<title>With Liberty and Justice For All - Heritage Lecture</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><b>Heritage Lecture No. 560 </b><p><h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and Educational Programs</a></h2><hr> <h3>With Liberty and Justice <I>For All</I></h3>

By Ward Connerly<br>
April 30, 1996
<p><blockquote>
<I>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</I>
</blockquote>
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thirty-one words tightly compressed into one sentence, a sentence that is more universally known and more often repeated in America than any other.
<p>
<img src="lect560.gif" align=left alt="Ward Connerly with Dr. Matthew Spalding, Director, Lectures and Educational Programs"><caption><b>Ward Connerly with Heritage's Dr. Matthew Spalding</b></caption><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is hardly a day that passes that I do not recite that pledge -- in public or in private -- at least half a dozen times. How many hundreds of times has each of us recited those words?  Do we reflect on the meaning of the words embodied in that sentence, or is it like so many other things we say during the course of our days, giving little thought or commitment to what is meant?  "Have a nice day."  "Good to see you again."  Perfunctory words of life.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But this pledge is no ordinary sentence. It is a definition of American democracy and a constant reaffirmation of our dedication to the fundamental principles of that democracy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You flatter and honor me today by this opportunity to share what I believe is the significance of that pledge, to visit with you and discuss the meaning of American citizenship, America's passion for fairness, matters relating to that delicate subject of race, and why I believe the time is at hand for us to pursue a new course with regard to what we call "affirmative action."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When we become citizens of this nation, at birth or otherwise, we get a warranty. That warranty is supposed to honored by every government franchise in every village and hamlet of this nation. It is not transferable, and it is good for the life of the vehicle.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We are guaranteed the right to vote; the right to due process; the right to be free, not to be enslaved, as long as we conduct ourselves in accordance with the laws of our nation; and the right to equal treatment under the law, regardless of our race, color, sex, religion, or national origin. These are rights which attach to us as individuals, not as members of a group.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This warranty has not always been honored for some of us. Because of the color of our skin or the place from whence we came, some of us were denied the right to vote; we were enslaved; we were denied due process; and the equal treatment granted to others was not ours to enjoy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In my lifetime, I can give testimony to America's meaner instincts and their consequences upon my life. To reflect upon this nation's past, with my racial background, it is tempting to mock that pledge, to devalue the warranty, and to be embittered by those who would urge me to forget the past. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One need only invoke a few memories to become enraged and to feel entitled to all of the preferences that can be presented:
<p><ul>
<li>Rosa Parks relegated to the back of the bus,
<p>
<li>Drinking fountains for "whites only,"
<p>
<li>Restrooms for "men," "women," and "colored,"
<p>
<li>George Wallace standing in the schoolhouse door saying "segregation now, segregation forever,"
<P>
<li>Images of black people being hosed in the streets simply because they demanded that the warranty be honored,
<p>
<li>And my thirty-year-old uncle being called "boy" by a ten-year-old white kid.
</ul> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because we were treated like animals, there are some who say "America owes us."  But the past is a ghost that can destroy our future. It is dangerous to dwell upon it. To focus on America's mistakes is to disregard its virtues. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This nation has a passion for fairness. That passion is evidenced in our Constitution, in the Bill of Rights, in executive orders, in court decisions. But most of all, it courses through the arteries of our culture. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" is the centerpiece of virtually all of our religious faiths.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
That great American pastime -- baseball -- is a reminder of the intensity of our passion for fairness as we exhort the crowd to "kill the umpire" if he makes what we consider an unfair call. As we drive home at the end of the day, our hands gripping the steering wheel, our bumper kissing the one ahead, when to our right a vehicle speeds along the curb and merges ahead of us at the moment when an opening appears, our passion for fairness surfaces. The protrusion of one of our fingers signals our belief that one of the rules of fairness has been violated. In every sport I can think of -- baseball, basketball, football, tennis -- one is expected to play between the white lines. To do otherwise is unfair and carries a penalty.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our passion for fairness seeps out of every pore of our existence. Great leaders understand that passion. In his early days, when members of his own church were urging him to "cool it," Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. appealed to America's sense of fairness and morality. It was Dr. King's appeal to fairness that resonated throughout the land and inspired Americans of all races and colors to travel to the deep South and to put their lives on the line in defense of what they considered the right thing, the fair thing to do.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Affirmative action has its roots in that passion for fairness. When President Lyndon Johnson explained affirmative action to the nation, it is significant that he said, "You can't bring a man to the starting line who has been hobbled by chains and expect him to run the race competitively."  Fairness dictated that the nation pursue affirmative action to compensate black Americans for the wrong that had been done. Affirmative action was a technique for jump-starting the process of integrating black Americans into the fabric of American society, for changing the culture of America from an exclusive society into an inclusive one. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe affirmative action was meant to be temporary. It was meant to be a stronger dose of equal opportunity for individuals, and the prescription was intended to expire when the body politic had developed sufficient immunity to the virus of prejudice and discrimination. It was not meant to be a system of preferences that would harm innocent people. The rationale for affirmative action thirty years ago was a moral one. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Three decades later, affirmative action is permanent and firmly entrenched as a matter of public policy. It has its own constituency that is prepared to defend its continuation at any cost, not because of any moral imperative, but because it has become the battleground for a political and economic war that has racial self-interest as its centerpiece.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Affirmative action, as most of us originally understood the term, enjoyed the support of a majority of Americans. Many Americans still support this concept as long as it does not involve preferences. Preferences, on the other hand, were wrong at the outset and are wrong today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Affirmative action has become a system of racial preferences in my state. Jobs are solicited with explicit acknowledgment that we want a woman or an African-American or a Hispanic for this position. Contracts are set aside for certain groups, with the taxpayers paying what amounts to an affirmative action tax. This is the result of contractors who set up shell minority and women-owned businesses to front for white-owned businesses in order to benefit from the minority set-asides.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Wealthy sons and daughters of underrepresented minorities receive extra points on their admissions applications to the university, based solely on their race, while higher-achieving Asians and whites from lower-income families are turned away from the university. Families are forced to mortgage their homes to send their children out of state to an institution comparable to Berkeley and UCLA. A racial matrix is used at most of our campuses which establishes a racial pecking order that distributes extra points on the basis of one's racial background.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When this nation began its use of affirmative action decades ago, America's racial landscape was rather clear. There was the dominant white majority and the oppressed black minority. Today, we have several dozen racial and ethnic categories in California. There is no dominant majority and there is no oppressed minority. Within a few years, the group which will numerically be the largest is Hispanic. Our racial tensions are no longer just black and white. They are black and Korean, black and Hispanic, white and Hispanic, Russian and Hispanic. Every conceivable racial conflict is present and lurking somewhere beneath the surface in California. How, then, do we decide who among us should receive a preference?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A direct product of our diversity is the emergence of a whole new set of racial configurations and problems which defy the old racial order. Yet affirmative action operates as if the old order was still in place, as if our racial dilemma was still black against white.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The end of affirmative action will be difficult for black Americans. It is our nature not to be trusting of the goodwill of whites. It is instinctive for us to harbor the belief that our rights will only be as secure as the amount of ammunition issued to the federal troops to protect us. Well, it is time to let the troops go home and to place our faith in the American system of democracy, in America's passion for fairness. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 It is time for black Americans to enter the arena of democracy instead of seeing ourselves as spectators. <I>This</I> is our land, not Africa. The blood and sweat of black Americans can be found in the pot of democracy in just as great a quantity as that of others. It is time for black Americans to accept America proudly as their land, the land of opportunity.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To black Americans, I say look through the windshield at America's opportunity, not through the rearview mirror at this nation's mistakes. Resist the temptation to believe that our nation owes us a debt. Let us take the initiative to say that the debt has been paid and the books are closed. And the Republican Party should say, "Come home to your party; you have been gone too long."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A significant phenomenon in my state is the growing political influence of Hispanics. As the emerging numerical majority, many Hispanics see affirmative action as their passport to college, jobs, and contracts. Many see affirmative action as a tool that has benefited black Americans, and they now believe it is their turn to be the preferred minority. They see it as the express lane to a better life. I urge them not to pursue this strategy. It is corrosive and dangerous. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am often asked why it is that California, one of the most multiracial states in the nation, is the first to begin the process of dismantling affirmative action. The answer is twofold: First, because California is a window of the future, we often experience events before other states. Second, it is precisely because of our diversity that we know how destructive affirmative action can be of fundamental democratic values of self-reliance, individualism, and equal opportunity for all.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
California is as close as any society on the face of the Earth to being that promised land where racism is considered repulsive and has no place. But this promised land can become a battle zone if we allow the continued tribalization of California.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We can point with pride to the fact that the mayor of one of America's favorite cities, San Francisco, is a black man: Willie Brown. The mayor of one of the largest cities in the nation, Los Angeles, for years was a black man: Tom Bradley. Our two United States Senators are women. The mayor of our state capital is Hispanic: Joe Serna. Although I as a Republican don't always agree with the political judgment of my fellow Californians, I believe no one can dispute their egalitarian impulses. As one looks at <a href="http://www.ca.gov">California state government</a>, for example, the conclusion is inescapable: Equal opportunity is now inbred. The cabinet of Governor Wilson is nearly equally divided among men and women, and it only takes a casual meeting with any of them to confirm that raw talent, and not affirmative action, is the basis of that fact.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am terrified at the prospect of what can become of us if we maintain our existing preference policies. In police departments, in fire departments, in middle-class homes throughout California, there is a growing perception that if I am white, I and my kids will not have an equal opportunity to succeed. No matter where it comes from, if anyone among us believes the warranty is not being honored, we have a duty to investigate the legitimacy of their complaint and to make it right if their complaint is proven to be valid.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout this debate, you will hear about blacks being stopped in white neighborhoods, about white women clutching their purses as black men approach, about the difficulty of black men getting a taxi in urban centers late at night, about the glass ceiling, about the lack of role models, about the percentage of black males in prison, and about the shortage of women in the Congress. All of these complaints warrant our attention, but none of them, no matter how true, justifies a suspension of that warranty that I talked about.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are those who say that racism and sexism are not dead in America, and they are correct. But racism and sexism in our society do not justify our government giving a preference to Jose over Chang because Susan's father discriminated against Willie's father fifty years ago. Not in America.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If you are a student of history, you know that every now and then, the opportunity to alter the course of human events presents itself. Such is now the occasion for the people of this nation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Every now and then, the challenge confronts us to step out from among the crowd to perform extraordinary acts. Such is the moment for the Republican Party.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The challenge is to end the corrosive system of racial preferences that has evolved in our nation, a system that has the potential to fatally damage the most fundamental values of our democracy, and to do so in a way that does not unleash the meaner instincts of some and the fears of others. The opportunity is to resume that noble journey of building an inclusive family of Americans in which men and women of all races and colors can work and play in harmony, with mutual respect and expecting nothing more than an equal opportunity to compete, and from that competition to build that more perfect union of which our forefathers dreamed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The vehicle for this journey is the California Civil Rights Initiative. This initiative is simple and direct: No government agency shall discriminate against anyone on the basis of race, sex, or national origin, and no government agency shall give anyone preferential treatment for any of those reasons.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two days ago, I appeared on a talk show with Congresswoman Maxine Waters. She argued that the California Civil Rights Initiative will create divisiveness. That may be true, but we are not the ones creating the divisiveness. Those who cling to the notion that preferences must continue are the ones responsible for dividing our society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the student who works hard for four years to earn a 4.0 grade point average only to be denied admission to Berkeley or UCLA in favor of someone with a 3.0, merely because UC wants racial diversity, whether she thinks we are being divisive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the poor Vietnamese student who is turned away from Berkeley or Irvine, despite his high grades, in favor of a wealthy underrepresented minority whether he thinks we are being divisive. Ask him whether he is satisfied with the explanation that we are getting too many Asians at those campuses.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the daughter of a third-generation Chinese-American family whether she thinks we are being divisive when we say that it is unfair for applicants who are in this country illegally to get a preference over her.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the parents of James Cook, one of only two California students admitted to Johns Hopkins University in 1994 only to be denied admission to UC San Diego medical school because he is white, whether they think we are being divisive. Ask them and thousands of other middle-class families, who are forced to take out $80,000 to $100,000 second mortgages on their homes to send their kids out of state to college because racial preferences prevent them from being able to attend UC, whether they think we are being divisive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the high-achieving black or Chicano student who works hard and gains entry to college solely on the basis of his merit, but who then must endure the nagging question of whether he was admitted because of affirmative action, whether he thinks we are being divisive. Ask him whether he thinks it's fair that his accomplishments are devalued.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Do we not believe it was divisive when those from an earlier period said that slavery is immoral and should be ended?  Was it not divisive when our nation's people fought among themselves over this very issue?  Was it not divisive when we sent troops into Montgomery and Selma, Alabama, to protect the rights of people like Rosa Parks and James Meredith to ensure their right to sit wherever they wanted on the bus and to attend a college that wasn't segregated?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yes, those were divisive times. But the seeds of division are planted not by those of us who seek to eliminate racial and ethnic preferences; they are planted by those who believe that our skin color and gender and how we spell our last name should entitle us to the harvest of diversity -- college admission, government employment, and contracts. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
My friend and ally throughout this experience has been <a href="http://www.ca.gov/gov/governor.html">Governor Pete Wilson</a>. When I first brought the fact to him that the University of California was engaged in an offensive system of racial preferences, the governor unhesitatingly said, "Let's fix it."  When our opponents accuse us of being divisive, the governor is correct when he says that sometimes the only way to resolve issues in a democracy is through the ballot box. That is why this initiative is so important.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I find it interesting that a nation which claims to have the heart to solve an ethnic war in Bosnia shouldn't have the stomach to prevent one here at home. If there is any lesson that we can learn from the rest of the world, it is that America's experiment with democracy will fail if we divide our people into racial enclaves and allocate jobs, contracts, and college educations on the basis of group identity.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We often hear about the "angry white male."  If anyone is discriminated against because of his or her color, they have a right to be angry. And we should all share that anger, not belittle or rationalize it by citing glass ceiling statistics. As individuals, none of our rights are secure when the fruits of our society are allocated on the basis of group allotments.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yogi Berra once said, "When you reach a fork in the road, take it."  Well, try as we might, we can't take his advice. We must make a conscious choice. We can continue down the path of numerical parity, racial preferences, and a continuing preoccupation with the concept of race. We can continue perpetuating the outdated premise on which racial preferences are based: that blacks, women, and other minorities are incapable of competing without a handicap. Or we can return to the fundamentals of our democracy: the supremacy of the individual, equal opportunity for the individual, and zero tolerance for discrimination.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As a Republican, I want my party to be known not just as the party that eliminated the deficit and concerned itself with the fiscal health of our nation. I want us to be remembered as the party that stood fast in support of the proposition that racial preferences are a social deficit that has to be eliminated, that true equality of opportunity cannot be compromised, that the next generation should not have to inherit the task of solving the horrible problems that affirmative action is creating. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am not worried about the skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Aryan Nation. In our time, we have discredited them and their brand of racism. Now we must fight those who, in their own way, peddle a form of racism and bigotry that is just as destructive of democratic principles as the bigots of yesteryear.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You know, it pains me to say that within the past year, I have experienced more hate from my fellow black Americans than I have seen in the previous 55 1/2 years of my life. For example, a black state senator, Diane Watson, recently said that I want to be white, that I consider myself colorless, that I have no racial pride -- all because my wife is white and because I oppose racial discrimination and racial preferences.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The one thing that I have learned from this experience is that bigots come in all shapes and colors. Despite their physical differences, they have one thing in common; they all reside in the same intellectual sewer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The senator is right about several things. First, I do want to be colorless in the eyes of my government. I thought that was a goal to which we all subscribed. Second, I am lacking in racial pride. I have self-pride. I am proud to be an American. I am proud to be a Rotarian. I am proud of my family. I am proud to own my own business. But I am racially indifferent, not racially proud.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Those who proclaim pride in their color or race trouble me, unless they have earned that color lying on the beach or in front of a sun lamp. To any of you who want to travel down that road of racial pride, leave me out of the vehicle. But I urge you to be attentive for those signs which read, "slippery road ahead."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And so, my friends, we find ourselves poised at this moment in the life of a great people, trying to define the character of our nation. Throughout America, we are restructuring our institutions. Our nation is desperately trying to embrace policies which place greater reliance on the rights and responsibilities of individuals. The debate about affirmative action must be seen in that context.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This issue will define the political parties in our nation for generations to come. The challenge for Republicans will be to convince all Americans that preferences are not in the national best interest, that a preference for some means a loss of liberty and the pursuit of happiness for others. We have to convince black Americans, a group which has become addicted to the drug of a powerful central government, that their rights can be no more secure than anyone else's when we empower government to make decisions about people's lives on the basis of a government melanometer which measures melanin levels. None of our rights are secure in a game of racial self-interest.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I will never abandon my faith that America can become Ronald Reagan's "shining city on the hill," a society in which a person's gender or race or ethnic background are irrelevant in the transactions of their government. Let us not mourn the death of affirmative action. Instead, let us proclaim our belief that the spirit of equal opportunity, which affirmative action engendered, has become a permanent feature of America's social, economic, and political landscape. Let us have faith in our own sense of fair play.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On February 27, 1860, in his Cooper Institute address, President Lincoln urged his party to hold fast to their beliefs: "neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government, nor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why do I take the position I have?  Because it is my duty as an American citizen.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am often asked if I would do it over again, knowing what I know now about the loss of privacy, the personal insults, and the occasional negative stories. My response is: "in a heartbeat."  This is the price of citizenship in a democracy. This is the fee which democracy exacts from each of us. If you don't have the courage of your convictions, then you forfeit the best that a democracy has to offer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Please indulge me in this moment of personal pride, as a citizen who has no political aspirations, who derives no economic benefit from this effort, in sharing with you the fact that I have taken the best blows that the opposition has been able to deliver, and I am still in the ring and on my feet.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is it too presumptuous of me to say that one person can indeed make a difference?  Is it too naive of me to consider my experience as a reassurance that democracy works, that the republic for which it stands is a value worthy of our aspirations and dedication?  Is it wrong for me to think that the Pledge of Allegiance obligates me to believe and act upon my belief that the pursuit of liberty and justice for all is a duty for all of us?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I hope you will agree with me that those propositions are not presumptuous and naive.

<h3>
HOW CONGRESS CAN PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF PARENTS TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN </h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States Supreme Court noted many years ago that "The primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."<sup>3</sup>  And President Bill Clinton, in his 1994 State of the Union speech, declared that "We cannot renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise children, parents do."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress is poised to give legislative form to these sentiments. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (S. 984 and H.R. 1946), introduced by Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and Representative Steve Largent (R-OK), would give parents the standing in law to protect their rights to direct the education and to protect and form the moral character of their children. In fact, it would give them superior standing over government and its agencies in these matters: The bill declares that parents' rights to direct the upbringing of their children are fundamental rights which government can curtail only under conditions of "compelling interest" and under "strict guidelines" of judicial procedure, legal terms which guide courts in their decisions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congressional proponents of the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act contend that parental rights over the rearing of children are so basic that the Founders never even conceived of their being usurped by government. These rights, precisely because they are basic to the concept of liberty, should not be abridged by government except in the most unusual circumstances. They are liberty rights, protected by the Fifth Amendment. The bill would make this clear.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Parental rights concern the relationship between government -- federal, state, and local -- and parents in the raising of children. This area of civil liberties is the domain of Congress and the Supreme Court, with the Fourteenth Amendment clearly giving Congress the power to pass legislation to enforce such constitutional rights and protecting citizens against the abridgment of their rights by government:<blockquote>
	All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States....<sup>5</sup>
<p>
	The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote><P>

<B>The Erosion of Parental Authority</B>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the years, widely scattered and repeated attacks on the fundamental rights of parents have come from state and local courts; from federal, state, and local government bureaucracies and officials; and from policy initiatives inspired by a number of the major professions dealing with children. Certain members of these professions seem more concerned with displacing parents than with aiding them. In fact, the bill is opposed by many liberal groups wishing to change the relationship between government and the family, including the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National Education Association.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While critics say the bill would cause confusion in child abuse and domestic relations law and procedure, congressional sponsors argue that child abuse is not a parental right and that they explicitly left all child abuse and domestic relations concerns outside the scope of the bill. These clearly are within the proper scope of state authority.
<P>

<B>WHAT THE BILL DOES</B>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 4 of the bill clarifies and codifies the rights of parents already affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court: "No Federal, State or local government, or any official of such a government acting under color of law, shall interfere with or usurp the right of a parent to direct the upbringing of the child of the parent."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to Section 3, the parent's right to direct the upbringing of a child includes the right to:
<UL>
<p><li><b>Direct or provide</b> for the education of the child;

<p><li><b>Make</b> a health or mental health decision for the child, with exceptions;<sup>7</sup>

<p><li><b>Discipline</b> the child, including reasonable corporal punishment as already defined by the Supreme Court; and

<p><li><b>Direct or provide</b> for the religious and moral formation of the child.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It also makes clear the procedure the courts must follow when these rights are to be denied by the state. The standard to which the courts must hold all levels of government in any move to deny parents their rights is laid out simply in Section 5:<blockquote>

	No exception to [the right] shall be permitted, unless the government is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence, that the interference or usurpation is essential to accomplish a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn or applied in a manner that is the least restrictive means of accomplishing the compelling interest.</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This would establish a clear standard of judicial review whenever a state challenges parents. The government or its agencies would have to demonstrate a compelling interest in the contravention of parental authority. "Compelling interest" is a standard that demands "strict scrutiny" or "clear and convincing evidence" of the government's compelling and narrowly drawn interest in removing parental authority in the case before the court. It is the highest standard that can be adopted in a civil issue and is the traditional standard used by all when reviewing all other fundamental rights issues. If parental rights are fundamental, therefore, the "strict scrutiny" and "compelling interest" tests ought always to follow.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 7 specifically puts certain areas outside the scope of the bill, either because they properly are subject to state law or because they are not parental rights. These areas include the abuse or neglect of a child; domestic relations conflicts between parents, such as divorce and child custody battles; and adoption proceedings.
<p>

<b>Deference to States' Rights</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the United States, family law is made at the state level. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act therefore would uphold the role of the states in their relationship to families and parents by depriving no state of any power it retains under the federal Constitution. By clarifying the rights of parents, it would be a defense against intrusion into parental authority either by government (including legislatures, courts, and agency bureaucracies) or by professions acting as agents of government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As noted, the bill delineates the areas of state law within which it does not apply. Because family law, as opposed to individual rights, is the domain of the states, the bill does not change definitions in state family law. "The term `child' has the meaning provided by state domestic relations statute," for instance. "The term `parent' has the meaning provided by state domestic relations statute....  The term `direct upbringing of a child' shall not include abandonment, abuse and neglect as the terms have been defined in state statute."<sup>8</sup>  Furthermore, "Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the ability of state or local governments from granting greater protection to parental rights."<sup>9</sup>
<p>

<b>THE NATURE OF PARENTAL RIGHTS</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under American constitutional law, "fundamental rights" are inherent in the person, and government at any level can abridge them only in cases of compelling state interest. The Constitution spells out or provides the basis for a number of such fundamental rights: free speech, freedom of religious practice, freedom from racial discrimination, freedom of the press. Many of these rights are spelled out in detail in statutes enacted by Congress pursuant to the Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Legal rights," by contrast, are not inherent in the person. They are granted by government and therefore can be altered or withdrawn by it. Social Security, Medicare, and welfare entitlements all are examples of legal rights.

<p>
<b>Parental Rights As Fundamental Rights</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is the settled view of the U.S. Supreme Court that parental rights are fundamental rights. In 1943, for example, the Court said:<blockquote>

	Constitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents' claim to authority in their own household to direct the upbringing of their children is basic in the structure of our society. It is cardinal with us that the custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary functions and freedom include preparations for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Supreme Court repeatedly has affirmed the fundamental nature of these rights, including the right to marry; to establish a home and bring up children;<sup>11</sup> to raise these children in their own fashion<sup>12</sup> (whether the children like the way they do it or not);<sup>13</sup> to direct the education of their children and to pass on to them their own principles, faith, and values;<sup>14</sup> to direct their children's religious and moral education;<sup>15</sup> to make medical decisions for their minor children;<sup>16</sup> and to inflict corporal punishment when it is deemed necessary.<sup>17</sup>  In cases as far apart in time as 1925 and 1979, the Court has declared that:<blockquote>

	Our jurisprudence historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children. Our cases have consistently followed that course; our constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is the "mere creature of the state" and, on the contrary, asserted that parents generally "have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare [their children] for additional obligations."

<p>
	The law's concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life's difficult decisions. More important, historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interest of their children.

	<p>
	That some parents "may at times be working against the interest of their child"... creates a bias for caution, but is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child's best interest. The statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition.<sup>18</sup>

	<p>
	[P]arents and guardians, as part of their liberty, might direct the education of children by selecting reputable teachers and places.
<p>
	The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not a mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
	Simply because the decision of the parent is not agreeable to the child or because it involves risks does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state.... Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment. Parents can and must make those judgments.<sup>20</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1972, the Supreme Court summed up its intent in these earlier rulings: "The primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."<sup>21</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While parental rights are fundamental, however, they are not absolute. The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that states have the right to regulate the activities of family life for reasons of compelling state interest. Nonetheless, this governmental right is not unlimited. As the Court found in 1972, for example, "The state's interest in universal education, however highly we rank it, is not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests."<sup>22</sup>
<p>

<b>Complementary Roles of Congress and the Supreme Court</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution are the domain of the federal government because they regulate the relationship between government -- all government -- and the citizen. Clarity on these rights results from their being spelled out in the Constitution, in Supreme Court rulings, in legislation passed by Congress, or in some combination of the work of these two branches of the federal government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Redundancy of affirmation of fundamental rights is frequent between Congress and the Supreme Court. This has been the case in the last few decades, for instance, with the right to freedom from racial discrimination. There is a rich history of such clarification underlying the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. At times, the Supreme Court will correct Congress, as it did in <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> in 1954, clarifying the right to segregation-free education.<sup>23</sup>  At other times, Congress will correct the Supreme Court, as it did with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, clarifying the right to freedom of religious practice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress's responsibility to enforce the protection of fundamental rights is described in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:<blockquote>

	No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.... <sup>24</sup>
<p>
	The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<sup>25</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the event of confusion over the nature of fundamental rights, it is the federal government's responsibility to clarify or protect them. Congress did this with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Supreme Court did so in <I>Brown v Board of Education</I> in 1954. Both Congress and the Court also may act if one state upholds fundamental rights and another denies them (as happened in certain states which persisted in countenancing racial discrimination). With the Parental Rights and Responsibility Act of 1995, Congress would assume this task with respect to parents' rights.
<p>

<b>THE NEED TO RESTORE THE PRIMACY OF THE FAMILY</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The family is the indispensable institution of civil society; for it is the family that is primarily competent and responsible for developing the good character of children. When families are strong and function well, their children grow into adults who are truthful and responsible, and who practice private virtue and public citizenship. When families falter, their children grow into adults who can be vicious and irresponsible. Thus, because a free and civil society depends so utterly on the work of families, individuals take on extraordinary responsibilities when they become parents. As the bipartisan National Commission on Children observed in its final report in 1991:
<blockquote>
	The family is and should remain society's primary institution for bringing children into the world and for supporting their growth and development throughout childhood.... Parents are the world's greatest experts on their own children. They are their children's first and most important caregivers, teachers, and providers. Parents are irreplaceable, and they should be respected and applauded by all parts of society for the work they do.<sup>26</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As Urie Bronfenbrenner, professor of child psychology at Cornell University, has explained:
<blockquote>
	In order to develop -- intellectually, emotionally, socially, and morally -- a child requires participation in progressively more complex reciprocal activity, on a regular basis over an extended period in the child's life, with one or more persons with whom the child develops a strong, mutual, irrational emotional attachment and who is committed to the child's well-being and development, preferably for life.<sup>27</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is parents -- not teachers, child care providers, social workers, or a "village" -- that are most likely to give this all-encompassing commitment to the welfare of the child. This is not to denigrate the important work done by teachers, child care providers, and social workers, but simply to acknowledge an important truth: Only parents can reasonably be expected to put the interests of their children above their own. Thus, government must assume that parents, not bureaucrats or politicians, are in the best position to make decisions about their children because only parents can be expected to have this overriding commitment to their children's welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This does not mean that all parents will put their children's interests above their own at all times. Indeed, some parents -- especially those who are under the influence of drugs like crack cocaine or alcohol -- even abuse their children physically or sexually. In such cases, the state can act to curtail the right of an individual parent or couple to care for a child. But the state can never lawfully curtail the fundamental rights of parents as a class; its duty is to uphold these rights. In all areas of public policy, government should assume that because parents are best able to make decisions about the welfare of their children, they must retain the maximum decision-making authority when it comes to raising those children. This is the underlying assumption of the Parents' Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995.

<p>
<b>WHY PARENTS' RIGHTS NEED TO BE CODIFIED</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are four reasons for codifying parental rights in law, even though the Supreme Court has ruled clearly on the issue in the past. First, certain legislatures have transgressed against parents. Second, there is evidence that these rights have been violated in the courts at lower federal and state levels. Third, state government agency actions sometimes violate these rights. Fourth, an increasing hostility to the fundamental rights of parents is evident in the activities of certain prominent members of the very "humane professions" (education, law, medicine, social work, and psychology) that are supposed to aid parents in the work of raising children.<ol>

<p><li><b>Legislative Threats.</b> State legislators have encroached on parents' rights. Though the courts or the people eventually have repelled these attacks, the very fact that such rights are subject to assault illustrates the danger. A few examples:<ul>

<p><li><b>Oregon.</b> In the 1920s, when the state of Oregon passed a law banning private schools, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the fundamental right of parents to choose the type of education they desire for their children:
<blockquote>
The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not a mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.<sup>28</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nevertheless, a whole state government, including both chambers of the legislature, the governor, and the state judiciary, had attempted to violate the fundamental rights of parents as a group.

<p><li><b>Utah.</b> In 1980, the Utah legislature, with the governor concurring, passed an Amendment to the Children's Rights Act which changed the test by which parents could be denied the right to custody of their child. The old criterion of "unfit or incompetent" was supplanted by a new one: "the best interest of the child."  In 1982, however, the Utah Supreme Court rejected the new criterion because it would have allowed the state rather than the parent to determine what constitutes a child's "best interest":
<blockquote>
	[T]he 1980 amendment did not merely <I>refine or elaborate</I> the requirement that the parent be found "unfit or incompetent" in order to terminate his or her parental rights. Instead it <I>replaced</I> that subsection, and in doing so deleted a statutory protection for the parental rights of fit parents.... 
<p>
	No court is warranted in applying the "polar star [guiding] principle" of the welfare of the infant until the natural parents' rights have been lawfully severed and terminated.... 
<p>
	We are not aware that this Court has ever espoused the view, and it is not our view, that the termination of parental rights can be decreed without giving serious consideration to the prior and fundamental right of a parent to rear his child; and concomitantly, of the right of the child to be reared by his natural parent.<sup>29</sup>
</blockquote><p>
<li><b>The U.S. Congress.</b> In February 1994, Representative George Miller (D-CA), long-standing chairman of the House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families, introduced an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (H.R. 6) that would have required a home schooling parent to be teacher-certified in any subject before being able to teach that subject to his or her child. This measure would have deprived parents of the hard-won recognition of their freedom to educate their children at home. Once the legislative threat became known, constituent phone calls to Congress reached historic levels,<sup>30</sup> illustrating the growing level of parental sensitivity to such encroachments. Thanks in large part to this public outrage, the Miller amendment failed by a vote of 382 to 53.
</ul><p>
<li><b>Judicial Threats.</b> Parental rights also have been threatened by the courts.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Massachusetts.</b> In 1995, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts affirmed the decision of the School Board of Falmouth to deny parents the ability to "opt out" of sex education classes and condom distribution for their children. The court further claimed that the freedom of parents was not violated because the children were not forced to take the condoms, the parents were free to tell their children to avoid the classes in question, and the children were free to avoid the classes if they chose.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The parents contended that the most critical and powerful element was missing from this formulation: the requirement that schools honor the parents' right to "opt out" even when their children did not want to do so. Thus, the ruling struck directly at parental authority. The court contended that the parents failed to demonstrate how their interests as parents were burdened by the school's condom or sex education programs. In other words, the state does not have to demonstrate "compelling state interest" when it decides to override the fundamental rights of parents; parents have to demonstrate unconstitutional interference by the state. The state is assumed to possess superior authority to direct the education and health of the child unless the parents can demonstrate otherwise.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This ruling directly contradicts many other state court rulings on the same issue.<sup>32</sup>  Massachusetts parents thus do not have parental rights that are recognized in other states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In another notable case, the Massachusetts Supreme Court moved against parents who sought advance notification from the school so that they could exercise the "opt-out" provision.<sup>33</sup>  They contended that there was not much point in being able to "opt out" if they learned of the need only after the damage had taken place -- in this case, an AIDS awareness program conducted for the children by an outside consulting firm, "Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions Inc.," which included demonstrating the use of condoms and discussing many sexual acts traditionally regarded by parents as perverse and immoral.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both the federal district court and the federal circuit court found the Massachusetts parents' case to be without standing, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. As a result, Massachusetts parents have no recourse from rulings of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Both state and federal courts, in effect, have denied the existence of the parents' fundamental rights, and there is no legal procedure by which these parents can protect themselves from this violation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both of these rulings illustrate the need for Congress to clarify a right deemed fundamental in many states but not in all.


<p><li><b>Michigan.</b> In 1993, the Michigan Supreme Court issued two rulings on home schooling which illustrate that court's confusion with regard to parents' rights in education. According to the first, a set of parents has the right to home school their children because of their religious beliefs.<sup>34</sup>  But according to the second, another set of parents does not have the same freedom because, not claiming religious liberty principles, their rights to educate their children are controlled by the state of Michigan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In denying the "secular parents" their right to direct their children's education, the Michigan Supreme Court held "that a parent's Fourteenth Amendment right to direct a child's education is not one of those rights described by the United States Supreme Court as fundamental, and, thus, the strict scrutiny test is unwarranted."<sup>35</sup>  Thus, "religious" Michigan parents have a freedom to direct the education of their children that "secular" Michigan parents do not have. Michigan appears to have established a religious test for home schooling.

<p><li><b>Washington.<sup>36</sup></b> In 1980, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington ruled that it was not a violation of parents' rights to remove an eighth grade girl from her family. The parents had grounded her because she wanted to smoke marijuana and sleep with her boyfriend. She did not like her parents' rules, even though they were reasonably enforced, and asked the local child welfare agency to place her elsewhere.<sup>37</sup>  Rather than back the parents as the best way to correct the child's behavior, this agency honored the child's request that she be placed in someone else's home. One of the dissenting judges in the case described the situation:
<blockquote>
	They [the parents] asked their 15-year-old daughter not to use drugs, or associate with those who had furnished drugs, that she not use alcohol, that she not be sexually active, and that she be in at a reasonable hour. Because of the daughter's unwillingness to follow these obviously reasonable standards, these parents are summarily deprived of custody and the best opportunity to resolve these problems within the family.<sup>38</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

At no time did the state's lawyers contend that the parents' rules and their enforcement of them were unreasonable. Nor did they argue that the parents abused or neglected the child. The child simply wanted to avoid these restrictions, and the local child welfare agency and the courts backed her rather than her parents. Subsequently, the child's teenage and early adult years were extraordinarily troubled. Now an adult and mother herself, she sees the wisdom of her parents' approach and says that she wishes the local and state authorities had backed them instead of her.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Though the majority of the Washington Supreme Court denied the parents' rights (and in doing so differed clearly from both the Utah Supreme Court and the West Virginia Supreme Court), the three dissenting judges wrote:
<blockquote>
	There is no claim or proof [by the state] of unfitness or neglect by the parents. There was no claim of proof of any imminent threat of harm or danger to this 15-year-old.... Petitioning juvenile was asked at the court hearing the following: Q. "Could you please tell us why you believe there is a conflict in that home?"  A. "I just feel that there's a communication gap there."...  That is the sum and substance of the petitioner's testimony upon which she was taken from her parents' custody over their objections....  The court's justification for this extensive deprivation of fundamental parental rights consisted merely of conclusory findings of fact which met the unconstitutionally vague and inadequate standards of the statute.<sup>40</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Washington court's ruling was possible because of the lack of clear procedural legal guidelines for the denial of parental rights. This would not have happened if the court had been required to use the "compelling interest of the state" standard of review required by the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act now before Congress.
</ul>
<p><li><b>Threats from Boards and Bureaucrats.</b> Perhaps more than anything else, what has made parents increasingly aware of their fundamental rights is the frequent violation of these rights by state and local government officials.<ul>

<p><li><b>New York City.</b> The violation of parental rights can lead to confrontation. In 1992, one such dramatic and widely reported confrontation between parents and education authorities occurred over the teaching of "gay sex" in New York City's proposed "Rainbow Curriculum."  Despite hearings attended by hundreds of parents (and the declared opposition of tens of thousands more), the Board of Education pressed forward with its plans. While the voters ousted the offending board members shortly thereafter, the incident highlighted the depth of opposition to the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children, even in the area of intimate family-generating behavior.

<p><li><b>Virginia.</b> Sometimes the irony of this opposition escapes bureaucrats. In 1995, during a debate in Fairfax, Virginia, at a local school board meeting convened to vote on sex education, there was standing room only for parents, most of whom wanted something different from what the board intended to give them. School Superintendent Robert Spillane, annoyed with this supposed parental interference, complained: "You can see why parents should not be involved in family life education."<sup>41</sup>

<p><li><b>Maryland.</b> In 1996, a similar hearing in Montgomery County, Maryland, on the issue of "gay sex" in the public school curriculum evoked similar outrage from parents at open school board meetings. Again, the school board decided to disregard the parents' concern and go forward with the curriculum change. Maryland parents and students are not permitted to "opt out" of sexual education courses.

<p><li><b>Texas.</b> Many officials simply discount parental rights. One recent case involved a disagreement between parents and the Texas Board of Education on parents' access to standardized state test materials. When the lower court ruled in favor of the parents, the Texas Attorney General appealed the ruling. Though many might side with the school board on the particulars of the case, it is disturbing that the State Attorney General based his appeal on a rejection of the fundamental right of parents to direct the education and upbringing of their children.<sup>42</sup>

<P><LI><B>North Carolina.</b> In 1995, the county of Durham, North Carolina, drew up its own guidelines for judging the presence of child abuse. Though most of these "Minimum Standards of Care" make sense as indicators of potential child abuse, a number of them indicate a dangerous overreach by bureaucrats, who can claim authority to come into any home to check the suitability of parents. For instance, a parent may be investigated for "child abuse" if he confines a child to his room or violates any of a number of detailed government standards governing the supervision, nutrition, clothing, cleanliness, and even the bedtime of children. According to the Durham County Department of Social Services:
<blockquote>
 	The document reflects, to the extent possible under state law, the standards of care which the Durham community deems to be minimally acceptable for its children....  The period of supervision (baby-sitting by minors) must not extend beyond a reasonable bedtime: 9:00 p.m. for 12-14 year olds and midnight for 15-17 year olds.... Parent or caretaker insures proper hygiene by providing care, instruction, or necessary items for cleanliness (water, soap, toothbrush etc.).<sup>43</sup>
</blockquote>
These guidelines, undoubtedly drafted with the best of liberal intentions by the Department of Social Services, nonetheless reflect a desire to police parents. They are an excellent illustration of a trend described by Dr. Ed Zigler, Professor of Developmental Psychology at Yale University: the growing tendency to classify parental behaviors as abusive. "It's a terrible problem," says Professor Zigler. "I see an expansion of parental behaviors that are classified as abuse....  The whole area has become too subjective."<sup>44</sup>
</ul>
<p><li><b>Threats from Professionals.</b> Within the major professions of education, medicine, psychology, social work, and school counseling, there is increasing evidence that too many people and associations think they are more qualified than parents to judge what is good for particular children. There also is increasing evidence that they assume their professional judgment is superior and therefore can be exercised independently of parental judgment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The conception of the relationship between state and family held by many professionals is wholly unlike that held by most parents. The big contest is over the sexual morality of children. The work of Stanley Rothman and Richard Lerner, professors of sociology at Smith College and experts on the sociology of America's elites, points to a vast difference on matters related to sexual morality. Aside from wide discrepancies over the morality of abortion, Rothman and Lerner find "very large differences in the two groups' views regarding homosexuality, extra-marital and premarital sex, divorce, the ideal number of children in a family, voluntary suicide, and euthanasia."<sup>45</sup>  Differences between the therapeutic professions and the general population likewise are often stark. For instance, 72 percent of people generally describe religion as the most important influence in their lives,<sup>46</sup> while religion is much less important in the lives of the "mental health" elites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In effect, the divisive politics of "family values" is basically a contest between most Americans and a relatively small elite whose members, because their ideology is estranged from the views of Americans generally, do not want parents to have the legal power to resist their attempts to impose on America's children a set of beliefs sharply different from those of their parents.

<p><li><b>Medicine.</b> In East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, about 60 girls recently underwent a physical examination, including examination of the genitalia by a school nurse and doctor, without the permission of many of their parents. All the girls were 11 and 12 years old. Several objected, some started crying, and others asked to inform their parents. One of the girls said, "We tried to get out the windows but they pulled us back."<sup>47</sup>  Parents, understandably, were outraged.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Instead of operating according to a straightforward policy of obtaining written parental consent, the school simply assumed the right to conduct invasive medical examinations as long as there was nothing in writing to the contrary. And instead of seeing themselves as assisting parents in the work of raising children, school officials saw themselves as the locus of primary responsibility for the medical examination of other people's children. Rather than live by the Supreme Court's ruling that parents have the fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, these officials apparently assumed the right was theirs. Pennsylvania law protects the school in its conduct of these examinations. In New York, however, a state health education teacher, contrasting the East Stroudsburg incident with practices in her school, said, "No child is ever touched without a permission slip. How dare they do this."<sup>48</sup>

<p><li><b>School Counseling.</b> Under the code of conduct for professional psychologists, those in private practice may not offer mental health services without the prior, informed consent of the child's parents.<sup>49</sup>  The law in this instance recognizes that no matter how much training a psychologist may have, he cannot substitute his judgment, arbitrarily and presumptively, for that of the child's parents. But school counselors have a very different situation: "The authors are not aware of any state or federal statutes requiring school counselors to obtain parent permission to counsel minors of any age.... "<sup>50</sup>

<p><li><b>Librarians.</b> By the nature of its work, the American Library Association is in the forefront in educating children. But the Association apparently sees the need to protect children from parents as a group, and stands firmly against parents' rights to direct the education of their children. Consider the following extract from the "ALA's Library Bill of Rights" discussing R-rated and X-rated videos:<blockquote>

Policies which set minimum age limits for access to videotapes... with or without parental permission, abridge library use for minors. MPAA [Motion Picture Association of America] and other rating services are private advisory codes and have no legal standings.... [T]o attempt to enforce such ratings through circulation policies or other procedures constitutes labeling, "an attempt to prejudice attitudes" about the material, and is unacceptable.<sup>51</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In some states, officials also have moved to undermine the right of parents to monitor and control their children's reading material. If a child has a library card, the state forbids library staff to answer parents' questions on what books their children have taken out of the library, no matter what the child's age. For example, Maryland state law declares that "a custodian shall prohibit inspection, use, or disclosure of a circulation record of a public library or other item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual...."<sup>52</sup>  This is reinforced elsewhere in the Maryland code: "a free association, school, college or university library in this State shall prohibit inspection, use or disclosure of any circulation record or other item, collection or grouping of information about an individual...."<sup>53</sup>  The code then lists the exceptions, none of which involves any recognition of the parents' right to direct the education of their minor children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Safeguarding the confidentiality of library patrons is important to anyone concerned with the rights of individuals. But it is significant that in the development of reading by minors -- an area in which parents are the key players, recognized by the Supreme Court as the agents with the fundamental right to direct the education of their children -- libraries make no accommodation for parents and jealously guard against any parental intrusion. This has led to a bizarre situation in which parents, still financially responsible for books their children lose, are frustrated when they try to learn the names of these books so that they can search for them at home. Maryland public librarians may not tell them. But much more is at stake than this ludicrous inconvenience.

<p><li><b>The Education Establishment.</b> The gradual erosion of parents' standing in the eyes of the nation's powerful educational establishment is already far advanced, notwithstanding Supreme Court rulings to the contrary. Sammy Quintana, President of the National School Boards Association (NSBA), for example, denies the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children:
<blockquote>
	None would argue that active parental involvement in the care, upbringing, and education of our children is the cornerstone of a strong, healthy society....  This legislation could place federal judges in the position of requiring the school district to implement policy in conflict with the state's requirements. This is in direct disregard of the constitutionally recognized education function of the state.<sup>54</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In testimony on the bill before the House Committee on the Judiciary, Vicki Rafel, representing the National Parent Teacher Association, stated the NPTA's views on the relationship between parents, teachers, and other professions with similar bluntness:
<blockquote>
 	These institutions are not just part of a local community. They are also part of a total system of services and accountability that must be intertwined to provide an optimum environment for all children. Decisions affecting children should be made in a collaborative effort involving all the stakeholders including parents, educators, health care givers, and government bodies.<sup>55</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rafel's testimony is striking because of what it does not affirm:
<blockquote>
	Since parents are their children's first teacher, we believe firmly that parents must be involved in every facet of their children's education. However, both the state and federal governments have responsibilities for the education of children. Parents and schools, working together as partners, make the best decision for children in the field of education.... From constitutional and historical perspectives, the states are primarily responsible for education. Under state laws, local school boards have a central role in providing education services with support from other governments.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
	We do not believe that any one single entity, operating outside of the collaborative framework [federal government, states, local school boards, and parents] can adequately address the educational needs of children.... <sup>57</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the National School Boards Association believes parents may be "involved" but that government officials enjoy the fundamental rights in education, and the National Parent Teacher Association denies the primary and fundamental right of parents in directing the education of their own children -- part of the same right the Supreme Court has described as "beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."
</ul></ol>
<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL BUREAUCRATIC INTRUSIVENESS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On February 23, 1995, President Clinton signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which now awaits the advice and consent of the United States Senate. This Convention states that providing for the well-being of children is primarily the right of government. Article 3 establishes legal opposition between parent and child: "State Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With respect to the rights and duties of parents, Article 5 declares that "State Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents... to provide... appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention."  In other words, parents have the right to guide their children's exercise of rights enumerated by the Convention. According to Article 3, for example, "The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice."  In addition, "States recognize the rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom of peaceful assembly."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The right of a minor to free association makes sense when it has parental sanction. But the universal right to free association outside of parental sanction leaves minor children open to exploitation by others, including those who challenge the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. Nowhere in the Convention is the right of the parent to direct such activity acknowledged. To the contrary, Article 15 states: "No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of these rights other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."  Thus, under the U.N. Convention, only the state may restrict the right of assembly of minors, as a group or as individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The idea of a child's right to privacy also has merit, especially when threats to this privacy come from outside the home. But given the clear responsibility of parents to direct their children's upbringing, the right to privacy articulated in the Convention is a threat to parental authority. While the overall themes of the Convention and many of its specific articles may be laudable, they are vitiated by the absence of any clear articulation of the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. Worse, the Convention's language gives children a right superior to the rights of their parents: "States Parties [governments and government agencies] shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents... to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With its detailed elaboration of the rights of the child, coupled with the absence of any legal protection for the rights of parents against intrusive action by the state in the upbringing of children, the U.N. Convention is incompatible with traditional Western conceptions of the liberty of parents and with the U.S. Supreme Court's settled view of parental rights as "beyond debate."  Worse, the state is the only other entity whose rights are made clearly superior to the domestic life of the family as an institution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Parents should be very concerned over the dangerously intrusive impact of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The reasons for this concern are indicated by a 1995 evaluation report from the United Nations to the government of Great Britain, a signatory to the Convention:
<blockquote>
	In relation to the implementation of article 12, the Committee is concerned that insufficient attention has been given to the right to the child to express his/her opinion, including in cases where parents in England and Wales have the possibility of withdrawing their children from parts of the sex education programmes in schools. In this as in other decisions, including exclusion from school, the child is not systematically invited to express his/her opinion and those opinions may not be given due weight, as required under article 12 of the Convention.<sup>58</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act does not specifically address the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, and Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so far has blocked consideration by the Senate, this treaty is nonetheless a significant illustration of the thinking on the family among elites in government and the humane professions.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE BILL
<p>

Q: Would the bill establish a new right?
<p>
A:</b> No. The right of parents to raise their children is not new. It is a basic liberty issue for all parents everywhere, in all times, and under all political conditions and regimes. The Supreme Court affirmed this ancient tradition in the jurisprudence of Western civilization over 70 years ago.
<p>
<b>Q: Would the bill grant ambiguous rights to parents?
<p>
A:</b> No. It denies ambiguous rights to government and to others acting on behalf of government. By applying the "compelling interest" clause to parents' rights, as is done with all other fundamental rights recognized under the Constitution, the bill curtails the ability of government officials to be ambiguous or arbitrary in their dealings with parents. When "overriding" the fundamental rights of parents (as it can, for parents' rights are not absolute), the state must do so in a very narrowly defined and defensible fashion. The same principle holds for all other groups and professions in their relations with parents and children.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill violate the "rights of the child?"
<p>
A:</b> No. The rights of children and parents are complementary. Children have the right to be formed as competent human beings by those who brought them into the world, and parents have the right to develop these capacities in their children. Parents give their children life and continue to influence the development of their children's individuality through their actions as parents. In developing this individuality, which includes intellectual and moral capacities, parents are fulfilling natural rights and responsibilities that not only are an essential component of the Western concept of the individual liberty of the parent, but also are recognized as fundamental under the federal Constitution. Parental exercise of these rights does not violate the child's rights; it fulfills them.
<p><B>
Q: Would the bill eliminate the "best interest of the child" criterion in public policy?
<p>
A:</b> No. It would make the parent the arbiter of the child's best interest. This also is the position of the United States Supreme Court. The community can affect parents' conception of what is in their children's best interest, but children are the progeny of their parents, brought into existence by them, and naturally subject to the parent's conception of what is in their best interest.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill breach the confidentiality of professional counseling relationship in school settings?

A:</b> No. There is a difference between establishing a professional-minor relationship and preserving the confidentiality of that relationship once established. The bill would do nothing to alter the confidentiality of professional relationships. Confidentiality is a sine qua non of a therapeutic relationship and is widely understood as such. The bill would clarify the process through which such a confidential relationship is established: No professional could enter into such a relationship with a minor without the express permission of the parent, for it is the parent's right, not the professional's, to decide what is in the best interest of the child. The bill would make no difference to many of the therapeutic professions, including psychology and psychiatry, for this already is their established ethic.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Other professions, however, are less explicit in their ethics or professional guidelines. According to the American Counseling Association's professional code of ethics, "When counseling minors or persons unable to give voluntary informed consent, counselors act in the client's best interest."<sup>59</sup>  By contrast, consider the guideline of the American Psychological Association: "When persons are legally incapable of giving informed consent, psychologists obtain informed permission from a legally authorized person, if such a substitute consent is permitted by law."<sup>60</sup>  There is a very big difference between the two: Psychologists defer to parents as the arbiters of their children's best interests in establishing the relationship; school counselors try to claim that right for themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Parents send their children to school to be taught, not to be counseled one-on-one in private professional settings guarded by the rules of confidentiality, unless these relationships are expressly established in cooperation with the parent. Any relationship with a minor that is guarded by confidentiality should be contingent upon the prior written permission of the parent. The very presence of a confidentiality requirement is a signal that there is a need for the express permission of the parent. Under the laws of certain states, older children who also are unemancipated minors may enter into such confidential relationships without their parents' permission. But state laws often prescribe the ages and describe the situations in which these minors may do so.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill violate the principle of federalism?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress explicit authority to legislate to protect the fundamental rights of citizens. Congress and the Supreme Court are the two venues in which this legal clarification takes place. It cannot be done at the state or local level.
<p><b>
Q: Does the bill not threaten and weaken parental rights by involving Congress and the federal courts in family issues?
<p>
A:</b> No. The liberty of parents increasingly is being violated by government agencies and professions acting under government agency authority and protection. Congress and the Supreme Court are the only two institutions which can articulate parental rights in ways that bind all levels of government. Moreover, Congress has the constitutional ability to correct the Supreme Court. Though the Court has articulated parents' fundamental rights, these rights still need to be operationalized by the clear articulation of "compelling interests, narrowly drawn" when the rights of parents are to be set aside. This is not currently the criterion, and its absence is the main reason for the erosion of parents' liberty in the moral formation of their children.
<p><b>
Q: Would this legislation impose an unfunded mandate on the states?
<p>
A:</b> No. Guaranteeing the fundamental rights of citizens is not an unfunded mandate. It is a fundamental duty of each state's judicial system. Section 422 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 states clearly that "this part shall not apply to any provision in a bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report before Congress that (1) enforces constitutional rights of individuals...."  Furthermore, the state and its bureaucracies, as the main violators of these rights, can avoid such costs simply by not infringing on the fundamental rights of parents.
<p>
<b>Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents allow parents to sue in both federal and state court systems?
<p>
A:</b> Yes. As a fundamental right, it can be violated at any level, including the federal. Also, violations at the state court level (and there are many instances of these) are properly appealable at the federal court level, as are violations of all other fundamental rights under the federal Constitution.
<p><b>
Q: Would the codification of parents' fundamental rights be a bonanza for trial lawyers?
<p>
A:</b> No. By clearly defining these fundamental rights and establishing a compelling interest test, the bill would reduce the number of cases moving to litigation. It is the absence of this clarity that contributes to the current flood of litigation in local, state, and federal courts.
<p><b>
Q: Would the cost of enforcement be prohibitive?
<p>
A:</b> No. The National Education Association, which openly defends violations of the fundamental rights of parents, says the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would cost $3.3 billion per year. Even if the NEA's exaggerated estimates were correct, however, such a demand for fiscal conservatism is odd coming from the NEA. According to one recent estimate, the NEA's own legislative agenda would cost the American taxpayer $700 billion.<sup>61</sup>
<p><b>
Q: Could parents use codification to challenge welfare reform?
<p>
A:</b> No. Welfare entitlements are legislative grants, not fundamental individual rights. The state may attach requirements to such grants, but only insofar as they do not violate fundamental rights.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill permit parents to use child labor to supplement family income?
<p>
A:</b> No. The U.S. Supreme Court has established the right of the state to regulate parents in the matter of child labor, an evil against the child. This bill would do nothing to contravene this state right; nor would it allow parents to deprive their children of the minimum of education required by the state. According to the Supreme Court, "It is cardinal... that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first with the parents.... [T]he family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest.... [L]egislation appropriately designed to reach such evils [as child labor] is within the state's police power."<sup>62</sup>
<p>
<b>Q: Would defining parents' fundamental rights hinder states in their task of protecting children from child abuse?
<p>
A:</b> No. No parent has a right to abuse a child. When such abuse happens, the state, acting on the child's behalf, has a duty to protect the child. The truth is that this bill would reinforce the right of states to protect children from abuse. A much greater threat to the state's ability to protect abused children is the "family preservation philosophy" in child care social work, which leads to repeated efforts to reunite the child with an abusive family in the hopes that eventually the parents will improve. By failing to heed the evidence of abuse, this approach frequently places the child in grave danger. In 1992, in New York City, 21 children were killed by a parent or a mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened. Both Arizona and Oregon have instituted special units to investigate severe child abuse situations to help the courts move quickly to terminate the parental rights of such abusing parents, and to rescue the children.<sup>63</sup>  This bill would pose no threat to such action by states or local governments, but by the clarity of its statements on child abuse could be cited in support of such actions.
<p><b>
Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents endanger the right of states to guarantee public health by such means as school vaccinations and other public health interventions?
<p>
A:</b> Not at all. The Supreme Court has established the role of the states in safeguarding public health.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't people who suspect child abuse be disinclined to report their suspicions?
<p>
A:</b> Far from it. The bill makes clear that no one acting to protect a child from abuse can be subjected to a lawsuit based on such action.
<p><b>
Q: Would parents be able to impede investigations of child abuse by the state?
<p>
A:</b> No. The bill specifically leaves all state child abuse state laws unaffected. The states would retain the duty to protect children who are being abused.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the corporal punishment clause give parents a license to abuse their children or encourage them in the use of abusive punishment?
<p>
A:</b> No. All states currently allow "reasonable corporal discipline," and the Supreme Court has ruled that even school authorities may use "such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary for the proper education and discipline of the child."<sup>64</sup>  Thus, both state law and the Supreme Court have affirmed that parents and schools may use reasonable corporal punishment.
<p><b>
Q: Would defining fundamental parents' rights overturn state compulsory education laws and prohibit state regulation of home schooling?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Supreme Court has ruled that the state has an interest in establishing compulsory attendance laws and regulating education.<sup>65</sup>  The Court also has stated that parents must demonstrate to the state that their alternative education is appropriate, both in standards of literacy and in terms of the child's eventual self-sufficiency, and has reaffirmed that states may set educational standards for children within their borders.
<p><b>
Q: Would this bill pit school boards and parents against each other?
<p>
A:</b> No. The essence of the American tradition of control by local school boards is to encourage parents to play a full role in the direction of their schools. All this bill would do is create an official atmosphere more sensitive to parents' views. Where these views cannot be accommodated, especially in cases involving sensitive moral issues, parents would have the freedom to withdraw their children from controversial classes.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill require schools to provide individual tuition or curricula whenever a student's parents disagree with curriculum content?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Supreme Court has ruled that local school boards have the right to set curricula, and the federal courts have held that for the federal judiciary to intervene on behalf of parents, those parents must establish that their constitutional rights have been violated.<sup>66</sup>
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the bill require alternative curricula for each race or religion, overturn curriculum decisions, overturn decisions on textbooks, remove free inquiry from the classroom, and forbid mandatory graduation requirements?
<p>
A:</b> No. Establishing the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children, as well as their religious and moral formation, does not diminish the right of the community, as represented in its local school board, to act on all these issues. The Supreme Court recognized these local community rights in 1988,<sup>67</sup> affirming the school's right to teach even curricula opposed to the beliefs or values of parents. According to the Court, this does not violate the parents' rights; at the same time, however, for the school board to require the student to act on these values would violate the student's rights.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't codifying these fundamental parental rights lead people to use the courts as a solution of first rather than last resort, and cause money to be diverted from the classroom to the courtroom?
<p>
A:</b> No. With the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, religious parents gained the heightened scrutiny standard of "compelling state interest."  Under the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, all parents would benefit from this standard. There has been no diversion of discussion and energy from classroom to courtroom under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; rather, official sensitivity and discussion increase when these issues arise. If parents raised ridiculous claims under the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, their cases would be thrown out of court. The Supreme Court has established school board rights as well. Frivolous litigation would be costly for parents and of no benefit to them.
<p><b>
Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents force local bodies to pay for private or sectarian tuition?
<p>
A:</b> No. Repeated Supreme Court decisions show that the state does not have to pay either for services a person may freely choose in law or for services (such as private education and health care) to which the law may not deny access.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the bill move authority over education to the federal government?
<p>
A:</b> No; quite the opposite. By codifying the fundamental nature of parental rights, it would strengthen the hand of parents in dealing with government, whether federal, state, or local. It also would increase dialogue at the local level and ensure greater sensitivity to parents' rights on the part of government officials.
<p><b>
Q: Does the bill threaten the rights of girls to receive education on contraception and abortion?
<p>
A:</b> Parents have the fundamental right to direct the moral formation of their children. They also have the right to protect their children from behavior that is immoral in their eyes. In a society deeply divided on what is moral and what is immoral, mainly in the area of sexual morality, either school officials would refrain from entering this area of moral teaching (as they do already with respect to religious teaching), or parents would have the clear right to opt out from the official imposition of "values" hostile to their beliefs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The bill would give parents on both sides of these and other sensitive issues the ability to exercise their right and duty to direct the moral formation of their children as they see fit. Government officials have no right to form moral beliefs in children that contradict the beliefs of parents. According to the Supreme Court government officials are not obliged to teach the sexual morality that parents want taught, but neither do they have any right to teach children a sexual morality opposed to that of their parents.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rights of parents as a group are disregarded or endangered all too frequently by government officials. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would codify a fundamental right already articulated by the Supreme Court. It is needed because of repeated threats to parents' rights from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government at all levels -- federal, state, and local -- and from the humane professions. The bill is consistent with a tradition of freedom long recognized by the Supreme Court. It also is appropriate to the federal legislative process, because it articulates a fundamental right that applies to all American citizens in relation to all levels of government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There has been a disturbing pattern over the past century. Child rearing in America increasingly has come to be viewed as a public matter, a matter for the national "village."  As early as 1901, the Indiana State Supreme Court, in a ruling upholding the state's compulsory education law, stated that "The natural rights of a parent to the custody and control of his children are subordinate to the power of the state."<sup>68</sup>  In 1960, writing in the professional journal <I>Child Welfare</I>, one social worker noted that "daycare can offer something valuable to children because they are separated from their parents."<sup>69</sup>  Today, believing that government is in the best position to ensure the well-being of children, many take it for granted that government should have great authority over their upbringing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the persistent danger to the fundamental rights of parents from state court rulings, professional associations, government bureaucracies, the educational establishment, and international agencies and bodies, it is clear that these rights need codification in law. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, sponsored by Senator Grassley and Representative Largent, would do just that, erecting a barrier against the mounting erosion of these rights. In an increasingly fragmented and hostile culture, American parents deserve to have their liberty and legitimate rights established as clearly in law as they were in the assumptions of those who founded the American Republic.

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, supporters and employees of Legal Services Corporation (LSC) grantees fought efforts to reform federal subsidies to the Corporation, both by mounting a massive lobbying campaign -- paid for in part by federal funds -- and by devising loopholes to avoid the few restrictions that eventually were imposed. Faced with renewed pressure to reform and cut spending in 1995, the LSC responded with a new set of subterfuges and strategies designed to assure business as usual.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The LSC's actions during the past year prove that the legal services network is fundamentally unreformable. In addition, the efforts of LSC grantees to secure new funding sources indicate that subsidized legal services for the poor would continue to be available even without federal aid. It is therefore time to abolish all federal funding for legal services.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the FY 1996 appropriations process, congressional leaders struck a compromise which included reduced, though still significant, funding for the LSC coupled with a promise to end the federal subsidy by 1998. In light of the past year's events, Congress should reaffirm its decision to phase out federal subsidies by 1998 in the FY 1997 Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.
<P>
<b>Background</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federally funded civil legal assistance to the poor, first offered under Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, was institutionalized in the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974. From its inception, the Legal Services Corporation, with its 323 local affiliates and 17 support centers, has been viewed as one of the most politicized of federal programs. Liberals have cheered LSC as a force for "social justice," but conservatives have criticized it as offering taxpayer funding for radical activism and expansion of the welfare state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Though President Ronald Reagan's attempts to abolish the LSC -- the first full-scale effort by conservatives to end the program -- failed in the face of congressional opposition, in the 1980s abuses uncovered by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) and a Senate committee led to some restriction of political activity by grantees. Predictably, legal services programs fought even the most modest attempts to rein in their political activities. Grant recipients, for instance, fought a protracted battle in the federal courts over a regulation forbidding the use of federal funds for congressional redistricting litigation and lobbying. <sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the seating of the 104th Congress in January 1995, the legal services program found itself for the first time under the jurisdiction of a largely conservative Congress. Given the LSC's history, conflict was inevitable. Conservatives sought to eliminate federal funding for both policy and budgetary reasons. LSC grantees are among the leading opponents of welfare reform and chief litigators for left-of-center causes; moreover, the LSC budget, as part of discretionary domestic spending, offered a prime target for almost every plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a full-scale lobbying effort launched by LSC grantees and their allies, Congress approved a phased elimination of all federal LSC funding. The omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in late April 1996 reduced LSC's budget from $400 million in FY 1995 to $278 million in FY 1996. Further reductions are planned for next year, with an end to federal funding in 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Additionally, the 104th Congress imposed numerous restrictions on the types of cases in which LSC grantees could be involved. The Clinton-appointed Corporation and its grantees responded by returning to the strategy LSC had used effectively in the Reagan years: exploiting all possible legal loopholes. The efforts of legal services lawyers to avoid compliance with new restrictions have reinforced the conviction of many congressional critics that the politicized legal services fund must be eliminated from the federal budget.
<p>
<b>The 104th Congress: Phased Elimination and New Restrictions</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Intent on cutting the deficit in early 1995, the new Congress proposed a recission of $17.1 billion in federal spending, including $15 million from the LSC. Legal services supporters responded with vitriol. In February 1995, for example, American Bar Association President George Bushnell attacked conservative critics of legal services as "reptilian bastards."<sup>2</sup>  Congress and President Clinton eventually agreed to rescind $15 million of the $415 million FY 1995 LSC budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The general commitment to achieving a balanced budget placed heavy pressure on moderate Members of the 104th Congress, who otherwise might have spared the LSC, to go along with significant cuts. The May 1995 budget resolution, which passed along party lines, therefore endorsed a phased elimination of LSC spending in which the adjusted funding level of $400 million for 1995 would be reduced to $278 million for FY 1996, $141 million for FY 1997, and zero for FY 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the budget resolution sets forth the general budget plan for LSC, actual appropriations are made through a separate process. The House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Harold Rogers (R-KY), recommended an FY 1996 funding level of $278 million -- the amount specified by the House budget resolution. House conservatives, however, mindful of how legal services groups might thwart welfare reform and other key elements of their agenda, advocated an immediate end to all LSC funding. The fact that the Legal Services Corporation Act had not been reauthorized since its expiration in 1980 gave LSC's foes an opportunity to use House rules to challenge funding for an unauthorized program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within this framework, the House Republican leadership met with the interested parties and struck an agreement to protect legal services appropriations from a floor challenge with the further understanding that the terms of a planned reauthorization bill would be added as an amendment, or rider, to LSC appropriations. The reauthorization legislation then under consideration included elimination of the LSC coupled with block grant funding to the states, to be used to provide legal services, and far stricter prohibitions on political activities than in prior legal services legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In mid-1995, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, chaired by Representative George W. Gekas (R-PA), held hearings and voted out a bill containing many of the needed reforms, including elimination of the LSC and the block granting of legal services funds. However, the full House Judiciary Committee -- reflecting both its more liberal membership and the influence of the organized bar -- narrowly passed a number of amendments extending the life of the program and increasing its spending levels. This new bill, unacceptable to House conservatives as well as to the Republican leadership, was never brought to the floor for a vote.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the Senate, Phil Gramm (R-TX), a longtime critic of the LSC, chaired the Appropriations subcommittee that reported out an even lower funding level for LSC than had been reported by the comparable subcommittee in the House: $210 million. That figure survived a vote by the full committee, but an effort on the Senate floor -- led by Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM), aided by the votes of 15 other Republican Senators and most Democrats -- narrowly defeated the Gramm proposal, replacing it with a much higher funding level of $340 million.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A House-Senate conference committee agreed to $278 million for LSC along with restrictions on lobbying, prison litigation, class action suits, illegal alien representation, and lawsuits against welfare reform, but President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill on December 19, 1995. The LSC appropriations thus became part of a long series of continuing resolutions which contained none of the proposed new restrictions, leaving legal services programs free to continue many of the same ideological and political activities that had motivated the 104th Congress to cut the program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On April 24, 1996, the President signed a new appropriations bill which reduced LSC funding to $278 million, the figure reported out by the original House-Senate conference committee. This bill also eliminates all funding for LSC's 17 support centers, some of which have engaged in litigation supporting the provision of government services to illegal aliens and opposing parental consent requirements for adolescents seeking abortions. These major cuts in the LSC budget are clear victories for congressional conservatives.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nearly as significant as the cuts in LSC funding are the restrictions placed on the types of cases LSC grantees may pursue. Grantees no longer may file challenges to welfare reform, for example, and class action lawsuits -- traditionally a major weapon in the grantee arsenal -- now may be filed only with the approval of the Corporation. Moreover, legal services lawyers are barred from representing prisoners, illegal aliens, and public housing residents being evicted for drug-related crimes.
<p>
<b>Replacing Federal Funds and Avoiding New Restrictions</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the fight over the future of legal services, the LSC empire's 4,000-plus attorneys, many with activist backgrounds, organized rallies, lobbied Congress, wrote op-eds, held demonstrations, and undertook direct-mail campaigns. A similar lobbying effort to counteract the Reagan Administration's effort to eliminate the LSC in the 1980s was investigated by the GAO, which found that federal funds intended for the provision of legal services to the poor were diverted to the LSC's political "survival campaign."<sup>4</sup>  Perhaps even more significant than their lobbying efforts was the fact that grantees sought additional non-federal funding and sought to create new loopholes by which to avoid federal restrictions.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal budget numbers do not begin to reflect the actual funding available for legal services programs. The 323 programs funded by LSC also receive in excess of $250 million a year from other sources, including foundations, state governments, legal fee awards, and the organized bar's Interest on Lawyers Trust Account programs. Without exception, in each of the last ten years, combined funding for legal services grantees from non-LSC sources has increased.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Efforts to raise non-federal revenues have increased significantly over the past year. According to the LSC, at least 27 states are studying ways to provide additional funding for legal services programs.<sup>5</sup>  Typically, most proposals seek an increase in filing fees for civil cases, with the proceeds earmarked for legal services:
<p><ul>
<li>In May 1995, Tennessee increased the filing fee for civil cases by $1 and designated the increased revenue for legal services programs.
<p>
<li>In February 1996, a bill was introduced in the Maryland legislature to raise $4.5 million for programs, including legal services, by adding a surcharge to civil case filing fees.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li>In New Jersey, a proposal to increase fees for filing civil motions from $135 to $160 was endorsed by the New Jersey Bar Association and the head of Legal Services of New Jersey. The entire $25 increase in filing fees is slated to be turned over to Legal Services of New Jersey. If the proposal is enacted, legal services will receive a projected $8 million increase in funding.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>New Loopholes</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because President Clinton has signed the appropriations bill, the new restrictions on legal services are now in effect. Many of the activist lawyers who lead legal services programs resent these regulations, which will bar a wide range of controversial activities undertaken by LSC-funded lawyers in the past, including lobbying, class action suits, and the representation of illegal aliens, drug dealers, and other criminals.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even more upsetting to opponents of reform, the new prohibitions would close the largest loophole in the legal services program by forbidding the use of non-LSC funds to support activities for which LSC funds also may not be used. In the past, legal services lawyers could evade virtually any congressionally imposed restriction by using, or claiming to use, non-LSC funds which are not subject to this limitation. Critics of legal services note that money is fungible, as is a lawyer's time. The absence of mandatory timekeeping, along with the fact that case files are closed to outside monitoring, made it easy for legal services programs to use federal funds for restricted activities.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The new restrictions have left legal services activists looking for new ways to continue their controversial activities. Using a variation of a strategy tried in the 1980s, grantees are seeking to evade the restrictions by setting up new closely affiliated but legally separate entities. A 1985 GAO investigation determined that such affiliated groups often engaged in activities prohibited to LSC grantees and that the relationships between these two sets of groups were so close that LSC should consider them one group for purposes of complying with restrictions.<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Growing numbers of legal services groups have announced they will refuse LSC funds because of pending restrictions. Foremost among these are Community Legal Services (CLS) of Philadelphia; the Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara, California; three Washington State grantees; and Greater Boston, Massachusetts, Legal Services. The strategy is simple: Such "former" grantees will continue to receive bar support, private funds, and state support for soon-to-be-restricted activities; meanwhile, new organizations will apply for and receive LSC funds to use in non-prohibited cases. Many of the new organizations have been created by attorneys affiliated with the "former" grantees, which would be free to handle political and ideological cases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The possibility that former LSC grantees and new grantees will share office space and even staff means that, once again, it will be difficult to ascertain whether federal funds are being misused. Early signs of close ties between former and current grantees, however, are already apparent:
<p><ul>
<li>The Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center, for example, was formed by 12 lawyers from Community Legal Services to assume CLS's non-prohibited cases, setting up shop in the same building as CLS.<sup>9</sup>
<p><li>Members of the Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara's executive committee opted to refuse LSC funds and set up a new organization to take LSC funds. LAS Vice President Elizabeth Shivell explained the tactic in an unguarded moment: "If [Congress] can screw people with technicalities, we can unscrew them with technicalities. That's why we're lawyers and not social workers. Two can play this game."  A bar publication reported that many poverty lawyers worried that her remarks could cause trouble with Congress.<sup>10</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A top LSC staff member, Robert Echols, was quoted as describing the rash of new groups as a perfectly appropriate approach.<sup>11</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Legal Services Corporation -- run by a Clinton-appointed board and run by senior-level staff with strong ties to the groups they are charged with regulating -- has provided guidance to its programs on this issue. In a December 1995 memo to its 323 field programs on "Applicability of Restrictions to Interrelated Organizations," LSC set forth the factors to be considered in determining whether one group controls another, thereby subjecting both groups to the new restrictions. Among the eight criteria used to determine control are:
<p><ul>
<li>Any overlap of officers, directors, or managers;
<p>
<li>Contractual and financial relationships;
<p>
<li>A close identity of interest; and
<p>
<li>A history of relationships among organizations.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The LSC memo pointed out that any determination as to whether two groups are subject to common control would consider the "totality of circumstances," with the "presence or absence of any one or more of these factors" not necessarily determinative. Translation: LSC staff, with close ties to LSC grantees, will be the sole judges of whether two groups sharing office space, staff, and other resources are subject to common control, and therefore to the new restrictions.

<p>
<b>Other New Loopholes: "Restriction" of Drug Cases and the Cohen Amendment</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Legal services lawyers have incurred the bipartisan wrath of Congress by representing public housing tenants in drug-related eviction cases. LSC-funded lawyers, for example, thwarted attempts by then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp in 1991 to expedite evictions to clean up the serious drug problem in public housing.<sup>12</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, the poor -- those whom these programs ostensibly are designed to help -- have lined up almost uniformly in opposition to legal services and in favor of expediting drug evictions. In a major case now pending in New York City, representatives of New York's 500,000 public housing tenants have entered a court case on the side of their landlord, the New York Housing Authority, to support expedited drug evictions. On the other side is the Legal Aid Society, an LSC grantee once chaired by the Corporation's current President, Alex Forger.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faced with the likelihood of tough new restrictions imposed by Congress, the LSC board made a virtue out of necessity: It promulgated a new regulation purporting to restrict representation in drug-related eviction cases. This regulation appeared in the <I>Federal Register</I> on April 1, 1996. While appearing to crack down on one of the most indefensible of legal services activities, however, the new regulation actually is filled with loopholes.
<p><ul>
<li>It allows family members who knew about and benefited financially from drug activity to be represented, provided they are not charged with a crime.
<p>
<li>It specifically allows legal services lawyers to use non-LSC funds to represent the drug dealer.
<p>
<li>But nothing in the regulation prohibits legal services lawyers from filing actions to challenge attempts by federal, state, and local governments to expedite drug-related evictions from public housing.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proponents of legal services have tried to minimize this issue by claiming that such cases are rare; critics, on the other hand, point to the action against Secretary Kemp and the case pending in New York City to show that legal services' involvement delays drug-related evictions, thereby harming hundreds of thousands of low-income tenants.<sup>14</sup>  In short, the new regulation offers the perfect metaphor for the claim that the legal services program finally is reforming itself: While doing nothing to deter a legal services lawyer from continued involvement in drug-related evictions, it gives LSC a pretext for telling Congress that it has cracked down on such representation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the LSC's obvious failure to follow the new restrictions, the legal services empire scored a major victory in 1996 with the inclusion of the Cohen amendment in the omnibus spending bill. This amendment, sponsored by Senator William Cohen (R-ME), allows grantees to comment on legislation and participate in legislative rulemaking. The effect of the Cohen amendment is to provide a major loophole for legal services lawyers disposed to engage in lobbying activities.
<p>
<b>Conclusion: Looking to the 105th Congress</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although LSC escaped total defunding in 1995, it lost nearly one-third of its federal appropriation. Fearing that Congress would impose several important limits on grantee activities, the LSC, its grantees, and their affiliates worked to devise new strategies to avoid complying with such restrictions. As a result, conservatives in Congress remain determined to push for phased elimination of all federal LSC funding.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House Republican leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached last summer, is expected to ensure that the Rules Committee will not protect LSC from a point of order when the full House considers the FY 1997 appropriations bill containing LSC funding. This could open the opportunity for the House to "zero out" LSC. So far, there is no reliable head count, but it should be remembered that whatever happens, the Senate -- given last year's performance -- is not likely to go along.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The major battle in Congress therefore will be over whether the budget resolution's FY 1997 figure of $141 million for LSC will be followed. This would represent a sharp cut from the $278 million voted for FY 1996. If Congress approves $141 million, the stage will be set for the final showdown on legal services. The 105th Congress, to be elected this November, will decide whether it has the political will to vote for the final installment of the budget resolution plan for LSC: zero support from the American taxpayer by FY 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reducing LSC's appropriation by one-third while placing significant restrictions on the allowable activities of LSC grantees, the 104th Congress took major steps to reduce the tendency of grantees to pursue frivolous and politically charged lawsuits at taxpayer's expense. LSC grantees responded by attempting to blunt the impact of congressional efforts, primarily by seeking new, non-federal revenue sources or by restructuring their organizations to circumvent the new regulations. Through these actions, grantees have shown once again that legal services cannot be reformed. It is past time for Congress to eliminate all federal funding for this program.

       <hr width=50%></center><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I love my nation but I fear my government." So read a bumper sticker I saw in Topeka, Kansas, during my first campaign for political office. I was running for Congress and I had to wonder: Was this not the same government that had mobilized the nation to win World War II, that had defeated communism, that had built the interstate highway system? What had gone so desperately wrong? A few months later, I understood perfectly the meaning of that message. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Americans deeply believe in the principles of America, but they don't see them reflected in their government. Americans believe in freedom, democracy, moral values, family, community, and free markets. Yet their government seizes their rights without their consent. Government has become their master, not their servant.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To address these concerns, I ran a campaign in 1994 based on three words: Reduce, Reform, and Return. Reduce the size and scope of the federal government. Reform the Congress. Return to the basic values that had built the country: work and family and the recognition of a higher moral authority.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While many were rightfully skeptical back then that what I said would ever happen, none says so now. We are finally seeing some progress toward reversing a trend thought unstoppable: the growth of government, the irresponsibility of Congress, and the loss of the moral character upon which the nation was founded. The current debate over the budget is about more than simply learning to live within our means. It is a turning point in the history of the federal government. The crucial issue is who should be in charge of major programs like welfare and Medicaid -- the bureaucrats and regulators and members of Congress in Washington, or the American people and their elected state and local representatives.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our Founding Fathers designed the federal government to be limited. But in the name of compassion, the federal government now tries to do all things for all people. We have discovered, by spending trillions of dollars and taking rights and freedoms away from individuals, that government cannot solve all of our problems. Indeed, exceeding the authority for which the system was designed hurts people.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I certainly discovered this in the district I  represent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	LeCompton, Kansas, has a population of 750. At the city hall one day, I met Jeff Goodrick, who showed me a ramp that has provided access to the handicapped for 20 years. Under the new Americans with Disabilities Act, the town was told to replace this ramp for an estimated cost of $15,000, even though the design of the old ramp had never denied anyone access to the tiny city hall. The new one was to be slightly longer, with a slightly more gradual slope. The people of LeCompton don't have the money to pay for this new ramp without sacrificing other services essential to their community. Their freedom had been diminished, and for what?
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Erie, Kansas, I walked up and down the main street while I was campaigning. I entered a small repair shop and visited with the owner, Rex Bohrer. He had the thick, callused hands of a man who has not lived a life of leisure. I asked him for his vote. Rex stared up at me from behind an air-conditioner he was repairing and said, "You runnin' for the U.S. Congress?" --  to which I answered a timid "yes." He said, "I want to talk to you." He led me to the front of his shop and showed me a government manual containing more than 50 pages of fine print telling him how he must repair refrigerators under new regulations regarding the chemical freon. He asked, "What the heck am I supposed to do with this? I don't understand this manual, and you tell me that if I violate any provision it could cost me $10,000. What am I supposed to do?"
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I didn't know. I certainly do not want to pollute the environment with dangerous chemicals. But here was an honest citizen trying to earn an honest wage who was being directed by an impossibly complex manual and who face fines of up to $10,000 if he violates any of its provisions. Rex's only recourse is to quit the business that he needs for survival. What is he to do?
<P> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Girard, Kansas, I was speaking to the seniors of Girard High School about the Social Security trust fund. A number of these students had already paid some Social Security taxes. I asked how many of them expected to receive anything from Social Security when they reached the age of 65. Out of nearly 100 students, only four raised their hands. Then I asked how many of them believed in extraterrestrials. About 15 hands went up. This mirrors the responses of young people everywhere. Nationwide, fewer Americans under 25 believe that they will receive anything from Social Security when they retire than believe in UFOs. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Troy, a farming community in northeast Kansas, I held a town meeting about the need to balance the budget and cut the government back for the sake of future generations. Blaine Holder held up his hand and said, "Well, I can tell you how to do away with the entire U.S. Department of Agriculture and the farm programs, but we as farmers have to have some sort of promise that the government won't use food as a political weapon. We need a contract with the State Department that if they ever use food as a diplomatic weapon, they will reimburse us for the reduction in price that we receive because of our government's actions. If the government would enter into a contract of this nature with the American farmer, I think many of them would be willing to do without all of the government interference and price supports." Of course, Blaine thought the possibility of such a contract was hopeless. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In nearly every town hall I visit, I hear complaints about our tax system. The complicated and frequently politically driven statutes that now make up our tax code compromise our economic growth and provoke class envy. No one can understand the 10,000 pages of tax laws; even the tax lawyers complain about its complexity. When America's taxpayers call the IRS for information, they get five different answers from five different agents. Whatever happened to a tax code designed only for raising federal revenue? How did we end up with a system that micromanages our lives and our economy?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Everywhere I go, I hear stories that reveal an overreaching regime distorted by the false notion that centralized authority will lead this nation on the right path. In fact, the American people believe they can handle most of their problems better than the federal government can. They are right.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	How has a nation conceived in liberty and opposition to tyranny arrived at a point today where citizens are more fearful of their own government threatening their rights than they are of any other government? <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We got off track by forgetting our core principles. But the good news is there is a way out. It's called the Constitution. However much we may have strayed from the precepts of that document, Americans continue to revere it and the principles it enshrines. Ratified by our founding generation and amended by succeeding generations, the Constitution stands equally for self-government and limited government. It is the instrument with which we empowered the federal government in the first place. But it is also the instrument with which we limited that government. If we would only return to those principles of limited government, then our nation, our economy, our liberties, and our social fiber will grow stronger than we have seen for a generation.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The bureaucratic model of growth and prosperity for a nation has been shown wanting all over the world, from communism in the former U.S.S.R., to socialism throughout Europe, to the welfare state in America. Those running for office in 1996 will find that one of the keys to success and leadership will be a vision of hope, of a brighter future with a smaller government -- one that is at last turning toward its constitutional principles and away from the idea that a centralized, bureaucratic government will solve all of our problems.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We must create an environment in which Americans look first to themselves and to each other for help, not to their congressmen. We must return to a society where people rely on their communities and do not regard their government as a substitute for civil society. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Faith-based institutions can address the needs of the poor more compassionately than federal bureaucrats can. Right now America could profit tremendously from a Fourth Awakening of the moral and spiritual fiber of this country. The government cannot lead that and it certainly should not thwart it. Government should take the Hippocratic Oath to "do no harm" to the values, the faith, and the moral and spiritual roots of the people of this deeply spiritual land. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We must restore the master-servant relationship between the people and the government. The people, of course, are the master, and government the servant, but even the best servant can't do everything. We must remind ourselves, as Ronald Reagan once said, that a government big enough to do everything for everybody is big enough to take everything from everyone. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Constitution gives the federal government a limited number of important enumerated powers -- for example, to borrow money, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, to establish post offices and post roads, to declare war, to coin money, to lay and collect taxes for all these purposes. Powers not granted and enumerated are retained by the states and the people. Much of the federal government literally has no constitutional basis. And that is where we find ourselves today.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The underlying principles limiting the federal government are embodied in our founding documents -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Civil War Amendments. These documents paint a picture of government, and the role of government in human affairs, that is subtle and profound. As the product of many compromises, the Constitution is not perfect; in fact, one of its compromises took a civil war to resolve. The process of refinement began with the Bill of Rights, which concludes -- in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments -- with a succinct statement of the Constitution's blueprint for a government of enumerated powers and delegated to the government by the people. Finally, the Civil War Amendments ended the immoral institution of slavery, then corrected the imbalance between federal and state power by adding a federal check on the states' power, thus adding greater force to the Declaration of Independence's original promise of liberty and equality for all. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the Declaration of Independence, we find the American vision of freedom and responsibility in its purest form. The Declaration's essence is captured in the few short phrases that begin with the most important phrase of all, "We hold these truths to be self-evident." In that simple line, Thomas Jefferson placed us squarely in the natural-law or higher-law tradition, which holds that there are "self-evident truths" of right or wrong. And what is that higher law? It begins with a premise of moral equality --  "all men are created equal" --  then defines our equality by reference to our "inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There, in a nutshell, is the moral vision -- a world in which moral people are free to pursue their own happiness, constrained only by the equal rights of others to do the same. It is not the responsibility of government to secure our happiness for us. That is our responsibility -- and our right. The role of government, rather, is to secure our rights, as the Declaration goes on to say. That is its basic function. But to be just or legitimate, government's powers must be derived "from the consent of the governed." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We have evolved this century from a constitutional government to a government that behaves without regard to constitutional principle. That moral vision in which people have the right and responsibility to pursue their own happiness has been lost. The federal government no longer derives its powers from the people -- it just takes them. This is why citizens distrust their government so much today. It is time that we re-limit our federal government so it can perform its proper functions well, and leave to the people and the states those functions which the federal government was never intended to perform.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If we can begin to restore a constitutional government, I foresee an America where freedom and responsibility grow for individuals, families, and communities. Freedom and responsibility cannot be separated. Our freedoms never belonged to the federal government, but to the individual. We must make our government return them.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I foresee an America that is the most family-friendly nation on earth. The family, not the government, should be the backbone of society. Government should cease trying to supplant it. When we are careless, legislative initiatives can harm families. By pledging to spare families from additional legislative and regulatory tinkering, we will do more to protect the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness than any federal legislative quick-fix.
<P> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I also foresee an America where far fewer decisions are made by Washington, and more are made by individuals, markets, or localities. Imagine the federal government, operating within its limited role, serving as a model of efficiency and effectiveness. A federal government focused on its constitutional missions -- rather than creating new ones -- could become a model for other governments. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So, how do we return to a constitutional government? To start, we can give the American people a clear choice in the next election. I propose that all Republican candidates running for president, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives start working together to develop a specific plan to return to a limited federal government as intended by our Founding Fathers. We must develop an agenda to recover the rights of individuals from their government. <p><b>A New Contract With America</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Call it a new Contract With America -- one that passes laws, not merely proposes them. Our party's greatest asset is our message, not our messengers. We should stake the future of our party -- and the country -- on a certain set of ideas, a governing moral code, rather than on any particular politician. Our goal should be to implement reforms consistent with those timeless principles embodied in the Constitution. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our pledge to the American people should be clear: "If you elect a Republican president and maintain Republican majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate, we will do the following . . . ." Here are some broad outlines for such a contract: <p><b>I. Reduce Government Spending</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will reduce the size of the federal government by a tangible measurement over a period of four years. My preference would be a reduction of federal spending from 22 percent of our GDP to 15 percent or less (which may take longer than four years). Imagine taking these resources from the hands of government and putting them back into the pockets of families and entrepreneurs.<P><b>II. Transform the Tax System</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will remove all social engineering from the U.S. tax code to create a new tax system designed strictly for the purpose of raising revenue efficiently. The power to lay and collect taxes was meant to fund the enumerated powers, not to become a political device in and of itself. Today, we discourage certain behaviors and reward others based purely on the whims of those who control the tax leviathan. <p><b>III. Reorganize the Executive Branch</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will redesign the executive branch to be consistent with its constitutional authority instead of one still operating on 20th-century, centralized government experiments. We will replace the 14 cabinet-level agencies, which impose more than half a trillion dollars worth of regulations upon the U.S. economy each year, with perhaps nine, and restrict their regulatory powers under constitutional principles. The Constitution does not authorize at the federal level, for example, many of the activities within the departments of Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Education, and Energy. <p><b>IV. Create a Constitutional Caucus</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will form a constitutional caucus or commission to evaluate all federal programs for an authorizing principle under the Constitution. A constitutional cleansing of the federal government is long overdue. Furthermore, Congress should require that all legislative proposals cite their precise constitutional authority before they can be enacted. In the case of existing illegitimate programs, Congress should identify and debate which ones should be returned to the states or phased out entirely.<p><b>V. Seek Change with Compassion</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As we phase out unconstitutional programs, we will implement change with compassion, so that people currently dependent upon federal programs will have time to prepare for the transition and enjoy the empowerment they receive from their new freedoms. <p><b>VI. Pay Off the National Debt</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will implement a plan not only to balance the budget, but to run surpluses and pay off our $5-trillion national debt over 30 years, so that our children can decide their own future. <p><b>VII. Remove Barriers to Good Citizenship</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will erase from the books all laws, regulations, and other barriers that prevent local voluntary and civic institutions from helping their neighbors. Faith-based and civic institutions that are leading the fight for a civil society should not be stymied and penalized by mountains of federal laws and regulations that merely supplant local acts of kindness with the cold attitude of "government knows best." Why do we have a poverty class at all, when we spend an average of $36,000 in federal, state, and local welfare funds on every family below the poverty level? Because as much as 70 cents of each government anti-poverty dollar doesn't even reach the poor -- it is engulfed by administrative overhead and "professional" personnel. We will form a task force to conduct an exhaustive investigation of rules and laws that are interfering with those faith-based and civic institutions that are working to revive their communities and families. Then we will implement its recommendations. Local church and community groups can do far more to bring their people back to self-sufficiency than a central planner could ever hope to achieve. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are conservatives who believe that, with the proper leadership, the federal government can engineer the comeback of the family and civil society. But we should not yield to such temptations. If we are trying to end social engineering from the left, how can we justify it from the right? Our highest goals should not rely on new legislative initiatives as much as on the proper legislative restraint.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With this platform and this contract with the American people, we will continue to be the party of ideas and of commitment to constitutional principles, to prosperity, to a revived citizenry, and to a government on the side of those who want the culture in America to reflect their basic values. This is more important now than ever before, because government thwarts those values by attempting to replace them. Today, on behalf of the "public good," government crowds out the individual's "pursuit of happiness" --  including private investment and private charity -- by replacing them with government substitutes.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We face today a set of deep-seated problems --overweening government, massive public debt, and crippling dependence on federal programs. But we face as well a historic opportunity to base our solutions upon our very roots as a nation, and upon our principles as a people -- freedom and responsibility. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let us seize the opportunity before us by recovering those principles. If we restore government to its proper role under our Constitution, we will look back in years to come and say that the moment was right, and we were a match for that moment. And our children and grandchildren will thank us. <p><i><b><a href=" http://www.house.gov/brownback/welcome.html"> Sam Brownback</a></b> is a freshman Republican congressman from Kansas.</i>

<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</I>

</center><p>

	The first act of an incoming president is to "solemnly swear (or affirm)" that he will "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."  In judging prospective candidates for the presidency, it is therefore important to examine whether they interpret the Constitution properly. To help voters with this determination, <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> asked the following question of the principal presidential candidates still running as of November 1995: "Which parts of the Constitution are commonly misinterpreted or underappreciated, and therefore deserve more emphasis in political discourse?" We publish responses from Senators Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, and Dick Lugar; Governor Lamar Alexander, and Representative Robert Dornan. (President Bill Clinton, Patrick Buchanan, Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes were invited to participate but did not respond by our deadline.)

	The most basic misunderstanding is that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment demands that any reference to religion must be absolutely cleansed from our schools and other public institutions. A second misunderstanding is that anyone who wants our public institutions to show more respect for the religious faith of the American people is really plotting to impose a particular religious viewpoint on those with different beliefs.

<p>	A good part of the blame for this confusion lies with the Supreme Court of the United States. Years ago, the Court cast aside the original meaning of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which forbids the establishment of an official state religion or policies favoring one religion over another. In its place, the Court has erected a variety of confusing formulas -- the Lemon test, the endorsement test, and others -- that invoke the Constitution to support the proposition that religion must be purged from public life. Using such tests, the Supreme Court has banned the display of the Ten Commandments in any public school, even for educational purposes.


<p>
	Unfortunately, misguided school administrators and teachers in some areas of the country have also wrongly embraced the idea that all references to religion in school settings are unconstitutional. Among the results of this misreading of the First Amendment:

<p><ul>

<li>Teachers have been disciplined for wearing a cross as personal jewelry and for reading their own Bible during break periods.<p>

<li>Two Texas third-graders were prohibited from wearing T-shirts depicting Jesus -- though Power Rangers and Barney were just fine.

<p>


<li>Many communities have banned holiday crche displays from public buildings and parks, even where 
they have been set up by private civic groups.


<p>

<li>Some schools have banned religious songs at choir concerts, as well as Christmas carols, and even Christmas trees.
<P>

<li>Students have been told they may not talk about God to classmates, and teachers have rejected religious artwork and reports on "my hero" where the students took the politically incorrect decision to write about Jesus.
</ul><p>


	In fact, studies by the National Institute of Education, People for the American Way, and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State have all confirmed that references to religion's role in American life and history have been systematically stripped from textbooks and curricula.
<p>

	A fair reading of the historical record, however, shows that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was designed to protect religious liberty, not strip religious expression from all public institutions. As Professor Stephen Carter writes: "[T]he metaphorical separation of church and state originated in an effort to protect religion from the state, not the state from religion. The religion clauses of the First Amendment were crafted to permit maximum freedom to the religious."

<p>	After all, it was the first Congress -- which passed the Bill of Rights and sent it for ratification to the states -- that opened each day's session with a prayer led by a chaplain. This practice continues today. And 24 hours after it voted in favor of what is now the First Amendment, the Congress considered a resolution proclaiming a national day of thanksgiving. Indeed, if the Supreme Court itself really adhered to the view that the government must divorce itself from religion, then it would not open every one of its sessions with the appeal, "God save the United States and this Honorable Court."

<p>	There are some hopeful signs that the confusion surrounding the First Amendment's Establishment Clause is now beginning to clear up. Earlier this year, in a close, 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a public university can deny funding to a Christian student newspaper while financing student publications generally. It now appears that there are at least five justices who believe that religious expression is entitled to the same constitutional protection as other forms of expression.

<p>	To say that our public institutions should accommodate religious speech is not to say that the state should impose official prayers and punish students who do not participate. That's certainly not my position. Nor is it the position of Jay Sekulow, Pat Robertson's counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, who has said, "We don't want to see a return to the pre-1962 situation, with a teacher leading a class i
n prayer."

<p>	At the same time, we simply do not accept the view that the Constitution commands that religion be erased from whatever government touches. This view misreads the First Amendment and distorts history.

<i>The Takings Clause</i><br>
<a href="http://www.gramm96.org">Phil Gramm for President Home Page</a>

<p>
	When considering the most "underappreciated" element of the Constitution, anyone who sees what is going on everyday across this country as I do will respond immediately, "the Fifth Amendment." Well known for its protection against self-incrimination, the Fifth Amendment also contains a clause that protects private property, a building block of the American foundation. The Takings Clause is a quintessential constitutional shield, artfully and specifically rejecting the idea that government officials can seize property without compensation, regardless of what public good they intend to accomplish.

<p>	Unfortunately, we are facing a threat to the right to own property that our Founding Fathers could never have imagined. In America in 1995, two consenting adults can engage in any kind of consensual behavior with total constitutional protection -- except owning private property  and engaging in commerce and business. Over and over again -- every day all across America -- people are having their private property taken without compensation -- by way of the Endangered Species Act, wetlands regulation, and a host of other "regulatory takings." Property values are being reduced and land is effectively being taken to promote objectives that society considers good, but for which society refuses to pay. In fact, we have a president today whose interior secretary has suggested that private property may even be outdated in the modern world!

<p>

	If government takes your property or restricts its use, you should be compensated. On this issue there can be no compromise. Private property is the foundation of our freedom, and I will defend it as vigorously as the freedom of speech and freedom of religion. As president, I will work hard to protect private-property rights and to bring the Fifth Amendment back into the family of the Bill of Rights on behalf of the people who own property, till the soil, and produce the goods and services in our country.

<p>	The most pressing constitutional issue facing our nation, however, involves a matter not actually enshrined in that great document. I am referring to the need for a Balanced Budget Amendment. I introduced a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution on my first day in Congress and have worked hard to pass it ever since. But, as surprising as it may be to some of my colleagues, this debate did not begin with my tenure in Congress.

<p>	Through the course of American history, we have amended our Constitution 27 times, but haven't yet had the political will to fix the only thing Thomas Jefferson found wrong with the document. Jefferson was this country's Minister to France during the writing of the Constitution, and when he was first shown the document, he had a proposal for one change. In a subsequent letter to John Taylor, Jefferson recorded that proposal:

<p>	"I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional article taking from the government the power of borrowing."

<p>	So the present controversy is not just a debate over a balanced budget amendment, but a debate on the Jefferson amendment. It is also a debate about the future of America and a potential seed of its destruction. We need a contract between the government and the people that binds Congress with a chain that cannot be broken. The genius of the Const
itution is that it rules out of bounds actions that the people have determined that they do not want Congress to take. Read the first words from the Bill of Rights in our Constitution: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for redress of grievances."

<p>	The American people were clear about the grievances they wanted redressed in November 1994. In the most decisive election since 1932, the people said to their government, "Stop the taxing. Stop the spending. Stop the regulating." To do that, they supported the Contract With America, a key element of which is a balanced budget amendment. But we haven't given the people what they want yet. We have not fulfilled a promise we made.

<p>	The Constitution was written because people did not trust the government. With Congress's failure to honor its promises, act responsibly, and be accountable for its actions, there is much for the people not to trust.

<a name="lugar"></a><b>Senator Dick Lugar</b><br>
<i>Enumerated Powers</i>
<br>
<a href="http://www.iquest.net/lugar/lugar.html">Lugar for President Home Page</a>
<p>
	Virtually every clause in the Constitution has been used -- even tortured -- to justify a variety of causes. What deserves more emphasis in political discourse, however, is the spirit of what the Constitution set out to do generally: to assign to the federal government specific tasks and the powers to carry them out, and to reserve all else to the states or the people. This intent is most clearly articulated in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution.


<p>
	The aim of the Constitution's Framers was clear enough: to create a strong, but limited, national government. Having first decided to omit a list of specific limits (or "negatives," as the Framers called them) on the national government's authority, the Framers then agreed in principle to accept them as the first amendments to the new Constitution. The first eight amendments impose specific limits on the power of government, both at the national and state levels. All serve the same end: restricting the scope and power of government. Lest there be any ambiguity, the Ninth Amendment makes clear the presumption that rights belong to the people: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." And the Tenth Amendment makes clear the boundaries that this places on the national government: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

<p>	In a way, it might be said that these provisions were not so much "amendments" to the Constitution -- in the sense of replacing existing provisions or adding new features -- as clarifications of the Constitution's underlying intent. The Framers were no libertarians; they set out to create a strong national government with powers sufficiently robust to accomplish its functions. This is especially true in the realm of national security, where powers are largely reserved to the national government. That which the federal government should do, the Framers believed, it should do well.

<p>
	But that which the federal government should not do and cannot do well, it should not do at all. The modern departure from this philosophy is largely responsible for the lack of confidence that Americans now express about their government. As the national government has expanded its reach into virtually every sphere of Americans' lives, it should not be surprising that the volatility of voter preferences and discontent with government have increased. The passions of individuals and groups are inflamed on all sides of issues that are not properly within the sphere of the federal government.

<p>	Take the recent debate over funding formulas and federal "strings" on welfare block grants. It is well and good that states and localities should administer their own social welfare programs. They are closer to the people and, on the whole, they will do a better job than the federal government. This is surely consistent with the intent of the Framers.

<p>	But why should the federal government be the tax collector for the states' programs? Why, for example, should citizens of Iowa or New Hampshire or any other state send their money to Washington, only to have it returned -- after bitter fights over allocation formulas and conditionsto run their own programs? Wouldn't it make more sense for states to raise the funds to pay for the programs they establish?


<p>
	In this regard, I have proposed to eliminate the federal income tax (and the 16th Amendment, which makes it possible) and replace it with a national sales tax collected by the states. National and state sales taxes can coexist perfectly well and, after a brief time, are likely to come into conformity with one another. Once this occurs, the federal government could reduce its sales tax, and allow the states to raise the funds for their own programs. Gone would be monetary transfers to Washington; gone would be formula fights; and gone would be federal strings. And limited federal government would be here to stay.

<p>	The Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution offer much needed guidance. If we were to ask whether each new proposed program, as well as many existing programs, represent legitimate tasks of the federal government, our answer would often be "no," and we could start to fashion a more efficient federal government. We would also discover that properly limiting federal government would raise its public standing commensurately.

<p>	In speaking of the amendment process, James Madison says in The Federalist No.49, "As every appeal to the people would carry an implication of some defect in the government, frequent appeals would, in great measure, deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on everything." A society that appeals to its national government to attend to all things -- including those for which it is not suited -- will find that that same government loses the veneration of the people in political discourse. That cannot be the goal of true friends of limited government.

<a name="lamar"></a><b>Lamar Alexander</b><br>
<i>Presidential Powers</i><br>
<a href="http://www.Nashville.Net/~lamar">Alexander for President Home Page</a><p>

	One section of our Constitution distinguishes the United States from virtually all other countries: Article II, the description of the role and powers of the president. The president is the only figure in our government whose oath of office is actually written in the Constitution. He is the only person who is elected by and represents all of the people. Yet, today, it is the president whose power and authority is most in decline.

<p>	The reasons for the decline are obvious. Even at the outset of his administration, when Bill Clinton's own party controlled both Houses of Congress, nearly all his actions undermined the strength of the presidency. He has retreated from campaign promises (the middle-class tax cut, a balanced budget), sown disaffection among his own supporters (gays in the military, health-care reform), dragged the White House into embarrassing scandals (Travelgate, Whitewater), and zigged and zagged on foreign policy (Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia).

<p>	But the presidency has also suffered from the rise of the legislative branch, especially since the elections of November 1994. This development is unusual. While the Congress has often had energetic leaders, it is rare in the modern era to see the national agenda set by the legislative branch rather than the executive.

<p>	Setting the national agenda may be the single most important function of a president. A strong president is someone who can focus on the two or three most urgent needs facing our country, develop a strategy to deal with them, and then convince at least half the country he's right. President Carter, by contrast, tried to involve himself in virtually every policy matter. President Clinton has done the same. The result has been an unfocused, and consequently weak, presidency. I am convinced that much of Ronald Reagan's effectiveness as president came from having three clear goals -- lower taxes, less government, and strong defense -- and spending all eight years of his presidency pursuing them.


<p>
	A careful reading of the Constitution shows that Article II provides the president with the tools to set the national agenda. He is the commander in chief and he is responsible for the conduct of the nation's foreign affairs. He can pick his own cabinet and appoint the chief officers of the government. He can select candidates for the federal bench. Through the careful use of the veto, he can reject whatever competing ideas the Congress tries to impose on the nation. All of these instruments of executive power can make for a strong president who helps chart the nation's course.

<p>	Again, President Clinton provides us with the best example of how the misuse of these powers leads to a weak executive. President Clinton's role as both commander-in-chief and the executive responsible for the conduct of foreign policy has done nothing to persuade America that there is a steady hand on the tiller. The result has been a Congress all-too-eager to usurp the president's prerogative in making foreign policy, whether it is in trade matters or the deployment of troops in Bosnia. A strong executive, as the Constitution implies, must make foreign policy, and resist congressional encroachments.

<p>	Our current situation is often ascribed to President Clinton's "inexperience" in foreign policy matters. Of course, it is not unusual for a president to arrive at the White House without a detailed knowledge of foreign affairs. But it is alarming to have a president who apparently doesn't know anyone else who does. Here we see President Clinton's ineffectual use of the power of appointment. The bureaucratic in-fighting among the State Department, Pentagon, and National Security Council personnel at the start of the Clinton presidency was a sign of the chief executive's inability to put together a first-class team that could work together. Joycelyn Elders and the series of bungled nominations at the Justice Department further eroded our confidence in the president's judgment. More recently, President Clinton's threats to veto a balanced budget amendment and the Republican Medicare plan seemed like pure political posturing rather than prudent use of executive power. These actions weakened both the president and the office of the presidency.

<p>	To be sure, there are many other aspects of our Constitution that receive too little notice: the Ninth and Tenth Amendments; the 22nd Amendment that created term limits for the president (the precedent for Congressional term limits); and the two alcohol amendments that tried to impose national legislation where local ordinances had proven more effective.
<p>
	But today we are on the brink of electing the first president of the next century. It would be worthwhile for all students of the Constitution -- not to mention all candidates for president -- to reexamine Article II. Used the way our Founders intended, Article II will help a strong, agenda-setting president committed to a limited central government achieve his goals.
<p>

<a name="dornan"></a><b>Representative Robert K. Dornan</b><br>
<i>"Government by Judiciary"</i>

<p>

	James Madison wrote that if "the sense in which the Constitution was accepted and ratified by the Nation . . . be not the guide in expounding it, there can be no security for a consistent and stable [government], more than for a faithful exercise of its powers." I couldn't agree more.

<p>	Seventy years of liberal activism, defined as opposing Madison's sentiment, have undone the original intent of the Framers. But no single point of judicial activism has done more harm to our nation than the doctrine of "incorporation"  in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights. In one fell swoop, the majesty and wisdom of the Tenth Amendment -- not to mention every doctrine of liberty upon which this nation of states was founded -- came crashing down.
<p>

	Our national penitence for the gross and evil sin of slavery has taken its toll on our every public institution. We fought a civil war, the bloodiest of all American wars, in large part to shed the physical chains of slavery protected by states' rights. We could have used surgically precise remedies to eventually bring closure to this historic tragedy without savaging the very liberties we insisted we were defending; instead we ignored the wisdom of our Founding Fathers and attempted a solution -- government by judiciary -- that fell way off the mark. In our earnest attempt to stop injustice from hiding behind the shield of states' rights, we threw the baby out with the bathwater. And, politics and power being what they are, "absorption" gave way to "incorporation."

<p>	Government by judiciary is perhaps the severest price our nation has paid for slavery. Through "incorporation" in the Fourteenth Amendment, the voice of the people (Congress and state and local governments) is patronized by "benevolent" judges, manipulated by strident ideologues, and mortgaged for generations by monied special interests. If the courts are, for all practical purposes, a "continuous constitutional convention," then how does our democracy differ from past oligarchies?

<p>	It is no small irony that this abrogation of federalism, our ultimate response to slavery, has brought on the second crushing evil to beset our nation: abortion. Only a judiciary that felt it had free rein to invoke "penumbras" within our Constitution could be so sick with power as to legalize mass extermination of our most innocent and defenseless citizens, our pre-born. Millions of pre-born children have been cruelly and brutally slaughtered -- a toll more horrific than any other holocaust -- because a simple majority of only nine men, ruling on behalf of 50 separate state constitutions, held that the Constitution, somewhere and somehow, contains a paramount right to privacy . . . and that "incorporation" dictates that this "penumbra" apply to the states.

<p>
	Every great social question in which the U.S. Supreme Court has weighed its opinion is the spawn of incorporation. Again, by what force of irony have our earnest attempts to rectify the problem of slavery ultimately given birth, not only to an even greater national sin in abortion but to a brood of contentious national issues that federalism was designed to pacify?

<p>	Consider, for instance, the charged issue of prayer in public schools. Any person with half a brain recognizes the insurmountable social problem of maintaining one collective way of publicly expressing our national adherence to the benevolent hand of God. And yet, precisely in response to public prayer -- contention that is completely natural and expected -- a simple majority of only nine unelected rulers told all of us that because one collective way of public prayer is not compatible with national cohesion, then no public prayer will be allowed. The doctrine of incorporation gives the Court this prerogative to rule in this manner.

<p>
	Every thinking American schooled in our national heritage -- all except a majority of the robed nine -- knows the intrinsic secular benefit from publicly acknowledging our Creator. Allowing and even encouraging public-school children to formally and vocally acknowledge their Creator impresses upon each of them a fundamental doctrine of Americanism -- that inalienable rights come from a Creator and not from man.

<p>
	Hence, these rights cannot be justifiably taken from them by men and their governments. How else can we more effectively impress this powerful message on the minds of rising generations? Incorporation states that we need not even try.

<h2>A Cop Next Door</h2>
<b>by Walter Oleksy</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1991, the police department in Columbia, South Carolina, began offering low-interest mortgage loans to any officer willing to live in a high-crime or deteriorating neighborhood. One rundown house whose street address was 911 caught the attention of Officer James Brown. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I told my wife, 'That house is meant for us,'" he says. Brown's wife and two young children weren't so sure. The one-story brick house needed repairs, and the neighborhood was suffering frequent burglaries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The department offered the Browns a mortgage loan with a 4 percent interest rate and no money down. Their only out-of-pocket expense was $5 for a credit check. They bought the house for $70,000, including $28,000 in renovation costs, and have lived in it happily for more than four years. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I dreamed of having my own home, but never thought it would happen," says Brown. "My neighbors say they see a big difference since my family and I moved in and I park my squad car out front. They tell me they sleep feeling safer, knowing I'm living here with them. I think the police homeowner program is great for me and the city."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Brown did not know it at the time, but by buying and moving his family into the "911 house," he became one of the first police officers in the nation to take part in a small but growing and  successful element of community-policing programs across the nation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Police homeownership in high-risk neighborhoods is community-oriented policing at its very best," says Columbia police chief Charles Austin. "People in problem areas of our city used to complain that police aren't really sensitive to the problems of the community. 'Police don't live here,' they would say, 'so they don't really care what happens here.' Now they know that police officers live among them and do care."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Austin says the program is a major ingredient of his community-based policing plan. Overall crime rates have decreased 16 percent since 1991, and he attributes much of that  drop to the new home loan program, which induced 11 officers to move into some of the city's high-crime neighborhoods.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Like most other cities, the fight against crime and deteriorating homes leads the list of needs," says Richard J. Semon, Columbia's community-development director. He says that the program has also furthered the goal of revitalizing the city's housing and promoting homeownership.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The results have been overwhelmingly positive: The ongoing presence of police can help sustain or renew a sense of stability to a community. Suzanne House, a neighbor of one of the Columbia policemen in the program, agrees. "We had police at our community meetings, but it wasn't quite the same, if they didn't live here. With a police officer and his family living here and parking his squad car in front of his house, it's made a big difference. It makes us neighbors feel more safe."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"There used to be a crack house a block away," says Columbia resident Brooks Dickerson. "Since a policeman moved in here, it's gone. The neighborhood's much quieter now." The program is improving neighborhoods in part because it transforms the attitudes of police patrolling those neighborhoods. "I used to just work the neighborhood," says Officer Charles Rowson. "Now I give it 150 percent more, because my family and I live here. I no longer leave it after my shift and figure it's someone else's problem." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"It makes you a better police officer if you live in the area you patrol," says Corporal Randy Blackwell. "I rode my patrol car around the area for several years, but didn't live there. Since I own a home in the neighborhood and know the people who live here, I have a totally different opinion of it and them. The city of Columbia is no longer just a place where I go to work. It's where I live. You take a different interest in it, if you live where you work."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Young police officers and their families like the loan program because the low-interest and no-money-down mortgages offer them a chance to own a home years earlier than they otherwise could afford. The home loans include generous rehabilitation funds for older, rundown homes. The buildings, once prime candidates for demolition, are remodeled into attractive like-new homes both inside and out, including brand-new kitchens and landscaping.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It wasn't difficult to persuade Columbia bankers to support the effort. "Every bank we approached responded by saying yes," Semon says. "They agreed to provide 50 percent of financing below market rates, and each volunteered to do at least one loan." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Public-private partnerships do work," says Wayne Lovelace, a vice president of First Citizens Bank of Columbia. "We get a good loan, we address a social need, and a responsible buyer gets a house they couldn't otherwise afford. We're glad to be part of the program." As a result of the program, Columbia's police department has won a prestigious "Innovations in Policing" award from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, based in Washington, D.C.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since Columbia began its program, other cities have begun similar projects. In Sarasota, Florida, a homeownership program aimed at stabilizing certain neighborhoods offers participants up to 100 percent of the financing of a low-interest loan with no down payment and a take-home police car. Chicago's city council last year approved a program to assist police officers who buy homes in low and moderate-income neighborhoods. Suburban Elgin, Illinois, has offered a similar program since 1992.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has designed its own version of the concept, in cooperation with the police department and the Police Foundation, a research group in Washington, D.C. The program offers low-interest, 30-year, fixed-rate loans with no down-payments to police officers who move into designated neighborhoods and carry out certain community-oriented policing activities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Dubbed the "3-2-1 Program," the financial incentives to officers depend on the crime rates of the neighborhood in which they choose to reside. In the more desirable Area 3, 3-percent mortgages are offered with a $300 application fee, three loan points, and no loan forgiveness. In Area 2, officers may receive 2-percent mortgages with a  $200 application fee, two loan points, and one year of loan forgiveness for every two years of residency. In the high-crime Area 1, participants in the program can get 1-percent mortgages with a $100 application fee, one loan point, and a year's forgiveness for each year of residency. Every officer is assigned a patrol car, which he must park in front of his home when off duty. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nineteen officers who chose to participate in the program confirm that it makes people in the community feel safer, deters crime, and involves officers more deeply in the community they have sworn to protect. New Jersey's legislature is now considering a statewide version of the program. "Cops and crime can't coexist in the same neighborhood," says James Kennedy, the executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In many departments and cities, attempts to require officers to reside in the city they serve have become extremely contentious. Homeownership incentives may achieve a similar result without coercion. "When police officers are integrated into the fabric of the community," says Hubert Williams, the president of the Police Foundation, "they will get information that they could never get if they lived on the outer boundaries. And information is the life blood of a police department. The residency requirement is not very effective right now. We simply need another approach, and police homeownership in high-risk or deteriorating neighborhoods is proving to be a successful solution."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Police should be part of a community," says Richard Semon, the director of Columbia's community-development department. "Police homeownership is not the entire solution, but it is one effort, one piece of the puzzle. We think it is a vital part of the solution of deterring crime and revitalizing our neighborhoods."<p><I>For more information about this program, contact <b>Richard Semon</b>, community development director, Community Services, City of Columbia, 1225 Laurel St., Columbia, S.C. 29217.

<P>
	In recent years, two tragic events have fundamentally changed the way many Americans view 
federal law-enforcement agencies and jeopardized public confidence in the federal government 
itself. In August 1992, U.S. marshals sought to arrest white separatist Randy Weaver at his 
remote mountain cabin in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. A confrontation resulted in the death of a federal 
marshal and Weaver's 14-year-old son. Special FBI teams were called in, and during the siege 
that followed, Weaver's wife was killed by an FBI sniper's bullet. At his subsequent trial, 
Weaver was acquitted of all but the most minor offenses.
<p>
	Since Ruby Ridge, federal law enforcement as a whole has come under intense congressional 
and media scrutiny. Even those normally supportive of the police ask: Should the federal 
government have risked this loss of life and expended $10 million to capture a hermit whose 
only alleged crime was selling two sawed-off shotguns to an undercover federal agent?
<p>
	In February 1993, a 51-day standoff first erupted when agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) tried to apprehend the leaders of the Branch Davidian cult at 
their compound in Waco, Texas, for the violation of federal gun laws. Four BATF agents lost 
their lives in the initial foray, and the subsequent siege ended in the deaths of 85 cult members, 
killed either by gunfire or by a suicidal fire that was ignited when FBI agents stormed the 
compound. Again, conflicting versions of events led to congressional hearings as well as public 
and media criticism. 
<p>
	Both these tragedies are the direct result of federal jurisdiction in crimes once considered 
wholly within the province of state and local police agencies. In neither incident did the 
underlying crime involve interstate activity or pose a threat to the federal government. Without 
the federalization of laws regulating firearms, a matter left to the states during most of our 
country's history, neither the BATF or FBI would have had jurisdiction at Ruby Ridge and 
Waco, and any law-enforcement actions would have been handled locally, if at all.
<p>
<b>3,000 Federal Crimes</b>
<p>
	"We federalize everything that walks, talks, and moves," said Senator Joe Biden, Democratic 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1986 to 1994. 
<p>
	Unfortunately, this is not much of an exaggeration: Today there are more than 3,000 federal 
crimes on the books. Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the reach of 
federal criminal jurisdiction. Federal crimes now range from serious but purely local crimes like 
carjacking and drug dealing to trivial crimes like disrupting a rodeo. President Clinton's 1994 
crime bill alone created two dozen new federal crimes. The bill federalized such crimes as drive-
by shootings, possession of a handgun near a school, possession of a handgun by a juvenile, 
embezzlement from an insurance company, theft of "major artwork," and murder of a state 
official assisting a federal law-enforcement agent. Although many of these crimes pose a real 
threat to public safety, they are already outlawed by the states and need not be duplicated in the 
federal criminal code.
<p>
	The federal judiciary, for its part, has imposed national standards on all state criminal 
proceedings. In cases like <i>Mapp v. Ohio</i> and <i>Miranda v. Arizona</i>, the Supreme 
Court overruled state law and forced every state to exclude evidence under certain conditions. 
This massive federalization of the rules of evidence greatly increased the rights of criminal 
defendants and further burdened law-enforcement agencies throughout the nation. In addition, 
the federal courts have virtually taken over such vital state functions as the operation of prisons 
and mental hospitals. By 1993, the federal courts operated 80 percent of all state prison systems 
in America. Amazingly, federal judges determine virtually every detail of these prisons, 
including standards for food and clothing, grievance procedures, and cell space per convict.

<P>
	The nationalization of criminal law has included the criminalization of environmental and 
regulatory laws. Historically, these statutes contained only civil penalties and were often handled 
in an administrative rather than judicial forum. Environmental statutes like the Clean Air Act and 
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, however, created an array of new federal crimes. 
Most of these federalized environmental offenses occur entirely within a state and bear no 
connection to the federal government. Worse yet, these statutes are often so vague and 
complicated that some "defendants" did not even realize that they had violated the law. Consider 
this: From our nation's founding until 1982, the federal government criminally prosecuted only 
25 environmental cases. Due to the recent trend toward federalization, the national government 
since 1982 has prosecuted and won more than 1,000 environmental cases. In 1993 alone, 135 
defendants were convicted and sentenced to prison for federal environmental crimes.
<P>
	The responsibility for the federalization of crime falls upon both political parties and all three 
branches of government. Although Democrats like Representative Charles Schumer and Senator 
Biden are among the most zealous advocates of the federalization of crime, Republicans must 
also share the blame. Two of the largest increases in federal criminal jurisdiction, the Controlled 
Substances Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of 1972, were products of the Nixon 
administration. In one fell swoop, Nixon's Controlled Substances Act gave the federal 
government jurisdiction over every drug crime in America, no matter how small or intrastate in 
scope. More recently, Republican senator Alfonse D'Amato proposed legislation that would have 
federalized virtually any crime committed in America if a gun was involved. To justify such a 
sweeping expansion of federal authority, D'Amato stated, "The national epidemic of gun-related 
homicides requires increased federal attention, expanded federal jurisdiction, and increased use 
of federal law-enforcement resources."
<P>
	Some of the usual defenders of constitutional limitations on the federal government seem to 
lose perspective when crime is the issue. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, one of the Senate's most 
influential conservatives, has also expressed support for the federalization of crime: "I sincerely 
believe that all of us in the federal government must do more to fight violent crime. The security 
of persons and property must be a priority of every level of government, including the federal 
government." Senator Phil Gramm, an articulate proponent of limited government, once 
proclaimed: "When you have violent predators, the public doesn't care whether the local police 
or the FBI apprehends them. They want something done." Such statements superficially address 
the public's concern over crime, but they ignore the profound constitutional and practical 
implications of this dangerous course, as well as the potential threat to individual liberty.	
<p>
	Clearly, a major cause of the federalization of criminal law is the desire of some members of 
Congress to appear tough on crime, though they know well that crime is fought most effectively 
at the local level. Others, however, offer more legitimate reasons for extending federal 
jurisdiction. They note that prosecuting defendants in federal court leads to longer prison terms, 
due to the federal sentencing guidelines enacted during the Reagan administration. Inmates 
convicted in federal court serve on average 85 percent of their sentences, while inmates 
convicted in state courts only serve about 40 percent of their terms.

<p>	Understandably, public officials who are tough on crime choose the most advantageous 
forum to keep criminals off the street. These longer federal sentences are one of the driving 
forces behind the federalization of crime. For example, the new federal "three strikes" law 
recently snared its first defendant. On August 14, 1995, Thomas Farmer was convicted of armed 
robbery and sentenced to life in prison plus five years. "If Farmer had been convicted in state 
court, he would have been eligible for parole in two-and-a-half years and would probably have 
served about eight years in prison," said U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Rapp. "But because of the 
crime bill, we were able to remove him from society for the rest of his life."
<p>
	Another claimed advantage to the federalization of crime is the availability of the death 
penalty. If a criminal is convicted of a federal capital offense, he can be sentenced to death even 
if the crime occurred in a state that does not allow capital punishment. One impetus for 
D'Amato's bill to authorize the federal death penalty for all murders committed with a firearm 
was New York governor Mario Cuomo's annual veto of a capital punishment bill. This federal 
legislation would have enabled proponents of capital punishment in the 13 states without it to 
circumvent the state political process by simply prosecuting the defendant in federal court.
<p>
	These arguments for a greater federal role in law enforcement, while initially attractive, on 
closer inspection fail to justify such a massive federal usurpation of the police power. If longer 
sentences and the availability of the death penalty are needed to preserve public safety, state 
governments are equally capable of enacting such measures to the extent their constituents so 
desire. Indeed, some states had already adopted "three strikes" laws for habitual offenders before 
this policy became federal law. In New York, voters in 1994 elected a new governor who favors 
the death penalty. 
<p>
<b>The Case Against Federalization</b>
<p>
	Perhaps the most compelling reason to oppose nationalizing crime is that it contradicts 
constitutional principles. The drafters of the Constitution clearly intended the states to bear 
responsibility for public safety. The Constitution gave Congress jurisdiction over only three 
crimes: treason, counterfeiting, and piracy on the high seas and offenses against the law of 
nations.
<p>
	As he wrote in <i>The Federalist</i> No. 45, James Madison envisioned little or no role for 
the federal government in law enforcement: 
<p><blockquote>
	"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and 
defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The 
former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign 
commerce. . . . The powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which, in 
the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and property of the people, and the 
internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the state."
</blockquote><p>
	Even Alexander Hamilton, the greatest proponent in his day of a strong federal government, 
saw law enforcement as a state and local concern. If Hamilton were alive today, he would be 
appalled at the use of the police power by federal agencies. To reassure the states that the federal 
government would not usurp state sovereignty, Hamilton wrote in <i>The Federalist</i> No. 17 
that law enforcement would be the responsibility of the states:
<p><blockquote>
	"There is one transcendent advantage belonging to the province of the state governments, 
which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light. I mean the ordinary 
administration of criminal and civil justice."
</blockquote><p>
	Unfortunately, the damage caused by the federalization of crime is not merely abstract or 
academic. The more crime that is federalized, the greater the potential for an oppressive and 
burdensome federal police state. As early as the 1930s, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover warned of 
the dangers of a "national police force." In fact, Hoover was so fearful of an expansive federal 
role in law enforcement that he resisted efforts by his allies in Congress to make the FBI 
independent of the Justice Department and to expand the bureau's jurisdiction over additional 
crimes. As an alternative to a federal police force, Hoover instead created the National Academy 
as an adjunct to the FBI's own training facilities, where local law-enforcement officers could be 
trained and then return to lead their own forces. This greatly enhanced the quality of law 
enforcement nationwide without creating the federal police force that Hoover so feared. 
<p>
	Modern state authorities share Hoover's fears. Charles Meeks, executive director of the 
National Sheriffs Association, argues that with every additional federal crime, "we're getting 
closer to a federal police state. That's what we fought against 200 years ago -- this massive 
federal government involved in the lives of people on the local level." And far from being 
appreciative of federal prosecutorial support, one of the leading opponents of the federalization 
of crime is the states' National District Attorneys Association. Not surprisingly, many Americans 
are beginning to share this fear of the federal government. In a recent poll, a large sample of 
citizens was asked to respond to the statement, "There may be a time in the near future when the 
government might limit my rights or threaten my beliefs to the point where I would feel the need 
to disobey the law to protect my constitutional rights." An astonishing 51 percent agreed that this 
situation was very likely or somewhat likely to occur.
<p>
	Federal law-enforcement authorities are not as attuned to the priorities and customs of local 
communities as state and local law enforcement. In the Ruby Ridge tragedy, for example, would 
the local Idaho authorities have tried to apprehend Weaver in such an aggressive fashion? Would 
they have spent $10 million on a relatively minor case, as did the federal agencies? More 
fundamentally, would Idaho officials have even cared about two sawed-off shotguns? In the 
Waco situation, would the local sheriff's department have stormed the compound, or instead 
have waited to arrest David Koresh when he ventured into town for supplies, as he did 
frequently?
<p>
	We do not mean to question the character or competency of federal agents, the vast majority 
of whom are honorable and dedicated public servants. But it is important to remember that both 
of these tragedies resulted in part from the federalization of state gun laws. If the regulation of 
firearms had remained with the states, where it was customarily handled, these tragedies might 
never have occurred.
<p>
	Stephen Saland, a New York State senator with a strong interest in law-enforcement issues, 
puts the argument succinctly: "Generally, crime is best fought at the local level, with local police 
who know the community, with local judges who reflect the standards of the community, and 
with local understanding of which crimes most need the focus and resources of the community."
<p>
	<b>Violates double jeopardy.</b> Another unfortunate consequence of the federalization of 
crime is the danger it poses to our constitutional protections against double jeopardy. 
Federalization of penal laws often creates concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over the same 
offenses. This concurrent jurisdiction grants prosecutors at both the state and federal levels the 
opportunity to prosecute the same case. Legally, the rules of double jeopardy generally do not 
apply when both state and federal courts are involved because these courts represent different 
levels of government. Nevertheless, the spirit of double jeopardy is violated when a defendant 
can be acquitted in state court and retried on essentially the same facts in federal court, or vice 
versa. 
<p>
	The best-known recent example of this was the case of the Los Angeles police officers 
accused of beating Rodney King; they were tried on federal charges after having been acquitted 
in state court. Reporters from the American Lawyer, a generally liberal magazine, concluded that 
the state-court verdict was not only reasonable but largely justified. Nevertheless, the federal 
government retried the acquitted officers on federal charges. In the second trial, what juror would 
not have been affected by the fear of additional riots and violence if they acquitted the officers? 
Would anyone argue this second trial was fair?
<p>
	<b>Incurs unnecessary expense.</b> Simply put, it is far more cost-effective to fight crime 
at the state and local level than at the federal level. Federal judges, prosecutors, and investigators 
often cost far more than their state and local counterparts. According to some reports, the annual 
total cost of each federal judgeship exceeds $1 million. Even more amazing, if they remain with 
their judge long enough federal law clerks can earn up to $100,000_more than many states' 
supreme court justices are paid. Similar disparities exist between federal and state prosecutors 
and investigators. So if D'Amato's bill (which attempted to federalize all gun crime) had passed, 
it would have cost the federal government an estimated $8 billion per year_far more than the 
costs of prosecuting these cases at the state level. (Perhaps the most humorous example of costly 
federal law enforcement is "McGruff," the Justice Department's cartoon crime dog. After 
spending $620,000 on the McGruff media campaign in 1993, the Justice Department spent 
another $300,000 for an extensive study that yielded no evidence that McGruff has reduced 
crime.)
<p>
	<b>Undermines state experimentation.</b> One of the worst consequences of the 
federalization of crime is a tendency toward national standardization and a corresponding 
reduction in state and local experimentation. States should be allowed to serve as "laboratories of 
democracy" and experiment with innovative approaches to the prevention and control of crime. 
Even the Great Centralizer Franklin Roosevelt once noted that when a state experiment fails, at 
least it has little effect on the rest of the nation. If one state wants to fight crime by building more 
prisons and another state wants to operate midnight basketball leagues, why not let them? As 
Abner Mikva, Clinton's former White House counsel has observed, some successful prison 
reforms originate with local government. Mikva recalled that in the 1960s, California governor 
Ronald Reagan provided county governments funding for each prisoner they handled locally and 
kept out of the state system. This experiment led to successful alternative programs like work 
release and halfway houses for those prisoners who could be safely controlled in this manner.
<p>
	<b>Shifts accountability.</b> With the possible exception of education, crime is the most 
important issue facing America on the state and local level. It is also the issue over which state 
and local officials exercise the most control. When federal elected officials promise to "crack 
down" on crime, they create the false public perception that crime is the responsibility of the 
federal government. This shifts accountability away from state and local officials who actually 
apprehend, prosecute, and imprison 95 percent of all criminals. The federalization of criminal 
law shields from scrutiny the state and local officials who are most responsible for fighting crime 
and the legislators who draft the laws and appropriate the funds to enforce public safety. 
<p>
	The federal law-enforcement apparatus is quite removed from the individual citizen and from 
local democratic control. Unlike their federal counterparts, who are appointed by the president, 
local sheriffs and district attorneys are directly elected by and must answer to local citizens. 
Similarly, city police are directly responsible to local mayors and city councils. If voters are 
dissatisfied with their sheriff, district attorney, or local police force, they can vote the appropriate 
officials out of office. However, the voters do not have this direct option with federal law-
enforcement officials.
<p>
<b>The Proper Federal Role</b>
<p>
	If any word describes the proper role of the federal government in law enforcement and 
criminal prosecution, it is "limited." There are, of course, certain areas of criminal jurisdiction 
that the federal government should be involved in. Two broad areas come to mind. One is crime 
directed against the sovereignty of the United States, including offenses such as counterfeiting, 
treason, violations of national security, and assaults on federal officers.
<p>
	A second area is crime involving a significant interstate or international enterprise. Obviously, 
these offenses are appropriately subject to federal involvement because they cannot be handled 
effectively by an individual state. However, a word of caution is needed here. The Supreme 
Court often views individual crimes as belonging to a "class of activities." Virtually any crime so 
viewed could be found to have some marginal interstate effect. This category, therefore, must be 
carefully defined to include only crimes that by their very nature are truly interstate in character. 
Nationally organized crime syndicates, cross-state drug cartels, transportation of stolen goods or 
kidnapped victims over state lines, and interstate flight to avoid prosecution are examples of 
appropriate federal jurisdiction. 

<p>
	Lastly, the federal government properly provides technical assistance on a nationwide scale, 
serving all law-enforcement agencies at every level of government. This includes a national 
clearinghouse for information and statistical data as well as a national repository for criminal 
histories and fingerprints.
<p>
	By contrast, crimes that are not directed against the national sovereignty, or do not have an 
interstate or international dimension, are not legitimate concerns of federal authorities, no matter 
how serious they may be. As Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has said: "Murder is not a 
federal crime. Murder of the president is. What has happened in recent years is people have come 
to think if it's a big problem, then it's a federal problem."
<p>	
While crime is a major problem affecting the entire nation, both constitutional tradition and 
practical experience demonstrate that it is most effectively fought at the state and local level. 
Federal law-enforcement officers face an enormous challenge just fulfilling their proper 
constitutional role to fight interstate and international crime and providing technical assistance to 
local police on a nationwide basis. 
<p>
	Ultimately, the responsibility for halting the creeping federalization of crime rests with the 
voters. Although the temptation is great, national politicians must be principled and resist the 
urge to make ordinary crime a federal issue. It is vital for responsible leaders at both the state and 
federal level to recognize the dangers and drawbacks of the federalization of crime and to 
educate the public about the proper roles of the state and federal government in law enforcement. 
Only then will citizens be able to hold the appropriate officials accountable for public safety. In 
short, our nation needs statesmen who will stand up and proclaim, "Let's not make a federal case 
out of this!"
<p>
<b>The List Goes On . . .</b>
<p>
	With the regularity of a timepiece, Washington responds to widespread concern about crime 
with election-year legislation. Undaunted by our constitutional separation of powers and other 
hindrances, Congress keeps adding to the list of federal crimes; the results are often duplicative 
and ineffective, and occasionally comic.
<p>
	The 1994 crime bill pushed by President Clinton was a prime example of this election-year 
syndrome. Here are some highlights:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Blockading an abortion clinic:</b> This law applies to every clinic in America; 
interstate travel or commerce is not required for the application of federal jurisdiction. Penalty: 
up to one year in prison for first offense.
<p>
<li><b>Theft of "major artwork":</b> Penalty: up to 10 years.
<p>
<li><b>Theft of firearms and explosives:</b> Obviously, theft is already outlawed in every 
state. This is another example of the massive federalization of gun laws. Penalty: up to 10 years.
<p>
<li><b>Possession of a handgun by a juvenile:</b> The bill made possession of a handgun by 
a juvenile a federal crime except where authorized by state law. Penalty: up to one year in prison 
or probation, depending on the background of the defendant.	
<p>
<li><b>Drive-by shootings:</b> Already illegal in every state. It applies to any drug-related 
shooting "into a group of two or more persons." No interstate circumstances required. Penalty: 
the death penalty is possible, if the shooting results in death.
<p>
<li><b>Killing a state or local official helping a federal law enforcement official:</b> 
Already illegal in every state. Penalty: up to the death penalty. 
</ul><p>
	Of course, Congress has a long, proud history of regulating minute aspects of our lives in the 
name of public safety. These federal laws are all on the books.
<ul>
<li><b>Mailing of injurious animals, plants, pests, and illegally taken fish and 
wildlife:</b> Penalty: up to one year.
<p>
<li><b>Damaging a livestock facility in excess of $10,000:</b> Penalty: up to one year for 
first offense. 
<p>
<li><b>Making false crop reports:</b> Penalty: up to five years.
<p>
<li><b>Issuing a check for less than $1:</b> Penalty: up to six months.
<p>
<li><b>Making false weather reports:</b> Penalty: up to 90 days.
<p>
<li><b>Interstate transport of unlicensed dentures:</b> Yes, it is a federal crime to transport 
artificial teeth into a state without the approval of a local licensed dentist. Penalty: up to one 
year.

<title>Government's Hidden Tax: Time to Account for the Cost of Regulation - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>GOVERNMENT'S HIDDEN TAX: TIME TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF REGULATION</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 459<br>
September 10, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Senate is expected soon to consider <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/z?cp104:hr660.104:">H.R. 3756</a>, the Treasury and postal appropriations bill, which includes funding for the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). On July 23, the Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment -- Section 645, offered by Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) -- requiring OMB to prepare an accounting statement that estimates the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB already is responsible for reviewing regulatory actions to ensure that they are consistent with the Administration's regulatory principles and agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While there is much debate about federal taxes, spending, and the need to balance the budget, considerably less is known and understood about the benefits and burdens of regulation. Unlike federal tax and spending programs, no comprehensive cost accounting system exists for regulation. But regulatory costs -- $677 billion in 1996 -- are nearly one-half the cost of direct taxation. And the economic impact is significant; according to one estimate, federal regulations cause $1.3 trillion in U.S. economic activity to be lost each year. Just as the annual federal budget allows policymakers and the public to debate and decide what programs to support and which ones to scale back and eliminate, information on regulatory costs and benefits would help them to determine what regulations do the most good for the money spent, set regulatory priorities accordingly, and minimize the burden on the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>A Good First Step.</b> Under the Stevens proposal, OMB would be required to submit to Congress by September 30, 1997, a report on the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB also must report on the effect of federal rules, both on the private sector and on the federal government, and provide estimates of the costs and benefits of rules costing more than $100 million annually. The public would have an opportunity to comment on the OMB report before it is submitted to Congress. OMB also would have to offer recommendations to Congress and the President about how to reform regulatory programs that are not a "sound use of national resources."  This is a sensible first step toward improving oversight and promoting greater efficiency throughout the federal regulatory system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This proposal will be criticized by federal regulators and politicians. Regulation is one of the most politically convenient ways to carry out public policy because it typically does not require substantial, direct taxation or government spending. This is particularly appealing in an era of federal budgetary restraint. The Clinton Administration has put at least 10,000 new pages of federal rules on the books since 1993. But how much has this cost, and what did the American people get for their money?  Because regulators gain power by regulating as much as possible, with little to stop them from regulating as if it cost nothing, opponents will use the same misleading rhetoric against this proposal that they used to defeat a far more comprehensive regulatory reform bill in 1995. The following three myths are typical:
<p>
<b>MYTH #1: It is doubtful that reliable estimates of costs and benefits can be developed.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> There is no dearth of methodological tools available for estimating the costs and benefits of federal regulations. The Department of Commerce regularly surveys business establishments to collect information on expenditures caused by particular regulatory programs. Since 1981, every President has required federal agencies to consider costs and benefits in their regulatory decisionmaking. To assist them, OMB developed guidelines for such analysis. Even though federal agencies try to avoid any effort to measure the costs and benefits of their actions, dozens of these analyses have been done over the last 15 years. Between 1990 and 1995, for example, EPA did at least 70 rule-specific cost-benefit analyses. Ironically, in 1993, the Clinton Administration removed hundreds of rules from OMB review, de-emphasizing the need for cost-benefit analysis.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #2: Any attempt to measure the costs and benefits of regulations will consume a significant amount of new resources.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> With more than 130,000 federal regulators spending more than $14 billion annually to develop and enforce regulations, how can more be needed?  The Clinton Administration itself recognizes that federal agencies -- which have been required to consider costs and benefits of regulatory actions since 1981 -- "are the repositories of significant substantive expertise and experience...."  In addition, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews rules before they are issued, has a fiscal 1996 budget of more than $5 million and a staff of about 30 analysts and economists with years of experience reviewing and evaluating agency cost-benefit analyses. During the Bush Administration, OMB reported on the aggregate costs of regulations in a publication that later was stopped by the Clinton Administration; no such information has been published since then.<sup>2</sup>  OMB already is in an excellent position to work with other agencies to prepare this statement, but Congress must demand that it be done and that it be made available to the public.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #3: This is just the first step in an effort to justify a "roll back" of important public health, safety, and environmental protections.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> The opposite would be true. Strengthening the use of cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decisionmaking would mean higher levels of protection. A recent Harvard study estimated that current regulation of health risks is so inefficient that for the same investment of resources, we could save an additional 636,000 years of life--60,200 premature deaths every year-- simply by changing our priorities.
<p></ul>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and its allies in Congress already are on record as supporting regulatory cost accounting as part of more comprehensive regulatory reform legislation in 1995. In addition, President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review requires federal agencies to "assess the costs and benefits" of regulations. The Stevens amendment simply suggests that the numbers should be added up so the American people can have some idea of the kinds of regulatory decisions their government is making and how good a job federal regulators are doing.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is a good first step, and Congress must go further and implement a regulatory budget like the one proposed in <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3277:">H.R. 3277</a> by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). A regulatory budget would force federal regulators to operate within limits, much as an agency's fiscal budget does. Both Congress and the President would be accountable to the public for making sure that economic resources are allocated in a manner that produces the greatest benefit to society.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1996 presidential campaign has rekindled the debate over tax reductions. Among the proposals being considered are an across-the-board reduction in tax rates, the repeal of rate increases imposed in 1990 and 1993, the deductibility of payroll taxes, and a modified flat tax. But regardless of the particular features of each change under consideration, the argument is the same. Proponents argue that lower tax rates will spur economic growth by reducing the penalty on working, saving, and investing. Opponents disagree, claiming that the economy is doing fine and that tax rate reductions, if enacted, will help the rich disproportionately while widening the deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Fortunately, there is a way to judge the desirability of lower tax rates. The United States has had three major episodes of tax rate reductions -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. By looking at how the economy performed during these periods, and by examining what happened to the deficit and the degree to which different income classes were affected, it is possible to gain useful evidence about the desirability of tax rate reductions today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The evidence provides strong support for those who believe the economy is weak and favor reductions in tax rates. Recent history is especially compelling. Tax rate increases in 1990 and 1993 boosted the top rate to 39.6 percent (and over 42 percent including the Medicare payroll tax). This means a 50 percent increase in the tax burden on work, saving, investment, and entrepreneurship when compared with the 28 percent rate in effect when Ronald Reagan left office. The effect has been dismal:
<p><ul>
<li> During the post-Reagan era, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.
<p>
<li> Real median family income, the best measure of living standards for the average American, has fallen by more than $2,000 since Reagan left office.
<p>
<li> Assuming there is no change in policy, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth for the next ten years will average less than 2.1 percent annually.<sup>1</sup>  This is well below the post-World War II average of 3.2 percent.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy's sub-standard performance in recent years should come as no surprise. As seen below, major changes in tax policy inevitably affect growth.
<p><ul>
<li>Across-the-board tax rate reductions in the 1920s reduced the top rate from 71 percent to 24 percent. The economy boomed, growing by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929.
<p>
<li> In 1930, Herbert Hoover raised tax rates from 25 percent to a maximum of 63 percent, and Franklin Roosevelt boosted them to 79 percent later in the decade. The 1930s, to put it mildly, are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<li> Across-the-board tax rate reductions introduced by President John F. Kennedy reduced the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. These lower rates, along with substantially lower taxes on savings and investment, are associated with the longest economic expansion in American history.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<li> The Johnson surtax, enacted in 1968 during the administration of President Lyndon Johnson, combined with the inflation-induced bracket creep of the 1970s (subjecting taxpayers to higher rates even though their real incomes had not changed), resulted in a decade of stagflation.
<p>
<li> Reagan's across-the-board tax cuts ushered in America's longest peacetime expansion, helping to create 20 million new jobs and pushing incomes and living standards to record highs.
<p>
<li> The tax rate increases imposed under George Bush and Bill Clinton, as outlined below, are associated with the slowest growing economy in 50 years and a decline of more than $2,000 in the average family's income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If legislators want to unleash stronger growth and more prosperity, the best tax policy would be the flat tax. Under that proposal, all three major problems of the current tax code -- high rates, anti-capital bias, and complexity -- would be minimized. To the extent that politicians are reluctant to adopt a flat tax, however, any change that moved in the right direction would be helpful. If history is any guide, any tax rate reduction, whether a 15 percent across-the-board cut, a repeal of the Bush and Clinton tax hikes, or some other reform, would boost the economy and raise living standards.
<p>
<b>LOOKING AT CASE HISTORIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The effect of tax rates on economic activity should not be overstated. The economy, after all, can be affected significantly by trade policy, regulatory policy, monetary policy, and many other government actions. Even within the context of fiscal policy, tax rates are not the only critical issue. Both the level of government spending and where that money goes are very important. And even when looking only at tax policy, tax rates are just one piece of the puzzle. If certain types of income are subject to multiple layers of tax, as occurs in the current system, that problem cannot be solved by low rates. Similarly, a tax system with needless levels of complexity will impose heavy costs on the productive sector of the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Keeping all these caveats in mind, there nonetheless is a distinct pattern throughout American history: Simply stated, when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Conversely, periods of higher tax rates are associated with subpar economic performance and stagnant tax revenues.
<P>
<b>The 1920s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon during the Administrations of Presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, tax rates were slashed from the confiscatory levels they had reached in World War I. The Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926 reduced the top rate from 73 percent to 25 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Spurred in part by lower tax rates, the economy expanded dramatically. In real terms, the economy grew 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, and annual economic growth averaged more than 6 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Notwithstanding (or perhaps because of) the dramatic reduction in tax rates, personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of no inflation).<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The share of the tax burden borne by the rich rose dramatically. As seen in <a href="bg1086c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, taxes paid by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent of the total tax burden in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This surge in revenue was no surprise to Mellon:
<p><blockquote>
	The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people.<sup>5</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1960s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Kennedy proposed a series of tax rate reductions in 1963 that resulted in legislation the following year dropping the top rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Kennedy tax cuts helped trigger the longest economic expansion in America's history. Between 1961 and 1968, the inflation-adjusted economy expanded by more than 42 percent. On a yearly basis, economic growth averaged more than 5 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Tax revenues grew strongly, rising by 62 percent between 1961 and 1968. Adjusted for inflation, they rose by one-third.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to President Kennedy:
<p><blockquote>
	Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Surely the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions and any new recession would break all deficit records. In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now.<sup>8</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1980s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation which together reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economic effects of the Reagan tax cuts were dramatic. When Reagan took office in 1981, the economy was being choked by high inflation and was in the middle of a double-dip recession (1980 and 1982). The tax cuts helped pull the economy out of the doldrums and ushered in the longest period of peacetime economic growth in America's history. During the seven-year Reagan boom, economic growth averaged almost 4 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Critics charge that the tax cuts caused higher deficits, but they misread the evidence. The Reagan tax cut, though approved in 1981, was phased in over several years. As a result, bracket creep (indexing was not implemented until 1985) and payroll tax increases completely swamped Reagan's 1.25 percent tax cut in 1981 and effectively canceled out the portion of the tax cut which went into effect in 1982. The economy received an unambiguous tax cut only as of January 1983. Thereafter, personal income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to conventional wisdom, it was the "rich" who paid the additional taxes. The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the chief architects of the Reagan tax cuts was then-U.S. Representative <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a> (R-NY). According to Kemp:
<p><blockquote>
	At some point, additional taxes so discourage the activity being taxed, such as working or investing, that they yield less revenue rather than more. There are, after all, two rates that yield the same amount of revenue: high tax rates on low production, or low rates on high production.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>THE LESSONS
<p>
1) Lower tax rates do not mean less tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> Personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, despite the reduction in rates. Revenues rose from $719 million in 1921 to $1164 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of virtually no inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Tax revenues climbed from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, an increase of 62 percent (33 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> Total tax revenues climbed by 99.4 percent during the 1980s, and the results are even more impressive when looking at what happened to personal income tax revenues. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
<b>2) The rich pay more when incentives to hide income are reduced.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> The share of the tax burden paid by the rich rose dramatically as tax rates were reduced. The share of the tax burden borne by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Just as happened in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased following the tax cuts. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>13</sup>

<p>

<b>THE 1990S: IGNORING THE LESSONS OF THE PAST</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike reductions in tax rates, increases in tax rates have a history of failure. The Hoover and Roosevelt tax increases of the 1930s certainly contributed to the dismal economy during the Great Depression. Tax revenues fell during much of the period, and the deficit increased. And as <a href="bg1086c11.gif">Chart 11</a> shows, the high tax rates of the 1950s resulted in sluggish revenue growth. Ignoring history, both Democrats and Republicans at the time argued that tax rates reaching over 90 percent could not be cut for fear of revenue loss. Moreover, the 1970s, which began with the Johnson surtax and later were hit by bracket creep, triggered the tax revolt and the Reagan tax cuts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps more than any other decade, however, the 1990s make the best argument against higher tax rates. In both 1990 and 1993, the economy was subjected to record tax increases, the ostensible purpose of which was to raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. As <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a> illustrates, however, these increases backfired. Total tax revenue, as a percent of economic output, is expected to be lower this year than it was when Reagan left office.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, the modest decline in revenues relative to gross domestic product (GDP) is due to the slower growth in personal income tax revenues. As shown in <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a>, individual income tax revenues totaled 8.6 percent of economic output in 1989. By 1996 -- two large tax increases later -- individual income tax revenues had fallen to 8.5 percent of economic output. In other words, the tax that was increased the most accounts for the drop in tax revenue as a share of national output.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
High tax rates are bad for the economy. High tax rates that increase the deficit by reducing the growth of tax revenue are even worse. What makes recent history especially tragic is that the economic and budgetary losses could have been avoided if Bush and Clinton had simply kept Reagan's policies in place. In 1989, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the budget deficit, which then was $152 billion, would continue to fall for the next five years assuming no change in Reagan's policies. As of 1995 -- again, two large tax increases later -- the budget deficit had risen to $164 billion, and it is projected by the CBO to reach more than $400 billion by 2006 if Clinton's policies are left in place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dismal budget numbers, however, tell only part of the story. The economy has been the real victim of higher tax rates. As <a href="bg1086c13.gif">Chart 13</a> shows, the post-Reagan era has seen the slowest growth of any seven-year period since the end of World War II. As discussed earlier, this slow growth has left people with more than $2,000 less income when inflation is taken into account. The biggest losers have been the poor. As Chart 14 illustrates, income for the bottom 20 percent has fallen the most during the Bush/Clinton era. The politicians who imposed the higher taxes, needless to say, argued that the rich would be the ones to suffer.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy is limping, incomes have been falling, tax revenues are stagnant, and it is projected that the deficit will more than double in the next ten years. This is the legacy of higher tax rates and a tax code that punishes working, saving, and investing. History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates. Legislation to reduce rates would do this. Better still, Congress should scrap the current system as quickly as possible and replace it with a flat tax that treats all taxpayers equally and minimizes the burden on productive behavior.

<a href="fyi102t3.gif">Table 3</a>: Direct and Indirect Costs Can Consume Half the Cost of Employing a Worker 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Average American workers have become frustrated that their take-home pay seems to buy less and less. Some policymakers say this is because corporations are not passing on to workers the real value of their labor. Focusing on the low-paid, some lawmakers say take-home pay needs to be increased by raising the minimum wage, even though this would destroy thousands of job opportunities.<sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The problem with this view is that it overlooks the huge gap between what employers pay out to hire and maintain a worker and the amount of money that actually reaches the worker in the form of a paycheck that can be cashed. Most American workers have little understanding of just how much disappears from their earnings before the money reaches their pockets. They usually are aware only of the taxes taken directly from their paychecks. What they do not see is the additional cost of government taxes, mandates, and regulations that employers also must bear and that, in practice, comes out of a worker's compensation.<sup>2</sup>  Over the past 20 years, these additional costs have taken an ever-increasing bite out of personal income, creating a larger and larger "wedge" between the cost of hiring a worker and what that worker receives as take-home pay.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How do government taxes, mandates, and regulations increase the cost of hiring employees and reduce the take-home pay of workers?
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, it cost all employers in private industry an average of $17.10 per hour to hire and keep workers on their payrolls.<sup>3</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes, and optional benefits is deducted, workers took home an average of $9.84 per hour, 42 percent less than the total direct expense of employing them. The total tax wedge (government-mandated benefit costs plus taxes) cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation.<sup>4</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire a minimum wage worker.<sup>5</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03) is deducted and the Earned Income Tax Credit is added, however, an average minimum wage worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total expense of employing that worker and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These figures do not include the hidden cost of federal regulations. One study estimates the regulatory burden per employee, on average, to be in the range of $3,000 to $4,000. This equals somewhere from $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for a full-time worker.<sup>6</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Government must share the blame for reductions in the take-home pay of American workers. Over the years, it has forced employers to shift more of their employees' "pay" to mandated employee benefits, thereby making the hiring of workers more and more expensive. Employers, as well as employees, operate within a competitive labor market in which wage rates broadly reflect the productivity of workers -- <I>less</I> the costs of taxes, mandated benefits, and regulations associated with employing a worker. The more productive a worker is, the more that worker will be paid. The smaller the government tax and mandate wedge is, the more cash workers will be able to take home.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The solution to this problem is not more government mandates, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, government should pursue policies that directly reduce the wedge between compensation and take-home pay. Such policies also would promote economic growth and thereby increase productivity, job opportunities, and real earnings. Specifically, Congress should cut payroll and income taxes, reduce the regulatory burden on business, cut the capital gains tax, and improve basic education through school choice.
<p>
<b>THE DIRECT COST OF GOVERNMENT TAXES AND MANDATED BENEFITS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The hourly wage that employers pay is not what workers take home; nor is it the total cost of labor borne by businesses. When calculating the hourly cash wage rate that a business will pay workers, the employer also must take into account the legal obligation to pay Social Security/Medicare taxes, federal and state unemployment insurance taxes, and workers' compensation taxes.<sup>7</sup>  These costs reduce the amount the employer otherwise would be prepared to pay, based on the productivity of the worker. But from the wages and salaries employees receive initially in their paychecks, workers must pay their share of Social Security/Medicare taxes, as well as federal and state income taxes. The difference between this cost of labor to employers (cash wages plus mandated taxes and benefits) and the take-home pay of workers (cash wages minus payroll and income taxes), is the tax wedge (see <a href="fyi102c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). In 1995, the tax wedge averaged $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of an average worker's total hourly compensation (see <a href="fyi102t1.gif">Table 1</a>).<sup>8</sup> 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Legally mandated benefits, such as unemployment insurance and workers' compensation, are not "free" to the worker, as many employees assume. A range of studies indicates that, on average, some 88 percent of the cost of all employer-paid government-mandated benefit taxes is shifted to workers in the form of reduced cash compensation.<sup>9</sup>
<p><ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<li><b>In 1995, it cost all private industry employers an average of $17.10 per employee per hour to hire and keep workers on their payrolls.</b><sup>10</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes, and optional benefits is deducted, workers took home an average of $9.84 per hour, or 42 percent less than the total expense of employing them. The total tax wedge cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation.<sup>11</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<li><b>In 1995, it cost manufacturing industry employers an average of $20.47 per employee per hour to hire and keep workers on their payrolls.</b><sup>12</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes, and optional benefits is deducted, workers took home an average of $10.93 per hour, or 47 percent less than the total expense of employing them. The total tax wedge cost workers an average of $4.65 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<li><b>In 1995, it cost service industry employers an average of $15.88 per employee per hour to hire and keep workers on their payrolls.</b><sup>14</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes, and optional benefits is deducted, workers took home an average of $9.46 per hour, or 40 percent less than the total expense of employing them. The total tax wedge cost workers an average of $3.64 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation.<sup>15</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<li><b>In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire a minimum wage worker.</b><sup>16</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03) is deducted, however, an average minimum wage worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total expense of employing that worker and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the years, proliferating mandates and rising taxes have increased the cost of hiring workers. By 1994, the cost of government-mandated benefits accounted for 8.9 percent of total employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and just 3.5 percent in 1951.<sup>17</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Government taxes and fees have been taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income (<a href="fyi102c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Although real personal income per person increased 121 percent from 1959 to 1995, government taxes and fees paid per person increased 155 percent in real terms over the same period.<sup>18</sup>  In 1994, federal, state, and local governments took an average of $2,800 (in 1992 dollars) from every person.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, in recent years there has been a significant increase in mandated benefits (<a href="fyi102t2.gif">Table 2</a>), and these costs are likely to become larger in the future. For example:
<ul>
<li>If Congress proceeds with a proposed 90 cent increase in the minimum wage, it will cost consumers and workers about $2.2 billion per year as the cost of entry-level jobs is passed on through higher prices and lower real wages. It also will cause employers to create over 200,000 fewer entry-level jobs each year until 1999.<sup>19</sup>
<P>
<li>The Medicare program is on the brink of insolvency. To put it on a sound financial basis without reforming and improving the way the program operates could mean as much as a 3.52 percentage point increase on top of the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. This means workers earning $45,000 per year would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $1,584 per year.
</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly understand how government excess, rather than corporate greed, consumes their take-home pay.
<p>
<b>THE HIDDEN COSTS OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taxes and mandated benefits are not the only government policies that drive a wedge between the cost of hiring an employee and that employee's take-home pay. Regulations also increase the cost of employing workers. For example, environmental and workplace safety regulations impose costs that take the form of such things as compliance expenditures (e.g., equipment purchases, worker training); time lost due to paperwork requirements; delays in the processing and issuance of permits required by the government; and attorneys fees incurred in regulation-related litigation. For the smallest businesses, the costs of tax compliance (paying professionals to decipher the tax code, filling out forms, maintaining the appropriate records) and payroll recordkeeping are the largest components of the regulatory burden.<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Regulation imposes the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze. According to recent studies by Professor Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology:
<p><ul>
<li>For the average firm with fewer than 20 employees, the regulatory cost per employee is estimated to be about $5,500. For the largest firms (those with more than 500 employees), the cost is about $3,000 per employee.<sup>21</sup>  Unfortunately, Congress has responded to the disproportionate burden on small business by exempting different sizes of companies from different regulatory statutes. The effect of this approach has been to discourage companies near an established threshold from hiring new employees.<sup>22</sup>
<P>
<li>The business regulatory burden also varies considerably by industry. For example, the average cost of regulation per employee in the manufacturing industry, where regulatory costs are the highest, is in the range of $5,000 to $7,000. For the service industry, where regulatory costs are the lowest, it is in the range of $2,000 to $3,000. As <a href="fyi102t3.gif">Table 3</a> shows, these average costs are equal to a range of approximately $1.00 to $3.00 per hour per worker.<sup>23</sup>
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As Professor Hopkins notes, estimating the precise cost of federal regulations to business and workers is extremely difficult. These cost estimates are intended to offer only an illustrative profile of the cost of the regulatory system. While these estimates do not factor in the benefits of particular regulations, understanding the cost impact is important for policymakers, particularly in light of the already significant costs to employers of taxes and mandated benefits.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although regulation imposes costs on businesses, ultimately they are passed on to individual Americans, often through lower wages (see <a href="fyi102c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).<sup>24</sup>  Moreover, mandated requirements, such as family and medical leave, directly affect an employer's decisions about whether and when to hire a worker, which worker to hire, how much cash to pay the worker, and how long to keep that worker. The rise in mandated labor costs paid by employers is one of the most important forces leading companies to lay off workers, as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor.<sup>25</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A recent study by Richard Vedder for the Center for the Study of American Business shows that in addition to the costs of complying with regulation, there are longer-run costs in the form of reduced productivity. Vedder explains that when a business must devote resources to implementing regulatory mandates, those resources are used in a less efficient manner because firms are forced to use more costly and less productive methods of production.<sup>26</sup>  This significant "drag" on productivity denies workers higher wages and a higher standard of living.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other studies support similar conclusions. One 1987 study by economist Wayne Gray examined the effects of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations on 450 manufacturing industries and concluded that these regulations explained more than 30 percent of the slowdown in productivity from the 1960s to the 1973-1978 period.<sup>27</sup>  A 1995 study by the Employment Policy Foundation found that 19 percent of the productivity slowdown during the 1970s is directly attributable to regulations published by OSHA28 and that nearly half of the slowdown in long-run productivity growth can be explained by rising government regulatory activity.<sup>29</sup>Further, since productivity and workers' pay and benefits rise together, government regulations are directly responsible for some part of the slowdown in wage growth and take-home pay (<a href="fyi102c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).
<p>
<b>RAISING TAKE-HOME PAY</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress and the Administration should focus on policies that will increase wages and job opportunities for Americans by improving labor productivity and reducing the cost of employing workers. Specifically, Congress and the Administration should:
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Cut payroll taxes.</b> Taxes and government-mandated benefits cost the average worker over 21 percent of total compensation -- 13.8 percent for minimum wage workers. The solution is not more mandates -- for example, a higher minimum wage. Cutting payroll taxes, however, would directly increase take-home pay.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Cut the capital gains tax.</b> The U.S. tax code punishes capital investment by taxing investment income more than once.<sup>30</sup>  It taxes corporate and individual income from investment, and then taxes capital a third time by taxing capital gains. Lowering the capital gains tax would increase investment in the U.S. and provide an incentive for both American and foreign firms to put their capital to work here with American workers. A capital gains tax cut also would make more venture capital available for emerging technologies and for research and development that would improve future productivity.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Enact significant regulatory reform.</b> The explosion of new regulations since 1988 has raised the cost of labor and capital, created barriers to the formation of new companies and jobs, and raised the cost of employing Americans. This higher cost of employment in turn means that in a competitive economy, the return to labor in the form of wages is reduced. The regulatory burden needs to be rolled back, not only to allow wages to rise, but also to decrease the cost of hiring workers. To do this, Congress should strengthen White House oversight of executive branch agencies; establish in statute a set of principles, including cost-benefit analysis, to guide regulatory decisionmaking; establish a regulatory budget; and require federal agencies to review existing regulations to ensure that they meet sound regulatory principles.<sup>31</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Increase the skills of the workforce.</b> What is needed is fundamental change aimed at improving basic education through school choice, strengthening core curricula, and enabling local educators to improve discipline and set high expectations. Congress also should consider tax-deferred or tax-free education savings accounts similar to individual retirement accounts, or enabling states and individuals to use lump-sum unemployment insurance benefits for education and training.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Politicians who blame "corporate greed" for what is happening to the take-home pay of American workers are diverting attention from the real problem: an overly intrusive and expensive federal government. Over the years, more and more mandates, higher and higher taxes, and excessive regulation have slowed the growth of the economy and created a larger and larger wedge between the cost of hiring employees and workers' take-home pay. If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly realize the significant costs government imposes and the effects on their take-home pay.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The solution to these problems is not more government mandates and programs, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems -- high payroll and income taxes, and excessive regulation. Removing these obstacles will increase productivity, job opportunities, and real wage growth for all Americans.

<li>    Mackinac Center for Public Policy, "The Right to Know Payroll Form," April 1996. Workers can determine the amount of Social Security and Medicare taxes they pay, as well as their federal and state income taxes, simply by looking at their pay stubs. Employers, however, usually do not report to workers the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes paid on behalf of their workers.<p>
<li>    Bureau of Labor Statistics, Internet site <a href="ftp://stats.bls.gov/pub/news.release/ecec.txt"> ftp://stats.bls.gov/pub/news.release/ecec.txt</a>, or "Employer Costs for Employee Compensation, March 1995," June 22, 1995. The sum of cash wages plus the cost of all employer-paid benefits (government-mandated and optional) and payroll taxes equals total compensation, or the total direct expense to the employer. Employer costs associated with recruitment, screening, and initial training of employees are not included. Also not included are the indirect costs of complying with federal regulations.<p>
<li>    The cost of the tax wedge to workers excludes the cost of optional employer-provided benefits (see Chart 1 for a complete description). Further, taking into account that 88 percent of the cost of all legally required benefits typically is shifted to workers in the form of reduced cash pay (see footnote 9), as well as the fact that some workers receive Social Security benefits, the net cost of the tax wedge for workers is between $3.81 and $3.69 per hour, or at least 21.6 percent of a worker's total compensation.<p>
<li>    Heritage Foundation calculation of hourly cash wages plus the cost of government-mandated benefits. Although some employers provide optional benefits to minimum wage workers, accurate cost estimates for minimum wage workers are not available.<p>
<li>    This calculation assumes a full-time employee works 2,080 hours per year. See Thomas D. Hopkins, "Profiles of Regulatory Costs," report to the U.S. Small Business Administration, November 1995, Tables A-6 and B-6.<p>
<li>    Total compensation is the sum of an employee's cash pay plus the cost of all employer-paid benefits (government-mandated and optional) and payroll taxes. Total compensation is the same as the total direct cost of labor for the employer.<p>
<li>    Heritage Foundation calculation based in part on Bureau of Labor Statistics, "Employer Costs for Employee Compensation" data. Optional employer-provided benefits that account for another $3.26 per hour, or 19 percent of total compensation, are not included in the tax wedge but also increase the cost of labor.<p>
<li>    The 88 percent figure is based on such analyses as Jonathan Gruber and Alan B. Krueger, "The Incidence of Mandated Employer-Provided Insurance: Lessons from Workers Compensation Insurance," <I>Tax Policy and Economy</I> (1991); Jonathan Gruber, "The Incidence of Mandated Maternity Benefits," <I>American Economic Review</I>, Vol. 84 (June 1994), pp. 622-641; and Lawrence H.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy currently exhibits relatively low levels of inflation, interest rates, and unemployment. Yet millions of workers remain anxious about their economic security. The relatively good economic news, combined with the widespread dissatisfaction among Americans with the nation's economic performance, seems to be a paradox. But an analysis of underlying policies and economic trends suggests an answer to this puzzle.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)<sup>1</sup> -- a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many <I>Fortune</I> 500 companies -- economists at The Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession.<sup>2</sup>  The results of this analysis shed light on why Americans are so anxious about the economy's performance. According to the Heritage analysis, the 1993 tax hike, championed by the Clinton White House, did indeed produce what some critics have referred to as a "Clinton Crunch" -- a larger tax bite for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy performing well below its potential.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that, compared with how the economy would have performed without the 1993 tax legislation, Clinton's 1993 tax and budget plan will have:
<img src="bg1078t1.gif" width=408 height=459 border=0 alt="Table 1" align=right><ul><P>
<li><b>Cost the economy $208 billion in output</b> from 1993 through 1996,<sup>4</sup> in today's dollars.<sup>5</sup>  This lost output is equal to nearly $2,100 for every household in America. Last year, without the 1993 economic package, gross domestic product (GDP) would have grown $66 billion more than it actually did absent the change.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the number of private jobs created by 1.2 million</b> between 1993 and the end of 1996. Including the forecast for 1997, the total employment cost of the 1993 tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million lost job opportunities.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Delivered only 49 percent of the new revenues predicted</b> by the Congressional Budget Office from the increase in personal and corporate tax rates between FY 1994 and FY 1996. When compared with the 1.2 million lost jobs, the tax hike has depressed potential employment growth by 17,600 jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
<p>
<li><b>Cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of potential employee wages and salaries</b> between 1993 and 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the growth in real personal disposable income</b> of Americans by $264 billion in today's dollars between 1993 and 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the potential sale of automobiles by 773,700 and light trucks by 504,000</b> between 1993 and 1996. Some 1.1 million of the nearly 1.3 million <a href="bg1078c5.gif">lost vehicle sales</a> would have been produced domestically. In 1996, Heritage calculates that this loss in auto and truck sales will cost a projected 60,100 jobs across all industries.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the value of business investment in durable goods by $42.5 billion</b> in today's dollars; $15.4 billion of this is lost investment in computers.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some proponents may argue that even if the economy is not performing up to its potential today, this slow growth period is necessary to reduce federal deficit spending which, in turn, will promote greater future growth. Yet many respected economists maintain that this will not be the case with the 1993 tax increase and budget deal: Increased taxes (and particularly increased marginal tax rates) will permanently decrease economic activity below its potential.<sup>7</sup>  Similarly, the Heritage analysis, using the WUMM economic model and forecasts of future economic activity, supports this theory. According to the Heritage analysis, nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically:
<ul><P>
<li><b>Gross domestic product is projected to be lower in each year.</b> In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li><b>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year.</b> In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><P>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. President Clinton's 1993 economic plan turns out to have deprived Americans of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth potential, leading to a slower rise in employee compensation, household income, industrial output, and most other measures of a prosperous economy. 
<p>
<b>HOW IS THE ECONOMY REALLY PERFORMING?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a flow of quite good economic news in recent months, many Americans feel anxious about their economic security, complaining of stagnating family incomes, less money in their paychecks after taxes, and a belief that the economy is performing below its full potential. They simply do not accept that the economy is, as the President claims, the "healthiest it has been in 30 years." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the latest <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, the White House maintains that the general health of the economy is good and credits the creation of 8 million new jobs to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93), which, the report says, "set the stage for this economic expansion and resurgence, by enacting historic deficit reduction while continuing to invest in technology and education."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX) cites OBRA-93, which enacted the largest tax increase in history, as the culprit for the anxiety Americans are now feeling. Calling this condition the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/lect556.html">"Clinton Crunch,"</a><sup>9</sup> Armey claims workers are experiencing the dual effect of an actual decline in real wages and higher taxes. With fewer of their own dollars in their pockets to meet the needs of their families, he says, workers understandably have a heightened sensitivity to changing economic conditions, corporate layoffs, and downsizing.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Who is right?  Is the economy performing up to its potential, as claimed by the White House?  Or are Americans suffering from the "Clinton Crunch," as claimed by Armey?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans have good reason to be confused about the direction in which the nation's economy is headed. On the one hand, there is good news in statistics showing continued economic growth, relatively low unemployment, and record highs in the stock market. And as the Clinton Administration points out, the economy has created nearly 8 million jobs over the past three years, 93 percent of them in the private sector. Clinton also claims credit for reducing the federal budget deficit for three consecutive years: According to the <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, passage of the 1993 economic plan "put the country solidly on the road to fiscal responsibility."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for Americans in recent years. For example, existing studies and government data indicate: 
<p><ul>
<li> Since 1992, real median family income has stagnated even though more adult women are working than ever before.<sup>11</sup>  Since September 1993, both real average hourly earnings and real average weekly earnings have stagnated.<sup>12</sup>
<P>
<li>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.<sup>13</sup>  Over the same period, real hourly compensation (which includes benefits as well as wages) has not increased significantly.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
<li>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs in the twelve months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet. In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.<sup>17</sup>   The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<li>
From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.<sup>19</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>THE ECONOMY IS LAGGING BEHIND PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, while the economy is no longer in a recession, and indeed is experiencing modest growth, many Americans are still having trouble making ends meet and corporate layoffs have many workers thinking twice about the security of their jobs. But is this just part of a typical business cycle?  Experience suggests "no."  Although total employment has increased in recent years, the current economic expansion -- which began in March 1991 and is now some 59 months long -- is not progressing as well as it should when compared with the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months. These expansions occurred from February 1961 to December 1969, from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to July 1990.<sup>20</sup>  The failure of this economy to perform as well as similar expansions gives a clue as to why many Americans are concerned about their economic future.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is interesting to compare this expansion with the average of these previous expansions. To be sure, the patterns of each expansion do differ, so data for each expansion are provided in <a href="bg1078t2.gif">Table 2</a>, as well as the average. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the current expansion:
<ul><p>
<li>The gross domestic product has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries. Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><a href="bg1078t2.gif">Total employment</a> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>The number of unemployed Americans has declined by less than half the number during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>Real median family income has <I>declined</I> by a total of 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
<li>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an <I>increase</I> of 3.1 percent during the 1982 to 1986 expansion.<sup>22</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, despite the Administration's cheerful outlook, the economy is not performing well when compared with similar points during the three previous expansions of similar lengths. The question is "why?"  Would the economy have been performing less well today without OBRA-93, as the Clinton Administration claims, or did the tax increase slow down an economy in recovery and put many workers into a wage and job squeeze, as critics claim?
<p>
<b>THE 1993 BUDGET DEAL</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all economists agree that Washington can alter the course of the economy to some degree through its tax and spending decisions. This influence is particularly evident when Congress and the President enact tax and spending policies that affect income from work or investment. For example, Washington can reduce employment and workers' take-home pay by increasing tax rates on wages and salaries. Higher rates take money directly out of workers' pockets and make work less attractive. Conversely, lower tax rates increase the incentives for men and women to work, start new businesses, or invest in training and equipment for workers. In short, tax rate changes either lower or raise the cost of labor, depending on the direction of the rate movement. Commonly, lowering labor costs leads to a higher demand for labor. When combined with lower capital costs stemming from lower taxes on capital, greater levels of economic activity are attained.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When Congress and the President adopt policies that alter economic life in some significant fashion, there will be a difference between how the economy then performs and how it would have performed had policy not been changed. These differences between actual and potential performance can be estimated statistically using models of the U.S. economy that capture the economic impact of policy changes. Generally speaking, these models allow analysts to "simulate" the impact of tax and spending decisions that could have been made -- or not made -- by Congress and the President, and then compare the simulation with what actually occurred. This is what the Congressional Budget Office routinely does when Congress is considering tax and spending legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been two major tax and spending plans enacted in recent years. These were in 1990 and 1993. American taxpayers were told that large tax increases in each of these plans would lead to a significant reduction in federal deficits and spur long-term economic growth. In this study, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to investigate the effects of the 1993 budget deal. There were two reasons for the decision to focus on the 1993 agreement: First, by 1993, the economy was largely in recovery from the 1990-1991 recession, so the impact on the expansion of the 1993 plan could be isolated more easily. And, second, focusing on the 1993 economic plan allowed analysts to test the Clinton thesis that the plan has produced "the healthiest economy in three decades."<sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1993 budget plan (OBRA-93) raised taxes $241 billion over five years and called for $77 billion in entitlement program savings and $69 billion in discretionary program savings by 1998.<sup>24</sup>  The tax law changes included two new personal tax brackets (36 and 39.6 percent) and an extension of the Medicare payroll tax to cover all wages. The motor fuel tax was increased 4.3 cents per gallon, and the tax on Social Security recipients' income from personal savings was increased. Congress and the President agreed to raise the corporation income tax to 35 percent and to restrict business meal and entertainment deductions. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The small entitlement savings came mostly from reductions in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals and increased charges to Medicare beneficiaries. OBRA-93 delayed cost of living adjustments for military and civil service retirees and limited Medicaid payments to the states. Small reductions also were made in veterans benefits, farm programs, and student loans.
<p>
<b>THE FINDINGS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comparison of the real and simulated economies suggests that OBRA-93 was not as beneficial to the economy as the White House claims. Indeed, it damaged the economy and living standards in several ways. Specifically, the Heritage analysis finds that:
<ol><p>
<b><li>Economic growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy would have grown significantly faster without the Clinton tax increases and spending reductions of 1993. These policy changes will have cost the economy <a href="bg1078c2.gif">$208 billion</a> in today's dollars in output from 1993 through 1996, equivalent to nearly $2,100 in lost GDP for every household in America. In 1995, GDP would have grown by nearly 0.90 percent more, or $66 billion in today's dollars, than it actually did. The model forecasts that GDP in 1997 will be 1.0 percent lower than it could be without the 1993 tax hike, or about $95.5 billion in today's dollars.
<p>
<b><li> The pace of business formation has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Heritage analysis shows more new businesses would have been incorporated without Clinton's 1993 package. This is due to the relationship between gross domestic product and new business incorporation. In general, for every $1 billion in GDP, about 195 new businesses are incorporated. Thus, the $208 billion fall in GDP due to the 1993 legislation will have prevented the formation of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and the end of 1996.<sup>25</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The loss of new businesses means not only a loss of valuable entrepreneurs, but also the loss of many new jobs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) estimates that five new jobs are created with each new business establishment. Using the SBA estimate, the loss of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and 1996 will have meant the loss of 203,000 new jobs.
<p>
<b><li>Job growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy produced 1.2 million fewer private sector jobs between 1993 and 1996 than it would have without the tax increase and budget changes of 1993. President Clinton claims credit for more than eight million new jobs during his Administration, so far, with roughly seven million of these in the private sector. But the Heritage analysis indicates that 1.2 million <I>additional</I> Americans could have been working without his policy changes. If the forecast for 1997 is added to these figures, the total private employment cost of the tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million.<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It must be noted that the loss of potential civilian employment is one of the more remarkable findings of the analysis, based on the model's design. It is also one of the more controversial. While it is the Heritage Foundation's policy to accept the model's macroeconomic results and assumptions (other than the action of the Fed -- see box, page 8) and not make adjustments in these results through statistical work performed outside the model, this particular effect of OBRA-93 deserves a brief explanation. The model's measurement of how much employment will change when taxes change (the so-called tax elasticity of employment) sits roughly in the middle of the professionally accepted range for such measurements: The model contains a factor of .29 percent change for every one percent change in labor income, and the standard range among economists goes from .12 to .37 percent. These elasticities mean that a 10 percent increase in take-home pay leads to an increase in the labor supply of between 1.2 and 3.7 percent. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The designers of the WUMM model caution users regarding the output of the model's employment equations. However, Heritage economists decided to accept the model's results because further investigations and calculations using other data bases gave general support to the conclusions in this Heritage study. If the rate changes associated with OBRA-93's increases in payroll and income taxes are applied only to the incomes of those with more than $70,000 in income, we calculate that potential employment was at least 350,000. Of course, the increase in tax rates also negatively affected investment decisions, which resulted in slower growth of job-creating new businesses and business expansion. For example, Heritage calculates that the loss in potential capital stock may account for an additional decrease of 470,000 jobs. When these and other capital effects are combined with the direct and minimal employment effects, the calculation derived from the model of 1.2 million in 1996 between actual and potential employment appears reasonable.<sup>27</sup>  Even using lower elasticities favored by some economists would mean an employment effect of at least 400,000 lost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Heritage calculates approximately 203,000 of the potential lost jobs between 1993 and the end of 1996 were a result of new businesses that were not formed. The remainder of lost potential jobs, some 1 million, most probably results from existing businesses that hired fewer employees than they otherwise would have or expanded less.
<p>
<b><li>The growth in household income and savings has been cut. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the job losses are combined with higher taxes on working families, a disturbing picture of lost household income growth emerges. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in wages and salaries has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of employee wages and salaries between 1993 and 1996, when compared with the pattern that otherwise would have occurred. Extending the analysis to 1997 would mean $162 billion in total lost wages and salaries, again in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> In 1996 alone, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton program depressed the growth in wages and salaries by $46.5 billion in today's dollars, roughly $465 for every household in America. The loss of potential income means that families spent less than they could have spent on food, clothing, transportation, medical care, and other necessities for their families. Indeed, in a typical month, the average household spends $251 on groceries, $160 on medical costs, and $40 on education.<sup>28</sup>  The addition of $465 in purchasing power for the typical household means an average of 1.8 months of groceries, or 2.9 months of medical bills, or 12 months of educational expenses in a typical year.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The growth in personal disposable income has been cut.</b> The 1993 budget deal raised taxes on millions of American households and will have cut overall real personal disposable income by $264 billion in today's dollars from 1993 through 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America. In 1996, households will have nearly 2 percent, or $101 billion, less money to spend on education, food, medical care, and other items than they would have had without the 1993 legislation.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Total personal disposable income measures both wage income and non-wage income from such things as investments. Besides lost future wages, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton tax increase and budget plan will have cost households $152 billion in non-wage income, in today's dollars, between 1993 and the end of 1996. This is equal to $1,500 for every American household. In 1996 alone, the average household will realize $550 less in non-wage disposable income, nearly double the amount the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the average household spends on appliances each year.<sup>29</sup>  Many households use income from non-wage sources to make large purchases such as the down payment on a new car, a washing machine, and other appliances. Alternatively, families may use this income to finance extraordinary events such as weddings, college education, or vacations.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in personal savings has been cut.</b> Between 1993 and the end of 1996, the 1993 budget plan will have reduced personal savings by roughly $138 billion in today's dollars. This cut in family savings means that future consumption of the things for which families save, principally housing and education, will be lower than it would have been. If 1997 is included, savings will have been cut by a total of $192 billion, in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The three things households save for most are education, housing, and retirement. To illustrate the impact of these lost savings, Heritage analysts distributed the $138 billion in lost savings to families with children, young families saving to purchase a home, and those saving for retirement, based upon age and population. We then assumed that this amount would grow at an everyday interest rate of 5 percent, to see what important purchases these three groups could make in the future with their respective accumulated savings. Each of the following amounts is what could be purchased with the future value of each group's portion of the $138 billion in lost savings:<sup>30</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>$432 billion for higher education expenses; and
<p>
<li>$335 billion for buying homes; and
<p>
<li>$3.6 trillion for retirement.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the portion of this $138 billion we allocated to families with children been allowed to earn interest for the average number of years available for savings in the under-18 age group, then the cumulative amount could have purchased a four-year college education for 7 million students at $14,000. Had the foregone savings we allocated to young families saving to purchase a home (the age group 18 to 35), been allowed to grow for 18 years, the total sum could have resulted in 17 million future home sales where a $20,000 down payment is required. And had the portion of this $138 billion allocated to people above the age of 35 -- those saving for retirement -- been allowed to grow for the average number of years before this cohort retires, the future value could have resulted in 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities paying $37,500 per year.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth of household wealth has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have reduced the growth of household net wealth by $111 billion from between 1993 and 1996. The WUMM model defines net household wealth as a sum of personal savings, the purchase of automobiles and other durables, the existing household stock of durable goods and personal capital gains.
</ul><p>
<b><li>The reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The President maintains that taxes had to be raised in 1993 to reduce mounting federal debt.<sup>31</sup>  He now points to a fall in the deficit as justification for the 1993 legislation. But the Heritage analysis indicates that the weak economy produced by the tax hike will have generated far less new revenue, and thus less deficit reduction, than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had predicted for FY 1994 through the end of FY 1996. On the other hand, the analysis indicates that the modest amount of savings predicted from the spending cuts will materialize. These findings suggest that if OBRA-93 had enacted few or no tax increases to slow the economy, but more spending cuts, the deficit would be far less today than it is.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1993, CBO predicted that OBRA-93 would lower the cumulative deficits between FY 1994 and FY 1996 by $171 billion. Some $50 billion of these savings -- 29 percent of the total -- was to come from spending cuts, including $17 billion in net interest savings and asset sale proceeds. The remaining $121 billion in deficit reduction -- 70 percent of the total -- was to come from the new revenues generated by the increase in tax rates.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that OBRA-93 will have produced just 74 percent of the deficit reduction CBO had estimated, or a total of $127 billion.<sup>32</sup>  This, however, does not tell the whole story. While the spending cuts will have produced slightly more savings than CBO predicted, $52 billion (excluding asset sale proceeds), accounting for 41 percent of the overall deficit reduction achieved,<sup>33</sup> the tax increase accounts for roughly 54 percent of the total, having delivered far less new revenue than was promised. 
<p><ul>
<li>The Heritage analysis shows that the tax increase will have produced just $68 billion in actual deficit reduction between FY 1994 and the end of FY 1996, just 56 cents of actual deficit reduction for every new dollar CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>However, excluding the roughly $16 billion in new revenues generated by the increase in the motor fuels tax, the analysis shows that the increase in personal and corporate tax rates produced only 49 percent of the new revenues CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>Thus, comparing the actual amount of deficit reduction produced by the 1993 tax hike between 1994 and 1996, with the 1.2 million potential new jobs lost, it can be said that the 1993 tax increase will have meant the loss of over 17,600 new jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis of the near-term consequences of the 1993 tax increase largely confirms the results of a recent study by noted Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their analysis of the impact of the 1993 tax increase on individual behavior shows that the higher tax rates placed on upper-income taxpayers encouraged these individuals to change their economic behavior and, thus, report lower taxable income. As a result, in the first year it took effect, the 1993 tax rate increase raised just 45 percent of the "revenue that would have been collected if taxpayers had not changed their behavior."<sup>34</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, Feldstein and Feenberg discovered that the 1993 tax hike caused considerable inefficiencies in the economy, what economists call "deadweight losses."  "This means that for every dollar of additional revenue collected by the government as a result of the higher tax rates, taxpayers experience a decline in their well-being equivalent to three dollars as a result of the induced changes in work, in the form of compensation, and in tax deductible expenditures."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, conclude Feldstein and Feenberg, "the structure of the 1993 tax increase thus made it a very inefficient way of increasing revenue."<sup>36</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This analysis so far has examined what might be called the short-term effects of the 1993 package. The current debate is about these short term effects, with the White House claiming benefits to today's economy. But for there to be a complete verdict on the 1993 tax and budget plan, one needs to project into the future, to explore whether the short-term effects analyzed above are merely a prelude to future growth.
</ol><p>
<b>THE LONG-TERM PICTURE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To estimate the longer-run future effects of the 1993 plan, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to extend the simulation of potential economic performance without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal through 2004. The results of this simulation were then compared with the baseline economic projections -- under current law and including the 1993 tax increase and budget deal -- produced by the owners of the WUMM model in December 1995. The comparison shows that nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically, the Heritage analysis concludes: 
<p><ul>
<li><a href="bg1078c4.gif">Gross domestic product</a> is projected to be lower in each year. In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year. In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Employment is projected to be less in every year. By 2004, 1.5 million fewer jobs will be created because of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there is good news in the economy, such as low interest rates, low inflation, 8 million new jobs, and lower federal deficits, many workers and their families feel that the recovery is anemic as far as they are concerned. The Clinton Administration is taking credit for good economic news and asserts that the news is a justification of its economic policies; specifically, the 1993 budget deal, which included the largest tax increase in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The evidence does not support the Administration's claim that the 1993 budget plan triggered stronger economic growth. On the contrary, the critics of the 1993 legislation appear to be correct that because of it Americans are caught in what some refer to as the "Clinton Crunch," the dual effect of declining real wages combined with higher taxes. The analysis by Heritage Foundation economists, using the WUMM model, indicates that OBRA-93 has had a damaging impact on the nation's economy. Removing the effects of OBRA-93 in an econometric simulation shows that the economy would have been performing better today had Congress not enacted the legislation. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, President Clinton is right to point to the 1993 budget deal as creating today's economic climate. But rather than create a better climate, the legislation has cast a dark shadow over the economy.

<a href="bg1078a.gif">Appendix:</a> Economic Impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconiliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93)
<p>
<b>Notes on the Simulation</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The simulation of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) was developed using the Washington University Macroeconomic Model of the United States economy. The baseline is that produced by the model in December 1995. Only those variables in the model that reflect federal tax and spending policies were modified to create the simulation. Both the baseline case and the simulation incorporated the model's Federal Reserve reaction function. Specifically, Heritage economists made the following decisions regarding tax and spending data inputted into the model for the simulation:<sup>37</sup>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Tax Changes</b> -- Most changes in tax policy were initiated in the first quarter of 1993 to account for the retroactive nature of the tax increases included in OBRA-93. 
<p>
1. The maximum federal corporate tax rate was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level to account for the one percentage point rate increase included in OBRA-93.
<p>
2. The statutory depreciation period for nonresidential structures was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level of 31.5 years. The corporate capital consumption allowance, as a percentage of total capital consumption allowance, was increased to accommodate the shorter depreciation periods within the simulation.
<p>
3. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal tax rates on wages, dividends, and interest were restored to their "pre-OBRA-93" levels.
<p>
4. The average federal personal tax rate was adjusted to account for lower marginal tax rates within the simulation compared to actual levels.
<p>
5. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal Social Security tax rate on wages and salaries was re-set to its "pre-OBRA-93" level.
<p>
6. Federal collections from social insurance taxes were adjusted to account for the repeal of the cap on earnings subject to the Medicare tax.
<p>
7. Federal collections from indirect business taxes were adjusted for the extension and increase of the motor fuels tax account.
<p>
8. Federal collections from business taxes were adjusted to account for non-rate changes in the business income tax code.
<p>

<li><b>Mandatory Spending Changes </b>
<p>
1. The actual spending level for <b>Medicare</b> was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $55.8 billion between 1994 and 1998. 
<p>
2. The actual spending level for <b>Medicaid</b> transfers was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $7.1 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
3. The actual spending level for personal transfers was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal employee retirement and health benefits, veteran benefits</b>, and the <b>Earned Income Tax Credit</b> would create -- a net total of $6.7 billion of increased spending between 1994 and 1998. The increased spending for the Earned Income Tax Credit more than offset the savings from reforming federal employee retirement and health benefits, and veterans benefits. Therefore, the simulation actually calls for less spending on personal transfers than actually occurred during the past three years.
<p>
4. The actual spending level for other grants-in-aid was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal farm programs</b>, the <b>food stamp program</b>, and <b>"other" mandatory programs</b> would save -- a net total of $7.2 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
5.  The proceeds from FCC electromagnetic spectrum auctions and the savings from changes in federal family education loans were added to the unified deficit but not included in the NIPA-based spending accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Discretionary Spending Changes</b> -- The actual spending levels for <b>non-defense purchases, defense purchases, and federal grants</b> to state and local governments were adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in discretionary spending would save -- a total of $68.5 billion between 1994 and 1998. This was evenly distributed among the three separate accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Spending Projections FY 1999 - FY 2004</b> -- CBO September 1993 estimates extended through FY 1998. For fiscal years 1999 through 2004, the underlying growth rates were assumed.
</ul><P>

<b>Other Technical Notes</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal Savings</b> -- The Heritage analysis concludes, among other things, that the tax policy changes of 1993 undercut personal savings by $138 billion. The estimates of long-term consumption effects were calculated as follows. The foregone personal savings were distributed across an array of seven age groupings by the percentage of people that fall in each grouping. This array consists of population estimates made by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for 1995.<sup>38</sup> 
<p>
<li>For those people 18 years old or less, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow until their 18th year at a compounded rate of 5 percent. The sum of this compounding ($432 billion) was divided by $14,000 to arrive at the estimate of 7 million people who could pay for four years of state university education. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 18 and 35, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 35th birthday. The sum of this compounding ($335 billion) was divided by $20,000 to arrive at the estimate of 17 million home sales that might be effected by potential home purchasers having $20,000 for a down payment and other home-buying costs. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 35 and 65, the distributed savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 65th birthday. The sum of this compounding was $3.6 trillion. To this sum was added the amount of distributed personal savings for people above age 65. It was assumed that this amount is consumed as it is received. Therefore, the total amount available for retirement was $3.6 trillion. This $3.6 trillion estimate was divided by $37,500 (an estimate of annual living costs at retirement for the cohort aged 35 and above) to arrive at the estimate of 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities.

<li>Data on median weekly earnings are not available on a consistent basis prior to 1979.<p>
<li>There are limits to the historical changes economists can make in structural macroeconomic models.  Clearly the major limitation is the time period.  While economies rarely experience major changes in the span of a few years, structural stability is far less likely over longer time periods.  The six years of changes in variables in the WUMM model needed to measure the 1990 tax increase would have stretched prudent econometric practice to its limits.  A number of prominent macroeconomists have written on the deleterious effects of the 1990 budget deal.  For a summary of these viewpoints, see Daniel J.  Mitchell, "The Impact of Higher Taxes:  More Spending, Economic Stagnation, Fewer Jobs, and Higher Deficits," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  925, February 10, 1993, and Daniel J.  Mitchell, "Why Higher Tax Rates on Income Will Slow Growth, Cost Jobs," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  942, May 25, 1993.<P>
<li>Congressional Budget Office, <I>The Economic and Budget Outlook:  An Update</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1993), Table 2-2, p.  29.<p>
<li>This estimate is derived from a statistical analysis of the relationship between the number of new business incorporations and real GDP over the period 1959-1994.  Overall a decrease in GDP of $1 billion was found to be associated with a decrease in the number of new business incorporations by an average of 194.957 over this period.  (The estimate had an R-squared of .92748, a standard error of 9.35, and a t-statistic of 20.852.) Multiplying this figure by the $208 billion lost from GDP over 1993-96 (as a result of the Clinton tax increase) gave an estimate of 40,600 fewer new businesses.  Figures for GDP and business formation came from the 1995 and the 1996 <I>Economic Report of the President</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1996), Tables B-2 and B-92, respectively, pp.  282, 385.   <P>
<li>The estimate of lost potential employment results from increases in taxes on the wages and salaries of upper income Americans, on the income of corporations, and on capital, an effect that stems from lengthening the period of depreciation on capital goods as well as taxing interest, dividends, and capital gains at higher rates.  Such tax increases reduce capital formation and promote consumption.  By increasing both the cost of capital and the cost of additional labor, the rate of business expansion and formation falls below potential which, in turn, reduces the potential growth of employment.<p>
<li>Most labor economists view tax increases as being equivalent to wage decreases, but they hold sharply divergent views about the degree of change in employment that results from a change in the tax rate on labor income.  See Mark Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I> (New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1983), Chapter 6, esp.  pp.  356-360.  This variation in the amount of labor that is supplied as the wage level changes is called the "wage or income supply elasticity of labor."  More specifically, the supply elasticity of labor is a measurement of the percentage change in the amount of labor that is supplied from a one percent change in the compensation of labor.  The professional literature contains estimates of the labor supply elasticity that range from.  12 to.  37 percent for every one percent change in total labor income (which become negatively signed when analyzing the effect of taxes on labor supply).  See Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I>, pp.  119-125, Table 3.2 to 3.5.  Also see comparable variation in the demand elasticities for labor in Daniel S.  Hamermesh, <I>Labor Demand</I> (Princeton, N.  J.:  Princeton University Press, 1993), Table 7.5.  The elasticity of labor supply used in the Washington University Macro Model is 0.29 percent and lies within the midrange of the estimates contained in this literature.<P>

It should be noted here, however, that the foregone savings is distributed to three different age groupings that each save for only one of the three purchases.  Allowing only one purchase for each group significantly simplified an otherwise complicated problem.  The group that is saving for education (those people under age 18) is not saving for a home purchase.  The group that is saving for a home purchase (aged 18 through 35) is not saving for retirement.  And the group saving for retirement (age 35 and above) is saving only for retirement.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using distressing stories of laid-off workers, decreasing paychecks, and increasing income inequality, some politicians and journalists have been painting a picture of economic gloom and doom in America. At the same time, the economy exhibits increasing employment, low inflation, and growth. Still, while the economy appears to be doing well, many Americans see themselves as struggling to make ends meet and feel they are worse off than their parents were a generation ago. This raises the obvious question: Are middle-income and low-income workers falling farther behind, or is the standard of living increasing for most Americans?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What has really been happening to wages, profits, and incomes in recent decades?
<p><ul>
<li>There has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, but this does not mean a decrease in the American standard of living. In fact, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase. Moreover, a broad array of measures indicates that the standard of living for most Americans continues to rise.
<p>
<li>There is no evidence to support the popular argument that rising corporate profits have come at the expense of workers. Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together. Whether corporate profits are falling or rising as a share of national income, the employees' share of a growing economy remains fairly constant.
<p>
<li>The slow growth in take-home pay is not the result of "corporate greed."  It is the result of a slowdown in the growth of productivity, caused in part by the growth of government taxes and regulations on business and investment. Higher taxes also are taking an ever-larger bite out of personal income, leaving a smaller and smaller share for individuals to spend, save, and invest.
<p>
<li>Although the income difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, a majority of men and women have seen their real earnings increase. Studies suggest the increasing divergence in the earnings of high-wage and low-wage workers is due primarily to an acceleration in the rate of technological change favoring those with higher skills, changes in the composition of the workforce, and a substantial shift in demand for the products of different industries. Increased trade and the number of low-skilled immigrants, however, have had only a small effect on wage patterns.
<p>
<li>The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an extraordinary degree of income mobility which has been all but ignored in the controversy over wage differences. The notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed of the same people, stuck in the same jobs over time, is an illusion. Data on income mobility reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. In America, the upward movement of workers in the lowest, second-lowest, and middle-income groups is much larger than the downward movement.
</ul> <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conventional wisdom is that wages are falling, the middle class is moving down instead of up, and corporate profits are rising at the expense of workers. But like so many other examples of conventional wisdom, it is wrong. The truth is that most workers are better off today because their real earnings are increasing and their standard of living continues to rise. Both corporate profits and labor compensation are growing, and although the difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, the U.S. economy remains dynamic and productive enough to enable most Americans to work their way up the economic ladder.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not higher taxes, more mandates and government programs, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes and excessive regulation. Removing these obstacles will increase productivity, job opportunities, and real wage growth for all Americans.

<b>HOW COMPENSATION INCREASES WHILE WAGE GROWTH STAGNATES</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, but this does not mean a decrease in the American standard of living.<sup>1</sup>  In fact, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase.<sup>2</sup>  The reason for this is that workers are taking home more of their pay in the form of tax-free benefits than ever before.<sup>3</sup>  Hourly wages do not account for the increasing tendency of employees to receive their "pay" in the form of untaxed fringe benefits.<sup>4</sup>  Moreover, hourly wage data are limited as to the types of employees they cover, further understating actual wage growth.<sup>5</sup>  Real compensation thus is a more accurate measure of the "pay" American workers receive because it includes benefits, such as health care and pension payments, as well as cash.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As <a href="fyi97c1.gif">Chart 1</a> illustrates, total compensation has increased even when average wages have declined. From 1959 to 1973, real hourly compensation increased by an average of 2.8 percent per year.<sup>6</sup>  Between 1973 and 1994, real hourly compensation increased an average of 0.4 percent per year. The problem is not that the average cash wage has declined, but that total "pay" has grown more slowly since 1973. The reason: a slowdown in the growth of productivity caused in part by the proliferation of government regulations, mandates, and higher taxes, all of which reduce the net value of a worker's output, which leads in turn to a slowdown in compensation.<sup>7</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most of the growth in real compensation since 1986 can be attributed to the fact that benefits have increased faster than cash wages (see <a href="fyi97c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Although real wage growth as measured by the Employment Cost Index has stagnated since 1986, sharply rising benefits have increased total compensation by 1.9 percent.<sup>8</sup>  Between 1981 and 1995, real employee benefits have increased 26.8 percent as workers have continued to demand more of their total pay in the form of tax-free benefits, and the cost of providing those benefits has increased.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While real compensation for most Americans has increased, workers correctly believe that they should be better off today than they are. Tax increases in the 1990s deprived them of a higher standard of living by undercutting the economy's rate of growth, undercutting productivity gains, and holding back pay increases.<sup>9</sup>  If workers and businesses were not burdened with large tax and regulatory increases, total compensation and real take-home pay would be higher.
<p>
<b>HIGHER PROFITS BENEFIT WORKERS, FALLING PROFITS LIMIT COMPENSATION GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence to support the popular assumption that rising corporate profits and the record high stock market have come at the expense of workers.<sup>10</sup>  <I>The Washington Post</I> was correct when it editorialized: "[Secretary of Labor Robert Reich] charges that the productivity improvements are going disproportionately to corporations. That's not the real explanation. While corporate profits, as a share of total economic output, are slightly higher than in the late 1980s, they remain lower than in the 1970s. The causes of the country's poor wage performance lie elsewhere."<sup>11</sup>  Those causes also do not include the trade deficit or immigration, both of which increased during the 1980s at the same time labor compensation increased significantly.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Whether corporate profits are falling or rising as a share of national income, labor's share of a growing economy remains fairly constant (see <a href="fyi97c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). The share of national income going to corporate profits declined in a seesaw fashion from 14.1 percent in 1965 to a post-World War II low of 6.0 percent in 1982. Workers' share of national income, however, rose from 68.1 percent in 1965 to 74.2 percent in 1970 and has remained relatively stable ever since.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together (see <a href="fyi97c4.gif">Chart 4</a>). When corporate profits declined in 1974, labor compensation declined too. When corporate profits declined from 1979 to 1982, compensation failed to increase. Corporate profits resumed their increase in 1983, and labor compensation followed suit, increasing by 23.3 percent from 1982 to 1988. From 1988 to 1991, the growth of corporate profits declined and labor compensation stagnated; when corporate profits began to increase again in 1992, however, so did labor compensation.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Higher profits also benefit workers because they are shareholders. Sixty-four percent of all workers are employed by companies with pension plans, and 50 percent of all workers participate in those plans.<sup>12</sup>  Nineteen percent of all workers also have their own individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence to support the popular argument that rising corporate profits have come at the expense of workers. Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together. Real labor compensation has risen $340 billion (in 1992 dollars) between 1991 and 1995, and corporate profits have increased $152 billion over the same period. Moreover, the fixed-pie assertion that a higher level of after-tax profits means less income available for labor compensation or tax revenue for the government is simply wrong. The problem is that the share of national income taken by all levels of government has increased from 32 percent in 1965 to 39 percent in 1994.<sup>13</sup>  This leaves a steadily smaller share for private citizens to spend, save, and invest.
<p>
	
<b>WAGE AND INCOME DIFFERENCES HAVE INCREASED</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Wage growth and wage differences are two distinct concepts,<sup>14</sup> but they interact to shape a worker's sense of well-being. If all real wages increase, everyone is better off, even if there is a widening difference in earnings. On the other hand, if average real wages stagnate while wage differences are growing, low-wage workers as a group may become poorer as the rich grow richer.<sup>15</sup>  In the case of the United States, the former pattern holds true: The standard of living for most Americans actually continues to rise, even though both wage and income differences have widened.<sup>16</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  Studies suggest that there are several reasons for widening wage differences. The accelerated rate of technological change, for example, favors those with higher skills. Also, changes in the composition of the workforce -- including a slowdown in the relative growth rate of college graduates and the increasing labor force attachment of women -- lead to a divergence of incomes. And there has been a substantial shift in demand for the products of different industries (such as lower paying services replacing higher paying manufacturing).<sup>17</sup>  The increase in low-skilled immigrants (both legal and otherwise) and trade, however, had only a small effect on wage patterns in the 1980s.<sup>18</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1973, income differences among families also have grown because of the sharp rise in the proportion of Americans who live in families with no male workers, growing differences in earnings among men, and the increasing likelihood that in a traditional family both husband and wife will be working.<sup>19</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of a family makes a difference. Census Bureau income data collected according to the presence of children show that while families with no children experienced a 36 percent increase in real median income over the past 25 years, families with one or two children did considerably less than half that well. The real median income of families with more than three children declined over the same period.<sup>20</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, a majority of men saw their real earnings rise 5 percent or more from 1979 to 1989, and a large majority of women (76 percent) saw their earnings increase.21  Moreover, a broad array of measures indicates that the standard of living for most Americans continues to rise. To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not higher taxes, more mandates, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are lower taxes for families and reforms that will increase worker productivity and job opportunities for Americans by, for example, improving basic education and encouraging more investment.
<p>
<b>MORE AMERICANS ARE MOVING UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an extraordinary degree of income mobility which has been all but ignored in the controversy over wage differences. The notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed of the same people over time is an illusion. Data on income mobility reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. The comparison of average incomes by group would be meaningful only if America were a caste society in which the people comprising one group remained constant. This is one reason why Americans with modest incomes tend to resist "soak the rich" class warfare arguments: They hope to be rich one day themselves. Further, average wage statistics are affected by economic changes that do not adversely affect most American workers.<sup>22</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, there was considerable upward mobility for those in the lower-income and middle-income groups.<sup>23</sup>  For example, from 1979 to 1988, the income of 85.8 percent of workers in the lowest income group had increased enough to move them up into a higher-income group.<sup>24</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Income mobility is important, but the direction of that mobility is more important. Needless to say, some people move up while others are moving down (see <a href="fyi97c5.gif">Chart 5</a>). But in America, the upward movement of workers in the lowest, second-lowest, and middle-income groups is much larger than the downward movement. From 1979 to 1988, the income of 60.1 percent of workers in the second-lowest income group had increased enough to move them up into a higher income group, and 47.3 percent of workers in the middle group had moved up.<sup>25</sup>  Over the same period, much smaller percentages of workers were moving down: only 10.9 percent of the second-lowest group and 19.7 percent of the middle group.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The possibility of moving down increases as incomes rise, while the probability that low-wage workers will move up is much greater for those in the lowest quintile. Moreover, a worker in the lowest income group was more likely to have moved into the top income group by 1988 than to have remained in the bottom group.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More than 60 percent of all workers can point to a minimum wage job as their first job experience.<sup>26</sup>  Some 40 percent of workers starting a minimum wage job receive their first raise within 4 months, and 63 percent of those workers earn 20 percent more than the minimum wage within 12 months.<sup>27</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. economy, while not without problems, thus remains dynamic, open, and productive enough to enable most Americans in the bottom income groups to work their way up the economic ladder. What is needed is policies to ensure that the opportunity for advancement is extended as widely as possible.
<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS: MORE EQUALITY AND LESS GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concern about stagnating wages and increasing income inequality has some politicians looking to Europe for solutions. But proponents of government actions to "alleviate inequality" would do well to ponder the anemic job growth in Europe. European firms are encumbered with costly mandates and taxes that have discouraged hiring and held back employment growth,<sup>28</sup> so while incomes are more equal in Europe, this equality comes with a very high price in terms of economic growth, new jobs, and inflation.
<P><ul>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, the U.S. economy has grown an average of 2.9 percent per year, compared with 2.3 percent in the European Union.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<li>Between 1970 and 1992, employment increased in the United States by 49 percent, compared with only 9 percent in the European Community.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
<li>Europe's employment rate (the proportion of its population of working age that is working) is the lowest of any industrialized part of the world. Moreover, it has fallen over the past two decades. The employment rate in the United States, which started in 1970 at a level similar to the European Community's, has grown in two decades to its current level of around 70 percent.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, the U.S. unemployment rate averaged 6.9 percent per year, compared with 9.9 percent in the European Union.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, consumer prices in the U.S. rose an average of 3.7 percent per year, compared with 5.1 percent in the European Union.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<li>Although wage differences between low-income and middle-income workers are much higher in the United States than in Europe, the relative differences between middle-income and high-income workers are the same.<sup>34</sup>
</ul>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Europe is now realizing that its existing collective bargaining, tax, and labor cost arrangements do not create more jobs; instead, they cause gains from economic growth to be absorbed mainly by those already employed. European Community member states are seeking to remove obstacles to employment growth by adjusting employer taxes, the idea being to make more jobs available to the relatively less-skilled by reducing the cost to employers. They also are lowering the relative cost of labor with respect to other factors of production -- for example, by reducing the employers' social security contributions. These are precisely the types of policies that should be adopted in the United States instead of more mandates and labor market restrictions.
<p>
<b>TAXES AND MANDATES LIMIT TAKE-HOME PAY AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Real compensation and benefits are important, but take-home pay is what matters most to workers.<sup>35</sup>  The slow growth in take-home pay is not the result of corporate greed or trade deficits.<sup>36</sup>  It is the result of a slowdown in the growth of productivity caused in part by the expansion of government regulation, which in turn reduces the net value of workers' output and contributes to slower wage growth.<sup>37</sup>  Further, an ever-larger share of workers' total pay (wages and benefits) is beyond their control, consumed by mandated benefits and taxes.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As <a href="fyi97c6.gif">Chart 6</a> illustrates, productivity growth has slowed since 1973, leading to reductions in the growth of workers' pay. From 1959 to 1973, productivity increased an average of 3.2 percent per year, and real hourly compensation increased by an average of 2.8 percent per year.<sup>38</sup>  Between 1973 and 1994, however, productivity growth slowed to an average of 1.3 percent per year, and real hourly compensation growth increased an average of 0.4 percent per year.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Government taxes and fees at all levels are taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income (see <a href="fyi97c7.gif">Chart 7</a>). Although personal income per person increased 121 percent from 1959 to 1995, government taxes and fees paid per person at all levels increased 155 percent over the same period. In 1994, federal, state, and local governments took an average of $2,800 (in 1992 dollars) from every man, woman, and child.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Several studies also point to the job-destroying effect of the regulatory and mandate explosion in recent years.<sup>39</sup>  For example:
<ul><p>
<li>There are at least 3 million fewer jobs in the American economy today because of the growth of regulation over the last 20 years.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
<li>A 1990 study estimated that environmental regulations alone had caused national employment to be 1.2 percent less in 1990 than it otherwise would have been.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1994, legally required benefits<sup>42</sup> accounted for 8.9 percent of total employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and 3.5 percent in 1951.<sup>43</sup>  These mandated benefits are not "free" to the worker, as many employees assume. A range of studies indicates that, on average, 88 percent of the cost of all legally required benefits or payroll taxes is shifted to workers in the form of reduced cash compensation.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
<li>The increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to employers and workers of complying with workplace safety and health regulations.<sup>45</sup>  One study has estimated that 19 percent of the productivity slowdown during the 1970s is directly attributable to regulations published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<sup>46</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Up to a certain point, government functions enhance economic well-being. Beyond that point, however, the burden of excessive government reduces economic growth.<sup>47</sup>  Employers and workers are straining under unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, and high taxes on labor and capital. This increasing drag on economic freedom has slowed growth, job creation, and wage gains. Government must roll back taxes, reduce the regulatory burden, and balance the budget to unshackle the economy and increase the real wages of all American workers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conventional wisdom is that wages are down, the middle class is shrinking, corporations are getting fat, and the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Like most other examples of conventional wisdom, it is wrong.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States remains a nation of extraordinary opportunity and mobility. The real wages of high-income, middle-income, and low-income workers do not come at the expense of each other; they rise and fall together. The U.S. economy remains dynamic, open, and productive enough to enable most Americans to work their way up the economic ladder. To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not more government programs, trade restrictions, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage; it is policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes and slow productivity growth. Only by correcting these problems can we increase job opportunities and real wages for all Americans.

<a href="fyi96t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Employment, Wage, and Compensation Growth, Current Expansion Vs. Previous Expansions
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a flow of good economic news in recent months, many Americans are concerned about their economic security, stagnating family incomes, and less money in their paychecks after taxes. They have a sense the economy is performing below its full potential and do not accept President Clinton's claim that the economy is the "healthiest it has been in 30 years."<sup>1</sup> 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A comparison of the current economic expansion and the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months suggests that they are right. The economy is failing to perform as well as similar expansions, and over the past three years the job opportunities and real earnings of many Americans have declined.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the current recovery, for example:
<P><ul>
<li><b>The gross domestic product</b> has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.<sup>2</sup>  Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><b>Total employment</b> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li><b>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs</b> has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li><b>Real median family income</b> actually has declined 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average increase of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
<li><b>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers</b> have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an increase of 3.1 percent during the November 1982 to July 1990 expansion.<sup>4</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, the economy is experiencing modest growth, but other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for many Americans in recent years. For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Since September 1993, real average hourly earnings have stagnated and real average weekly earnings have declined 1.5 percent.</b><sup>5</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.</b><sup>6</sup> Over the same period, real hourly compensation (combined wages and benefits) has not increased significantly.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs</b> in the 12 months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<li><b>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet.</b> In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>9</sup>
<p>

<li><b>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.</b><sup>10</sup>  The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.
<p>
<li><b>From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.</b><sup>11</sup> From March 1991 to March 1995, the first four years of the current expansion, manufacturing employment slowly increased (52,000 total new jobs). Over the past year, however, it declined by 1.8 percent.
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. Graded on a curve, the economy gets a "D" for below-average performance when compared with other expansions. It is not quite failing, but it clearly is not performing up to its potential.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This year's presidential campaign has raised once again the issue of free trade versus protectionism, with protectionists arguing that reducing foreign imports protects American jobs and benefits the overall U.S. economy. What are the facts?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence that protectionism produces economic benefits that outweigh its costs, but there is plenty of evidence that it does more harm than good. There is near unanimity among economists, for example, that free and unrestricted trade benefits economies while protectionism hurts them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America has a long history of advocating free trade, and, despite the claims of many, has been a free trade country throughout most of its history. When America has strayed from the path of free trade, the result has been economic hardship. Yet America today is on the brink of reviving protectionist policies that have failed in the past. The consequences would be all too predictable: lower living standards for all Americans, higher levels of unemployment, more business bankruptcies, and lingering economic decay.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The policies advanced by opponents of free trade ultimately are based on a number of myths: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #1: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Today manufacturing measured as a percentage of the U.S. economy is about the same today as it was in 1967.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #2: High manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the cost to the overall economy. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. The cost of saving jobs from foreign competition is higher consumer prices, which harm the economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #3: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. America today is the most technologically advanced country in the world, recapturing the lead in many high-tech industries like semiconductors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #4: Trade deficits are harmful while trade surpluses are beneficial.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Not true. Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than they are of weakness. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #5: Trade deficits cost jobs. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. The data show that as the trade deficit increases, unemployment decreases. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #6: Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Not true. Japan is suffering economically because of its managed trade policies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #7: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits import competition and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Many industries once thought to be in danger of bankruptcy are making record profits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #8: Countries like Japan are called protectionist simply because the U.S. has experienced difficulty penetrating their markets. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. American companies sell almost $70 billion a year in Japan, America's largest market besides Canada.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #9: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Not true. Some countries are likely to run a trade deficit because they import cheaper raw materials and export more expensive finished goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #10: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Trade retaliation most often fails to open foreign markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #11: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. No international organization has final policy-making authority over the United States. In all cases, the U.S. Congress and the President have final authority.
<P>

<b>THE MYTHS OF TRADE PROTECTIONISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The protectionist approach to settling trade disputes with Japan, China, and other countries rests on a number of myths about free trade and trade deficits. These myths are the intellectual foundation of protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #1</b>: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. Opponents of free trade argue that cheaper labor in foreign countries forces American companies to move their operations overseas. They contend that in the long run, America is being de-industrialized. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. First of all, labor is not the only factor in producing manufactured goods. Other factors such as capital, natural resources, and infrastructure also must be considered. If labor was the only or even the most important factor, all the world's manufacturers would be located in such low-wage countries as Haiti, Somalia, and the Dominican Republic. Manufacturers avoid these poor countries because of the many problems that add to the cost of doing business there. For example, port facilities or roads may be inadequate or non-existent, driving up the costs of transporting goods to market; there may be no telephone or fax service; and local and federal taxes may be so high that they cancel out any savings from cheap labor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>America's Manufacturing Might.</b> Even more important, America is not de-industrializing. Manufacturing as a percentage of the U.S. economy is essentially the same today -- about 21 percent of GDP -- as it was in 1967.<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, employment in manufacturing has remained relatively stable over the last three decades. The number of Americans working in manufacturing jobs today (about 10.5 million) is about the same as in the early 1960s.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, even though these jobs represent a smaller percentage of the growing U.S. population, these Americans now are building computers and advanced medical devices instead of working in assembly lines sewing clothes or soldering circuit boards. If it is true that manufacturing is about the same percent of the U.S. economy as it was nearly 30 years ago, and that there are fewer workers as a percentage of the total U.S. population performing those tasks, then it is also true that the American worker is becoming more productive. This is a sign of strength, not weakness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #2</b>: High manufacturing wages must be protected regardless of the cost to the overall economy. Protectionists believe that American manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the costs to the rest of the country. They also argue that foreign competition causes Americans to lose their jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. The cost of saving jobs from foreign competition is higher consumer prices, which harm the economy. For example, when trade quotas were imposed on imported cars in the early 1980s, prices for domestic and imported cars rose by $2,000.<sup>3</sup>  While these quotas may have preserved some auto workers' jobs, they also passed the cost on to the American consumer. Instead of being able to use this money to send their children to college, pay their mortgages, or put food on the table, American consumers are forced to subsidize the jobs of other Americans who cannot compete internationally. In short, protectionism takes money from the many to support the high wages or jobs of the few.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, trying to save a few jobs through protectionism may cause a net loss of many more jobs. When the U.S. imposed import quotas on the auto industry in the 1980s, the price of a new U.S. automobile increased by an average of 41 percent from 1981 to 1984. This was nearly twice the average rate of increase for all consumer prices during that time. While the auto industry can claim that these price hikes saved up to 22,000 jobs, they also prevented many consumers from buying new cars.<sup>4</sup>  In fact, U.S. consumers bought around 1 million fewer U.S. cars after the U.S. imposed import quotas,<sup>5</sup> and the drop in sales forced the auto industry to lay off 50,000 workers in the late 1980s.<sup>6</sup>  Thus, even though 22,000 jobs apparently were saved, the layoffs caused by the price increase actually produced a net loss of 30,000 jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is more, the price increases cost the American consumers $17 billion in higher auto prices. To save just one of those 22,000 auto jobs, American consumers had to pay $772,727. It would have been cheaper if the American taxpayer, through the U.S. government, could have given these auto workers a one-time check for $500,000 and then laid them off. Either way, whether by imposing tariffs or by paying laid-off workers directly, the U.S. government would be subsidizing relatively few workers at great expense to Americans generally.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, the number of retail jobs destroyed by years of import restrictions on textile and apparel products is far greater than the number of jobs created or saved in the textile manufacturing industry. Americans pay 58 percent higher prices for textile and apparel products because of U.S. trade restrictions. This amounts to $11 billion to $15 billion a year.<sup>7</sup>  Thus, while protectionism saved 22,390 U.S. textile and apparel jobs in the 1980s, it cost the U.S. consumer $550,916 per job saved. However, once job losses in other industries, like the retail sector, are added to the equation, the cost of each job saved increases to well over $4 million.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It should be up to individual Americans, not government, to determine how much they pay for consumer goods. It is unfair to ask a school teacher making $26,000 a year to pay $2,000 more for a car to subsidize an auto worker who makes $50,000 a year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #3</b>: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. Advocates of protectionism argue that the United States is losing its technological edge to countries like Japan, mainly as a result of the U.S. dedication to free trade. These advocates argue that foreign competition has forced many U.S. high-tech firms into bankruptcy or out of the business of producing certain goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. America today is the most technologically advanced country in the world, a leader in the production of such high-tech products as advanced audio and video equipment, air conditioners, building and construction hardware, computers and computer software, environmental technology equipment, medical equipment and chemicals, navigational and surveying equipment, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, American firms are recapturing the lead in many technological fields in which they had fallen behind during the 1980s. 
<p>
Two examples:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Example 1: Semiconductors.</b> Semiconductors are electrical components used to conduct electricity. They are used not only in the most basic of electrical products, such as toasters, but in the most advanced devices, such as supercomputers or orbital satellites. All electrical products incorporate some type of semiconductor, so this industry obviously is vital to the economic well-being of any country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, America is the world's largest manufacturer and seller of semiconductors. Many argue that an aggressive U.S. protectionist policy has raised the industry to its present status. In fact, however, it was U.S. private-sector joint ventures and sound business decisions by the U.S. semiconductor industry that resulted in this current prosperity. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the 1980s, Japan had become America's biggest rival in semiconductors. Japanese firms began to invest aggressively in computer memory chips, trying to beat out the remaining U.S. producers in this area. Sensing an impending downturn in demand, many U.S. firms abandoned production of these relatively low-tech items in favor of more profitable higher-tech products. One such product was the microprocessor. While the downturn in demand for memory chips did occur in the mid-1980s, and the Japanese endured major losses, American semiconductor manufacturers profited because they focused on producing microprocessors, not memory chips.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, after U.S. industry had walked away from the memory chip, sales in Japan dropped. The U.S. responded to this problem in 1986 by seeking a U.S.-Japan agreement that would force the Japanese to buy more semiconductors from the United States. But this agreement had little, if any impact on increased U.S. semiconductor sales in Japan. What did increase American semiconductor sales in Japan was a series of private-sector U.S. joint ventures with Japanese companies. These ventures gave U.S. companies access to crucial Japanese manufacturing techniques and distribution channels, in addition to shared research and development costs. In 1990, there was just a handful of U.S./Japan semiconductor partnerships; by 1994, there where over four dozen. It was these partnerships that enabled American companies to sell more semiconductors in Japan.<sup>10</sup>

<b>Example 2: Steel.</b> In the 1970s and 1980s, America's steel industry was unable to compete with cheaper, foreign made steel. Many steel workers were laid off, some permanently. Today, the U.S. steel industry is stronger, with growing sales and more profitability. Many advocates of protectionism argue that U.S. steel was saved by trade restrictions. In fact, however, protectionism in steel harmed the U.S. economy while failing to help the U.S. steel industry. What did help the U.S. steel industry?  Joint ventures with foreign firms and massive foreign investment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To help the U.S. steel industry cope with shrinking competitiveness in the 1970s, the Nixon Administration imposed relief from imports for a period of three years, during which the industry was supposed to modernize. In 1971, these import restraints were extended for another three years. From 1974 until 1993, the U.S. steel industry was under some kind of government protection. Wages rose from $9.90 per hour in 1970 to $17.46 per hour in 1980, an increase more than 60 percent higher than wage increases in the rest of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The combination of higher steel wages and 20 years of protectionism cost more jobs among users of steel than were saved in the steel industry.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, Americans paid some $5 billion a year in higher prices. Thus, while protection may have saved jobs in the steel industry, it destroyed jobs in other industries that use steel to manufacture their products. For example, from 1969 to 1980, U.S. manufacturers using U.S.-made steel paid 20 to 25 percent more for their steel than was paid by their foreign competitors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Still, the U.S. steel industry did manage to make a tremendous comeback.<sup>12</sup>  The industry once again is making profits and, after years of modernization, is prepared to compete with foreign steel producers. The reason: Japanese foreign investment poured into the U.S. in the 1980s and gave U.S. steel companies the money they needed to build new plants and adopt more advanced manufacturing techniques. Moreover, private sector joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese steel companies taught U.S. firms how to manufacture steel more efficiently.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #4</b>: Trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial. This is the core idea behind protectionism and managed trade. Advocates of this view argue that trade deficits harm the economy, destroy jobs, and reflect weakness in the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than of weakness. The U.S. trade deficit means that Americans hold more goods than their foreign trading partners, while foreigners hold more U.S. dollars. As the richest country in the world, America consumes goods and services from both U.S. and foreign companies. The influx of foreign goods and services in return for dollars adds to America's wealth. It does not detract from it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans receive imported goods and services that increase their standard of living. Moreover, the dollars sent abroad for the purchase of goods and services typically cannot be spent within those countries. While dollars are traded between countries in financial markets, they are used mainly by foreign consumers to buy American goods and services. Thus, nations use surplus dollars to buy American goods and services, invest in American firms, or purchase U.S. Treasury bonds. These investments create jobs and wealth for Americans, while the purchase of Treasury bonds frees U.S. domestic capital for savings, investment, and purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the example of someone who goes to the supermarket and buys $150 worth of groceries. The protectionist believes the proprietor has a trade "surplus" of $150, and the customer has a "deficit" of $150. But this is not the case. The grocer ends up with $150 in currency, while the customer has $150 worth of groceries. It is a mutually beneficial transaction. No one would expect the grocer to buy an equal amount of goods from the customer in order to have an equal balance sheet in exchanged goods. Nor should one expect countries to have an even balance sheet in international trade. The trade deficit represents nothing more than a surplus of foreign goods and services which Americans now own. The value of these goods and services is as much a part of the national wealth as is the possession of U.S. dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another misunderstanding involves the calculation of the trade deficit. At least one-third to one-half of the U.S. trade deficit figure counts U.S. imports from American overseas subsidiaries as part of the deficit. For example, when Ford Mexico sends a motor from its plant to the Ford assembly plant in Detroit, it is counted as an import. However, if Ford then sells an American-made car with a Mexican-made motor in the U.S., there is no corresponding export. Thus, a "deficit" supposedly is created. But why should a car sold in the U.S., even though it has a Mexican-made engine, be calculated as part of the trade deficit?  Most of the money made from this sale stays in the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Trade deficits are not harmful to the economy. If they were, America would not be the economic powerhouse it is today. The U.S. has run a trade deficit for most of its history. For the first hundred years, these deficits were fairly large; nevertheless, throughout this period, growth rates were higher than they are today. Trade deficits did not destroy the economy then. Nor will they destroy it in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #5</b>: Trade deficits cost jobs. Protectionists claim that trade deficits are a major cause of unemployment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. History shows that, on average, unemployment drops as trade deficits rise. For example, while the trade deficit leaped in 1983-1984 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted, from 9.6 percent in 1983 to 5.5 percent in 1988. When the trade deficit began to shrink from 1989 to 1991, on the other hand, unemployment rose from 5.3 percent to 6.7 percent, and when it began to rise again from 1992 to 1994, unemployment fell from 7.4 percent to 6.1 percent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Looking further back in history confirms that trade deficits do not cause a loss of jobs. Every year the trade deficit increased since 1962, unemployment decreased. Likewise, every year the trade deficit decreased since 1962, unemployment increased shortly thereafter.<sup>13</sup>  Despite the trade deficit, the economy was growing and jobs were being created.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why, then, are some major corporations laying off large numbers of workers?  The answer has nothing to do with trade deficits and everything to do with America's own economic ills. The U.S. economy today suffers from a host of government policies and regulations that are strangling corporate America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faced with a proliferation of environmental regulations, financial reporting requirements, and worker safety laws, American companies are finding it more and more expensive and difficult to comply with government directives. While many regulations may have laudable goals, their implementation is causing severe hardship for America's corporations. This, combined with added costs, causes far more job losses than trade deficits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #6</b>: Prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies. U.S. policymakers often use the managed trade policies of Japan as an example of how a country can eliminate trade deficits, increase living standards, and achieve greater economic stability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. A closer look reveals that Japan's managed trade policies have had mixed results. The real purchasing power of Japanese consumers is at least 20 percent less than that of the American consumer. For example, using purchasing power parity, which takes into account differences in currency values, local prices, availability of goods and services, and inflation, America has a per capita income of $25,860. Japan, however, has a per capita income of only $21,350.<sup>14</sup>  This means that the Japanese have a lower standard of living than Americans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan's lower standard of living can be attributed partly to a highly regulated economy that drives up the cost of living. For example, policies that restrict such imports as agricultural products, beef, and other food items force the average Japanese to spend about 25 percent of his disposable income on food, compared to less than 12 percent for Americans. Spending more on food means less money for housing and other needs. The result: a lower standard of living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Managed trade is not responsible for Japan's prosperity. In fact, Japan's prosperity exists in spite of Japan's managed trade and industrial policies. In the end, the freer trade and market economic policies of the U.S. have produced a higher standard of living in America than in Japan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #7</b>: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits competition from foreign imports and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. Advocates of managed trade argue that closed overseas markets are the chief reason for America's trade deficit, causing enormous economic hardships that result in bankruptcies and lost jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. This scare tactic is employed by U.S. companies to frighten policymakers into taking up their cause in Washington. And what is their cause?  To limit import competition and force foreign countries to purchase a set amount of U.S. goods and services. These companies argue that they are hurt by closed markets overseas. As a result, they want Congress and the Administration to punish American consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices for imported products like automobiles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But if American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter?  The U.S. exported over $783 billion in goods and services in the first 11 months of 1995.<sup>15</sup>  By contrast, Germany exported only $414 billion and Japan only $397 billion in all of 1994.<sup>16</sup>  Clearly, most U.S. exporters experience little if any difficulty finding overseas markets for their goods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the U.S. auto industry. Is it on the verge of bankruptcy today?  It is not. It racked up $14 billion in profits last year. The main reason for Detroit's resurgence was not government coddling. Rather, it is because manufacturers are building better automobiles. This is the result of competition from Europe and Japan. Today, American cars are better built, have fewer flaws, and are bigger sellers than many of their Japanese and European counterparts. For all this, the Big Three auto makers have the free market to thank, not the meddling hand of the federal government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #8</b>: Because the U.S. is unable to sell some goods and services in countries like Japan, these countries must have closed markets. Many protectionists argue that the U.S. has an open market while countries like Japan restrict American imports. Thus, they blame Japan for its trade surplus with the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Japan is no more protectionist than the United States. This is the conclusion of The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><i>Index of Economic Freedom</i></a>, which measures the relative level of economic freedom in over 100 countries. The study concludes that, from a global perspective, Japan and the U.S. have relatively equal levels of protectionism.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The trade deficit with Japan is not nearly as bad as protectionists argue. For example, the commonly reported trade deficit figures measure only merchandise trade. While these figures represent the bulk of the trade between the U.S. and Japan, they also ignore the tremendous trade surplus the U.S. has in consulting, telecommunications, computers, and other services. Thus, the deficit is usually smaller than commonly reported. Moreover, much of the trade deficit with Japan comes from counting the products of Japan-based American companies exporting their goods back home. The profits from these sales go to the stockholders of American companies, not directly to the Japanese.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The truth is that Japan is America's largest overseas export market. Japan imported $69 billion in goods from America in 1995 -- that is more than the U.S. exported to Britain and Germany combined ($22 billion and $19 billion, respectively).<sup>18</sup>  Moreover, on a per capita basis, Japan buys more from the U.S. than America buys from Japan. For example, each Japanese citizen bought $444 worth of U.S. goods and services in 1994, while each American citizen purchased only $441 worth of Japanese goods and services.<sup>19</sup>  But because Japan's population is about 50 percent smaller than America's, a deficit exists. Americans purchase more Japanese goods overall because there are twice as many Americans as Japanese. Thus, a trade deficit exists for many reasons, not just because of -- or even primarily because of -- Japanese protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #9</b>: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy. Protectionists argue that trade surpluses are created intentionally by government policy. Thus, they reason, trade deficits must be dealt with in the same manner -- by government action through tariffs and other forms of protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Those who argue that trade surpluses and deficits are the result of government manipulation do not understand how a market economy works. They ignore, for example, that some countries with scarce natural resources are likely to run a trade surplus because they must import relatively inexpensive unfinished goods and export more expensive finished goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan is a case in point. It must import such raw materials as oil and lumber. These raw materials are used to manufacture more expensive finished products, some of which are exported. Throughout this process, the Japanese are adding value to the imported raw materials by making more expensive finished products for export. The result is a trade surplus. By contrast, the U.S. has abundant natural resources, which in many cases it exports. Thus, most of its imports are finished goods, which are more expensive and worth more than the raw materials that went into making them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #10</b>: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. Protectionists believe the best way to open foreign markets is to threaten trade retaliation. The weapons of choice: special tariffs, duties, and import quotas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. The U.S. has resorted to threats of trade retaliation to open foreign markets, but most of the time they have backfired. The principal U.S. law used to threaten trade retaliation is Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which grants the President the authority to impose punitive trade restrictions on imports. Of the nearly 80 Section 301 cases initiated by the U.S. since 1974, only about 15 were successful. Yet even in these cases, American consumers were saddled with billions of dollars in higher prices caused by higher tariffs and special duties. In the end, all Americans were the losers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #11</b>: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. Advocates of trade protectionism argue that the U.S. should pull out of these and related institutions and agreements because they all infringe on American sovereignty and represent a move toward world government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. A world government would indeed be a grotesque and harmful development, but these agreements or organizations will not lead to such a result.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nothing in any of America's trade agreements, including the NAFTA, can force America to follow any law not previously passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by the President. All of these agreements contain language stating that no decisions made under them can supersede domestic U.S. law. How can a foreign organization like the WTO infringe on U.S. sovereignty if it lacks the power to supersede or overrule U.S. law? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Free trade is, in fact, the antithesis of world government. It depends on the free flow of ideas as well as goods and services. This promotion of freedom worldwide is inconsistent with the centralizing principle of world government.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The driving force behind the protectionist threat of trade sanctions against Japan, China, and other countries is a misguided belief that trade deficits are harmful to the economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Trade deficits are a sign of economic strength. They often represent a growing economy in which jobs and wealth are being created, not lost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another myth that inspires the protectionist is that trade deficits are mainly the result of closed markets overseas. This also is not true. There are many markets for U.S. goods and services overseas. In fact, the U.S. is the largest exporter in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Trade protectionists misunderstand America's position in the international economy. By failing to understand America's massive export strength, they fail to comprehend the implications of America's trade deficit. And they have mistaken the reasons why Japan and other countries have a trade surplus. As a result of these misjudgments, protectionists advocate a trade policy that could threaten the wealth and prosperity of all Americans. Their myths are not merely academic, but profoundly important in a practical sense. Getting the facts straight in this debate is vitally important to the future prosperity of the American people.

<title>A Republican Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch - Heritage</title>

<h3>A REPUBLICAN AGENDA TO REVERSE THE CLINTON CRUNCH</h3>

<b>By <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey/welcome.html">Dick Armey</a></b>
<P>Dick Armey is Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives and represents the 26th district of Texas.  He spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on February 27, 1996.

<P>
Can you believe that, in his State of the Union speech, President Clinton actually said "our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades"? I have to say, President Clinton is the Herald of Happy Talk, but this is what my wife Susan calls denial.
<table border=0 align=left>
<tr><td><img src="flnrarmy.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><th>Majority Leader Armey and Heritage<br> President Edwin Feulner</th></tr></table><p>
Only last week Alan Greenspan called the current economy "dismal." The Administration admitted as much when it announced that the economy grew less than 1 percent annually last quarter. This White House is quickly bringing back Jimmy Carter's economic malaise, but now they're calling it a funk.
<p>
The last two years of the Carter presidency were the worst for family incomes since the Great Depression. Ronald Reagan brought families back to prosperity with tax cuts, deregulation, good humor, and optimism. But Bill Clinton is bringing us a return of the middle-class squeeze.
<p>
Millions of working American families gather around their kitchen tables at the end of a hard work week and wonder why it is they can't seem to make ends meet. They work longer and longer hours, they take second jobs, but they feel they are just running in place. They are losing their faith in the American Dream: that their sons and daughters will achieve a higher living standard than their parents and grandparents.
<P>


I lay the blame for America's anxiety at the feet of this Administration. Here's the evidence:
<ol><p>
<li> In each and every year of the Clinton presidency, the typical American family had less real income than when President Clinton took office. Last year alone, the typical family earned $790 less than in 1992.
<P>
<li> The President enacted the largest tax increase in history, and the result is that the typical family now devotes 24.5 percent of its income to federal taxes -- a greater share of income than at any time in America's peacetime history.
</ol><p>

<b>Higher Taxes, Lower Incomes</b>
<p>
These two factors combine to make up the Clinton Crunch: taxes going up and incomes going down. If, instead, families had continued to prosper as they did during the Reagan expansion, the average family would have had $1,274 more last year.
<p>
Republicans want to reverse the Clinton Crunch. We want incomes to go up while taxes go down. Republicans want you to earn more and keep more of what you earn.
<p>
But this Administration would rather feel your pain than deal with it. Secretary Reich, for example, recites the Democrat mantra that real wages for the median worker have fallen 4.6 percent since 1979. He's just reciting the time-worn Democrat party line.
<p>
Income certainly hasn't fallen steadily since 1979. As President Carter completed his term, the nation plunged into recession and wages plummeted. But wages and incomes rebounded during the Reagan expansion years. Tragically, just as families had nearly regained their pre-Carter standard of living, the Democrat Congress and the Bush Administration stalled their forward progress, and now the Clinton Crunch has knocked families backwards.
<p>
What's the lesson here? The only period of sustained wage growth in the last 17 years came as government was cutting taxes and paring back red tape.
<p>
President Clinton didn't just ignore the lessons of history; he defied them. He enacted the largest tax increase in the nation's history and piled on new regulations. It's no wonder that more than half of the wage decline since 1979 occurred under Clinton's watch.
<p>
This Administration and the Democrats think the answer is more government, higher taxes, and more regulation. The President even wants to add new obstacles like a minimum wage hike -- putting the bottom rung of the economic ladder of success out of reach for millions of unskilled workers. The President says he wants to decrease the number of working poor. The trouble is he would do it by making the working poor the non-working poor.
<p>
<b>Bill Clinton: Last Defender of the Welfare State</b>
<p>
In a classic Clinton disconnect, Bill Clinton said that the "era of big government is over," but his actions make it clear that he is the last defender of the welfare state. He stands alone against the tide of reform and renewal rising throughout America.
<p>
More jobs were created in the last six months of the Bush Administration than in these past six months of the Clinton Administration. Bill Clinton inherited a growing economy and quickly trampled prosperity. But that's not all.
<p><ul>
<li>He vetoed the first balanced budget in 26 years.
<li> He vetoed tax cuts for working America and for economic growth.
<li> He vetoed regulatory relief that would have eliminated excess red tape that stifles wages. 
<li>He vetoed legal reform that would have stopped expensive, frivolous lawsuits. 
<li>He vetoed welfare reform that required work and discouraged illegitimacy.
</ul><p>
 Bill Clinton desperately wants to preserve the status quo. He and too many technocrats in Washington are willing to resign this nation to sluggish growth and limited opportunity. We can't settle for that kind of mediocrity.
<p>
But I'm here to bring you good news. Congressional Republicans have an Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch. We must revive prosperity so that working people can once again earn more and keep more of what they earn.
<p>
I have a favorite saying that makes a serious point about the American Dream and why economic growth is the most important goal of Republican policy. Very simply put, every parent knows, deep down, that the American Dream isn't just owning your own home; it's getting your kids out of it.
<p>
Think about it. We struggle through parenthood, sharing our children's hopes and joys and getting them through their disappointments. We're rewarded for all our hard work on that magic day when they burst through the door and say, "Mom, Dad, I got the job." It takes economic growth to create those jobs for our kids so they can start their lives, get married, and finally give us old folks the grandkids we so desperately want to spoil.
<p>
<b>Reversing the Clinton Crunch</b><p>
This is the American Dream, imperiled by the Clinton Crunch. House Republicans have a 9-point <b>Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch</b>:

<li> Cutting taxes on investment to create jobs; 
<li> Tax relief for working farnilies with children; 
<li> Protecting pensions for working Americans; 
<li> Streamlining regulations that stifle wages and increase prices; 
<li> Reforming the health insurance market to eliminate job lock; 
<li> Putting power in the hands of workers, not bureaucrats, by consolidating worker training programs;
 <li>Enforcing the <i>Beck</I> decision to end the coercive hidden tax that forces union workers to support partisan politics; 
<li> Voting on a tax limitation constitutional amendment to let you keep more of what you earn; and
<li>Continuing our success in eliminating wasteful government spending to use tax dollars wisely and move power back to the states.
</ol><p>
<b>Step 1: The first major step in restoring growth and easing the Clinton Crunch is tax relief.</b> We must cut taxes on investment to get the economy moving again. <b>This year, I am confident we can and will develop a capital gains tax cut that this President can sign</b>. We need capital gains  tax relief so that investment can flow from the stagnant industries of yesterday to the start-up firms of tomorrow, so that a person with a great idea today becomes an employer tomorrow.

<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> We will continue to pursue a child tax credit. When Democrats started their 40-year run as the majority in Congress, the average family paid $1 to the federal government for every $50 they earned. Today, the average family pays $12 to the federal government for every $50 earned. It's time to turn that trend around.
<p>
To  appreciate fully how big the federal tax bite is, I propose that you take the Armey Challenge. Look at your paystub every month, for as many months as it takes, and see if you are paying more for taxes than for food, clothing, and shelter combined. Too many of you will find that government-costs you more than the necessities of life. And that is wrong! <b>We will, again this year, give the President an opportunity to fulfill his campaign promise of a middle-class tax cut.</b>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> One of the largest sources of investment funds today is the pension and retirement savings millions of Americans set aside each year. Pension managers, wanting to get their investors the highest return, seek out the best investments. It's a win for savers, who earn a higher return; for borrowers, who can start or expand their businesses; and for workers, when new jobs are created. But Secretary Reich wants to pre-empt that synergy. He wants the government to choose "winners" and "losers" by redirecting pension funds into "social investment.'' That means lower returns for future retirees, and less investment funds available to start real, productive businesses that create jobs and opportunities. <b>The House passed Jim Saxton's H.R. 1594 last vear to stop Reich's pension grab. I'll ask Senator Dole to move this bill through the Senate so we can send it to the President this year.</b>
<P>
<b>Step 4:</b> Outdated regulations force employers to spend money investing in Washington paperwork instead of productive equipment -- and paying lawyers instead of giving raises to workers. We'll restore wage growth by eliminating unnecessary and job-destroying government regulation. Cutting excess red tape creates more jobs and higher wages, and lowers prices for consumers. <b>In March. the House will pass a regulatory reform bill H.R. 994, designed by Representatives Bill Clinger and Henry Hyde, updating the Regulatory Flexibility Act and requiring Administration review of old regulations</b>. We expect the legislation to be on the President's desk this spring.
<p>
<b>Step 5: In April, the House will vote to end health insurance job lock</b>. Today, too many working parents are afraid to pursue new opportunities, start a new career, or become an entrepreneur because they don't want to lose the health insurance they now have. This year we will bring up legislation centered around Representative Bill Thomas's H.R. 1610 to increase the availability, affordability, and accountability of health care coverage for working families.
<p>
<b>Step 6:</b> Federal job training programs today train workers for jobs that no longer exist. They erect barriers rather than bridges between aspiring workers and the jobs they seek. <b>The House and Senate this year will complete work on Representative Bill Goodling's CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)</b>, which takes control away from bureaucrats, who are in no position to know where the jobs are, and puts it in the hands of workers searching for training.
<p>
<b>Step 7:</b> The Supreme Court's 1988 <I>Beck</I> decision, which declared that union members cannot be forced to pay dues to pay for anything other than collective bargaining costs, today remains unenforced. As a result, union households are forced to pay dues to support partisan advocacy that violates their core political beliefs. In the <I>Beck</I> case, 79 percent of union dues funded activities other than collective bargaining, including overt partisan political activity. As Thomas Jefferson said, "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical." <b>This year, the House will bring legislation to the floor to end this hidden tax</b>. We must give union families control over how their hard-earned income is spent and restore their right to advocate their own political beliefs.
<p>
<b>Step 8:  On April 15, the House will vote on a constitutional amendment to limit tax increases</b>. The tax limitation amendment puts an end to the cycle of the past 40 years -- special interests in Washington demanding more spending, and Congress raising taxes to pay for it.
<p>
The American people know that cutting spending is the only way to get our fiscal house in order and balance the budget. Economists from all parts of the political spectrum agree that balancing the budget would bring interest rates down by nearly 25 percent -- or 2 percentage points. That means entrepreneurs and small businesspeople can better afford to start and expand firms, hire more workers, and invest in new equipment to boost productivity and wages. And a 2 percentage point reduction in interest rates translates into $1,300 per year in interest savings for a typical family with a home mortgage, a car loan, and student loans.
<p>
<b>Step 9:</b> Finally, we will continue this year to cut wasteful government spending. Two economists I hold in very high regard, Lowell Galloway and Richard Vedder of Ohio University, have done extensive work on the optimal size of government. Their research confirmed what I like to call the Armey Curve. It showed that government spending, up to about 18 percent of the economy, can have a positive impact. But beyond that point, Keynes is wrong -- more government isn't a stimulus; it's an obstacle to growth.
<p>
Today, federal spending approaches 22 percent of the economy. Clearly, there's ample
room to cut. In fact, Vedder and Galloway estimate that each dollar of federal spending restraint
increases private sector spending by $1.38. <b>In plain English, cutting wasteful government
stimulates growth and creates jobs</b>. Since Republicans became the majority in Congress, we put
government on track to cut federal spending by $50 billion this year and last. But that's only a
beginning. This year, we will again cut spending and return power to the states to give the
taxpayers more bang for their buck.
<p>
<b>A New Vitality for America</b>
<p>
This Republican Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch will create a new vitality in our nation. Every family once again will have the opportunity and the freedom to pursue the American Dream so that our sons and daughters can always achieve a higher standard of living than their parents and grandparents. A rising tide of prosperity will lift the fortunes of all Americans --  unless President Clinton keeps us tied to the moorings of big government, as he did last year.
<p>
America faces a momentous choice this year as we decide which of two paths this nation will follow into the next century. Republicans believe we must pursue freedom so that families can earn more and keep more of what they earn. We must put our faith in the ingenuity and goodness of the American people, rather than the guile of the government, to get this country back on track. Ronald Reagan's return to freedom ushered in an era of historic prosperity in this nation. The President would take us down the other path -- the path of the stifling, big-government status quo.
<P>
It is outrageous for an Administration that stifled job creation by hiking taxes to lament joblessness. It is outrageous for those whose red tape choked off raises for working men and women to decry falling wages. The President and other liberals in Washington have the gall to blame Americans for the Clinton Crunch. <b>And it is wrong</b>.
<p>
The "blame Americans" strategy will not work. False promises won't alleviate anxiety about what the future holds. Public hand-wringing will not rekindle our national optimism. Angry words will not create jobs. And class warfare demagoguery will not relieve the Clinton Crunch. 
<p>
America's anxiety will ease only as individual families witness and experience success. Republicans have an agenda to rekindle that success, while the President has only empty rhetoric. It's not enough to say "I feel your pain" when you're the one causing it. The President must accept responsibility for his actions.
<p>
Congressional Republicans have an Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch by relieving the burden of taxes and big government.  Our program will restore faith in the American Dream as families, one by one, prosper through freedom.

<h3>A Tale of Two Pesos:  A Comparison of Currency Policies In Mexico and Argentina</h3>




<b>By Steve H. Hanke<sup>1</sup></b><br>Delivered December 12, 1995<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A sound currency is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the establishment of a stable government and the promotion of economic prosperity. This theme has been sounded over and over again by virtually all great economists in positions of influence.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After suffering the trauma of the 1922-1923 hyperinflation, no people has taken the call for sound currency and credit systems more to heart than the Germans. As West Germany's first Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, put it:  "Safeguarding the currency forms the prime condition for maintaining a market economy and, ultimately, a free constitution for society and the state" (Marsh, 1992, p. 30). Not surprisingly, Adenauer's economics minister, Ludwig Erhard, went so far as to proclaim that monetary stability was a basic human right. These sentiments are shared by all political parties in Germany. Indeed, one of the pithiest pronouncements on the need for sound money was uttered in parliamentary debate by Karl Schiller, the Social Democratic economics minister from 1966 to 1972:  "Stability is not everything, but without stability, everything is nothing" (Marsh, 1992, p. 30).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The German views on sound money are enshrined in the Bundesbank Law of 1957. That law charges the central bank with one and only one objective:  to defend the value of the German mark. And that is just what the Bundesbank does. Indeed, in the post-Bretton Woods era, the mighty mark has been the world's most stable currency (Deane and Pringle, 1994, pp. 353-354). This performance is, of course, music to the ears of most Germans:  a recent poll found that almost 80 percent of the Germans identify their Germanness with the stability, strength, and international prestige of the mark (Nash, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After bearing the burden of one of the world's most unstable currencies for decades, Argentineans appear to be following the path of the Germans (Hanke, 1995). In Argentina's most recent presidential election, all three major parties (which accounted for 96.2 percent of the popular vote) supported Argentina's Convertibility Law (Law 23.928). Under this law, which has governed monetary policy since April 1, 1991, the Argentine peso is fully backed by U.S. dollar denominated assets and is freely convertible at an absolutely fixed exchange rate of one peso for one dollar.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In contrast, Mexico's monetary policy is in disarray. Although Mexicans yearn for a sound peso, politicians from the three major parties and the technocrats who advise them have not been able to agree on a well defined exchange rate policy. The Banco de Mexico has allowed the peso to collapse during the last four presidential election periods and consequently has the distinction of being one the world's worst central banks (101st out of 108), judged on the basis of currency stability (Deane and Pringle, 1994, pp. 353-354). Given this, it is not surprising that the Banco has been unable to establish a transparent exchange rate policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Banco de Mexico's monetary policy remains incoherent. Indeed, the numbers contained in the Banco's monetary plan for 1996 are not plausible. The Banco assumes that real GDP and inflation will increase by 3 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively, and that the monetary base will increase by 28.6 percent during 1996. This implies that the demand for pesos will dramatically increase and that the velocity of money will dramatically decline to    -5 percent. Given the historical record in Mexico, this is highly unlikely (I.D.E. A. and the London School of Economics, 1995). Indeed, for velocity to decline to -5 percent, inflation would have to decline from 53 percent in 1995 to around 20 percent in 1996, and more important, such a drop in inflation and a stable exchange rate would have to be the prevailing expectation. Such a shift in expectations is highly unlikely, particularly given the central bank's low level of credibility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, it is important to mention that Mexico -- unlike Argentina and Chile, for example -- has also failed to produce a coherent program to cut public spending and to privatize and deregulate its economy. As the <i>Economist</i> magazine put in its recent  <i>Survey of Mexico</i>, "much of the economic liberalization of recent years has not been up to scratch. Privatization sometimes merely served to replace public monopolies with private ones -- amid much scattering of lucrative favors....  [And] financial reform was late and poorly regulated."  (<i>Economist</i>, October 28, 1995, p. 15). If this is not bad enough, Mexico continues to embrace the principle of wage-price controls. This principle was enshrined in October 1995, with the approval of yet another pact, the Alliance for Economic Recuperation (DePalma, October 30, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An incoherent monetary policy and half-baked economic liberalization are hardly the foundation upon which to build stability and robust economic growth. Indeed, this combination of policies is a recipe for continued financial and political turmoil in Mexico.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To avoid future turmoil, Mexico must correctly define its exchange rate regime. Exchange rate regimes come in three varieties:  pegged (fixed, but adjustable), floating, and fixed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Pegged exchange rates are favored by most developing countries. Some developed countries, most notably those that are members of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, also employ pegged exchange rates. This regime is not a free-market mechanism for international payments. It is an interventionist system, and should be rejected on principle.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In practice, pegged exchange rate regimes, not surprisingly, do not perform well. They require central banks to manage simultaneously a currency's exchange rate, the domestic liquidity, and the capital account. This is a tricky, if not impossible, task, particularly in developing countries, where the instruments for discretionary monetary policies are limited (Fry, 1995). Consequently, a pegged rate inevitably results in contradictory policies that invite a speculative attack. When under siege, a peg cannot last unless interest rates are raised to sky-high levels or foreign exchange controls are imposed. Alas, such episodes usually get out of hand and result in an "adjustment" to the peg (a devaluation).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is what happened with Mexico's old pegged system in which the peso was linked to the U.S. dollar. Under that peg, the peso was allowed to trade within a tolerance band of some plus or minus 3 percent. The band "crawled" downward daily, allowing an annual peso depreciation of about 4 percent against the dollar.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To keep the peso within this band, the Mexican central bank had to manage at the same time both the peso-dollar exchange rate and the peso money supply. This is a difficult balancing act, as Mexico discovered in 1994, and as members of the ERM discovered in 1992 and 1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Interestingly, Lord Keynes anticipated the difficulties posed by pegged systems. As he put it in 1923, "we cannot keep both our own price level and our exchanges stable. And we are compelled to choose" (Keynes, 1971, p. 126). Alas, despite the evidence, advocates of pegged exchange rates are alive and well. Indeed, some research institutions, notably the Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., are evangelical in their promotion of pegged systems (Bergston and Williamson, 1983).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To put the failure of pegged exchange rates into a broader context -- particularly in developing countries, where they are almost universally used -- consider the performance of central banks in developing countries since 1971, when the U.S. closed the gold window (Schuler, 1995). The median annual rate of inflation of the 126 developing countries with central banks has been double that of the 19 developed countries. And 37 developing countries have experienced annual inflation from 100 percent to 999 percent, and 19 have endured hyperinflation of over 1,000 percent per year. In the same period, 13 developing countries have confiscated their currencies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not surprisingly, the currencies of the developing countries have lost most of their value relative to the U.S. dollar. The median depreciation has been 79 percent since 1970. And if you reside in a developing country, it is difficult to legally avoid the effects of currency depreciation because 88 percent of those countries impose some form of exchange controls.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;And here's the saddest part:  The low-quality junk money produced by the central banks in developing countries has been a drag on per capita economic growth. Since 1971, the developed countries have grown at almost twice the rate of the developing nations,
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In an attempt to avoid being robbed by their central banks, citizens in developing countries resort to all means, legal or illegal, to get their hands on "high-quality" money. Consequently, Gresham's Law in reverse is at work in most of the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As much as some might complain about the U.S. dollar, the greenback is the world's preferred currency, with the German mark coming in a distant second. Indeed, between $185 billion and $260 billion in cash is held outside the U.S. -- 50 percent to 70 percent of the total U.S. dollar notes outstanding (Blinder, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Where have all the greenbacks gone?  Between 1988-1991, most went to Latin America. Since then, Europe has been the dominant destination, with Russia demanding the lion's share. In 1994 well over half of the total foreign shipments of dollars went to Russia, a total of about $20 billion. The rate of shipments to Russia has increased in 1995, with flows running at a remarkable $100 million per business day. After Europe, the Far East and Middle East now account for about 30 percent of the shipments, and the remainder of the dollars flow to Latin America (Porter and Judson, 1995). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The export of greenbacks is a very profitable business for the U.S. No other export can match the profit margins earned by the Federal Reserve's shipments of cash overseas. The Fed prints and hands over little pieces of noninterest-bearing green paper at almost no cost and gets hard currency in exchange. This amounts to an interest-free loan from foreign holders of those pieces of green paper. The Fed then invests the proceeds in U.S. government securities and turns the profits over to the U.S. Treasury.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The profits are huge, between $11 billion to $15 billion per year -- equal to federal receipts from estate and gift taxes. Moreover, it is a growing business:  Foreign holdings of U.S. dollars are growing faster than the U.S. economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unlike pegged exchange rates, floating and fixed rates are free-market mechanisms for international payments. Under a floating regime -- such as that which governs the U.S. dollar, German mark, and Japanese yen -- a national currency seeks its own level in relation to other currencies that it floats against. Although many currencies in developed countries float, few of the developing countries float their currencies, and for those that do float, it tends to be a short-lived experiment (Schuler, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though there is nothing wrong with floating, in principle, this type of regime is plagued with practical problems in developing countries, where most central banks have very poor records and lack credibility. Consequently, to achieve price stability under a floating regime, a central bank must impose a relatively restrictive monetary policy and relatively high real interest rates for an extended period. Alas, this would be accompanied by an economic slump or very slow economic growth. This is why few developing countries have adopted floating rates. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fixed exchange rates are favored by a handful of countries -- most notably, Argentina, Estonia, Hong Kong, and Lithuania. These countries employ currency board-like systems in which their local currencies are backed 100 percent by a reserve currency and are freely convertible into the reserve currency at an absolutely fixed exchange rate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consequently, a country operating under this discipline forgoes an independent monetary policy and becomes part of a unified currency area with the country to which its local currency is linked. Unlike floating regimes, currency boards have a rich and successful history in developing countries (Hanke, Jonung, and Schuler, 1993).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More than 70 countries have had currency boards. The first currency board was established in 1849 in the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, then a British colony. Currency boards spread to other British colonies and to independent countries that wanted to earn income from having their own currencies, yet maintain fixed exchange rates with an anchor currency. Most currency boards used the pound sterling as their anchor currency, but some used the U.S. dollar, the Australian pound, gold, or silver.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beginning about 1913, the currency board system spread rapidly, and eventually it reached almost all parts of the world. Currency boards were common in Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, the Caribbean, and Oceania. In South America, Argentina had a currency board. In 1899 Argentina passed a law re-establishing the gold standard and requiring the Caja de Conversin, previously a conduit for unbacked paper money, to hold 100 percent gold reserves for all new liabilities. The system became fully operative in 1902. The period of its operation was one of great prosperity for Argentina, which at the time was among the world's richest countries. Argentina suspended the system just after the First World War began, apparently because the government feared a drain of gold to countries that had already suspended the gold standard. Argentina re-established a currency board briefly from 1927 to 1929, but suspended it again in December 1929, as a result of the worldwide stock-market crash and the resulting cessation of foreign investment in Argentina. Both in 1914 and 1929, the gold reserves of the Caja and commercial banks were high, and the rationale for suspending the system appears dubious in retrospect (Hanke, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The performance of currency boards through out the world has been excellent. All have maintained full convertibility into their anchor currencies. Furthermore, countries with boards have generally had price stability, respectable economic growth, and balanced government budgets. (Hanke and Schuler, 1994).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What type of exchange rate regime should Mexico adopt?  A pegged system should be rejected on two counts:  it is unsound in principle, and in practice, pegged regimes have a poor record, particularly in Mexico. A floating regime, though sound in principle, is unsatisfactory for developing countries with central banks that have low credibility, such as is the case in Mexico. Alas, many free-market economists have recommended that Mexico float the peso. Two notable examples are Dr. W. Lee Hoskins and Professor Allan H. Meltzer (Hoskins and Coons, 1995 and Meltzer, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Apparently, these free-market economists have failed to pay heed to Professor R.H. Coase and his complaints about economists who engage in abstract theorizing to the neglect of acquiring a detailed knowledge of the actual institutions involved (in this case, central banks in developing countries). This, of course, is not the first time this type of error has been committed in debates about exchange rate regimes (Hutchinson, 1977).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Both on principle and in practical terms, a currency board for Mexico offers the most attractive exchange rate regime. Sir Alan Walters and I first argued in favor of this approach in July 1994 (Hanke and Walters, 1994). Specifically, we concluded that the peso was overvalued and that Mexico's crawling peg system would fall apart. We recommended that the peso should be devalued by 16 percent, to 4 pesos per U.S. dollar, and that a currency board system should be installed. By introducing a completely new and credible exchange rate regime, inflation expectations would have been dramatically altered in Mexico and the new exchange rate would have remained absolutely fixed at 4 pesos per U.S. dollar from that point onward. Hence, we are not "airy-fairy" devaluationists, as Sir Roy Harrod has called them (Hutchinson, 1977, p. 101).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, we are not the only free-market economists who see currency boards as the only means to achieve monetary stability in developing countries. Professor Milton Friedman, never one to overlook real world institutional detail, has written that:
<p><blockquote>
	[F]or developing countries, the case against using monetary policy primarily as an instrument for short-run stabilization is far stronger than for developed countries. The crucial problem for developing countries is to achieve sustained growth, not to smooth short-run fluctuations. In addition, such countries seldom have financial markets and banking institutions sufficiently sophisticated to permit what has come (most inaccurately) to be called "fine-tuning" of monetary policy.
<p>
	...  [F]or most such countries, I believe the best policy would be to eschew the revenue from money creation, to unify their currency with the currency of a large, relatively stable, developed country with which they have close economic relations, and to impose no barriers to the movement of money or of prices, wages, or interest rates. Such a policy requires avoiding a central bank. (Friedman, 1974, p. 274).
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So why has Mexico eschewed a currency board?  Many hypothetical objections have been raised. Most of these have been presented in a recent book (Williamson, 1995). And all have been refuted (Hanke and Schuler, 1994). But, the Mexican technocrats, unable to mount a substantive attack on the currency board system, turned to a practical argument. They claimed that Mexico did not have enough reserves to fully back the Banco de Mexico's liabilities (Buira, 1995). Even if this was true, it is irrelevant. A viable currency board can be started with less than 100 percent reserves on existing, old liabilities, if all new liabilities are required to have 100 percent reserve backing. In the past, this type of marginal reserve rule has been successfully employed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, while the fiat issue of pesos that Argentina's currency board inherited in 1902 was virtually unbacked by gold (which served as the reserve cover), new pesos could only be issued if they were backed 100 percent by gold reserves. Once the new system was installed, the demand for new pesos grew rapidly. Consequently, the gold cover for all outstanding pesos rose from only 0.11 percent in 1902 to almost 73 percent in 1913 (Hanke, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This leaves us with two unanswered questions:  How well did the Argentine currency board-like system stand up to the ravages of the so-called tequila effect?  And what lessons can Mexico draw from Argentina's experience?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The shock imposed on Argentina by Mexico's financial crisis had four distinct phases (Banco Central, Republic of Argentina, 1995). The first phase lasted from December 20, 1994 through February 1995. External drains from the currency board-like system occurred, with the central bank's liquid reserves falling from $15.8 billion before the crisis to $13.3 billion at the end of February. (Note that Argentina's system is not orthodox because only 80 percent of the system's reserves must be held in dollar denominated assets issued by foreign governments. These are called "liquid reserves."  The remaining reserves must be dollar denominated, but can be issued by the Republic of Argentina. Both types of reserves must be marked-to-market (valued) at current prices.) There were also internal drains of both peso and dollar deposits from commercial banks. Wholesale banks and small retail banks were most strongly affected. Two small wholesale banks, with a high proportion of their assets in Argentine government bonds, were suspended.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During the first phase, the broad money supply, M3 (pesos outside banks plus peso and dollar deposits), decreased by 3.2 billion pesos, or 5.8 percent, by the end of February. And bond prices fell sharply, with yields on peso denominated bonds moving from 22.6 percent before the crisis to 38.9 percent at the end of February. The prime rate on peso denominated loans also increased during the period, from 12.5 percent to 22.7 percent. Dollar denominated bond yields and the dollar prime rate also increased, but not by as much as those on comparable peso denominated instruments. The peso-dollar bond yields, for example, increased from 480 basis points to 934 basis points (Pre 1 vs. Pre 2 bonds), reflecting an increase in the perceived exchange rate risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The central bank took steps to tighten the link between the peso and the dollar. On January 12th, it eliminated the spread between buying and selling rates for dollars, making the rate exactly 1 peso = $1. It also required banks to hold their current accounts at the central bank in dollars instead of pesos (these accounts are used for clearing and reserve requirements). That reduced the central bank's potential gain from a devaluation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To increase the liquidity of banks, the central bank temporarily reduced reserve requirements on deposits on the 28th of December and again the 12th of January. On January 12th, it also established a safety net (lender of last resort facility) financed with 2 percentage points of existing required reserves. These funds could be loaned to solvent banks with liquidity problems. Previously, there had been a private, voluntary safety net to buy loans from banks with temporary liquidity problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Subsequently, the government took further action to assure bank liquidity. Decree 286 of February 27th created the Fiduciary Fund for Provincial Development to help privatize banks owned by provincial governments, many of which were notoriously weak. Decree 290 of February 27th amended the Organic Law of the central bank to broaden its power to lend to illiquid banks, and amended the Law of Financial Institutions to allow the central bank to play a more active part in reorganizing troubled institutions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The liquidity squeeze that the financial system had endured became a true crisis in the second, post-tequila phase, which started in late February 1995 and lasted through March. On February 27th, the international banks with branches in Argentina cut off credit lines to their branch operations, citing "country risk" as the rationale for such drastic action. This shocked branch bank managers and sent them scurrying unprepared into the domestic interbank market. The consequences were predictable. The interbank interest rates rose dramatically, from about 20 percent on peso deposits to over 50 percent within hours after the international credit lines were cut. Also, the massive entry of the international branch banks into the interbank market was interpreted as a vote of no confidence for Argentina's currency board-like system. Consequently, both external drains from the currency board-like system and internal drains from the commercial banks became great floods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is important to stress that the withdrawal of the credit lines from the international banks was the event that pushed Argentina from a liquidity squeeze into a liquidity crisis. Viewed from a historical perspective, this event is unusual, if not unique. With absolutely fixed exchange rate regimes, either currency boards or the classical gold standard (1880-1914), foreign banks have provided liquidity during times of liquidity squeezes (Hanke, Jonung, and Schuler, 1993; Gallarotti, 1995). Indeed, private foreign banks have traditionally acted as lenders of last resort in absolutely fixed exchange rate systems. This was not the case in Argentina, because its currency board-like system was relatively immature and untested. Alas, Argentina had to pay a price for the sins of its monetary past.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fuel was added to the crisis, when in the last days of February, rumors spread that the government might freeze deposits, as it had done with the "Bonex plan" of early 1990. Many people were also apprehensive that the decrees of February 27th were a prelude to broader powers that would reduce the rule-bound nature of the currency board-like system. There was also fear that a possible devaluation in Brazil would have effects in Argentina.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In March, the broad money supply fell by 4.3 billion pesos, or 8.4 percent; it reached its low point for the crisis at the end of the month. Peso deposits, dollar deposits, and currency outside banks all fell, reflecting a desire by many Argentines to hold their money outside the local financial system, either in dollar deposits abroad or dollar caches locally. Interest rates jumped; the peso prime rate increased from 28 percent at the end of February and peaked at 45 percent in March. Dollar interest rates likewise increased, with the prime rate peaking at 30 percent. The exchange rate risk exploded, with the peso-dollar interest rate spread moving from 934 basis points at the end of February to 1,647 basis points at its peak. Since dollar interest rates were many times those prevailing in the United States, market participants evidently perceived that there was a high risk that borrowers of dollars would default or that the Argentine government would interfere with loans and deposits in dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With the crisis worsening, the central bank took additional measures to further increase liquidity for banks. On March 10th it temporarily allowed all banks to use up to 50 percent of their peso and dollar vault cash to fulfill reserve requirements, and allowed banks that had bought assets from institutions with liquidity problems to use the remaining 50 percent in the same way. The central bank also used its excess reserves to make short-term loans (discounts and repos) exceeding 900 million pesos to solvent banks with liquidity problems. As a result of its loans and the reduction in pesos outside banks, the central bank's liquid reserves fell to a low of 10.2 billion pesos at the end of March, compared with 15.8 billion pesos in late December. However, at no time during the crisis did the ratio of liquid reserves to the monetary base fall below the statutory minimum of 80 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On March 14th, the government announced a package of measures, totaling 11.4 billion pesos, to contain the financial crisis. It accelerated privatizations. It reduced its planned government spending by 2 billion pesos, including cutting the wages of senior government employees by 5 percent to 15 percent. It increased several taxes, most important the value-added tax (a temporary increase of the rate, lasting until March 31, 1996, from 18 percent to 21 percent). And it announced plans to borrow up to US$7 billion -- a three-year US$l billion domestic "patriotic" bond issue from Argentines, a three-year US$l billion bond issue from private foreign lenders and US$5 billion from the IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Argentina's success in putting together the (oversubscribed) $1 billion Patriotic Loan turned the corner. The loan was a convincing domestic affirmation of the creditworthiness of the Menem-Cavallo administration, and the IMF et al. tagged along. This soon opened up the system with a fall in interest rates as dramatic as the February-March rise. The crisis was over.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the beginning of April to the presidential election of May 14th, phase three, the crisis leveled off in some respects and eased in others. The broad money supply remained approximately constant:  dollar deposits decreased, while peso deposits and pesos outside banks actually increased. Interest rates declined slightly; the peso prime rate eased from about 27 percent at the beginning of April to 24.5 percent in mid-May. Perceived exchange rate risk also declined, with the peso-dollar spread narrowing from 1,224 basis points at the beginning of April to 713 basis points in mid-May. And on April 12th, the government announced the creation of a privately financed, voluntary Deposit Guarantee Fund for peso and dollar deposits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite the crisis, the Convertibility Law continued to enjoy support across the political spectrum, including the three leading candidates and parties in the presidential election. Nonetheless, people were apprehensive about what might happen if President Menem were defeated or forced into a runoff election. However, President Menem's re-election in the first round, and the strong showing of his Justicialist Party in Congress, calmed the fears that a change in the government would undermine the Convertibility Law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After the presidential election, all monetary indicators improved, marking the last phase the crisis, which ended by the beginning of August. Interest rates fell; the peso prime rate fell from 24.5 percent in mid-May to 14.5 percent by late July, while the dollar prime rate fell from about 18.5 percent to 12 percent in the same period. The broad money supply increased, though by the end of July it was still about 10 percent below the pre-crisis level. Pesos outside banks, peso deposits, and dollar deposits all registered increases. Bank credit to households and businesses, which had fallen about 4 percent from the beginning of the crisis to the low point at the end of April, began to recover. Further, the central bank reduced its repos by about half between the end of March and the end of July, while its liquid reserves held against the monetary base rose above 90 percent. The perceived exchange rate risk also eased, with the peso-dollar spread narrowing from 713 basis points at the beginning of phase three to 500 basis points at the end of July.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the present, the Argentine monetary indicators roughly reflect the "pre-tequila" magnitudes. The peso-dollar exchange rate remains absolutely fixed at 1 to 1. And inflation for 1995 was 1.6 percent, one of the lowest rates in the world and the lowest annual inflation in Argentina since 1944. The central bank's liquid reserves increased by $3 billion during December 1995, to reach $15 billion, almost the pre-tequila level of $15.8 billion. Dollar denominated time deposits currently stand $500 million higher than those of December 1994, and M1 has returned to its December 1994 level. And the peso and dollar prime interest rates are 9.5 percent and 8.25 percent, respectively. Both rates are lower than their pre-tequila levels. The perceived exchange rate risk is actually lower than the pre-crisis level, with the peso-dollar spread currently standing at 359 basis points, 121 basis points lower than the pre-crisis spread. Like tempered steel, Argentina's currency board-like system has been toughened by the crisis, and as the peso-dollar spread indicates, the system is stronger than ever. In addition, unemployment has started to come down and economic activity is starting to show signs of life. So, Argentina's currency board-like system has proven its critics, such as Professor Krugman, wrong (Krugman, 1995). As the Duke of Wellington often observed victory is the avoidance of being crushed by an onslaught, and Argentina's currency board-like system has certainly kept Argentina from being crushed by the tequila effect.
<p>
<b>What lessons can Mexico draw from the Argentine experience?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Currency boards, much like the classical gold standard, provide a constraint on monetary authorities. This is not to say that the monetary authorities do not attempt to maneuver around the constraints. Indeed, writing about the gold standard in 1932, Professor F. A. Hayek concluded that "Every effort has been made to obviate [the gold standard's] functioning at any point at which there was dissatisfaction with the tendencies which were being revealed by it" (Hayek, 1984, p. 134). During Argentina's recent experience, the authorities also squirmed as much as they could within the confines of Argentina's currency board-like system. However, as much as the monetary authorities tried to maneuver and introduce discretion into Argentina's rule-bound, absolutely fixed rate system, they failed to shake its irksome constraints (Gallarotti, 1995 and Hayek, 1984). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consequently, currency boards create price stability, even in times of severe crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The hard budget constraints imposed by currency boards motivate deeper liberal economic reforms, as well as desired automatic adjustments in the economy. For example, before the Mexican crisis, Argentina's banking system was notoriously weak. Given that Argentina had no central bank that could print pesos at will or act liberally as a lender of last resort, many people thought that the weak banking system would be Argentina's Achilles' heel. It was not and is not. Argentina's banking system is rapidly being strengthened and consolidated, with a few weak banks going to the wall and many more being bought by strong banks. Now, 80 percent of all Argentinean deposits are in the 25 largest banks. In addition, virtually all the weak banks owned by the provinces are on the block in a mass privatization. The discipline imposed by the currency board has put in place a virtuous cycle. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; And perhaps most important, the results produced by currency board systems can give politicians a platform from which they can win elections.
If Mexico wants to clean up its monetary mess, it must ponder the lessons provided by the Argentine experience. By facing reality, even Mexico's braying pack of technocrats might finally appreciate that a currency board system is the only way for Mexico to provide Mexicans with what they yearn for:  a stable peso.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives too often approach environmental issues without a clear framework within which to explain to the public how the objectives of environmental protection and economic growth can both be achieved. This failure has allowed many conservatives to be characterized falsely as "anti-environmental."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is little understanding among Americans either of the need to reform environmental laws to maintain -- or improve -- protection for health, safety, and the environment, or of the fact that this can be done while simultaneously making them less burdensome to the economy. Until conservatives can explain more clearly why protecting the environment is not synonymous with adopting the "environmentalist agenda," they will be unable to build public support for badly needed reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although current environmental laws have not worked well, conservatives have not developed a cohesive vision to help Americans understand how these laws should be reformed. Moreover, when criticized by liberals, they have failed to challenge liberals to respond with proposals to reform these programs. It is important to show that the good intentions of current law often are accompanied by oppressive, senseless regulations. But it is imperative that conservatives also show why their policies would do a better job of protecting the environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically, conservatives should stress the following themes:
<P>
<b>THEME #1: The Failure of Liberal Policies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to explain that existing statutes have had many severe side effects. Among them:
<ul>
<li><b> Exorbitant costs with little return.</b> Conservatives need to explain that while costs have continued to skyrocket, the benefits being purchased have plummeted. Indeed, many of these increasingly expensive regulations now do more environmental harm than good.
<p>
<li><b>Property confiscation and loss of economic freedom.</b> Conservatives need to explain that private property is being taken from Americans through unfair regulation, and that many government "solutions" to environmental problems conflict with basic property rights.
<p>
<li><b>Lost opportunities cost lives.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the policies of the environmental agenda save few lives while squandering scarce economic resources that could be used to save more lives if dedicated to more serious risks. In effect, today's badly designed policies can kill.
</ul><p>
<b>THEME #2: A Positive Vision.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to articulate more clearly a positive approach to the environment that emphasizes:
<p><ul>
<li><b>An ethic of conservation.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the need to conserve  natural resources-- or use them efficiently --  is not in dispute. The debate is over how best to do that -- through markets or through government controls. For instance, a market-based approach would greatly reduce air pollution, and at far less cost.
<p>
<li><b>Property-based solutions.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the best way to achieve many environmental objectives is to create incentives associated with property ownership, not to issue thousands of pages of rules. For instance, property rights can be used to protect threatened species more effectively.
<p>
<li><b>Priority setting saves lives.</b> Conservatives must explain that not all things are equally important or urgent, and that regulating all risks equally means fewer lives saved for the dollars spent than would be the case if priorities were set. Conservative policies can save more lives. For instance, reforming Superfund would save more lives by focusing efforts on eliminating the highest risks more quickly.
<p>
<li><b>States do a better job than the federal government.</b> Conservatives need to explain that states are in a better position to deal with environmental matters within their borders than is the federal government. For instance, with the safety of drinking water supplies determined by states, the states would likely no longer squander resources obeying federal mandates that, until the Safe Drinking Water Act was recently reformed, required them to test for chemicals not even found in unsafe levels. Instead, they might focus on the far more mundane but persistent, serious, and largely ignored problem of bacterial contamination.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives have erred in putting too much political stock in the significance of horror stories -- absurd or onerous cases of environmental regulation. Public dismay at these stories does not signify broad-based support for deregulation. Americans understandably fear that if the "regulatory safety net" were dismantled, the country would return to the days of smokestacks billowing black smoke and burning rivers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is why the message of balancing environmental protection and a strong economy has fallen on deaf ears. The public is easily convinced that the argument for deregulation is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections. And many conservatives fan this fear by adopting decidedly anti-environment rhetoric. For conservatives to be successful in convincing the public to support more reasonable environmental policies, they must explain them far more clearly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A track record must be developed by which the public's hopes are met and their fears quelled. Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy, and a cleaner environment. The challenge is to show Americans how to obtain more of each.
<p>
<b>CRAFTING A SUBSTANTIVE MESSAGE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most Americans want both a strong economy and a clean, healthy environment. The problem is that environmental regulations can be enormously expensive, and can cost jobs and stifle economic opportunity. On the other hand, without environmental protections, robust economic activity, particularly manufacturing, often led to a deteriorating and unhealthy environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A generation ago, as people perceived that their quality of life was beginning to deteriorate, they began to support aggressive policies to reduce pollution levels. These policies frequently failed in their aims and became increasingly and unnecessarily expensive, but the environment did begin to improve. Today, many Americans are becoming aware that many of these policies are unreasonable and that, even when they work, they seem to bring only small improvements in the environment at a heavy cost in jobs and freedom. Moreover, many Americans are beginning to recognize that there often is no sound scientific basis for assertions of environmental harm or risk to the public. As families and businesses have begun to feel the economic effects and loss of liberty caused by these policies, the pendulum has begun to swing the other way.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like most other people, conservatives have no wish to return to the days of black smoke billowing out of smokestacks.<sup>1</sup>  But they do want common sense brought to bear in dealing with the environment; they want reasonable environmental protection without having to sacrifice their freedom. At the same time, however, Americans generally want to be assured that reform will not lead to environmental deterioration. In other words, they trust conservatives to create jobs but question their environmental track record. If conservatives want to win the environmental debate, therefore, they must build that record and convince Americans that they hold the same values.
<p>
<b>HOW LIBERAL POLICIES FAIL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While pollution levels have dropped dramatically since 1970, most of these reductions were achieved early in that period and at relatively low cost. From 1970 to 1990, total emission levels fell by about 34 percent. Over the same period, lead levels in the air fell 97 percent, and carbon monoxide levels in the air fell 41 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As late as 1986, the annual cost of environmental protection was an estimated $87 billion. Since then, it has doubled to $174 billion.<sup>3</sup>  Meanwhile, environmental gains, which initially were very great, have slowed to a trickle as the federal government has run out of easy fixes and then attempted to eke out minuscule improvements in the environment at huge extra costs. These costs now represent about 3 percent of America's gross domestic product (GDP), or almost $1,800 per household per year.<sup>4</sup>

<p>Bill Stamp's family in Exeter, Rhode Island, has been blocked from farming or developing its 70 acres of land for 11 years, yet has been assessed taxes at rates determined by the land's industrial value. As a result, this fifth-generation farm family may lose their farm.
<p>Environmental regulations to "protect" people can cause death. The best example is the set of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, intended to conserve energy and keep oil prices down. The only way auto makers can meet the CAFE standards is by building lighter autos. Unfortunately for drivers and passengers, lighter autos are less able to withstand the impact of crashes. This substantially raises the number of highway deaths; the expected number for 1989 model year cars alone is 2,500.

</TABLE><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Environmental regulations also have caused immense hardships for businesses and small property owners alike. In the name of protecting the environment, powerless individuals have been forgotten as their businesses flounder because of expensive "command and control" regulations that tell them what to do and how to do it. The cost to individuals often is not a factor in the design of rules. Likewise, and without compensation, property owners often are required to forfeit the right to use their land for its intended purpose because regulators want to use it for wetland preservation or endangered species habitat. This can ruin them financially.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, despite the skyrocketing costs and increasing hardship for ordinary Americans, the current system does not guarantee that the environment will continue to improve, or that Americans' lives will become any safer and their quality of life any better. In fact, there is much evidence to suggest the opposite. For instance, instead of working to protect species, the current implementation of the Endangered Species Act has become the main impediment to recovery of species.
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why is this?  Consider that not a single species has recovered as a direct result of the Act.<sup>5</sup>  The few taken off the list so far were recovered for unrelated reasons (for example, the Bald Eagle, which benefited from a separate law protecting it) or because they were listed improperly in the first place even though always numerous (for example, the tumamoc globe berry). But when a listed species is discovered on a person's property,  the government  may restrict the landowner's right to use his property productively in order to preserve the habitat. The result: Landowners threatened with losing their livelihoods and property have little incentive to help maintain habitat. Indeed, the opposite is true. They are encouraged to eliminate habitat, perhaps through clear cutting, before restrictions are imposed in order to escape the devastating financial consequences. Thus, instead of encouraging landowners to protect endangered species, the Act often encourages them to destroy them.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, some environmental regulations may be an indirect cause of deaths among Americans. A seminal Harvard University study found that 60,000 lives are lost unnecessarily each year because of the current regulatory regime. Dr. Tammy Tengs, now at the University of California at Irvine and the author of the study, summarizes this phenomenon: "[W]hen we spend resources on interventions that save lives at a high cost, we forego the opportunity to spend those same resources on interventions that save lives at low cost.... At our current level of resource consumption, we could double the survival benefits of our expenditures. Alternatively, we could retain our present level of risk reduction and, in addition, save billions of dollars."<sup>6</sup>

Viewing the problem from a different perspective, the regulations themselves can be fatal. Statistical analyses have shown that for every $7.5 million in costs the government imposes on the economy, overall worker living standards are lowered enough to cause one additional statistical death.<sup>7</sup>  When this formula is used to compare the number of lives "saved" by a particular environmental regulation with the number of lives lost through lower living standards, it turns out that many regulations actually increase the death toll.
<p>
<b>HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for conservatives to approach the issue in a commonsense way that people can understand. Given the general skepticism, they must stress that the environment is something they want to maintain and improve -- and show that they mean it, not just with environment-friendly rhetoric, but with substantive policies that benefit the environment. Only by building a positive environmental agenda and track record can conservatives show that their reforms would create jobs and economic growth while also helping the environment. People need to be told that, while environmental protection need not come at the expense of jobs, it will cost jobs unless the model of centralized control of environmental protection is rejected. A better approach would be based on:
<p><ul>
<li> A conservation ethic (freedom with responsibility);
<p>
<li> Property rights;
<p>
<li>Priority setting; and
<p>
<li> A strong state role.
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Need for a Sensible Conservation Ethic</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives traditionally have stressed economic growth while ignoring the importance of environmental problems. Thus, they have fought environmentalists step by step -- and have lost step by step. The reason is not complicated: Environmentalists have occupied the moral high ground, even though they typically have not provided the most beneficial solutions. In short, conservatives have been on the wrong side of an emotional issue.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are two lessons to bear in mind:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First,</b> what leftists and the public at large understand is that publicly owned goods free of constraints on use will be depleted over time.<sup>9</sup>  Garrett Hardin, Professor Emeritus of Human Ecology at the University of California, in his seminal 1968 work <i>The Tragedy of the Commons</i> showed that when a good is publicly owned (or "owned" in common), no one has an incentive to conserve or manage it. In fact, there is a perverse incentive to use the good inefficiently (to deplete it) as each user tries to reap the benefits for himself. This fact is at the heart of most environmental problems such as air and water pollution and species extinction.
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Ten percent of the cars and trucks on the road cause over half of the pollution emitted by autos  and 20 percent of the autos cause more than 88 percent of the pollution. Yet the liberal approach has been to tighten standards for newer, cleaner cars rather than to attack the heart of the problem  -- older cars and untuned cars, and especially older untuned cars, which pollute heavily. Rather than making more regulations that add hundreds of dollars to the cost of millions of new automobiles to reduce their already low pollutant emissions by a few percent -- and aggregate auto pollution levels by even less -- it makes more sense to cut pollution levels by making the real culprits shoulder their share of the burden. Requiring heavily polluting cars to pay locally set fees or penalties based on the levels of pollution they emit as measured by remote sensing (similar in concept to a radar gun) could reduce car pollution levels dramatically, and at a fraction of today's onerous and illogical regulatory approach. Indeed, a pilot program by the state of Utah showed car pollution could be cut dramatically and cheaply simply by giving free tune-ups to the worst polluters. Moreover, by driving up the cost of new cars, regulations cause older polluting cars that are less expensive to be kept on the road longer, which works against the goal of lowering pollution.

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second,</b> if there are incentives to conserve resources, people will conserve out of self-interest. Thus, giving people a vested interest in providing environmental benefits (for example, through property ownership and other positive incentives) encourages them to provide such benefits voluntarily.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When it comes to certain resources like the air and water, conservatives have tended to ignore the first lesson, and consequently have lost the opportunity to implement the second.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Freedom with responsibility for one's actions" should be the conservative message. Responsibility restrains wasteful behavior. The old environmentalist slogan "Make the polluter pay" actually is consistent with this message. But when they say this, conservatives and liberals mean different things. As Al Cobb, then Director of Environment and Energy at the National Policy Forum, says, "What the environmental lobby means by that phrase is that corporate polluters should be punished severely for any pollution whatsoever. What conservatives mean, however, is that polluters should bear the full cost of environmental degradation, but no more."<sup>10</sup>  Put another way, individuals and corporations should be given the incentive of reaping rewards for conservation and environmentally sound practices.
<p>
<b>HOW PROPERTY RIGHTS ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The free market actually encompasses the conservation ethic better than command-and-control regulation from Washington. A free market can occur, however, only if private citizens can engage in trade, and people can trade only what they own: some form of property. Thus, property is the cornerstone of a free market. If property rights are insecure or publicly owned, a market cannot function effectively. Some critics call this "market failure," but it really is a failure to use markets and their main engine: property rights. As a result, both environmental protection and personal liberty suffer. Resources that are not owned will be depleted or will deteriorate because neither protection of nor damage to those resources is part of the decision-making process. Others nevertheless are subjected involuntarily to the consequences of those decisions.
<TABLE  align=right width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
<ul>
<li>In the decade 1979 -- 1989, East and Central African elephant herd populations dropped from more than 1 million to less than half that. Yet in Zimbabwe, elephant herds have increased dramatically. The difference is that in Zimbabwe, hunting is permitted as a property right. Small villages that own the land on which elephants live and graze charge safari operators to conduct hunts. Since the villages profit directly, they have an incentive to promote herd growth to increase their income. In surrounding African countries, government bureaucrats seem unable to curb incessant poaching. But in Zimbabwe, villagers are constantly on the lookout for poachers because they cost the village income. Zimbabwe and a few other countries reward the conservation of elephants by allowing the conservationists themselves to profit from their protective behavior. In each country where this approach is practiced, elephant herd sizes are increasing.
<p><li>In Scotland and England, the popularity of fishing has burgeoned in recent decades. In these countries, property rights to fishing sites have developed which formed the building block for markets to provide access to prime fishing spots. As a result, many private, voluntary associations have formed to purchase fishing rights access.<sup>1</sup> In Scotland, "virtually every inch of every major river and most minor ones is privately owned or leased . . . . "<sup>2</sup> Owners of fishing rights on various stretches of the rivers charge others for the right to fish. These rivers are not overfished because it is not in the owner's best interest to allow the fish population to be depleted. The owner wants to continue charging fishermen for the foreseeable future, so he conserves his fish stock, allowing them to reproduce, and prevents pollution from entering his stretch of the river. If a municipality pollutes the water upstream, the owner of the fishing rights can stop it by suing for an injunction. Everyone wins, including fisherman desirous of quality fishing with some privacy.
<p><li>
One group's approach to wetland protection has shown the power of property rights to achieve environmental goals. Ducks Unlimited (DU), a group consisting of hunters and non-hunters alike, is dedicated to enhancing populations of ducks. To do this, it has purchased property or conservation easements with privately raised funds. Unlike other groups that started as hunting/outdoorsmen organizations but have largely lost their original focus, Ducks Unlimited has kept its focus on the protection of duck habitat.3 In the last 58 years, it has raised and invested $750 million to conserve 17 million acres of habitat in Canada alone, which benefits other wildlife as well as ducks. In 1994, it restored or created about 50,000 acres of wetlands. Since DU pays market prices for the habitat it protects, this group in many ways embodies the essence of the conservative message, which is to allow the market to determine the best and highest use of a good or resource -- in this case, duck habitat.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives should concentrate on explaining the innovative ways property rights can be used to protect the environment. The most efficient method -- and the one that best protects individual rights and freedoms -- is to enlist self-interest in the service of environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, property rights are under attack in the U.S. from the environmental lobby. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states, "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," but this has been interpreted to give absolute protection only against physical takings or complete devaluation of property. Most property-rights infringements, however, involve federal bureaucratic decrees that owners may not use their property as they see fit (for example, by continuing to farm it). Since the courts have been unclear as to the degree of protection these property owners should have from such intrusions, legislative protection is needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Protecting and using property rights, either in a stand-alone Act or as part of Endangered Species Act reform, would work to protect species in America. The Act does not work. Indeed, as many species are delisted because they become extinct as are recovered. The Fish and Wildlife Service now virtually ensures that threatened plants and animals will suffer because of the disincentives thrust upon landowners who understand that the value of their land and their economic security will be wiped out when federal agents tell them they no longer can make use of their property. Merely taking away this fear by promising compensation would be a large step in ensuring peaceful coexistence between species and owners of the property on which the species live. Moreover, property rights automatically will work to help species whenever there is an economic incentive to do so, such as protecting valuable fishing streams. But property also can be put to work to benefit species. If property owners were given financial rewards whenever threatened species bred on their lands, the species would not be threatened for long. It is no accident that cows, pigs, and chickens are plentiful in this country; people have an incentive to breed them. It is time this lesson was applied to other species.
<p>
<b>WHY PRIORITY SETTING IS IMPORTANT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Ask the average American how much a human life is worth, and you probably will be told that "no amount is too much."  This is the answer that Congress and federal agencies use to justify imposing sometimes staggering costs on businesses to reduce the risk of death by infinitesimal amounts. While this allows policymakers to posture as saviors of life, these policymakers also generally fail to understand that wasting resources in this way means not using them in other ways that could produce better results and save more lives.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy has a limited ability to absorb environmental regulations. Simply put, the country cannot afford to eliminate every risk. There is an inherent trade-off: Attempting to regulate one risk out of existence may mean having to tolerate others. Thus, it is critical that regulators recognize the opportunity costs of their actions. Spending enormous amounts of money to eradicate small or even hypothetical risks means not being able to use those dollars in productive ways -- publicly or privately -- that would benefit the nation more.


<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It makes no sense to impose burdensome costs on consumers by, for example, regulating chemicals that are much less dangerous than everyday risks which average Americans, understanding that the danger is minimal, willingly accept. Yet that is exactly what the government does. For instance, the government routinely bans or regulates chemicals -- sometimes at the cost of billions of dollars -- whenever they pose a one-in-a-million chance of cancer, while simultaneously ignoring non-chemical risks hundreds of times greater that would be far less costly to regulate.
<p>
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Priority setting will save lives and improve people's lives. The cleanup of old industrial wastes, embodied in Superfund, is a good example. The biggest problem with the law today is that cleanups are progressing at an incredibly slow pace, partly because money is being spent on lawyers to fight cleanups instead of on the cleanups themselves. Moreover, the law has stymied attempts to revitalize poor inner cities; few industries are willing to locate on sites there because of the risk of liability for cleaning up some former businesses' wastes. Also, it has been shown that fully one-third of sites pose no risk whatsoever to human health and safety unless residential housing is built -- and children eat the dirt. Thus, the standards often are inapplicable to inner-city industrial zones. The law should be reformed to speed cleanups by eliminating the barriers created by the current liability scheme, setting standards according to the real risks posed by the sites, and vigorously attacking wastes posing serious risks. Money should go to cleanup, not lawyers' pockets. This not only would protect poor people better and sooner, but also would allow inner cities to prosper again.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If lawmakers were seriously to consider which environmental policies actually save the most lives, they would scrap many costly rules and use the freed-up resources in other ways that save more lives. This commonsense approach would lead to levels and types of regulation that are very different from those which burden America today. In many cases, if the private resources used to comply with federal mandates were to be left in the industries concerned, or used in other ways in the local economy, Americans actually would benefit more, and far more lives could be saved, as the following <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/tp16c1.gif">chart</a> illustrates:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is why it is essential for policymakers to develop a priority list of environmental problems, based on the extent of the possible harm each appears to pose and the cost of reducing that harm to acceptable levels. Such a list would enable policymakers to know just how much risk protection is being bought for every dollar spent, and Americans to receive the maximum environmental "bang for the buck."  Conversely, the federal government could achieve environmental objectives at the lowest cost, and thus with the fewest "pink slips" for American workers.
<p>
<b>STATES ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In thinking of the environment, conservatives should adopt the environmentalists' slogan: "Think globally, act locally."  There is no clearer statement of the need for greater local involvement in protecting the public safety and managing natural resources. While the federal government may serve a valuable role as technical advisor, especially to less populated or less sophisticated states, the states themselves are in the best position to know the needs of their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Localities form the front line in protecting public safety and should be given greater deference in prioritizing what public-sector actions will best protect the public. Communities then could redirect their attention to the most important problems, thereby protecting public safety and the environment more effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals like to argue that the states, if unsupervised, would ignore the health and welfare of their citizens. Nothing could be further from the truth. Experience has shown that those lawmakers and government officials closest to the people are the most responsive to the people. Conservatives should point out that federal regulators in Washington, D.C., because they are removed from the consequences of their decisions, respond more to national political pressures than to the needs and concerns of those who should count -- individuals and businesses facing the environmental and financial consequences of regulatory decisions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must make it clear that in a time of budget constraints and the growing imperative to balance the budget, it simply makes no sense to spend federal money to combat exclusively local problems. States should begin to shoulder their share of the burden. Quite simply, there is no reason for taxpayers in California to pay for environmental problems in Montana, or vice versa. For instance, since hazardous waste sites by their nature are confined to very small areas, it makes sense for states to finance cleanups of "orphan" sites within their borders where no responsible party can be found.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must begin to rethink environmental issues. They have lost the debate for decades because they have ignored the simple lesson that conservation is a conservative ethic. This ethic -- which at its core is simply freedom with responsibility -- is pursued by conservatives in economic policy and should be pursued in environmental policy as well. If conservatives are to win the debate on this issue, they must acknowledge that all Americans want an environment that is clean and healthy. It is something to which all Americans are entitled. But they are equally entitled to jobs and a high standard of living. In short, they are entitled to a higher overall quality of life. Environmental protection is not the enemy of economic freedom or of a strong and thriving economy. The issue is how best to realize as much of all three as possible.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must tell the American people the truth about the failure of current environmental policy. There are numerous "horror stories" to illustrate how our policies are destroying lives and squandering scarce labor and natural resources on nonsensical or counterproductive mandates. But conservatives must be careful to articulate the positive message as well. Only this message will lead to both public trust and the needed mandate for change.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must explain how their policies can better protect the environment and lives. Whenever possible, they should explain that by refusing to prioritize risks when regulating, federal agencies systematically condemn thousands of Americans to death each year. In an era of limited fiscal resources, refusing either to get the "biggest environmental bang for the buck" or to save as many lives as possible for the money being spent is irresponsible and reckless.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The market is the best conservation tool available. By tapping into the powerful forces and positive incentives of the market and property ownership -- incentives that reward responsible behavior -- Americans can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously increasing economic freedom and growth. Once the public understands that a conservative also can be an environmentalist, the debate will be won.

Many analysts note that pollution levels were decreasing at that time without federal interference. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that pollution levels were much higher than today.

<p>

When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn addressed the graduates of Harvard on the eighth of June, 1978, they gathered in anticipation of an extraordinary event.  But in his remarks, which he called <I>A World Split Apart</I>, Solzhenitsyn eschewed the kind of fulsome compliments now endemic in commencement speeches.  Instead, taking advantage of the fact that Harvard's motto is "Veritas," he ventured to tell them the truth:  that "a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the West today."  Speaking barely three years after the fall of Saigon, he observed in Americans something approaching "a lack of manhood" in acquiescing in communist aggression, a trend he found most pronounced "among the ruling and intellectual elites."
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's speech, which might have been an opening wedge into closed minds, only made some Americans stamp their feet in irritation.  It was much easier to conclude that he was wrong than to admit that we had abandoned Vietnam because of our own cowardice.  So his speech provoked a firestorm of condemnation in the media, led by First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who claimed that the Russian writer had no understanding of the United States.
<p>
Though Solzhenitsyn, who had braved the death camps of the Gulag Archipelago and the interrogations of the Soviet secret police in his quest for the truth, hardly needed to burnish his character as a brave man by speaking the truth in Harvard Yard, the speech did prove to be the turning point in his public reputation in this country.  Because of his many unfashionable conclusions, the mainstream media decided that he was a crank, so the man who had been lionized in American literary circles was thenceforth shut out, dismissed, and ignored.  A host of ignorant charges were made against him, while his message to Americans was buried and forgotten.  Harper and Row, which published the address in a little book with the Russian text on one side and the English translation on the other, allowed it to go out of print by the late 1980s.
<p>
The antipathy of the media toward Solzhenitsyn was long-lasting and still has not let up.  When he returned to Russia in 1994, they hastened to conclude that he was just as irrelevant in his own country as they had deemed him to be in ours.  As <I>A World Split Apart</I> makes clear in its lucid discussion of the media in Western countries, they are not open to unfashionable arguments.  Their reaction to the speech was predictable, and in effect Solzhenitsyn's speech predicts it, at least in broad outline.  Thus, the speech was more than a reproach, from a friendly but frank observer, of America's loss of courage:  It was a demonstration of courage by the Russian writer, whose speech was also a deed.
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's example of courage in the speech had a practical effect.  The complacency of the media was not the only opinion abroad in the land.  Among American students of foreign affairs, and also the general public, there was a widespread and justified apprehension by the late 1970s that our loss of courage had left the United States at risk.  The war in Afghanistan, pursued in sharp contrast with the former caution of the Soviet Union, was one sign of danger; another was the impudent seizure of American hostages by the Iranian revolutionaries.  The 1980 presidential election, which turned on the difference between these two opinions about America's place in the world, marked an important turn in our politics.
<p>
In the decade after Solzhenitsyn spoke, American courage played a vital part in the collapse of the Soviet Union -- the most astonishing political event in the lifetime of my generation.  The stiffening of American resolve after the humiliations of the 1970s had many manifestations, but it was personified in the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whom Solzhenitsyn publicly praised.  From the beginning of his administration, Reagan showed courage unknown to his predecessor.  His prompt decision to fire air traffic controllers engaged in an illegal strike caused Americans and foreigners alike to take notice.  Even more important was the way he acted when he was shot in the spring of 1981:  We saw courage in his jokes, and nothing made him more formidable.  His subsequent willingness to call the Soviet Union an "evil empire" instead of falling back on the usual diplomatic euphemisms, and his evident resolve to prevent that country from achieving worldwide hegemony, made a deep impression on his countrymen, on their allies, and also on the Soviets.
<p>
By the time Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia, of course, the "world split apart" that he had described in his speech had been transformed by the American victory in the Cold War, which culminated in the fall of the Soviet Union.  The tense bipolar world of two superpowers, each representing a different moral and political understanding of man, had been replaced by the uneasy -- and sometimes unacknowledged -- triumph of liberal democracy.  Russia returned to the sort of remedial aspiration for democracy that held sway before its government was hijacked by communists during the Great War, while the United States greeted its own dominance with the sort of absentminded modesty that comes over it when it is not at war.
<p>
The sudden demise of the Soviet Union, like the fall of Saigon, was only the culmination of a long series of events, many of them little noticed or understood at the time.  The Soviet Union fell after its rulers realized that communism, which always left the Russian empire at a moral and economic disadvantage, could not keep up with technological progress in the free nations of the world.  That realization, which became widespread among well-placed Russians in the 1980s, made them lose heart about continuing their long-standing war of nerves with the United States.
<p>
It is not given to human beings to know the future, so we cannot be sure that the changes in the Soviet Union are irreversible, dramatic as their effects already have been in many parts of the world.  Powerful politicians who cleave to communism and prefer the old regime now control important offices in Russia and are bidding for the presidency.  The picture also is mixed in many of the former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe.  Cuba and North Korea remain unbending, though increasingly isolated in their backwardness.  China and Vietnam have begun to modernize their economies by taking some small steps toward a free market, but without dismantling communist tyranny.  In China's case, the transition has been accompanied by an unwelcome belligerency toward the interests and friends of the United States.  Therefore, the post-Cold War world calls for continuing resolve and prudence on our part, not relaxation or inattention.
<p>
But there is plenty of evidence in <I>A World Split Apart</I> -- and much more in Solzhenitsyn's other writings on human nature and politics -- that the Russian writer considers courage important not only as an aid to preserving a decent regime, which it has been for the United States, but also as a virtue that belongs to a properly ordered human soul.  Thus, courage is prized for its own sake as well as for its instrumental effects.  When Solzhenitsyn reproached us for losing heart, he meant to make us ashamed, not just afraid.
<p>
What is courage?  Ernest Hemingway described it as "grace under pressure."  John Milton wrote that a man who had it would "never...  submit or yield."  Solzhenitsyn's predecessor as an honorary American citizen, Winston Churchill, esteemed it "the first of human qualities" -- in fact, the one that guarantees all the others.  In his youth, he sought to win a reputation for courage.  He tells us in his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> how, after he left the military academy at Sandhurst, he carried out a private experiment by attaching himself to a Spanish column fighting a guerrilla war in Cuba.  Before he got too far into his career as a cavalry officer, he wanted to find out if he had courage enough.  On his 21st birthday, he came under fire for the first time and was relieved to discover that not everyone gets killed, or even hurt.  The young Churchill escaped unscathed, thanks to a well-fed Spanish officer who was asleep in a hammock between him and the enemy guns.  He did not begrudge the fat man his meals.  Keeping the example of his unofficial trial of courage in Cuba in mind, we can discern a few capital facts about it.
<p>
Courage has to do with braving dangers nobly.  It means surmounting the fear of wounds or death.  In his autobiography, Churchill tells us how he gave up a piece of skin from his forearm to seal the wound of a brother officer.  A brave man can endure the prospect of bodily pain or violent death, or even the reality of it, without flinching.  But the danger that he knows how to face has to have something of nobility in it:  Courage is shown in surmounting your fear of being hurt or killed not through illness or a car accident, but through war.  Therefore, courage is seen more in Churchill's being under fire than in his willingness to be flayed by the doctor to help his wounded friend, though as a brave man he faced both kinds of pains well.  This endurance, which is really just doggedness, is an important part of courage and distinguishes someone who has the virtue from someone who does not have it.
<p>
It was Aristotle who invented the distinction between intellectual virtue and moral or ethical virtue, arguing that courage was one of the moral virtues, along with moderation, magnanimity, justice, veracity, and others.  He showed us that, like other moral virtues, courage is a habit, not an opinion or a frame of mind.  It is not enough simply to praise courage, or even to understand it.  To develop a habit like courage, you need chances to practice it.  Hence Churchill's eagerness to put himself in harm's way:  You can't act courageously without having dangers to face, and you can't cultivate a habit of courage without acting courageously.
<p>
Aristotle argued that, again like other moral virtues, courage is found in a mean, in between an excess and a defect.  The courageous man is not too afraid of dangers, like a coward, nor is he too unafraid of them, like a rash man.  Of the two extremes, the ordinary human bent is toward cowardice, because people have a natural disinclination to suffer pain or death -- a disinclination that is perfectly reasonable.  But rashness is a vice as well, because the rash man lacks the steadiness and the prudence of the courageous man.  Churchill acted rashly when he jumped off a bridge just after his 18th birthday to avoid being captured by his brother and a cousin, who were chasing him.  He fell 29 feet to the ground, ruptured his kidney among other organs, and for a year afterward "looked at life round a corner."  But rashness can be turned toward courage by age and experience more easily than cowardice can.
<p>
If wanting to avoid pain or death is perfectly reasonable, then courage, which puts you in harm's way, seems to have something in common with stupidity.  Churchill admits as much when he says of his trip to Cuba, "You might call it tomfoolery.  To travel thousands of miles with money one can ill afford, and get up at four o'clock in the morning in the hope of getting into a scrape in the company of perfect strangers, is hardly a rational proceeding."  Being virtuous is supposed to be pleasant, yet courage requires you to stand your ground tenaciously even when the consequence may be pain or death.  A brave man will sometimes charge into the enemy line, but a horse never will.  A horse is smart enough to shy away, and men often shy away too.  Hence Hobbes's notorious description of a battle as a running away on one side -- or both.
<p>
Nonetheless, Churchill knew "there were very few subalterns in the British Army who would not have given a month's pay" to share his adventure.  A courageous man does not just run away from battle.  He is willing to risk danger because, for him, avoiding pain and staying alive are not the most important things.  Everyone prefers to stay alive, of course; but the courageous man gives even his own life the proper weight:  not too little and not too much.  He isn't willing to pay any price just to stay alive, because he isn't willing to live just any kind of life.  He knows that everyone dies in the end, so what matters is the kind of life you live.  The price you pay to stay alive is too high if it means your life is not fully human; and a life of comfortable self-preservation is not a fully human life, because it lacks risk and adventure.  In addition to the endurance or tenacity -- the doggedness -- that I mentioned earlier, courage involves daring.  The courageous man dares, and dares greatly, like Churchill, who as a young man took risks over and over again to get to the battlefield, and then took risks on the battlefield to win a name for valor.
<p>
Here is a clue as to why he ranked courage first among the virtues.  For human beings, living means taking risks, because we are neither omniscient or omnipotent.  If we knew everything that was going to happen to us ahead of time, we could foresee and forestall injury and perhaps even death, but then life would be dull and not worth living.  Or, if we had the power to master everything, we could overcome even dangers that we could not foresee, which again would give us the conceit of absolute assurance and a very humdrum life.  Churchill explores these possibilities in his essay "A Second Choice," published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.
<p>
This idea of becoming omniscient or omnipotent is the real aspiration of modern science -- mastering nature, overcoming chance, learning to control our surroundings, taking the risk out of life by making it entirely predictable.  For Churchill, this aspiration is misbegotten, as he suggests in some of the other essays in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.  Insofar as science succeeds in mastering nature -- and Churchill is impressed with the success of modern technology -- it adds to our power, but without making us better or happier.  As fast as we embrace the fruits of modern science, we find that the guarantee of a good life is still somewhere around the next corner.  And when men reach the limits of their ability to control the world -- for Churchill concludes that there are limits to our science and power, particularly when it comes to reshaping human nature -- then they may realize ruefully that what nature gives us is not so bad after all, compared to what we make for ourselves.  Indeed, that realization may prove a relief.
<p>
We do not have the kind of comprehensive knowledge that would allow us to avoid every wrong turn, but we can have a human wisdom that allows us to see a little way ahead, if we are prudent.  And we do not have the kind of absolute power that would allow us to overcome every obstacle and accomplish every wish, but we do have the human strength to make a better life for ourselves, if we act wisely.  Discernment is needed to guide our actions; that is the intellectual side.  But courage is the moral equipment we need to live in an uncertain world without letting ourselves be either reduced to malleable material directed from without (a cowardly surrender of our humanity) or seduced by the idea that human beings can control everything (a rash attempt to play God).
<p>
Modern science leads men into both mistakes by considering us at once as material beings undifferentiated from the rest of nature and as rational beings radically distinct from the rest of nature.  A more suitable and courageous posture is suggested by Aristotle, who found no mean part for men with the moral virtues (and no one who has read Aristotle will fault me for any originality in my treatment of courage, unless I have made any mistakes).  Winston Churchill's discoveries about courage are remarkably similar to Aristotle's treatment of that virtue in the <I>Nicomachean Ethics</I>.  Churchill was aware of this similarity, but he did not consider it a coincidence.  When someone recommended Aristotle's book to him and then asked Churchill what he thought after he had read it, the answer he got was that Aristotle's views on ethics were very sensible, but not very different from those that Churchill had formed on his own.
<p>
Courage is always a popular virtue, but especially in wartime, when it seems so obviously needed.  A coward is no use to others in case of danger, whereas everyone hopes to find a brave man fighting shoulder to shoulder at his side.  But courage is not useful only on the battlefield:  It also is a good sign that a person is worth befriending.  One who prizes his own comfort and life above everything else is too selfish to be a friend to anyone else.  Churchill mentions that, in his youth, men who had been in battle had an aura about them that was recognized by the girls they courted.  In this, the girls showed a nice understanding of what was good for them, since a coward is too selfish to give much consideration to anyone else -- even his own wife or family.
<p>
But a courageous man is not courageous simply because he seeks the esteem of others.  While that aspiration is a healthy spur to a young man learning to be courageous, it cannot be the motive of a man who has courage.  A courageous man does not sacrifice his own pleasure as he does courageous deeds, though he may sacrifice his own comfort; he takes pleasure in acting courageously, even if he has to endure pain.  The pain, or the risk of death, is a reminder that human beings are not all souls, that we live in bodies and are vulnerable through them.  It is also the reason that courage, as the first of the virtues, is on a lower level than others, like friendliness and wittiness, that do not require us to suffer pain.
<p>
Aristotle reserves courage, and the rest of the virtues as well, for gentlemen who have been properly raised.  But Churchill, though he does not turn up his nose at gentlemanliness, seems to encourage young men of spirit wherever he finds them.  He calls his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> "a tale of youthful endeavour," dedicates it "to a new generation," and in it exhorts young men "all over the world" to take their places "in life's fighting line."  He tells them that they should never "take No for an answer" and "Never submit to failure."
<p>
Churchill's autobiography, which is still in print, is an adventure story that rivals for color, incident, and vivid description the best stories of Mark Twain, whom he admired.  Churchill would approve of the study of his own life as a spur to ambition, a guide to political judgment, and a model of courage, just as he studied and learned from the examples of his father Lord Randolph Churchill and his great forebear John Churchill, the first duke of Marlborough.
<p>
But Churchill is not the only one who can teach us courage.  Solzhenitsyn's books hold lessons for us too, especially his most impressive book, the three-volume <I>Gulag Archipelago</I>, which opens a whole new moral universe to the unsuspecting Western reader.  Beginning with <I>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</I>, the only one of his books that was published in communist Russia, Solzhenitsyn explored the question of what gives a human being strength to live a virtuous life under the most unpromising conditions.  <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I> affords a lengthier description of the men who discovered their souls under the bleak and distant sun of the Soviet death camps.  One of the merits of Solzhenitsyn's account is to show how that courage cannot quite stand alone as a moral virtue, that it needs to be paired with prudence.  Aristotle had come to the same conclusion.
<p>
And if we are looking for American heroes, some of the same discoveries may be made from reading the memoir written by our highest-ranking Vietnam POW, Admiral Jim Stockdale, and the woman who staunchly waited and worked for his return, Sybil Stockdale.  Stockdale is a man of remarkable thoughtfulness, a careful student of philosophers like Plato and Epictetus.  He had plenty of time to think as he endured privation and torture in the Hanoi Hilton.  The book he wrote with his wife, <I>In Love and War</I>, tells the story of his captivity from both sides.  Both endurance and daring, and the way these two elements of courage have to be guided by practical wisdom, can be learned from the Stockdales' book.
<p>
At first blush, Solzhenitsyn's warning that Americans might lack courage to prevail over the Soviets now seems too pessimistic.  The United States is the only remaining superpower:  The Soviet Union lies in the dust.  American steadiness won the Cold War, though my generation has never experienced a hot war worldwide.  Still, we have only to go back to the Gulf War to remember how the United States formed ranks against a nasty aggressor.  Though few Americans were called on to make sacrifices in that war, our experience in Korea, or in the two world wars, suggests our countrymen will not shrink from fighting to defend liberty.  In retrospect, Vietnam looks like an exception -- not that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen were loath to put themselves in harm's way, or the American people (with some sorry exceptions) to support them; but our political leaders lacked steady resolve to guide them and to explain the war to their fellow citizens.
<p>
Up to this point, I have emphasized courage in battle or in other situations of mortal danger.  That is a necessary corrective to the penchant today to prefer so-called moral courage, or the courage of your convictions, to real courage.  People who have the courage of their convictions, which means sincerity and a certain determination, have the strength of soul required for all the virtues, but not necessarily the particular moral habit of courage.  Voltaire is famous for saying that though he might disagree with what you said, he would defend to his death your right to say it.  For this sort of remark, he is widely praised for having moral courage.  But as Harvey Mansfield points out, that is not courage at all, but only cheap talk.  Voltaire never defended to the death anyone's right to say anything, much less something with which he disagreed; and it is doubtful that anyone ever has.
<p>
Since the decision to end the draft for American citizens, most of our young people have no experience of military service or the possibility of risking their lives for their country.  This deprives them of the usual way of learning about courage in practice.  But I do not mean to suggest that if you have no chance to go into battle, you cannot have courage.  That virtue belongs not only on the battlefield, but also in the peaceable lives of citizens and statesmen.  There is reason to be apprehensive about the courage of Americans today, from the man in the street right up to the White House.  Students are more likely to know about George Washington's false teeth than his courage as a general and statesman, and shoppers do not even remember whose birthday "Presidents' Day" once celebrated.  Public schools aim to make students fit in or to give them a specious self-esteem rather than teach them examples of the virtues, and courage is one of the most neglected.
<p>
Stigmatized as aggressive behavior by people who are hostile to anything noble, courage is treated with suspicion if it ever comes up; but mostly, the politically correct curriculum simply avoids mentioning it.  The kind of challenging, competitive, or warlike occasions that call forth courage are neither studied nor experienced in the classroom.  By giving up any effort to instruct students in moral virtues like courage, public schools discourage them.  The student who has faced exacting expectations from a teacher is a rare bird, easily recognizable by the unusual demands of his self-respect; but mostly, little is asked and little is learned.  Unambitious, unaccomplished, unenterprising students make half-hearted scholars, but they also are ill-prepared for life and make an easy mark for the engrossing distractions of alcohol, drugs, and television stupor.
<p>
Yet when you neglect the spirited part of students' souls, they do not just atrophy.  High aspirations remain, and students learn courage, if they do, in their increasingly risky unofficial dealings with each other and the world.  Too many of them are punished for their courage if they stand up to gang violence; others learn to act courageously in the bosom of a gang on behalf of a bad cause.  Public schools and the media maintain a conspiratorial silence about the prevalence of gang violence.  Parents do not want to believe it and too often are oblivious to the problem, but students know all about it.
<p>
Students today seem starved for good examples, for some relief from the public school professionalism that chills their ardent curiosity about the right way to live and denies them the kind of rousing adventures that appealed to young Winston Churchill.  Teachers who love their subjects and hold students to high standards, academic contests with winners and losers, conversations in class that give students a chance to explore their own questions with the help of classic writings -- these traditional methods could bring some excitement back into the classroom.  Students would be as encouraged to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed textbooks replaced with real books as to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed facilitators replaced with real teachers.
<p>
The long-run effects of neglecting courage go beyond our schools to civil society, where a parallel professionalism makes courts ineffective at maintaining civil order.  In our political leaders, lack of courage manifests itself, as Churchill observed, in living "in the temperamental atmosphere of a Gallup Poll -- always feeling one's pulse and taking one's temperature."  The politics of meeting the demands of your constituents, of pleasing an often uninstructed public, of changing your stance to get re-elected -- in short, what you might call the politics of valetudinarianism -- is rampant today (not that cautious compromise is always wrong, or a shift in position always the sign of a craven politician).
<p>
But Churchill warns that that sort of politician is increasingly common in our democratic age.  As usual, he reflects on this subject in his writings.  As he writes in "Fifty Years Hence," an essay published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, "Democratic governments drift along the line of least resistance, taking short views, paying their way with sops and doles and smoothing their path with pleasant-sounding platitudes."  That's a good description of presidential politics today.  Few of our politicians understand Churchill's remark that "politics is almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous" because "in war you can only be killed once, but in politics many times."  Most of them are too timid to risk being killed politically even once.
<p>
In his essay on "Consistency in Politics" in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, Churchill explores his view of political courage.  He deprecates the small-souled kind of consistency that means unbending adherence to a certain position, no matter what the circumstances; circumstances change, so positions have to change too.  A larger consistency means that a man has "the same dominating purpose," as he writes, even if circumstances force him to throw his weight now on one side, now on the other of a durable political controversy.  For instance, it is impossible to say in principle whether defense spending should be higher or lower; it is only possible to make a practical judgment about what the current situation requires, which may change from one year to the next.
<p>
But, as his countrymen would discover in the 1930s when he began his brave but lonely campaign to warn them of the Nazi menace, Churchill had no time for the kind of politician who simply swims with the current.  Such a timid policy neglects a statesman's responsibility as custodian of his nation's abiding interests.  Representative government requires a certain courage in its statesmen:  the courage to show constituents their true interests instead of just reflecting their wishes.  Americans citizens need that kind of instruction as much as their political leaders need the political courage and discernment to offer it.
<p>
When Solzhenitsyn explored the reason for resistance to Soviet tyranny in the third volume of <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I>, he found it in the courage of some human beings who had, as he said, "a nobler conception of life."  Courage is the virtue that defends our liberty; it is also the first virtue of a man who is truly free.  Therefore, it belongs, in the company of the other moral virtues, with what Russell Kirk finely described as "the permanent things."

<h3>Eve Without Adam: What Genesis Has to Tell America About Natural Law</h3>
By David F. Forte<br>
Professor of Law, Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland State University
<p>
Heritage Lecture No. 570<br>
A <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a><br>
Delivered May 1, 1996<br>
<p>

In the spring of 1992, I was ensconced here on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation. There I was, ferreting out the historical basis of the Supreme Court's right to strike down legislation, when, from a few blocks away, the Justices graced my work with the following statement:
	<p>
<blockquote>At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. (<I>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</I>, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2807 [1992].)
</blockquote>
<p>
All that was mine?  I thought. You mean, I -- on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation -- could define "existence," "the mystery of human life," and the "universe" too?  Yes, said the Court. All I need do, the Justices said, was accept the right of the Court to "speak before all others" on constitutional ideals and to follow its lead no matter what qualms of conscience I might have. The Court made that statement, of course, to support the right of a woman to terminate the life of the developing human fetus within her. But somehow, the Court's declaration had a more ancient ring to it.
<p>
Normally when I speak at the Heritage Foundation, I talk about law. But I am not going to talk about law today, even though the Supreme Court has inspired this reflection. Instead, I want to talk to you about a cultural moment, a moment Russell Kirk worked for and, I am sure, prayed for all his life. We are at a time when faith and reason, which moderns regard as antagonists, are resuming a partnership long overdue. Faith and reason are, in fact, two pillars of Western civilization, and their reintegration comes at a time when the hallmarks of that civilization are disintegrating around us.
<p>
I need not chronicle the statistics of our decline. You are familiar enough with them. <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, Gary Bauer, Marvin Olasky, and so many others have described a society where each person has become disconnected with his fellows, where we create zones of privacy to find ourselves and lose everyone else in the bargain. We are a citizenry where to a large extent, metaphorically speaking, Eve exists without Adam, Adam without Eve, where neither truth nor permanence are seen as real and relationships of all sorts are fitful, episodic, and transient.
<P>
This may be an America where there are a thousand points of light, but each one illuminates only itself. Faith is an outlaw in the public square, and philosophy deconstructs reason itself.
<p>
It was not always this way. It certainly was not this way at the founding of the country. For, as the Founders knew so well, Western civilization was built upon both reason and faith: the faith of the Judeo-Christian revelation and the reason that discovered and applied the natural law.
<p>
Today, I wish to make but three points. First, I want to discuss something of the history of the alliance between faith and reason in Western intellectual history and their estrangement. Second, by referring to some of the elements in the Book of Genesis, I would like to affirm the basic compatibility between the principles of the natural law and the values of our religious heritage. Finally, I raise a caution regarding religious doctrine and liberty that any effective and principled alliance between faith and reason must deal with.
<p>
<b>Faith and Reason</b>
<p>
	The Greeks, who gave us so much, gave us the natural law school of thought, particularly in the writings of Aristotle. Natural law was subsequently universalized by the Stoics, incorporated into the law by the Romans, allied with Christianity, and finally raised to its highest exposition by St. Thomas Aquinas in his Scholastic philosophy. The school of natural law championed man's reason, his being, his capacity for sociability, and his virtue. The values espoused by that school dominated Western thought through the end of the 18th century and were included in the principles of the American Founding.
<p>
The Judeo-Christian revelation provided the other, complementary notion of the nature of man: created by God, fallen, covenanted, and graced with a divinely inspired mission.
<P>
In the high Middle Ages, the traditions of faith and reason reached their greatest level of integration in the natural law philosophy of Thomas Aquinas. Scholasticism constituted the most fully developed version of natural law, while of the faith of the Church unified Europe. Then came the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and the age of scientific inquiry. The link between faith and reason was weakened, and eventually broken. The age of Reformation and Rationalism was launched. Faith sought to undo the shackles of reason, while reason tried to free itself of the shackles of religion.
<P>
Important Protestant theologians found the good solely through the will of God as revealed in His Word, while rationalists forsook natural law thinking as being too close to religion. The Reformation disparaged the Scholasticism of the high Middle Ages. God's law was divine positive law, and no natural law could independently find the good.
<p>
Not that natural law was extinguished at the end of the high Middle Ages. On the contrary, the cultural force that the alliance of faith and reason had created lasted for centuries. Even though Protestant theology rejected Scholasticism, Biblical values paralleled the norms of natural law. Magnanimity was charity, courage was fortitude, fidelity was faithfulness, community was congregation. On the other hand, although few philosophers "did" natural law from the 14th century on, most traded on its fundamental norms. Sir Edward Coke found natural justice to be "right reason," which was the basis of the common law. John Locke presumed those norms to be in the law of nature, which both limited and gave legitimacy to individual liberty. When international politics degenerated into self-interested discord, Grotius, Pufendorf, and Vattel sought to revive a modified natural law to restore some moral order to the relations between states.
<P>
The Founders fully understood that a civil society could not be maintained without recourse to the intellectual values of the natural law and the parallel spiritual values of revelation. Washington knew how crucial that bond was. As he said in his farewell address:
<P><blockquote>
	Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and Morality are indispensable supports.... In Vain would man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should labour to avert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of Men and Citizens. The mere Politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them.... And let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion.
</blockquote><p>
By the 19th century, however, the connection between the mind and the spirit was finally severed. When religion and revelation could no longer restrain reason and positivism, the power of the state and the power of the unconstrained individual came to the fore. It is not much of an exaggeration that the problems of politics since the 19th century in the world lie in the contest between the supposedly self-sufficient power of the state on the one hand and the supposedly self-sufficient power of the individual on the other. The higher law that tames both is absent.
<p>
In the 19th century, natural law had retreated to being a Catholic intellectual discipline. It was disdained in the academy. A character in Stendahl declares, "There's no such thing as natural law. This expression is nothing but old nonsense."  A lot of "old nonsense" was done away with in Fichte, Hegel, and Marx, in Austin, Bentham, and Holmes.
<p>
It was not until the aftermath of World War II, in confronting the Holocaust, that natural law stirred again in the conscience of the philosopher and the judge. If the Holocaust was evil, pure and simple, then there must be a good, pure and simple. If we shrink from thinking that the Final Solution can ever have been a valid human law because its purpose was so utterly perverse, there must be a purposive standard by which we can know what laws are indeed legitimate or not.
<P>
And so the revival began, kindling in different places: Jacques Maritain in France, Russell Kirk in the United States, the Hart/Fuller debate. By the 1980s, natural law had once again become an independent philosophical discipline. Dozens of books and hundreds of articles poured out. Natural law as a vibrant school of philosophy has returned. It is something we have not seen for six centuries.
<p>
Today, in the face of the dissolution wrought by positivism, there is a renewed alliance between faith and reason. Natural law thought is flourishing, pursued by Catholics, Jews, and Protestants, while a reawakening to faith stirs throughout the country. Pope John Paul II calls a return to natural law values essential to saving Western civilization itself, while Protestant ministers and political activists from the late Martin Luther King, Jr., to Ralph Reed find in the natural law those essential human values that are confirmed by revelation. The "law written on men's hearts," as St. Paul puts it, is once again recognized by Protestant Christianity.

<p>
<b>Genesis and the Natural Law</b>
<p>
The renewed alliance between faith and reason makes eminent sense, for the fundamental view of nature and of humanity articulated in the natural law school parallels the divine definition of creation and man taught by revelation. The example I use today is Genesis, though there are myriad other instances. I do not do so as a Biblical exegete. I am not qualified for that. But I do know something about the natural law and find that its insights are confirmed in many parts of the saga of creation in the Book of Genesis, at least according to many common interpretations of that text.
<p>
Every culture's creation stories reveal its basic concept of what is human, what is nature, and what is divine. In Genesis, we have a compilation of creation stories. Taken together, they tell us in mythic language what reason has brought us to apprehend in natural law. In its own terms, Genesis tells us what natural law tells us. It speaks to us of natural man and created man, of conjoined man and disunited man. It affirms man's reason, his goodness, his unity, and his ego. 	 Let me discuss just three parts of Genesis in relation to the natural law: the creation of the material world, the creation of man, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
<p>
Now, I am not going to talk about the creationism, or sin, or sex. If you want to talk about evolution, let's discuss it over coffee. If you want to talk about sin, perhaps we can do that over a beer. If you want to talk about sex, sorry, I'm a married man.
<p>
Let us start with the account of creation in the first chapter:
<p><blockquote>
	In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless waste, and darkness covered the abyss, and the mighty wind [the spirit of God] swept over the waters. (Genesis 1:1-2.)
</blockquote><p>
In that one majestic verse, God's creation astonishes us in two simultaneous ways. First, He creates everything ("the heavens and the earth") out of nothing. Second, He brings order out of chaos. In the image of the ancient Hebrews, the stuff of the cosmos was water, and water symbolized chaos -- which God orders. Think for a moment of the difference between farmers and fishermen: A farmer subdues the land and makes it his servant, but an experienced fisherman knows he is always a stranger on the sea and is never home till he reaches shore.
<p>
In Genesis, God's mighty spirit moves across the water, pushing it where He wills. He orders chaos itself. Recall in the New Testament, when Jesus awakens in the boat to still the storm that was threatening to overwhelm the disciples. "Who can this be," they ask in awe, "that the wind and the sea obey him?"  (Mark 4:41.) The disciples understood that this was no ordinary wonder-worker. In Genesis, God pushes the water out of the world by creating a domed firmament and separates the remaining water in the world into seas while permitting some of the remaining cosmic waters to sluice in as rain through holes in the dome, or bubble up from below through springs (oases perhaps) or rivers.
<p>
The point of creation is that without order, there would not be nothingness, but utter chaos. Let us reflect on that. People will give up their lives for order. They will die for their country, their faith, their family, or their friends. But a life without meaning leads to despair. Chaos, not death, holds the real terror for man. In the most primeval sense, a terrorist does the devil's work.
<p>
Notice also in this first chapter, that as soon as God controls chaos, pushing a mighty wind over the seas, He creates light. (Genesis 1:3.) Light is the greatest of the elements. Light is good. It illuminates the order he is creating. It is understanding. Throughout scripture, the notion of light is always seen as illuminating an understanding of the inner reality of things.
<p>
Finally, God proceeds, in a measured and deliberative manner, to create the remainder of material reality. Even with their pre-scientific notions, the Hebrews understood that everything created was logically and organically interrelated, and that reality was created in a purposeful manner from the most basic to the more refined. There is a purpose and a point to creation. It leads to man. And in finishing the work of creation, God said that it was good. (Genesis 1:31.)
<p>
In this most fundamental description of reality, natural law concurs. In natural law, reality is objective and ordered, and man is organically part of it. Socrates taught that man's reason could apprehend and illuminate this reality. He spent his life battling the Sophists, who saw only chaos underlying everything. Plato sought to discover the good that was the ultimate reality. Aristotle found that the world was the result not of chance, but of intelligent intention. He taught that change was not chaotic, but purposeful, wherein each thing moves to fulfill its own nature, and that being -- existence itself -- was in its very nature, good. All these elements were synthesized in Aquinas.
<P>
Similar parallels are in the account of man.
<p>
In the first chapter of Genesis, God creates man and woman equally in his image; that is, unlike the animals, men and women are to reflect the divine. In the second story of creation, God creates man (adam = universal humanity) and finds that "it is not good for man to be alone, I will make a suitable partner for him."  (Genesis 2:18.) God's creation is incomplete. It is not yet "good."  In natural law, too, things are good only when their nature is fulfilled, when their potentialities are brought to completion.
<p>
In Genesis, for man (that is, mankind in its individualization) to be complete, he needs a helpmeet. Likewise, in the natural law tradition, Aristotle insists that man cannot truly flourish as a human unless he is associated together in the polity. From Aristotle on, the natural law tradition emphasizes the fundamental good of friendship, defined as seeking the good of the other. In Genesis, there is a special complementarity in the friendship of a man and a woman, which becomes the fundamental experience of the good of sociability of each individual.
<p>
In natural law, sociability (which I think is natural law's unique contribution to understanding contemporary problems) is something without which man cannot flourish as a human person. It has its most intense fulfillment in the relations between a man and a woman in the family. That ordering of human relations is a fundamental good attached to human nature itself.
<p>
We can see already how radically similar the views of revelation and natural law are on the nature of reality and of man. Order, reason, community, purposeful action, the goodness of being, sociability, sexual complementarity are essential to both.
<p>
Now we come to the part of the story that everybody knows best: the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Adam and Eve, you recall, could eat of all the fruit of the trees in the Garden except one. But the serpent was a persuasive advocate:
<p><blockquote>
	The serpent asked the woman, "Did God really tell you not to eat from any of the trees in the garden?"  The woman answered the serpent: "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, `You shall not eat it or even touch it, lest you die.'"  But the serpent said to the woman: "You certainly will not die!  No. God knows well that the moment you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad."  The woman saw that the tree was good for food, pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some of the fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. (Genesis 2:1-7.)
</blockquote><p>
The serpent said three things about this tree. Fruit is sweet tasting. Knowledge is a delight. And you can be like God. Now, I love caramel sundaes, but I can turn down a sweet. I revel in the life of the mind, but I don't really have to know everything. But to be like a God -- that's a dizzying prospect. The exegetes tell us that the temptation to Eve and to Adam was to define for oneself what the scheme of good and evil is instead of apprehending what is objectively good for man. If I can define for myself for my own world, if I can determine what is good and evil, then for that little world of my making, I am a god. The serpent did say something else. He said Eve would not die. In the end, the promise to be a god, as enticing as it may be, is always a false promise.
<p>
By eating the fruit, Eve names good and evil for herself. Remember that earlier in this chapter of Genesis, God had given Adam the right to name the animals, to distinguish them, to find their inner scientific order. But the naming of good and evil, God retains to himself. Man was given reason to apprehend good and evil, but he does not, in his nature, possess the capacity for creating it.
<p>
Aristotle teaches that a just man is one who practices virtue, and he defines virtue as the habit of acting rightly. When one acts rightly, one reflects or participates in the objective moral order (the image of God in the words of Genesis). But when one defines the moral order for himself, he images nothing but his own will. By definition, under the natural law, one cannot act virtuously if one is knowingly acting outside of the objective moral order.
<p>
Having asserted one's own will as defining good and evil, the results ineluctably follow. For, as the story of creation predicted, without order there is not nothingness, but the terror and distress of chaos.
<p>
There is first the disorder of the soul, in the form of shame. Second, social cohesion is shattered. God strolls through the Garden of Eden and accuses Adam of eating of the forbidden tree. And Adam dissembles: "The woman whom you put here with me -- she gave me fruit from the tree, and so I ate it."  (Genesis 2:12.) Even in the garden of Eden, the man abandons the woman. They are no longer friends. The bonds of sociability are broken. As soon as we take unto ourselves the right to define good and evil, we jettison the interconnectedness between one another that our natures call us to have. Trust vanishes.
<p>
Lest you think that such insights come only from a religious tradition, let me read to you Cicero:
<blockquote><P>
	True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts wrongdoing by its prohibitions.... It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times, and there will be one master and ruler, that is, God, over us all, for he is the author of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. Whoever is disobedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature, and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties, even if he escapes what is commonly considered punishment. (<I>De Republica</I> 3:21.)
</blockquote><p>
Cicero never read Genesis.
<p>
The Supreme Court's definition of human nature in <I>Casey</I> has given us Eve without Adam, and Adam without Eve. We are solitary autonomous beings, unconnected, without responsibility for each other. The Court empowers us to define ourselves, to create our own universe, to be, as Genesis predicted, "like God."  In the same way in which the Supreme Court makes law without a constitutional standard, it has declared that there is no rule of law against which we must measure our own actions. We make the rule of law for ourselves, each one a different rule of law. So, for example, we often hear the familiar non sequitur, "I believe abortion is the taking of human life, but I would never want to impose my values on you."  It denies us the fundamental natural law standard of an objective basis of morality, and equally denies us the opportunity to strive to that perfection to which we are constituted.
<p>
That is our world today, and it comes from the disdaining of religion and of reason. The world of deconstructed philosophy, of private moralities, of God that cannot be mentioned in the public square leaves Eve without Adam, unborn children without their mothers, born children without their fathers, and the dying without hope. The homeless are not just those we see on the streets. Such a world leaves us all homeless. That is the Faustian bargain that the Supreme Court offers us in <I>Casey</I>.
<p>
Thus, there is little wonder that the philosophers of the school of natural law and the followers of revealed religion find themselves in a political, intellectual, and moral alliance today.

<p>
<b>Religious Doctrine and Human Liberty</b>
<p>
For the alliance of reason and faith to be effective, it must contend with issues of doctrine and with issues of liberty. The beauty of the natural law philosophy is that it is universal. It calls upon all persons to consider and freely to order their lives by an objective moral standard. Whether or not creationism can be justified scientifically, the rest of our society perceives it solely as a religious doctrine. Whether or not contraception is contrary to the natural law, the rest of our society perceives it as a Catholic doctrine. A simple rule of prudence requires that those values not be imposed. This is not to say, however, that the scientific shortcomings of evolutionary theory cannot be discussed. They should be. Nor that contraceptives should be distributed in the schools. We know the objective harm that brings and the invasion of the family it constitutes. But that is different from imposing those values as doctrines. Abortion, obviously, is qualitatively different because it is a universal question of how a moral society treats dependent life.
<p>
The other issue is liberty. Two points should be made here. First, we sometimes forget that under the plan of God, mankind was utterly free, except for eating of the tree of good and evil. As Pope John Paul II emphasizes, freedom and virtue depend upon there being an objective order, which we can accept or not. Without an objective moral order, there is no true freedom, for it has nothing to measure itself against. Second, modern natural law theory must acknowledge the great advances in the justification for liberty that 18th century natural rights theory made. Modern natural law theory, in its mature form, finds the freedom of the human individual rooted in the good, and holds that political authority is contingent upon that human freedom.
<p>
But what natural law offers in addition is that the free, flourishing individual prospers in his social relations, most especially in the family. What Adam Smith and John Locke presumed in their vaguely perceived notions of natural law and in the social experience of the Enlightenment was that these social relations would flourish of themselves. For the most part they were right. But we have learned in the two centuries past, and especially in this country, that those relations, the family, are much more fragile than we imagined and that for true liberty to be enjoyed, such relations need to be fostered and nurtured. For natural law not only judges what human laws ought not to be passed, but also illuminates the benign face of the law: It looks to those laws that ought to be enacted to assist human persons in the flourishing of their free individual personalities. Natural law is not only imperative; it is aspirational.
<P>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
When a philosophy -- even one like natural law -- is in the ascendancy, intellectual fatigue, as well as impatience with the imperfections any human system has, slowly brings on criticism and perhaps even rejection. But when order threatens to break down altogether, when chaos looms, then the mind reaches back to the stability of principle. Man cannot abide error for too long, for error produces a disintegration, a disorder of the soul, and a disorder of society. We can live a complex life; we can live a life of contradictions; but we cannot live an absurd life. That is our nature.
<p>
Whenever subjective relativism and objective truth have come into contest, whenever the choice is one or the other, man will ultimately opt for the truth, no matter how discomfiting it may be. Just look at whom we choose for heroes:
<p>
Is it Antigone or Creon?
<p>
Socrates or Alcibiades?
<p>
Is it Ruth, who embraces the One God despite the humiliation it brings, or her sister-in-law Orpah, who remains comfortable with the pagans?
<p>
Is it Lincoln or Douglas?
<p>
Solzhenitsyn or Brezhnev?
<p>
Jesus or Pilate?
<P>
Only when faith and reason are rejoined in mutually respecting friendship and are cognizant of liberty can the bonds of civil society, of civilization itself, be renewed. That moment may be upon us once again. May it come soon.

Sidebar: <a href="#rector">In Welfare Reform, Governors Miss the Point</a> by Robert Rector.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since the Republican victories of November 8, 1994, the press has focused on the dramatic changes in Congress. With a net gain of 52 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and eight seats in the U.S. Senate, the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Party-switching and special elections have since left the partisan balance in the House of Representatives at 236 Republicans to 198 Democrats (with one independent); in the Senate, it is 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This shift in party control certainly changed the direction of the national policy debate in Washington. Less than two years ago, Congress was seriously debating President Clinton's attempt to nationalize the entire health-care industry. And just a year earlier, Congress passed and Clinton signed a budget that contained what Democratic senator Pat Moynihan called the largest tax increase in the history of the world. Since the elections of 1994, however, the debate in Washington has centered on how to cut taxes and balance the budget in a way that would, over time, cut the size of the federal government from 21.2 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product to roughly 17 percent. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	
Yet the intense focus on Washington, D.C., has obscured the conservative revolution within the states. In some ways, the changes occurring in state capitals across the country are even more important than those inside the Beltway. Conservative reforms at the state level make similar efforts in Washington both more likely and, oddly, less important. The states have led the way so far, and they are quite prepared to march ahead, even if the revolution in Washington stalls.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although less visible, the 1994 shift in partisan control was more pronounced at the state and local levels than in Washington. Republicans won 24 of 36 gubernatorial races to increase the number of statehouses in their column from 19 to 30. With Mike Foster's victory in last year's gubernatorial election in Louisiana, Republicans now occupy 31 statehouses. More than 72 percent of the American people now live in states with Republican governors. Within state legislatures, the GOP gained 105 senate seats and 367 house seats in 1994 to gain control of seven upper chambers and 10 lower chambers. Since that election, 50 state legislators have switched to the GOP. 
<p>
<img src="norq.gif" align=center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These gains have historic consequences. Prior to the 1994 elections, Democrats controlled the governorship and both legislative chambers in 17 states. In these states, all labor law, election law, budgeting and taxes, redistricting, and judicial appointments were fully controlled by the Democratic Party. Republicans exercised similar control in just four states: Utah, Arizona, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. Today, the Democratic Party controls the governorship and the legislature only in Hawaii, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Maryland, while Republicans reign supreme in 15 states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nationwide shift to Republican governors affects the content of the policy debate in at least two ways. First, it intensifies the pressure from the states for more autonomy. In fact, strong lobbying by governors such as Bill Weld of Massachusetts, George Voinovich of Ohio, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, and John Engler of Michigan was crucial to Republicans' efforts in the fall of 1995 to pass their historic budget, designed to give states unprecedented power over welfare and Medicaid programs.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, a Republican Congress is more likely to fulfill its commitment to "devolution" knowing that ideologically sympathetic governors are at the helm in many key states. Despite the Republican Party's dedication to federalism, is it plausible that Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole would have fought so hard to send billions of dollars with few conditions over the next seven years to Ann Richards or Mario Cuomo to run Medicaid, welfare, and other programs? Liberal governors would have gladly spent the money, then denounced Republican policies for ending entitlements. And a conservative party would have been irresponsible to hand billions in unrestricted federal dollars to its political enemies, who could use the money to hire Democratic precinct workers and build political machines to destroy Republican congressmen and senators. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The historic shift was not just a matter of <I>more</i> Republican governors. The high quality of these governors was also critical. A conservative Congress would have been rightly wary of handing power and money over to yesteryear's generation of Republicans -- including Nelson Rockefeller of New York, Bob Ray of Iowa, Bill Milliken of Michigan, and James Rhodes of Ohio-whose records on spending, taxes, and the role of government were indistinguishable from that of Cuomo or Richards. Newt Gingrich is to Bob Michel as Michigan's John Engler is to Milliken, as New York's George Pataki is to Rockefeller. This profound ideological shift among governors and state legislators has occurred in more than 25 states.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The emergence of conservative Republican leadership simultaneously at the national and state levels was no coincidence. In the 1980s, Newt Gingrich learned from John Engler, then majority leader of the Michigan state senate, that many state legislators drove to attend legislative sessions. By sending them Republican audio tapes to listen to on these drives, Gingrich began to coordinate a conservative political message across the nation. The reforms that Engler and Tommy Thompson later pushed through their respective legislatures revealed what Republican governance could achieve. Their ideas for welfare reform, which predated the 1994 election, served as a national model for Republicans. The press attacked Engler savagely for ending general welfare for some 80,000 able-bodied men. But his recovery and the victories of Republican state senators running only six months later proved again that voters value effective policy over partisan polemics.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Washington, political reform has been frustrated by a recalcitrant Senate and Bill Clinton's veto pen. Of the Contract With America's 10 specific items, Congress has passed only the line-item veto, procedural reforms in the House of Representatives, and the Congressional Accountability Act, which brings Congress somewhat under the same laws it imposes upon business. The House has passed the Balanced Budget Amendment, regulatory reform, and other legislation, only to see them watered down or stopped in the Senate. Bill Clinton has twice vetoed welfare reform, and a relatively narrow tort-reform bill was passed over his veto.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the meantime, the states have not stood still. The new generation of Republican governors and state legislators is advancing the Republican reform agenda -- from tax cuts to tort reform. Here are a few of the critical issues raised by the Contract With America and addressed by the states. They provide a blueprint for future work in Washington:<p><b>Taxes</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993, Clinton campaign strategist James Carville announced that the off-year governor's race in New Jersey between incumbent Democrat Jim Florio -- who had raised taxes in 1989 -- and his challenger Christine Todd Whitman -- who called for a 30 percent across-the-board income-tax cut -- would be the burial ground of Republican advocacy of tax reduction.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Carville misidentified the cadaver. Whitman made the last month of the campaign a clear referendum on her tax-cut proposals, and it worked. Whitman's victory was critical in ensuring that tax cuts would be prominent in the Contract With America a year later.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, while Republicans in Congress were debating a $500-per-child tax credit and cutting the capital-gains tax in half, 17 states with Republican governors cut taxes. In addition, Bill Weld in Massachusetts and Kirk Fordice in Mississippi pushed for tax cuts but faced overwhelming opposition by Democratic legislatures. Arizona governor Fife Symington won an income-tax reduction of $130 million in 1994 and $200 million in 1995, and plans to phase out the income tax over the next four years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And in New Hampshire, Governor Steve Merrill demonstrated that taking the no-income-tax pledge remains a powerful campaign weapon and effective tool for governing. The Taxpayer-Protection Pledge -- made famous when George Bush won the Republican nomination and presidency because he took the pledge and then lost re-election when he broke it -- was born in New Hampshire in 1972. Since then, no one who has not taken the pledge has ever won the governorship of the state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the 1994 elections, Merrill had the happy idea of extending the pledge against a sales or income tax increase to the campaigns for the state senate. Before the election, there were 13 Republicans in the state senate and 11 Democrats. Merrill led a slate of 23 Republicans who took the pledge as a team (foreshadowing the Contract With America); as a result, the Republicans seized 18 of 25 state senate seats and drove from office two Republicans known in New Hampshire as RINOs, or Republicans in Name Only, who had voted with the other party. In 1996, all 395 members of New Hampshire's house of representatives will be asked to take the pledge, separating the RINOs from the Merrill low-tax Republicans. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Taxpayer activists in 40 states are now pushing state legislators, governors, and candidates for those offices to take a state taxpayer-protection pledge. Mike Foster won the governorship of Louisiana as a pledge-taker, and Alabama's Fob James signed the pledge in early 1996 to highlight his consistent opposition to tax increases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This state emphasis on holding down taxes has already produced results. In Kansas, Governor Bill Graves passed legislation cutting the automobile tax in half over five years and repealing a 2.5 percent sales tax on labor used in new construction and on utilities used in manufacturing. Graves also enacted a two-year moratorium on the collection of unemployment taxes from many Kansas businesses, saving them nearly $275 million. Iowa governor Terry Branstad is pushing legislation to phase out over six years the property tax on machinery and equipment, which is now taxed at 30 percent of its original cost. In New Hampshire, Merrill reduced the tax rate on business profits to its lowest level in 14 years, cut the telecommunications tax and the real estate tax, and abolished the savings-bank tax and the corporate-franchise tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Massachusetts, Bill Weld has achieved nine tax cuts, including the abolition of the inheritance tax, a rollback of Michael Dukakis's increases in income taxes and sales taxes and-despite an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature -- a cut in the capital-gains tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Weld's position on taxes illuminates the national debate over the flat tax. Massachusetts's constitution requires a single income-tax rate, now set at 5.95 percent. In 1994, the public-employee unions financed an initiative campaign to repeal this tax provision and establish a graduated, or "progressive," income tax. Weld and Citizens for Limited Taxation defeated the campaign, pointing out that a multiple-rate system allows politicians to separate voters into income groups and play them against each other.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On April 15, 1996, and again on April 15, 1997, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a constitutional amendment to require a two-thirds supermajority vote for any federal tax increase. This idea, too, is drawn from the states. The two-thirds supermajority was part of California's Proposition 13 in 1978, and in 1994, Fife Symington and Arizona taxpayer groups backed a successful ballot initiative that amended the state constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the legislature for tax hikes.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal and state constitutions require supermajorities for any legislative actions that depend on widespread support for their legitimacy (like overriding vetoes). Tax increases also demand that level of scrutiny. Taxpayer activists in Arizona are now circulating another initiative to require a two-thirds supermajority for any tax hike approved by the voters directly. They fear that public-employee unions will swamp low-turnout elections and force local or state tax hikes. George Voinovich in Ohio is working with taxpayer advocates on a ballot proposal to require a two-thirds supermajority vote for major tax hikes. Just as term limits swept through 23 states and became part of the Contract With America, the drive for supermajority requirements for tax increases has also been moving on parallel paths at the national and state level.<p><b>School Choice</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Washington, Republicans tried to provide parental choice in education for several thousand of the poorest families in Washington, D.C. Led by Republican congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, the House of Representatives approved the measure in the 1996 appropriations bill for the District. But as of March, the measure was stymied in the Senate by a Democratic filibuster.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As with many issues, parental choice in education reached the national political agenda via the states. Tommy Thompson led the way in 1990 with a model school-choice program for poor Milwaukee parents. More than 1,000 children have qualified to receive vouchers for tuition at secular private schools. The teachers unions maintained that only public schools could provide good education, but studies have shown that Milwaukee public schools suffer a 79 percent attendance rate and a 48 percent graduation rate. By comparison, the city's private schools boast rates of 96 percent and 88 percent respectively.Growing public support for school choice led Thompson to sign legislation last July that expanded the number of eligible children to 7,000 in the current school year and to 15,000 next year. This expanded program -- now being challenged in court -- would give parents the freedom to send their children to parochial or other religious schools. Pending a court decision, the Bradley Foundation and other private funders are financing vouchers for low-income students accepted to private schools.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Ridge put school choice at the top of his agenda. Although Republicans controlled both houses of the legislature, the governor's KID I program failed last year by six votes. Ridge returned last fall with a more modest program to provide $132 million for scholarships for as many as 50,000 students. To reassure skeptics, this version was designed to expire if not reauthorized and was limited to certain cities and counties. Ridge also added a provision ensuring that no school district in Pennsylvania would lose money as a result of school choice. As of this writing, the legislature has once more refused to follow the governor's lead, but key legislators vow that the battle is far from over.In Minnesota, Governor Arne Carlson wants to provide 65,000 low-income students in Minneapolis-St. Paul and a rural district yet to be named with vouchers of up to $3,000, valid at any school. Governor Carlson does not yet have a Republican majority in both houses, but is moving school choice forward by organizing a Republican Task Force for School Choice to put political muscle behind his vision.By promoting school choice, Carlson unites economic conservatives in the business community --who know that school choice will reduce education costs and raise the quality of high-school graduates -- with social conservatives who want parents, rather than bureaucrats, to control their children's education.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Arizona last year, Governor Fife Symington backed a statewide school-choice plan to give all Arizona students up to $1,500 to attend any private school of their choice. Many national figures in the GOP lobbied legislators on behalf of Symington's platform, yet the measure fell three votes short in the state senate, thanks to a handful of Republicans with ties to the National Education Association.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In California, teachers unions  spent $15 million of their members' dues in the fall of 1993 to defeat a school-choice ballot initiative. In his 1996 State of the State address, however, Governor Pete Wilson endorsed a targeted pilot program for school choice. Wilson's proposal would provide 250,000 children in the poorest 5 percent of California's public schools with up to $4,500 each to attend the public, private, or religious school of their choice. Connecticut's Governor John Rowland is also supporting a pilot school-choice program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Massachusetts, Michigan, and Arizona have all embarked on extensive charter-school programs, allowing individuals and teachers to create their own public schools, free of many existing regulations. While charter schools are not school choice, they do offer a real opportunity for many teachers and students to scale the wall the NEA has erected to keep "its" children from escaping bad schools.<p><b>Tort Reform</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, 12 Republican governors took on one of the fiercest Democratic special-interest groups -- the trial lawyers -- and won. While Congress was only able to enact a very limited reform of frivolous stockholder lawsuits, Republican governors made significant strides. Walter Olson, the author of <I>The Litigation Explosion</I>, cites tort-reform initiatives by George Bush Jr. in Texas and Jim Edgar in Illinois as two of the most far-reaching.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Texas now limits punitive damages, requires "clear and convincing" evidence to prove malice, raises the qualifications for expert witnesses, and eliminates joint liability for defendants less than 51 percent at fault.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new Illinois law bars any plaintiff found to be more than 50 percent at fault from recovering damages (which should stop drunks from suing after falling in front of trains), prohibits punitive-damage awards except where defendants behave "with an evil motive or with a reckless indifference to the rights of others," abolishes joint liability for economic and noneconomic damages (thus protecting "deep pocket" defendants from the liability of others), and provides the stiffest reform of product liability in the nation. The Illinois law also protects landowners from being sued by trespassers in most cases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	North Dakota governor Edward T. Schafer passed a product-liability reform package aimed at luring airplane manufacturers to North Dakota. Schafer has pointed out that states need not compete for business by offering subsidies or special tax breaks; instead, they can all lower regulatory and liability costs, and everyone wins.<p><b>Crime</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The latest Republican anti-crime agenda has made little headway in Washington, where the Senate has failed to act on a package of bills passed by the House. Meanwhile, Republican governors led the way in enacting "truth-in-sentencing" laws that require violent criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, with time off for good behavior but not parole. Governor Fob James of Alabama reintroduced chain gangs -- although the new chains are made of sturdy plastic. He also instituted work and education requirements for inmates to earn television and recreation privileges and banned inmate access to pornography. Mississippi's Kirk Fordice has reestablished the state prison farm, and taken a thousand television sets away from prisoners. Under Pete Wilson, California has carried out its first two executions in 25 years. In New York, after 19 vetoes by Mario Cuomo, Governor George Pataki signed legislation restoring the death penalty and honored Oklahoma's extradition request for murderer Thomas Grasso, who was subsequently executed for murder. Connecticut's John Rowland restored the death penalty there.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bucking the pro-gun control trend in Washington, D.C., that as recently as the fall of 1993 saw the "Brady Bill" passed and the so-called assault-weapon ban included in Bill Clinton's "crime" bill, 28 states have passed "concealed-carry" laws that require local officials to grant licenses to qualified adults who wish to carry concealed handguns. Ten states passed concealed-carry laws in 1995, including Oklahoma, which did not blink at liberal efforts to blame gun owners, taxpayers, and/or radio talk show hosts for the terrorist bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. Mike Foster, Louisiana's new Republican governor, campaigned on a commitment to sign a concealed-carry law that his Democratic predecessor had vetoed. Ohio, too, with its new Republican majorities, has the votes to pass a concealed-carry law.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Crime is always a thorny issue for Republicans in Washington, caught between their federalist belief in local responsibility for law enforcement and public pressure for federal action on crime. The success of Republicans at the state level at implementing tough anti-crime measures has the added benefit of taking national Republicans off the hook.<p><b>Welfare</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although Bill Clinton has vetoed the Republican welfare-reform bill (which embodies concepts that he once embraced), Republican governors continue to experiment with efforts to free individuals from the dependency of welfare. Tommy Thompson began a series of reforms in 1987 that have reduced Wisconsin's welfare caseload by 32 percent while welfare rolls nationwide were increasing by 25 percent. Pete Wilson suspended cost-of-living adjustments for welfare payments, saving taxpayers $6.3 billion over the past four years and keeping welfare costs 27 percent below where they would otherwise have been.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fife Symington has cut Arizona welfare rolls by 10 percent. His new "Empower" welfare reform limits able-bodied recipients to no more than 24 months of welfare benefits in a five-year period, ends additional payments for welfare recipients who have additional children, and requires minors to live at home to receive any benefits. Between 1992 and 1995, George Voinovich phased out Ohio's generous general-assistance program, which was paying benefits to 142,000 able-bodied Buckeyes. Bill Weld has pushed a series of reforms that have reduced the Massachusetts welfare caseload for 25 straight months. Almost every Republican governor has passed, introduced, or requested a federal waiver for welfare reform in their state. New Hampshire alone has requested 65 waivers from federal welfare requirements. Faced with a stone wall in Washington, Steve Merrill is now prepared to institute his reforms anyway.Spending Restraint
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The conflict between Congress and the president over the size and cost of government has already shut down the federal government repeatedly. This fight has played itself out in the states as well. Steve Merrill had to fight his own Republican legislature to lower spending, and finally won a budget lower than that passed by either chamber of the legislature. Merrill's veto of legislation that would have doubled state aid to education was upheld. Merrill, George Pataki of New York, and Bill Weld of Massachusetts are the only three governors who have actually shrunk their budgets since the previous year.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Ohio, George Voinovich won legislation eliminating two state cabinet agencies. He plans to privatize 78 state liquor stores, saving Ohio taxpayers $20 million annually. Cabinet agencies under the governor's control had 3,162 fewer employees in 1995 than in 1991, a reduction of 8.3 percent. Pete Wilson is asking for an amendment to the California constitution requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote for any new and costly regulation. Kansas governor Bill Graves enacted a six-month moratorium on new government regulations, and then eliminated 530 obsolete rules.<p><b>Medical Savings Accounts</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This centerpiece of the Republican reform of Medicare was blocked by Clinton's veto pen, but in 1995, five Republican governors (Fife Symington, Kirk Fordice, Jim Edgar, John Engler, and Idaho's Philip Batt) shepherded medical savings accounts through their state legislatures. These forays into market-based health care will have a significant effect on overall medical costs and insurance premiums, contributing substantially to the debate in Washington, and perhaps eventually ending the impasse. And, when Congress does finally enact reforms in Medicare, the states will already have in place the mechanisms to take full advantage of it.<p><b>Property Rights</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In March 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation recognizing that the Takings Clause of the Constitution is invoked when government actions destroy or reduce the value of private property, not just when the property is physically occupied by government. That legislation has not seen final action, of course. The pressures that produced it are growing throughout the country, however, and governors and state legislatures are responding to them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beginning in 1992, the states began passing legislation protecting the property rights of their citizens. To date, 23 states have enacted legislation of varying strength, and more efforts are under way. Most of these involve some form of compensation for land values affected by state restrictions on its use. In 1995, every state but Kentucky and Georgia was considering some form of property-rights legislation.<p><b>Color-Blind Society</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	California and Pete Wilson give a textbook example of how a state can force action that has been avoided for decades at the national level. Citizens have filed an initiative petition in California, the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), that would prohibit the state from discriminating based on race or sex. It is a ban on racial preferences or quotas. For two decades, Washington politicians were able to say "I oppose quotas, but favor affirmative action," while supporting laws and court decisions that require racial preferences and quotas. The California initiative may force all national politicians, during an election year, to answer the following questions: "Are you for or against the CCRI as written?" They could no longer fudge or evade discussions of affirmative action.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, a dozen other states are considering measures similar to the California initiative. And on January 15, 1996 -- Martin Luther King Day --the newly elected Louisiana governor, Mike Foster, issued an executive order abolishing all racial preferences as abhorrent to King's vision of a color-blind society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a result, Republican leaders in the Congress have all stated their opposition to quotas and racial preferences. Bob Dole and Representative Charles Canady have introduced federal legislation mirroring California's. Black congressman Gary Franks, a Connecticut Republican was ready to push an amendment to an appropriations bill immediately eliminating contract set-asides for minorities. House leaders persuaded him to postpone it, but this is clearly an issue that will continue to surface at the federal level. There could hardly be a clearer example of state politics forcing an unwanted issue onto the Washington agenda.<p><b>Federalism</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Alabama governor Fob James took his oath of office standing under a banner carrying the words of the Tenth Amendment: "The Powers not delegated to the United States nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Texas Governor George W. Bush has made a mantra of his call to "let Texans run Texas." Arizona's Fife Symington forced the federal government to reopen the Grand Canyon by threatening to operate it with state workers. He has since called on the federal government to cede control of the Grand Canyon to his state, and is working with Newt Gingrich to speed a transfer of power. Symington has also socked away $1 million to finance lawsuits that may be necessary to defend the state's Tenth Amendment rights.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Utah Governor Mike Leavitt has begun to organize a national movement to promote an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would give states the right to block national laws passed by Congress that violate their autonomy. For instance, two-thirds of the governors or perhaps two-thirds of state legislatures would have the power to overturn a federal law by passing resolutions of disapproval. As with a presidential veto, a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress would reinstate the law.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It may not be necessary to wait for an amendment. Leavitt is trying to get a commitment from Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole that they will force a second vote on any law or part of a law that draws written opposition from two-thirds of the governors. That would give America an opportunity to get used to the way the amendment would operate.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some commentators ask which of the Republican governors is the best or most effective. In fact, the breadth of quality and activism is amazing. Certainly, John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin were early revolutionaries. Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Kirk Fordice of Mississippi demonstrated how much one can accomplish in the face of overwhelming Democratic legislatures. Arne Carlson of Minnesota and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania have bravely challenged the teachers unions in their states, and George Bush of Texas and Jim Edgar of Illinois have taken on the trial-lawyer beast.	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All the Republican governors are traveling in the same direction and showing real courage in tackling the special interests of the old establishment order. This is important in each state, but it is also critical nationally. Republican governors and state legislators are to the new Republican majority in Congress and any future Republican president what the labor unions and corrupt big-city machines are to the Democratic Party: its nationwide infrastructure. They are a second front arrayed against the liberal welfare state. In the last five years -- and most intensely in 1995 -- they have followed Lenin's advice to probe with bayonets, looking for weaknesses. Their triumphs guarantee the ultimate success of the Gingrich Revolution-no matter what happens in Washington.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I><b>Grover Norquist</b> is the president of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a> and the national political correspondent for the</I> American Spectator.

<h2>In Welfare Reform, Governors Miss the Point</h2>
<b>by Robert Rector</b>
</center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Congress is now considering a welfare-reform plan recently proposed by the nation's governors. Unfortunately, this plan ignores America's biggest social problem: the catastrophic rise of illegitimacy. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly a third of the children born in America last year were born out of wedlock. The illegitimacy rate is rising by a percentage point every year. And among blacks the out-of-wedlock birthrate has reached 69 percent. This figure astounds even New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who warned us in the early 1960s of the threat posed to the black community by the collapse of marriage. Moynihan's admonition was dismissed then, but the breakup of the black family and the calamities that have accompanied it are outstripping his most frightful predictions. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ominously, the illegitimacy rate for whites is now edging toward 25 percent, almost exactly the rate for blacks when Moynihan first sounded his alarm. The white family now faces the same breakdown that has devastated black communities in the last 30 years. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Family collapse is the root cause of a host of social problems, including poverty, crime, drug abuse, and academic underachievement. Children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than children born to couples who are married. Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out of wedlock than girls from intact, independent families. And a boy from a single-parent household in the inner city is twice as likely to become involved in crime as a similarly poor boy who lives with a father and a mother.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nation's governors have responded to this grim reality by ignoring it. In unveiling their welfare reform plan, they have declared that there are three "key elements" to real welfare reform: (1) providing more government-funded day care; (2) increasing child support payments from absent fathers; (3) imposing time limits and work requirements on welfare recipients. Rising illegitimacy and the collapse of marriage do not receive even passing comment. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This plan represents a radical shift in the focus of the welfare debate -- from combating illegitimacy to providing public-support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Dodging the illegitimacy issue entirely, the governors' plan promises a future in which marriage collapses further and the government must meet the needs of a burgeoning population of single-parent families. The triumph of the Left is complete: Fighting illegitimacy is "out," and funding government-run day care is "in."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some argue that federal action on illegitimacy is not needed, that the governors will tackle the problem. But the governors' silence speaks volumes. Few have made reducing illegitimacy a priority; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. But by refusing to acknowledge the dangers of collapsing marriages and rising illegitimacy, they implicitly condone and ultimately promote illegitimacy. The result: Soon, half of all American children will be born out of wedlock and reared in government-run day-care centers. This is not reform -- this is a national disaster.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The governors' plan borrows heavily from the "reform" schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals. It also dovetails with the interests of America's huge welfare bureaucracy, which thrives on social decay. Although the plan will trim the growth rate of welfare spending slightly in the near term, it will lead to an explosion in welfare and social-service spending. In other words, we will have to pay the price for illegitimacy sooner or later.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress seems too willing to join the governors in ignoring illegitimacy. Under recent legislation, Congress will spend nearly a half trillion dollars over the next seven years to subsidize illegitimacy through welfare benefits, day care, job training, and other services. For every dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy, the federal government will spend about a thousand dollars on programs that contribute to it.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Marriage in America is dying, and the governors have prepared the coffin. Many in Congress seem willing to serve as pall bearers. But "welfare reform" is nonsense so long as the illegitimacy rate continues to rise. Vision and leadership are sorely needed -- and the governors especially seem unable to provide either.<p>

<center><h2>Can Congress Revive Civil Society?</h2>

By <a href="#coats">Senator Dan Coats</a>,<br>
With responses from <a href="#him">Gertrude Himmelfarb</a>, <a href="#eberly">Don Eberly</a> & <a href="#boaz">David Boaz</a>

<p>

      <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</i>
    
       <hr width=50%></center><p>
	In their 1975 book <i>To Empower People</i>, Richard John Neuhaus and Peter Berger challenged policymakers to protect and foster the "mediating structures" --  neighborhood, family, church, and voluntary associations -- that stand between the private individual and large government institutions. "Wherever possible," they wrote, "public policy should utilize mediating structures for the realization of social purposes."
<P>	Twenty years later, Washington is heeding the call. In October 1995, Senator Dan Coats introduced a package of legislative proposals to help empower local, community-based institutions that are addressing social problems. Crafted with the help of William J. Bennett, a codirector of Empower America, the <a href="#project">"Project for American Renewal"</a> comprises 19 separate bills designed to use public policy -- and public resources -- to energize mainly private efforts to meet human needs. Coats defended his legislation at a recent symposium at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>; what follows are his remarks and critiques by some of the symposium's participants.
<p>

<b><a name="coats">Senator Dan Coats</b><br>
<i>Re-funding Our "Little Platoons"</i>
<p>
	An intellectual revolution is underway concerning the nature of our social crisis. It is no longer credible to argue that rising illegitimacy, random violence, and declining values are rooted in the lack either of economic equality or of economic opportunity. These positions are still current in our political debate, but they have lost their plausibility.
<p>	America's cultural decay can be traced directly to the breakdown of certain institutions -- families, churches, neighborhoods, voluntary associations -- that act as an immune system against cultural disease. In nearly every community, these institutions once created an atmosphere in which most problems -- a teenage girl "in trouble," the rowdy neighborhood kids, the start of a drug problem at the local high school -- could be confronted before their repetition threatened the existence of the community itself.

<p>
	When civil society is strong, it infuses a community with its warmth, trains its people to be good citizens, and transmits values between generations. When it is weak, no amount of police or politics can provide a substitute. There is a growing consensus that a declining civil society undermines both civility and society.
<p>	In this discussion, the importance of civil society is something I want to assume, not argue. But it leads to another question: Does this intellectual revolution have political consequences? Should it influence the agenda of Congress, or is it irrelevant to our work?
<p>	Let me begin by saying what is <i>not</i> at issue. I do not argue that government is sufficient to the need. Nothing short of a Great Awakening, as Gertrude Himmelfarb has noted, is sufficient to the need. But I <i>do</i> argue that conservatives have duties beyond waiting for another Charles Wesley. Realism about government's limits is not a substitute for effective public policy. I am convinced that political reflection on these themes is important not only for its own sake; it provides the next, necessary stage of the conservative revolution.
<p>	Government clearly has had a role in undermining civil society. Families, churches, and community groups were forced to surrender their authority and function to bureaucratic experts. Fathers were replaced by welfare checks, private charities were displaced by government spending, religious volunteers were dismissed as "amateurs", whole communities were demolished in slum-clearance projects. The power to replace an institution is the power to destroy it. 
<p>	So the first item on the political agenda is a re-limited government, leaving enough social space for civil society to resume its role. 
<p>	But this brings us to a problem. The retreat of government does not automatically result in the rebirth of civil society. It is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one. As Professor John DiIulio has observed, when a victim is stabbed, you need to remove the knife. But removing the knife will not heal the wound. 
<p>	In Russia, the retreat of government has resulted in what one expert calls "anarcho-capitalism" --  closer to the Mafia than the invisible hand. Even if this result had been known beforehand, it would not have been an argument to retain the communist system. But it is an argument for respecting the potential for social dislocation when civil society is weak. Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise has said, "[T]he moral centers of black life were decimated by liberal policies." We should not ignore the potential for suffering, especially in our cities, when government retreats.
<p>	The decline of civil society threatens the future of our political order. It requires us to ask certain questions out of a reasonable, justified desperation. How do we creatively, but not intrusively, strengthen the safety net of civil society? How do we encourage the transfer of resources and authority, not just to state governments, but to those private and religious institutions that shape, direct, and reclaim individual lives? 
<p>	There is not -- and could never be -- a government plan to rebuild civil society. But there must be ways to actively take the side of people and institutions who are rebuilding their own communities, and who often feel isolated and poorly equipped.
<p>	This is the theory that Bill Bennett and I have adopted in the <a href="#project">"Project for American Renewal."</a> Government cannot directly restore what it has crippled. But we believe that deferring to and depending on these institutions in public policy would have a positive effect. As Robert Putnam of Harvard University has argued, the resources of community, unlike physical resources, become depleted when they are not used. They must be exercised or they atrophy. 
<p>	Our goal is to exercise civil society by turning over federal roles to private institutions. In practice, we hope to tilt public policies in favor of intact families. We want to strengthen grass-roots community organizations. And we propose to shift welfare responsibilities to private and religious charities. Every dollar spent by families, community groups, and faith-based charities is more efficient and compassionate than any dollar spent by the federal government.
<p>	The centerpiece and symbol of the package is the "Comprehensive Charity Reform Act." It would allow individuals to donate $500 of their tax liability to private, antipoverty organizations. This measure would take about 8 percent of federal welfare spending and provide it directly to institutions actually winning their war on poverty, armed with spiritual vitality, tough love, and true compassion. 
<p>	My objective is to promote a new ethic of giving in America. When individuals make these contributions to effective charities, it is a form of involvement beyond writing a check to the federal government. It encourages a new definition of citizenship -- one in which men and women examine and support the programs in their own communities that serve the poor.
<p>	This is exactly how I came to be involved in these issues. My initial interest was not academic. I had the experience of seeing how religious charities not only feed the body but touch the soul. They are dramatically effective, while the programs I reauthorized year after year in Congress did not even bother to keep track of their dismal results. 
<p>	One of my favorite examples is the Gospel Mission in Washington, D.C. It provides one of the most vivid contrasts to government failure I have ever seen. It has a 12-month drug rehabilitation rate of 66 percent, while a once-heralded government program just three blocks away rehabilitates less than 10 percent of those it serves. Yet the government program spends many times more per person.
<p>	To explain the difference you need to talk to those the Gospel Mission has served. One addict who came to the shelter after failing in several government programs says, "Those programs generally take addictions from you, but don't place anything within you. I needed a spiritual lifting. People like those at the mission are like God walking into your life. Not only am I drug-free, but more than that, I can be a person again."
<p>	Marvin Olasky has talked about the need to "defund" government and "refund" those faith-based institutions that actually work. Bill Bennett and I have taken this not merely as an interesting observation but as a challenge. The Project for American Renewal is not the definitive answer, but it is the beginning of a debate we can no longer avoid.
<p>	Naturally, we've encountered criticism, which has centered around three questions. First, is the project a violation of the letter and spirit of devolution? Nothing could be further from the truth. What we advocate is a particularly radical form of devolution. Some conservatives only seem comfortable transferring federal resources and authority to state bureaucracies. Our package would redistribute power directly to families, grass-roots community organizations, and private and religious charities. It is hardly a conservative position to argue that, of all the institutions of American society, only state governments merit our trust. Our goal should not only be to redistribute power <i>within</i> government, but to spread power <i>beyond</i> government.
<p>

	Second, should there be <i>any</i> role for the federal government in these matters?
<p>

	My response is that conservatives need to pick their fights. States are better positioned to do many things -- but not to do everything.
<p>

	Federalism is useful, but we need to avoid a 10th Amendment utopianism. Bill Bennett tells the story of a governor who sought a series of federal waivers from him when he was President Reagan's education secretary. Bennett responded that they would be granted, but only if the governor also sent of list of state obstacles to reform. The state regulations far outnumbered the federal ones. 


<p>	State officials can repeat the same mistakes as their federal counterparts. State welfare bureaucracies can be just as strong and wrong as federal programs. We need the wisdom to concentrate on those areas where we can be most effective, even if it means a federal role in jump-starting reform. It is a paradox that it takes an active federal government to divest itself of its own power. Federal inertia serves the cause of bureaucratic centralization. 	
<p>

	Third, does the project -- with its tax credits -- contradict the Republican economic agenda, particularly the flat tax? 

<p>
	I support a flatter, fairer, simpler tax code. But I am convinced that eliminating the charitable deduction would be social engineering on massive scale. The level of charitable giving is closely correlated with the treatment of charitable contributions in tax law. Abandoning this commitment would invoke the law of unintended consequences with a vengeance.


<p>	There are many in the Congress who could not and would not support such a reform. And many of the most serious flat-tax proposals now recognize this fact, carving out an exception for charitable giving. Those are the only initiatives with a political future. 
<p>	I believe we are led by policy to creatively surrender federal authority to civil society. But there is a political point to be made as well. 
<p>	There is only one thing more important than what Republicans do in the budget debate. It is what they say the day after it has ended. If our only appeal to Americans is a balanced budget and devolution to state bureaucracies, the Republican revolution is likely to falter. 
<p>	No lasting political realignment can occur without an element of vision and hope -- a message that our worst social problems, while persistent, are not permanent. Hope is what turns a sociological debate into a compelling political theme. If we do not develop such a theme, Republicans will become social Darwinists by default -- accepting the survival of the fittest. But we know where that hope is kindled -- among individuals and groups engaged in the hard, noble work of restoration. Their victories are among America's great, untold stories. No alternative approach to our cultural crisis holds as much promise as the success of these "little platoons," precisely because they have qualities not found in government at any level -- spiritual renewal and authentic compassion. As a matter of public policy, and as a matter of prudent politics, it is time to aggressively take their side in the battle to recivilize American society.

<i>Remoralizing Civil Society</i>
<p>
	 I have never been beguiled by the idea of devolution. Like Senator Coats, I believe that devolution -- the transfer of power from the federal government to local and state governments -- is a necessary but not a sufficient step in the reform of our society. I also believe that the next stage of devolution -- the transfer of power from government at all levels to civil society -- is necessary -- but again not sufficient.
<p>

	In recent times, civil society has had many of its functions usurped by an overweening government. Welfare has displaced a good deal of charity. Families have been relieved of the obligation to care for their aged and incapacitated members. Communities can no longer stigmatize behavior such as illegitimacy that the government subsidizes and, in effect, legitimizes -- rhetorically as well as practically. (While researching my last book, I wrote a federal agency to inquire about the latest statistics on illegitimacy. I received a letter firmly rebuking me for using that term; the proper term, I was told, is either "nontraditional child bearing" or "alternative modes of parenting" -- hence, legitimizing illegitimacy).
<p>

Civil society has thus been severely weakened by government. But it also has been weakened by the culture in general. More important, it has been corrupted by the culture. In fact, some of the institutions in civil society are thriving as never before. There are powerful philanthropies and foundations, more than we've ever had before, and some have unprecedented wealth; there are private schools and colleges, social agencies, civic institutions, cultural organizations, and churches of all kinds. And all are flourishing in civil society.
<p>

	But not always to good effect. Senator Coats describes civil society as an "immune system" against social disease. But civil society has been infected by the same virus that has afflicted the culture in general. The theories and practices that have been so detrimental to our educational system -- affirmative action, multiculturalism, outcome-based education -- have been initiated and promoted by private foundations and universities. Some of the most egregious projects funded by the National Endowment for the Arts have been proudly exhibited in local museums supported by the cultural elites of those communities. Even the churches, both mainstream and New Age churches, have contributed to what I would call the "de-moralization" of society, the kind of permissiveness and self-indulgence that is so conspicuous in our culture at large. The family is the bedrock of civil society. But it, too, is in a bad state -- witness the prevalence of illegitimacy, divorce, transient "relationships," neglected children, households where the main cultural vehicle is television, with its incessant messages of promiscuity and violence.

<p>
	It is not enough, then, to revitalize civil society. We have to start thinking about "remoralizing" civil society. And that is a far, far more difficult task. And here -- paradoxically -- is where the government can be helpful. Unlike some of my conservative friends, I've never been a libertarian in economic affairs; nor am I much of a libertarian in social and cultural affairs. In our present situation, it seems to me, the remoralization of society requires that we avail ourselves of all of the resources that we can command -- public and private, religious and secular, governmental as well as civil.

<p>
	This may be the most important lesson I learned from the Victorians: They did not bifurcate their lives. They did not distinguish between private virtue and public virtue. Nor did they try to keep religion out of the public square. The Dissenters, for example, had no objection to the established Church of England (there was no serious movement for the disestablishment of the Church throughout the entire Victorian period). Secularists habitually joined with religious groups -- utilitarians with Evangelicals -- in promoting various measures of social reform. Government officials responsible for the distribution of public relief cooperated with private charities, their common purpose being to prevent the "de-moralization of the poor" --  what we more politely call the "culture of dependency." They used, in short, whatever resources were available, in civil society and in the polity, to help stabilize and remoralize society.

<p>
	It's often said that you can't legislate morality. But we have, in fact, done just that. The civil-rights legislation in the 1960s had the effect not only of legally proscribing racial discrimination but also of proscribing it morally. The fact is that individuals, communities, families, neighborhoods, and churches do not function in isolation. They cannot sustain traditional values that are at odds with those being promoted by the government, by the courts, and by the culture. All values, even traditional values, have to be legitimized. And in a secular society, the main organs of legitimization are government, law, and the culture.
<p>

	Conservatives, then, must not only eliminate laws and social policies that have illegitimatized traditional values. They also must devise laws and social policies that will legitimize traditional values. One might say that our legislators and policymakers are as much our moral instructors as are our teachers and preachers. This is why the Project for American Renewal is an important document -- not only for the specific measures it proposes, but also for the principle it conveys: that government -- responsible, modest, self-critical government -- may be a useful ally of civil society in the remoralization of society.

<i>The New Demands of Citizenship</i>
<p>
	Dan Coats has issued a challenge for us to join in a new intellectual revolution, and join it we must. The most promising aspect of this revolution is that its recovery of the term "civil society" suggests that this concept may once again take deep root in our policy debates and in the public imagination. Civil society may very well supply the framework for a promising new social policy for the 21st century. 
<p>

	In his book <i>The Quest for Community</i>, Robert Nisbet suggested that the great challenge of modern society is "protecting, reinforcing, nurturing where necessary, the varied groups and associations which form the true building blocks of the social order." Nisbet's concern at the time (the 1950s) was that the human yearning for community, which is rooted in our social nature, would likely feed the hunger for a pervasive centralized government if not properly directed toward the restoration of real, functioning local communities. Our failure to heed his warning has left us with precisely the dangerous combination he feared -- a powerful central state combined with radically weakened social institutions. 

<p>
	In considering solutions to America's cultural decline, we would do well to keep in mind an ancient Chinese proverb: The possibility of progress begins when you call a problem by its right name. The present crisis in America is a crisis not merely of political and governmental dysfunction, but of societal disintegration.
<p>	We are witnessing today a dangerous depletion of the spiritual and psychological qualities upon which democracy and limited government depend. Our character-shaping institutions are collapsing in the face of a hedonistic mass culture increasingly characterized by violence, incivility, and a flagrant disregard for human dignity. We Americans are in rapid retreat from the very idea of society.
<p>	If we are to reverse this trend, we must change our conversation, and quickly, from the deterministic logic of the social sciences, which shift responsibility for antisocial behavior from the individual to the larger society. And we must move beyond our preoccupation with governmentalism -- that is, what government does, how it does it, or what it stops doing. 
<p>	Can Congress restore civil society? No one here believes that Congress can do more than help to set the conditions for such a recovery. But we should question whether Congress is prepared to do this much. Politicians must recognize that their ultimate success in policy reform depends precisely upon a deeper social renewal that can only originate in our hearts, homes, and local communities. The real question, then, is how do we, as a political community, respond to Nisbet's challenge to nurture the varied groups and associations of civil society.
<p>	There are many positive contributions that social policy reforms can make toward this end. Peter Berger and Richard John Neuhaus, in their classic work <i>To Empower People</i>, urged that the intermediary institutions and associations of civil society be recognized in policy reforms. They offered two primary principles to guide public policy formulation: first, that public policy should protect and foster mediating structures; and second, that wherever possible, public policy should encourage mediating structures to address social concerns. This is essentially what the Coats bill is attempting to do. Finally, there is much the individual politician can contribute to the recovery of foundational solutions: Elected officials can lead in rebuilding civic community and recovering effective charity in their districts.

<p>
	The most important thing is that we get the intellectual revolution right. That requires understanding what civil society is, why it matters, and what we Americans can do to recover it. The debate that lies ahead may indeed spark one of the most consequential shifts in social policy we have ever witnessed. The bill signals a departure from our current obsession with either the state or the market as instruments for social progress. Civil society is a different sphere. It is an intermediary sector, where private individuals join voluntarily in associations that operate neither on the principle of coercion, nor entirely on the principle of rational self-interest. In fact, the modus operandi of life in civil society gives expression to the pursuit of the common good, where actions are animated by a spirit of trust and collaboration. 
<p> I have a caution here, it is that civil society not simply be embraced mostly for its utilitarian value in replacing the central welfare state. The stakes in recovering civil society go far beyond the replacement of the welfare state, as important as that is. 
<p>The mediating associations of civil society, as Alexis de Tocqueville tells us, are essential to both our democratic and economic systems. He noted that "feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed only by the reciprocal influence of men upon one another" operating in civil society. This sector generates the social capital -- responsible citizens capable of self-governance and trust toward others -- upon which our economic and democratic life depend. Lose this third sector, and you end up not with two sectors but eventually with only one: the bureaucratic state. The reason for this is that a society of isolated, atomized individuals is simply no match for the power and expansive ambition of the omnicompetent state. In fact, individuals who are cut off from the problem-solving, order-creating realm of civil society will almost certainly turn to government for order and safety, and yes, even for a sense of belonging and purpose. The result is a politically organized society which is held together mainly by force of state authority. Anyone who thinks that the monster of statism has been slain by the mere adoption of the policies of political devolution should think again. 
<p>	Civil society, by definition, embraces institutions, groups, and associations, not individuals. It frustrates our dominant cultural impulse, which is to assert that the autonomous self is the only sovereign, and it grates against our dominant political reflex, which celebrates boundless individual choice as the highest good. The realm of civil society is free and largely autonomous, but it nevertheless imposes constraints and obligations on the individual and limits his choices. In other words, talk of civil society implies a return to authority and order. Many Western liberals -- whether in political or economic terms -- have embraced a notion of absolute freedom that is simply not self-sustaining. 
<p>	So as we evaluate this legislation, we must remember what has happened in our political culture even as we discuss the need for mentoring, fathering, character-shaping charity, community empowerment, and curbing divorce. Public policy has shifted away from our decades-long impulse to empower isolated individuals. Policies are now being directed at asserting institutional authority, social obligations, and moral requirements over the individual. We must be clear: We are talking about restoring authority in the noncoercive realm of civil society, not the coercive realm of the state.
<p>

	Freedom from the suffocating clutches of the social-service state is not simply a freedom to be left alone, as the latest conservative mantra has it. It is a freedom to become Americans again -- compassionate, civic minded, and committed to rebuilding the good society.
<p>

	The risk of the present revolution in Washington is that it simply replaces a sterile statism with an equally sterile antistatism, which does little to give life to a dying society. Dismantling ineffective and costly government is important work, but it does not constitute by itself a social or political philosophy. Freeing up the market is a splendid idea, but it does not constitute by itself a vision for a well-ordered society, and the market contributes little by itself to the recovery of community. (Some would argue that its effects are precisely the opposite.)
<p>	If civil society reappears, it will have been due to two events. First, we will have taken seriously the coherent moral vision reflected in this bill and worked to lodge it deeply within our public imagination, using it as the framework for rebuilding institutions, renewing human dignity, and restoring a functional society. Second, we will have directed our politics to the task of mobilizing Americans to do what politicians cannot.
<p>	We must applaud the Coats initiative without raising a new round of false expectations. The legislation should be accompanied by the issuing of greater demands -- yes, <i>demands</i> -- on American citizens. We're reminded daily that they apparently want power back. Well, this means helping them recover an awareness of their own social duties. With its emphasis on localism, citizenship, and networks of civic engagement, this bill issues a bold moral challenge to every American, one that should not be dismissed.
<p>

	The great question of our time is, 'How do we renew, regenerate, re-energize civil society?' " There is no compulsory program for civil society; it must be summoned forth. It will happen as we tap into the currents that have always renewed human society: religious revival, the quest for transcendence, moral order, and membership in community. This is important work, and work that every American citizen must embrace.

<i>Conservative Social Engineering</i>

	Senator Coats is to be commended for recognizing that devolution of power from the federal government to state governments is not a sufficient answer to America's problems. He correctly notes that many of our problems require "the recovery of families, neighborhoods, churches, schools, and voluntary associations . . . an influence that is literally 'civilizing.'" He rightly points out that "even if government directly undermined civil society, it cannot directly reconstruct it."
<p>

	It is important, as Senator Coats argues, to demonstrate that faith in limited government is not just a negative attitude toward government; rather, it is rooted in an appreciation of the complicated network of institutions and associations that bind us together and provide us with much of what makes life worthwhile. Unfortunately, while the senator has correctly identified the problem -- the decline of civil society -- he doesn't seem to understand the reasons for that decline. Despite his rhetorical skepticism about the efficacy of government, his 19-bill legislative package, dubbed the Project for American Renewal, shows a faith in government almost as breathtaking as that of the architects of the Great Society.
<p>

	First the good news: The centerpiece of Coats's plan is the Comprehensive Charity Reform Act, which would provide a $500-per-person tax credit for charitable contributions to groups helping the poor. That approach -- also found in legislation introduced by Senator John Ashcroft and Representatives Jim Kolbe and Joseph Knollenberg -- would shift charitable spending from government to millions of individuals and private organizations, and we can expect entirely exemplary results. Private charitable groups have a far better record than government agencies at getting people back on their feet, off welfare, and into stable work and family lives.
<p>

	Now for the rest of the story. Coats says that the Project for American Renewal "is not a government plan to rebuild civil society" and that he favors "a radical form of devolution [that] would redistribute power directly to families, grass-roots community organizations, and private and religious charities." But in practice he apparently believes that the federal government should tax American citizens, bring their money to Washington, and then dole it out to sensible state and local programs and responsible private institutions. Surely we have learned that government grants do not create strong, creative, vibrant private organizations. Rather, organizations that depend on government funding will have to follow government rules, will be unable to respond effectively to changing needs, and will get caught up in  games of grantsmanship and bureaucratic empire-building.


<p>	Moreover, nearly every one of his bills would further entangle the federal government in the institutions of civil society. Under the Role Model Academy Act, the federal government would "establish an innovative residential academy for at-risk youth." Under the Mentor Schools Act, the feds would provide grants to school districts wanting to develop and operate "same gender" schools. The Character Development Act would give school districts demonstration grants to work with community groups to develop mentoring programs. The Family Reconciliation Act would "provide additional federal funding . . . to implement a waiting period and pre-divorce counseling" for couples with children.
<p>

	Many of these bills are intended to address real problems, such as the effects of divorce on children and the terrible plight of children trapped in fatherless, crime-ridden, inner-city neighborhoods. But why is it appropriate or effective for the federal government to intrude into these problems? Surely local school districts should decide whether to build same-sex schools or residential academies for at-risk youth; and if the people of, say, Detroit decide that such options would make sense, any theory of responsible, accountable government would suggest that the local city council or school board both make that decision and raise the funds to carry it out.
<p>	Many of Coats's bills deal with symptoms -- they try to reform public housing by setting aside units for married couples or to provide mentors for children without fathers -- rather than dealing with the real problem, a welfare system that guarantees every teenager her choice of an abortion or an apartment if she gets pregnant. Some of the bills accept the federal Leviathan as a given and tinker with it -- for instance, by requiring that every federal dollar spent on family planning be matched by another dollar spent on abstinence education and adoption services. Others just follow the failed liberal policy of handing out federal dollars for whatever Congress thinks is a good idea -- school choice, restitution to crime victims, maternity homes, community crime-watch programs.

<p>
	Over the past 60 years, we've watched the federal government intrude more and more deeply into our lives. We've seen well-intentioned government programs become corrupted by the ideologues and bureaucrats placed in charge. We've seen schools and charities get hooked on federal dollars. The nature of government doesn't change when it is charged with carrying out conservative social engineering rather than liberal social engineering.
<p>	Let's not forget that if, say, Coats's Maternity Shelter Act were implemented next year, Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, would be charged with implementing it. She might appoint HUD assistant secretary Andrew Cuomo to run it, or maybe unemployed ex-congressman Mel Reynolds, or maybe just some Harvard professor who thinks single motherhood is a viable lifestyle option for poor young women. One reason conservatives shouldn't set up well-intentioned government programs is that they won't always be in power to run them.
<p>	In <i>Democracy in America</i>, Alexis de Tocqueville noted that "Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions constantly form associations . . . to give entertainments, to found seminaries, to build inns, to construct churches, to diffuse books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they found hospitals, prisons, and schools."
<p>	So why have families, churches, and neighborhood associations atrophied? Government, especially federal government, is a big part of the reason. Programs from Social Security to school breakfasts make family members less dependent on each other. Bureaucratic welfare programs not only encourage unwed motherhood and fatherlessness, they usurp a traditional role of churches. Governments promise to feed babies, teach children about sex, build playgrounds, run museums, provide job training, rehabilitate drug and alcohol abusers, and care for the elderly. Little is left for mediating institutions.
<p>	How do we get back to the healthy civil society that Tocqueville observed? Here's a program: First, reaffirm the constitutional mandate of the Tenth Amendment. That means the federal government should withdraw from areas in which it has no powers under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.
<p>	Second, cut federal taxes -- not by $500, but by a lot -- so that people have more money to spend, both on their own families and on charitable efforts. An important side effect of a large tax cut might be that more families discover they can live on one income and choose to have one parent stay home to care for children.

<p>
	Third, under the principle of subsidiarity, return all the functions of civil society to the lowest level at which they can be adequately performed -- the individual, the family, the church, the neighborhood, the school, the community, if necessary the state government. Advocates of limited government need to emphasize that the absence of government is not nothing: it's individual initiative and creativity and the vast array of associations that make up civil society.
<p>	Despite all we've learned about the failure of government, Coats just doesn't seem to get it. His proposals reflect the Washington that Roosevelt built, the Washington where, if you think of a good idea, you create a government program.
<p>	But ultimately, you either believe in individual liberty, limited government, and free markets, or you end up inviting the coercive state into every nook and cranny of civil society.

	The greatest achievement of the Clinton presidency has been to incorporate a message of 
personal responsibility and citizenship into the rhetoric of the Democratic Party. On the 
campaign trail in 1992, candidate Bill Clinton stressed "individual responsibility," sounding at 
times truer to conservative principles than George Bush. Clinton spoke eloquently of his efforts 
in Arkansas to preserve "the things we cherish and honor most about our way of life -- solid, 
middle-class values of work, faith, family, individual responsibility, and community." As 
president, he frequently invokes these Reaganesque themes.
<P>
	But his conception of citizenship is deeply flawed. Clinton has used the rhetoric of citizenship 
to justify his efforts to expand the welfare state. He has contradicted his emphasis on personal 
responsibility by working to preserve bureaucratic federal control of social programs. The revival 
of citizenship requires a transfer of power from government to families, voluntary associations, 
and communities. The president has instead sought to reinvigorate civic life by trying to 
relegitimize government.

<P>	At first blush, President Clinton's language of citizenship seems a sharp departure from 
the McGovernite ideology that has dominated American liberalism for the past 25 years. This 
ideology sees crime, drug abuse, family breakdown, and other social crises not primarily as 
deviant individual behavior but as social pathologies caused by underlying inequities. Moreover, 
in the McGovernite view, these pathologies are so complicated that traditional institutions such 
as churches and voluntary associations cannot possibly address them. Only policy specialists 
trained in the delivery of social services -- therapeutic-state elites -- are up to the task. The 
growth of McGovernism was accompanied by a massive transfer of power and resources to 
government. City halls, state capitals, and Washington, D.C., were given greater power to 
administer the programs that, liberals promised, would solve America's social crises. 
<P>
	By the mid-1980s, it had become apparent, even to Democrats, that liberalism's faith in the 
social-welfare state was misplaced. A growing body of research indicated that the expanded 
social-welfare bureaucracy, more often than not, worsened rather than relieved the problems it 
tried to solve. These policy failures also had clear political consequences. The Democratic Party 
began to lose traditional blue-collar voters, its former bedrock of support, who had become ever 
more frustrated by the mounting failures and rising costs of the welfare state. The liberal 
principles that undergirded the McGovernite approach -- especially the effort to blame society for 
failures of personal responsibility -- were at odds with the values of middle-class Americans. 
After Walter Mondale's landslide 1984 loss to Ronald Reagan, Democratic activists such as 
then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, then-Governor Charles Robb of Virginia, and Senator 
Sam Nunn of Georgia, banded together through the Democratic Leadership Council to bring 
Democrats back into the mainstream. 
<p>
	They called themselves "New Democrats," and much of their intellectual inspiration came 
from a school of political theory called communitarianism. Communitarians argued that man 
fundamentally is not a rights-bearing, property-seeking individual, but a social being who 
flourishes in stable associations and communities. Communitarians criticized both liberals for 
placing too much faith in bureaucracy and conservatives for stressing the power of the 
marketplace; they claimed that bureaucracy and the marketplace together had displaced the 
community as the locus of American life. 
<p>	
In the communitarians' view, 19th-century America offered the ideal model of community, with 
an active citizenry working locally to address shared concerns. Late 20th-century America, 
however, had witnessed the growth of big government and big business, which served to isolate 
and atomize Americans. The weakening of families and local community institutions, the 
communitarians warned, was beginning to erode fundamental elements of the American way of 
life. 
<p>	
According to the communitarians, the growth of bureaucracy, the instability of marketplace 
relationships, and an explosion of self-interested behavior -- increasing litigiousness is just one 
indicator -- all signaled a decline of the responsibility to community that is the essence of 
citizenship. Communitarians reminded us that it is civil society, not the marketplace or the 
bureaucracy, in which Americans interact and flourish. And it is civil society, they proclaimed, in 
which America's increasingly inaudible moral voice lies, for here is where the institutions that 
shape moral character are to be formed.
<p>
<b>The Clinton Promise</b>
<p>
	New Democrats clearly were on to something. Republicans had only paid lip service to the 
importance of civic involvement and the essential role of local and nongovernmental institutions. 
President Ford's Office of Public Liaison, President Reagan's Private Sector Initiative, and 
President Bush's Points of Light program showed that Republicans were aware of the problem, 
but these programs were severely limited in scope. They fell far short of providing the 
cornerstones of a domestic policy designed to redefine the relationship between citizens and the 
central government. 
<p>	
Eyeing the presidency in the early 1990s, Governor Clinton pushed beyond these Republican 
initiatives by drawing on the ideas of the communitarian movement. He emphasized 
responsibility in his presidential campaign, and the rhetoric of community and citizenship 
resonated with mainstream voters. On election night in 1992, President-elect Clinton called for a 
New Patriotism, in which Americans were "interested not just in getting, but in giving; not just in 
placing blame, but in assuming responsibility; not just in looking out for yourselves, but in 
looking out for others, too." On Inauguration Day, President Clinton declared, "It is time to break 
the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our government or from each other. Let us 
all take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families, but for our communities and 
our country." 
<p>
<b>Big Government Redux</b>
<p>
	Thus the Clinton administration began with an oft-expressed aversion to the mentality of 
entitlement and a keen recognition of the danger to community posed by big government. It soon 
became clear, however, that the policies of his administration bore no relation to the rhetoric of 
his campaign and inauguration. Consider the debacle of health-care reform, the would-be 
centerpiece of the president's domestic-policy legacy. The attempt to place nearly 15 percent of 
the private economy into federal stewardship was clearly at odds with a new ethic of personal 
responsibility.
<p>
	After the conservative victory in the 1994 elections, the president and his advisers realized 
that the health-care debate had unintentionally provoked anger against big government. With his 
familiar pattern of rhetorical retrenchment and redirection, the president tried to coopt this anger 
by returning to the language of citizenship. In his 1995 State of the Union address, the president 
admitted that "we need to get government closer to the people it's meant to serve. . . . Taking 
power away from federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is 
something everyone should be able to   be for."
<p>
	Notwithstanding this conservative tone, the president's new approach did not signal the final 
surrender of big-government liberalism. Rather, Clinton sought to recast big-government 
programs as instruments of individual and community empowerment. If conservatives believe 
that government must be limited in order to revitalize civil society, the president argued that 
government can be expanded or reinvented to serve as a "user-friendly" tool for citizens and 
communities. No Clinton initiative has epitomized this "bureaucratic populist" approach more 
than AmeriCorps, the president's national-service program. And it is no coincidence that in his 
1995 State of the Union, the President declared AmeriCorps to be "citizenship at its best."
<p>
	Touted by the administration as a "Republican idea," AmeriCorps at first struck many as 
precisely the type of program needed to revitalize civil society. The president promised that the 
program would assist nonprofit organizations working in local communities. In addition to 
promoting community service, AmeriCorps would combat the entitlement mindset nourished by 
the federal student-loan program by encouraging students to perform community service in 
return for financial aid. Most significantly, the president claimed that AmeriCorps would prove 
that government could act as a partner with citizens, using its resources to leverage additional 
contributions from the private sector. 
<p>
It quickly became apparent that in the AmeriCorps program, government overshadowed its 
"partners." More than one-fourth of AmeriCorps volunteers were placed in federal, state, or local 
government agencies -- where they would reinforce the bureaucratic state, not rebuild the 
voluntary sector. The program also drew criticism for channeling tax dollars to liberal advocacy 
groups and questionable activities, such as sex-education training and "self-esteem" enhancement 
projects. In retrospect, it is not surprising that such activities arose in a government-subsidized 
program; robust community groups that enjoy genuine grass-roots support do not need to seek 
federal grants. And the organizations that do seek out government support are generally those 
with their own in-house bureaucracies, accustomed to receiving federal social-welfare grants and 
contracts. 
<p>
	Finally, despite the president's statement that government could be used to leverage private 
resources, the General Accounting Office's audit of the first year of AmeriCorps activities found 
that only 12 percent of AmeriCorps's funds came from nongovernmental sources. The program's 
supposed ability to "leverage" private funds did not exist; if anything, AmeriCorps compounded 
the entitlement mentality that it sought to combat. Why would citizens support organizations that 
already received federal aid? In fact, public financing of AmeriCorps often led organizations to 
substitute the "blessing" of a government grant for the hard work of gaining and sustaining local 
support. 
<p>
	AmeriCorps reveals the administration's fundamental misreading of the components of 
healthy citizenship. The program provides government subsidies for voluntary activity at the 
federal, state, and local levels. By so doing, it conflates volunteering -- which nearly 90 million 
Americans regularly do -- with a federal-government jobs program run by a centralized 
bureaucracy. It is, in essence, a Great Society-style program trying to pass as a plan to 
reinvigorate citizenship and heal communities. But its very premise -- using federal resources to 
promote voluntarism -- contradicts the principle of self-government that lies at the heart of 
citizenship. AmeriCorps blurs the line between the problems and needs best addressed by 
individuals, voluntary association and localities and those best addressed by the federal 
government. Instead, it seems to suggest that social problems are the responsibility of the central 
government, and the federal bureaucracy must direct and improve local solutions.
<p>
<b>The School Lunch Debate</b>
<p>
	For all the flaws of AmeriCorps, the administration's shrill opposition to moves to scale back 
the federal bureaucracy is an even clearer example of how the president misunderstood the 
relationship between big government and citizenship. The Democrats' success in slowing the 
passage of the Contract With America through the House of Representatives in early 1995 
reached its apogee during the debate over Republican efforts to convert federal funds for school 
lunches into block grants to the states. The president's rhetoric -- once again contradicting his 
earlier paeans to citizenship -- contributed greatly to his success.
<p>
	During the public debate, the president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton challenged 
conservative reformers with an unqualified defense of the welfare state, evoking images of 
children starving because of Republican reforms. Rather than attacking the entitlement mentality 
responsible for unsustainable federal social-welfare spending, the administration fought 
desperately to save the status quo. The welfare bureaucracy was portrayed as a selfless agent of 
good. Ignoring successful local and privately run lunch programs, Clinton argued that the 
bureaucratic state -- described almost literally as a national nanny -- was the only entity that 
could be relied on to feed hungry schoolchildren. 
<p>
	They quickly expanded their criticism to include all aspects of the Republican drive to roll 
back the welfare state. In a defense of welfare spending in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> (March 
14, 1995), Mrs. Clinton called conservative welfare reform a "mean-spirited attack on nearly 
every government program designed to help poor and disadvantaged children," and concluded, 
"There is no such thing as other people's children." Implicit in Mrs. Clinton's defense of big-
government liberalism was the belief that individual responsibility for one's own children is 
fundamentally inadequate_and the only responsible adult is the nanny-state. It followed, then, 
that Americans could not be trusted with the broader, self-governing responsibilities of 
citizenship: to make decisions for themselves, their families, or their communities. The solution, 
the Clintons argued, was government <i>in loco parentis</i>, to save our children, the elderly, 
the poor, and perhaps not coincidentally, to protect the political interests of the welfare state. 
<p>
	The Clinton view of citizenship is thus based on universalized interests and responsibilities, 
not genuine familial and social attachments. By arguing that "there is no such thing as other 
people's children," Mrs. Clinton denigrates the motivating force that flows from obligation to 
family and loyalty to good friends and conscientious neighbors. Self-interest, a heightened 
attachment to our own property and loved ones, is essential to citizenship; through self-interest, 
we learn to be responsible for ourselves and our families, and to work with others to improve our 
communities. A detached altruism that makes everyone's children our own undermines the fixing 
of parental responsibility for nurturing and raising each child. This is communitarianism taken to 
extremes.
<p>
	The president's ill-fated defense of the school-lunch program, moreover, exposed his shallow 
commitment to returning power, responsibility, and resources to local officials. If we are truly to 
revitalize citizenship, Americans must be allowed to take more responsibility for public safety, 
education, and assistance to the poor. And restoring this responsibility to citizens and 
communities will almost certainly produce many different paths to sustaining healthy family and 
community life and to helping the disadvantaged. With such efforts, the bureaucratic state's 
platform of regulatory and entitlement-based equity will be broken. Individual and community 
choices will have much greater responsibility for the lives of citizens. Circumstances will not be 
better everywhere, but they will be better where citizens work to make them better.
<p>
	President Clinton's communitarian-inspired vision lacks a credible model for rebuilding 
America's communities and voluntary associations. These institutions have been weakened by 
overreaching government and the deeply rooted liberal dogmas that created and sustain such 
government. Citizen apathy -- and citizen anger -- are the result, not the cause, of these forces.
<p>
	To revitalize citizenship, Americans should forge a consensus on a new separation of powers -
- getting the federal government and even large state and local bureaucracies out of those areas of 
public life that citizens can and should direct themselves. The Clinton administration has failed 
to distinguish between the problems that Americans are responsible for solving as individuals 
and those, far more limited in scope, that properly involve government. By restoring authority 
and resources to citizens and the institutions they control directly, we will also restore the central 
place of middle-class values in our community and political life.
<p>
	The Clinton administration's use of federal resources to promote voluntarism and its 
unwillingness to trust states, localities, and parents in the fight over school lunches reflect a 
larger problem: the inability of welfare-state liberalism to recognize its proper limits. More than 
150 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville noted:
<p><blockquote>
	"Local institutions are to liberty what primary schools are to science; they put it within the 
people's reach; they teach people to appreciate its peaceful enjoyment and accustom them to 
make use of it. Without local institutions, a nation may give itself a free government, but it does 
not have the spirit of liberty."
</blockquote><p>
	Liberty, members of the citizenship movement must keep in mind, entails both failure and 
success. The risks are great -- but so is the opportunity to teach the self-reliance and 
independence that is the essence of the American character.

<title>The Contract With America: Implementing New Ideas in the U.S. -- Heritage</title>

<b>Heritage Lecture No. 549</b>

<h2>The Contract With America: 
Implementing New Ideas in the U.S.</h2>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerj.htm">Jeffrey B. Gayner</a><br>
[Jeffrey Gayner is a Senior Fellow at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation.</a>
 He spoke on October 12, 1995, at a conference in Athens, Greece, on "Beyond Statism: New 
Ideas." The conference was sponsored by the Athens-based Centre for Political Research and 
Information, a privately supported research institution that supports individualism and the free-
market economy.]
<p>

Decades from now, historians quite likely will reflect back upon the Contract With America as one 
of the most significant developments in the political history of the United States. As Newt 
Gingrich, the first Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives in 40 years, has written: 
"there is no comparable congressional document in our two-hundred-year history."
<p>
Never before had so detailed a document become such an integral part of a congressional election 
campaign; never had so many innovative ideas been drafted into legislation so quickly; and never in 
the previous six decades had so much legislation been passed by the House of Representatives in 
less than 100 days after the newly elected Members of Congress took office. As the chief political 
columnist for <i>The New York Times</i>, R. W. Apple, wrote in a front page news analysis: 
"Perhaps not since the start of the New Deal [in 1932], to which many of the programs now under 
attack can trace their origins, has Congress moved with such speed on so many fronts."
<p>
The revolutionary character of the change represented by the Contract went beyond the U.S. House 
of Representatives. Not only did the 367 Republican candidates for the House of Representatives 
who signed the document run election campaigns based on its provisions, but many of the 
campaigns for the U.S. Senate, as well as state and local government races, also pivoted around the 
fundamental questions concerning the role of government in society as reflected in the Contract. In 
short, the Contract may come to symbolize the most profound change in the American political 
landscape in the last half century and, in many respects, determine the character of American 
government well into the 21st century.
<p>
<b>The Contract and the Conservatives</b>
<p>
There has been a consistent growth of the role of the central government in the United States, or 
what you might call statism. This expansion of the government was never effectively challenged 
from the development of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal beginning in 1933 until the 1960s. Only 
after the defeat of Richard Nixon in the presidential campaign of 1960 did conservatives in 
America begin to vigorously challenge the growth of the state; at that time, conservatives won 
control of the Republican Party. From this position, the conservatives developed fundamental 
criticisms of statist liberal policies which culminated in the nomination of Barry Goldwater for 
President in 1964. Although Senator Goldwater was badly defeated in that election, both the 
conservative ideals he championed and the cadre of workers he enlisted became the basis of the 
modern conservative political movement in the United States.
<p>
Fortuitously, Senator Goldwater remained active in American politics through his final re-election 
to the United States Senate in 1980, the same year the second great transformation of American 
politics took place with the election of Ronald Reagan as President. It was then that conservatives 
learned two lessons about the role of the Presidency. On the one hand, the President can have a 
profound international impact through his policies, as reflected in the winning of the Cold War and, 
later, the war in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, in the most fundamental area of the size and 
scope of government activities, the President could lead, but a Congress controlled by the 
opposition did not have to follow. Thus, liberal Congressmen often effectively thwarted President 
Reagan's actions. As they often noted, the President is only in office for four or at most eight years, 
whereas Congressmen remained in office often for decades, as did the huge staff support system 
they developed. This "permanent staff" eventually reached over 20,000 personnel on Capitol Hill.
<p>
Thus, the third leg of the conservative revolution in post-World War II America is represented by 
the Contract With America and the election of a clear conservative majority in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. This can become the defining moment in the transformation of the responsibility 
for government in the United States away from the central government and back to state and local 
governments or to the private sector, to families and individuals.
<p>
The changes being debated in America now can provide useful lessons and insights to democratic 
societies throughout the world dealing with social and economic problems similar to those 
confronting the United States.
<p>
In many respects, the changes are already profound. The Contract With America led to much more 
than a change of parties in the United States, leading instead to fundamental philosophical 
questions being raised about government in ways not contemplated for 60 years.
<p>
Perhaps the best way to address various aspects of the Contract With America, the ideas in and 
behind the Contract and its relation to the size and scope of government activities, is to answer 
three basic questions:
<P><ul>
<li>Why was it done?
<li>How was it done?
<li>What has become of the Contract and the ideas it embodied?
</ul>
<p>

<b>Why was it done?</b>
<p>
Despite both the ascendancy of conservatives in the Republican Party and the election of Ronald 
Reagan as President, it became obvious that only a substantial change in the U.S. Congress could 
lead to the revolutionary transformation of America sought by conservatives for decades.
<p>
Many conservatives who came into Congress in the 1980 election and thereafter shared a much 
more dynamic vision of the role of conservatives in the Congress than did their predecessors. And 
among them, Congressman Gingrich consistently articulated his principal goal as the creation of a 
Republican majority in the House and the adoption of a very wide-ranging reform agenda.
<p>
In order to draw the attention of the public to the House of Representatives in the 1994 election, the 
Contract With America was created. The Contract provided the mechanism to move from vague 
political rhetoric to creating a specific political program. Through such a program, one could 
clearly delineate to the general public the contrasting philosophies of government the 1994 election 
offered the electorate.
<p>
The Contract's lineage can be traced back to the 1980 election campaign when most of the 
Republican candidates for federal office similarly stood on the steps of the Capitol in early October 
of that year and promised to support tax cuts, a strong national defense, and reductions in federal 
spending. While the Republicans gained 33 seats in the House that year, the Democrats nonetheless 
maintained their majority, and only the first two of three agenda items were initially adopted; but 
several years later, even the tax cuts and defense spending increases were abandoned. Federal 
spending continued out of control throughout the 1980s.
<p>
The ideas in the Contract emerged from extensive interaction between the new, more aggressive 
conservative Congressmen and the emergence of an extensive network of conservative think tanks, 
such as The Heritage Foundation. In 1980, Heritage and other conservative think tanks initially 
focused attention on changing the government through a change in the executive branch, as 
reflected in our monumental study <i>Mandate for Leadership</i>.
<p>
But after 1980, the attention of conservatives increasingly focused on the Congress. Heritage, for 
example, published a study in cooperation with the Claremont Institute in California on <a 
href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress: Crisis in the Separation of 
Powers</a>, which was published in 1988. Five years later, a successor study from Heritage came 
out entitled <a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/ruli.html">The Ruling Class: Inside the Imperial 
Congress</a>; 2.3 million copies of the later volume reached a wide audience. Both volumes drew 
attention to institutional problems within the Congress that were eventually addressed in the 
Contract With America.
<p>
And finally, Heritage developed a useful handbook, <a 
href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>, that provided specific legislative and 
policy recommendations for conservative candidates for Congress; many of these recommendations 
worked their way into detailed provisions of the Contract With America. In this manner, an 
extensive philosophical groundwork formed the intellectual foundation for the Contract With 
America when it formally appeared in the fall of 1994. Sound ideas thus became anchored into 
concrete policy recommendations.
<p>

<b>How was it done?</b>
<p>
The Contract itself emerged publicly with the staging of the mass signing of the Contract on the 
steps of the U.S. Capitol by 367 candidates for office on September 27, 1994. On that day, all of 
these candidates publicly pledged: "If we break this Contract, throw us out."  The Republicans who 
were already Members of the House of Representatives organized themselves into 11 working 
groups that eventually drafted ten bills that made up the Contract.
<p>
The items in the Contract were carefully selected in terms of issues that were of fundamental policy 
importance but also were "doable," that could be accomplished rather quickly because of the broad 
support they engendered. Extensive public opinion polling revealed that at least 60 percent of 
Americans supported all ten of the specific items in the Contract. By dealing initially with popular 
items, such as the Congress being governed by the same rules as all Americans, and broad 
philosophical concepts, such as balancing the federal budget, the Contract engendered popular 
momentum that could eventually lead to confronting more contentious issues, such as 
environmental regulations and Medicare and Medicaid reforms.
<p>
Politically, the Contract found a particularly receptive audience in the elections in the fall of 1994 
because of a combined disenchantment with the existing Congress and the widespread view of a 
lack of leadership being provided by President Bill Clinton in the White House. The Clinton 
campaign in 1992 had generated the expectation of great changes being made to deal with domestic 
problems. Moreover, the fact that Democrats in 1993 controlled both branches of the Congress 
together with the White House seemed to create the means for changes to take place by breaking 
the so-called partisan gridlock in Washington. But the failure to make substantive policy changes in 
1993 and 1994 clearly facilitated the political changes in November 1994. Thus, the concept of the 
Contract found a particularly receptive audience.
<p>
<b>What has become of the ideas embodied in the Contract?</b>
<P>
One of the revolutionary elements of the Contract is the fact that it actually was implemented as 
promised. Profound disillusionment within the American political system centered on the 
perception that politicians make promises only to be elected and then promptly abandon their 
pledges once safely ensconced in office. Thus, the first and most innovative idea reflected in the 
Contract required politicians to take their own promises seriously and actually implement them.
<p>
The idea of the first 100 days repeated, in a Republican Congress, what had been done by the most 
successful Democratic President in American history; in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt vigorously 
launched the New Deal in his first 100 days in office. The key difference between 1994 and 1932 
was that Republicans only controlled the Congress while a Democrat, President Clinton, still 
remained in the White House. This has clearly limited both the speed and scope of changes.
<p>
The ten items in the Contract were all acted upon in the first 100 days of the new Congress, which 
is what the signatories had pledged. Nine of the ten items in the Contract passed the House: Only 
the constitutional amendment on term limits (which required a two-thirds vote) was defeated. Out 
of a total of 302 roll call votes on issues related to the Contract With America, the conservatives 
prevailed on 299 of them. A balanced budget amendment passed in the House by a 300-123 margin 
but was subsequently defeated as it fell one vote short of the two-thirds needed for passage in the 
U.S. Senate. The overall margin by which the items in the Contract were passed averaged about 70 
percent despite the fact that the Republicans only held a 12-seat margin over the Democrats (52-48 
percent, the smallest House majority margin in 40 years). Given the notorious lack of party 
discipline in the American Congress, the passage by a large majority of nearly all of the items in the 
Contract was a remarkable achievement.
<p>
The ten specific bills which made up the Contract contained numerous provisions addressing a 
wide range of issues. Other elements of the Contract dealt with fundamental institutional political 
reforms. Outlined here are a few of these ideas and their status today.
<p>
<b>Institutional Reform: Making Congress More Democratic</b>
<p>
Most dramatically, the new Congress immediately implemented long-sought reforms within the 
House of Representatives. In this one area where the new Republican majority had full authority, 
they effectively exercised it by dramatically changing the nature of the House of Representatives 
itself during their first day in office; they passed nine major reforms.
<p>
First, they made all the laws that applied to the rest of the country apply to Congress itself; this 
indicated that Congressmen should be treated like other citizens and not remain a privileged elite, 
often immune from the consequences of the very laws they imposed on the rest of the country.
<P>
The House drastically cut by one-third the number of committees and similarly reduced committee 
staff personnel by one-third. In short, the lesson was that cutting back the size of government 
should begin in one's own House and thus establish a useful precedent for the rest of the federal 
government.
<p>
The House also provided for an independent audit of the finances of the House itself. This 
eventually led to a report by Price Waterhouse that found 2,200 instances of double payments for 
travel expenses, 700 retroactive pay hikes despite a rule against this, and, in general, accounting 
practices so out-of-date that the auditors could not be sure of the actual numbers they were working 
with.
<P>
Fundamental institutional change also arose in the Citizen Legislature Act provision of the Contract 
With America, which sought to limit the amount of time a Member of Congress could serve in one 
body to 12 years. This measure thus sought to limit the role of career politicians in Washington. But 
the measure required amending the Constitution and failed to achieve the two-thirds constitutional 
margin necessary. Term limits nonetheless remains a very popular issue, passed by many state 
legislatures; and Republicans promise that it will be the first item voted on if they retain control of 
the House after the 1996 elections.
<p>
<b>Controlling the Growth of Government: The Fiscal Responsibility Act</b>
<p>
A key ingredient, both explicit and implicit, in the Contract is a fundamental change in the 
character of government in the United States. The very first item in the Contract With America 
sought "to restore fiscal responsibility to an out-of-control Congress, requiring them to live under 
the same budget constraints as families and businesses."  The key components of this act were a 
line-item veto and balanced budget/tax limitation amendment. The line-item veto would allow the 
President to strike specific spending provisions in bills without having to veto the entire bill, and 
thus eliminate unnecessary spending. This provision passed both the House and Senate in slightly 
different forms, and President Clinton promises to sign it into law. On the other hand, the balanced 
budget amendment, which required a two-thirds vote to change the Constitution, was defeated. 
Even though not succeeding in passing the amendment itself, the House did pass a balanced budget 
resolution, which in the short term would have the same effect. Thus, the concept of balancing the 
budget has remained a central theme in the U.S. Congress; the means of achieving this could only 
come from a drastic reduction in the size and scope of the federal government.
<p>
The effort to eliminate unnecessary federal government programs has proven to be one of the 
biggest challenges facing the new Congress. Initial enthusiasm about eliminating unjustifiable 
federal programs, such as subsidies to the arts and humanities as well as public television and radio, 
generated fierce and well-organized opposition by the special-interest groups who benefit from the 
programs. Thus, instead of immediately eliminating them, the Congress only voted to phase them 
out over several years. What this means in Washington is that the battle is renewed each year.
<p>
The key lesson for anyone wanting to scale back the size of government is that it is best to 
eliminate a program immediately, as that engenders just as much opposition as reducing funding for 
a program. Only when a program is totally eliminated is the battle over that program won; in 
contrast, incremental reduction simply means revisiting the issue every year.
<p>
The example of the Reagan Presidency is instructive. Only 12 of 94 programs the Reagan 
Administration proposed to eliminate actually ended, and 10 of those were in Mr. Reagan's first 
term. Attempting to simply cut back programs ultimately failed. For example, the Small Business 
Administration (what we now call a welfare program for very few businesses) was cut back from 
$2 billion in 1980 to $85 million in 1989, but by the end of the Bush Administration in 1993, the 
program rose back to $975 million, and it is now once again a target of the new Congress.
<p>
Efforts to eliminate entire Cabinet-level departments of the government also have proved difficult. 
Conservatives have long sought to pursue a policy of "rollback" in dealing with proliferating 
government departments. The prime candidates on the list of government departments 
conservatives seek to eliminate are the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, and Housing 
and Urban Development. But at present, only the Commerce Department seems vulnerable. 
Another congressional initiative that has sought to consolidate the United States Information 
Agency, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Agency for International 
Development into the State Department prospectively would save $3 billion over the next four 
years. The combination of disenchantment with the size of the central government and growing 
budgetary constraints in Congress has created real momentum to seriously reduce the size and 
scope of central government activities in America.
<p>
<b>Welfare Reform: The Personal Responsibility Act</b>
<p>
One of the key ingredients in the initial Contract With America has led to one of the most 
contentious debates in Washington: reforming the welfare state. The Personal Responsibility Act in 
the Contract included prohibiting welfare going to mothers under the age of 18, halting the increase 
of benefits for mothers each time they had additional illegitimate children, and cutting welfare 
spending. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson declared a so-called War on Poverty; but 30 years 
later, after spending an estimated $5.4 trillion on welfare programs, it seems that poverty is winning 
the war. Thirty years of central government welfare programs seem only to have worsened the 
situation. The key problem, as my colleague at The Heritage Foundation, Robert Rector, has 
pointed out, is that "the welfare programs present a 'moral hazard' -- a strong tendency to increase 
the behaviors which are rewarded by welfare benefits."  Specifically, "when welfare benefits are 
tied, directly or indirectly, to such behaviors as low work effort, divorce, and illegitimacy, welfare 
strongly promotes an increase in those behaviors."  This only creates an ever-escalating cycle of 
more spending.
<p>
The Personal Responsibility Act of the Contract sought to fundamentally revamp the role of the 
state in welfare policy by developing policies to reduce teenage pregnancies and illegitimate births 
by prohibiting aid to mothers under 18 who give birth out of wedlock and requiring them to name 
the fathers of their children, who would be held accountable for their actions. Such women would 
be required to live at home to receive any aid and would not get housing subsidies to set up their 
own apartments. The Act also required that aid be cut off if recipients did not work.
<p>
The federal government provides 72 percent ($234.3 billion) of all welfare benefits, compared to 28 
percent ($90 billion) by the states. This has led the Congress to set certain general standards and 
criteria that recipients of aid must meet to receive benefits. But beyond some general restrictions, 
the key reform of welfare consists of attempting to decentralize the program to the 50 states and 
thereby stimulate numerous creative approaches to dealing with social problems.
<p>
This reflected the general conservative philosophical view in the Contract. As Speaker Gingrich 
writes in his book <i>To Renew America</i>: "We must replace our centralized, micro-managed, 
Washington-based bureaucracy with a dramatically decentralized system more appropriate to a 
continent-wide country... 'Closer is better' would be the rule of thumb for our decision making; less 
power in Washington and more back home, our consistent theme."
<p>
<b>Unleashing the American Economy: The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</b>
<p>
This Act attempted to reverse the increasingly debilitating role of the federal government in the 
American economy. One of its major provisions that has passed both the House and Senate ended 
so-called unfunded mandates which require states and local communities to impose various 
regulations but do not provide them the money to carry them out. In this manner, Congress passed 
allegedly beneficial laws that were cost-free, at least to the federal government. But such laws had 
enormous destructive power on states, local communities, and businesses. It was estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office that such regulations cost state and local government from $8.9 
billion to $12.7 billion between 1983 and 1990 and that the costs were growing. Similarly, the 
federal government often imposed costly regulations on businesses that stifled economic expansion 
by companies.
<p>
The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act included a variety of tax law changes and reforms in 
federal bureaucratic procedures that would enhance private property rights and economic liberty. 
Specifically, it provided for a 50 percent capital gains rate cut, allowed small businesses to deduct 
the first $25,000 worth of investment each year, reduced paperwork burdens on business by at least 
five percent, and required federal agencies to assess the risks and cost of each new regulation being 
imposed. Finally, the Contract provided for a Citizens Bill of Rights for anyone subject to 
investigation or inspection by a federal agency.
<p>
<b>Non-statist Approaches to Social Problems: The Family Reinforcement Act</b>
<p>

This Act similarly sought to refocus attention on the family and away from the government as the 
source of solutions to social problems. Thus, the Act reinforced child support orders issued by 
courts requiring absent fathers to financially support their children and provided both a refundable 
tax credit of up to $5,000 for families adopting a child and another tax credit of $500 for families 
caring for a dependent elderly parent or grandparent. Rather than emphasize institutionally provided 
state care, this Act sought to get orphaned children into homes and encourage family care of 
relatives. Similarly, another element of the tax provisions of the Contract provided a $500-per-child 
tax credit, which would mean that a family of four earning $28,000 would have their tax burden cut 
by one-third.
<p>
Other provisions provided incentives for saving money to be used for college education or buying a 
home and for ending a tax benefit for couples who live together but do not get married. For 
example, a couple earning $40,000 each will pay only $6,633 each in taxes if filing returns 
separately; but on a joint return, their combined taxes will rise by $1,285 to $14,541, or about a 10 
percent tax penalty for being legally married.
<p>
These proposals, as well as others, rested upon a fundamental philosophical principle, as stated in 
the book version of the Contract With America: "The American family is at the very heart of our 
society.... After forty years of putting others first [we] will put families first.... It is through the 
family that we learn values like responsibility, morality, commitment and faith." 
<p>
<b>Other Items in the Contract</b>
<p>
The remaining items in the Contract deal less with the role and nature of the state than with 
confronting specific legal and security issues. This includes dealing with the growing threat of 
crime in America, reforming the legal system, and improving the security of the country. They 
reflect the broad scope of the Contract but go beyond the scope of this lecture.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The ideas espoused in the Contract With America represented the culmination of 30 years of 
creative conservative thinking dealing with the basic social and economic problems of modern 
America. The ideas provided the background for the widest range of legislative initiatives, certainly 
since the 1930s, and possibly at any time in American political history. The fundamental principle 
involves re-examining the role of the government in society.
<p>
Central government attempts to solve many problems have only made them worse; thus, the 
Contract With America represents specific practical steps that can be taken in a wide range of 
government activities to roll them back. Ultimately, the government should cease many of its 
activities; but what is necessary now is a realistic transitional mechanism to achieve that goal. The 
Contract With America provides precisely the kind of formula that can accomplish that objective.

<h3>WHY RELIGION MATTERS: THE IMPACT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE ON SOCIAL STABILITY</h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION<sup>2</sup></b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By extolling freedom of religion in the schools, President Bill Clinton has raised the level of debate on the importance of religion to American life.<sup>3</sup>  The time is ripe for a deeper dialogue on the contribution of religion to the welfare of the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America has always been a religious country. "Its first Christian inhabitants were only too anxious to explain what they were doing and why," explains historian Paul Johnson. "In a way the first American settlers were like the ancient Israelites. They saw themselves as active agents of divine providence."<sup>4</sup>  Today, he adds, "it is generally accepted that more than half the American people still attend a place of worship over a weekend, an index of religious practice unequaled anywhere in the world, certainly in a great and populous nation."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the heart of religious practice is prayer: Americans pray even more than they go to church. According to a composite of surveys, 94 percent of blacks, 91 percent of women, 87 percent of whites, and 85 percent of men regard themselves as people who pray regularly. Some 78 percent pray at least once per week, and 57 percent pray daily. Even among the 13 percent of the population who call themselves agnostics or atheists, some 20 percent pray daily.<sup>6</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When policymakers consider America's grave social problems, including violent crime and rising illegitimacy, substance abuse, and welfare dependency, they should heed the findings in the professional literature of the social sciences on the positive consequences that flow from the practice of religion.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, there is ample evidence that:<p><ul><li> The strength of the family unit is intertwined with the practice of religion. Churchgoers<sup>8</sup> are more likely to be married, less likely to be divorced or single, and more likely to manifest high levels of satisfaction in marriage.
<p>
<li> Church attendance is the most important predictor of marital stability and happiness.
<p>
<li> The regular practice of religion helps poor persons move out of poverty. Regular church attendance, for example, is particularly instrumental in helping young people to escape the poverty of inner-city life.
<p>
<li>Religious belief and practice contribute substantially to the formation of personal moral criteria and sound moral judgment.
<p>
<li> Regular religious practice generally inoculates individuals against a host of social problems, including suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime, and divorce.
<p>
<li> The regular practice of religion also encourages such beneficial effects on mental health as less depression (a modern epidemic), more self-esteem, and greater family and marital happiness.
<p>
<li> In repairing damage caused by alcoholism, drug addiction, and marital breakdown, religious belief and practice are a major source of strength and recovery.
<p>
<li> Regular practice of religion is good for personal physical health: It increases longevity, improves one's chances of recovery from illness, and lessens the incidence of many killer diseases.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The overall impact of religious practice is illustrated dramatically in the three most comprehensive systematic reviews of the field.<sup>9</sup>  Some 81 percent of the studies showed the positive benefit of religious practice, 15 percent showed neutral effects, and only 4 percent showed harm.<sup>10</sup>  Each of these systematic reviews indicated more than 80 percent benefit, and none indicated more than 10 percent harm. Even this 10 percent may be explained by more recent social science insights into "healthy religious practice" and "unhealthy religious practice."<sup>11</sup>  This latter notion will be discussed later -- it is seen generally by most Americans of religious faith as a mispractice of religion. Unfortunately, the effects of unhealthy religious practice are used to downplay the generally positive influence of religion.<sup>12</sup>  This both distorts the true nature of religious belief and practice and causes many policymakers to ignore its positive social consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Religious practice appears to have enormous potential for addressing today's social problems. As summarized in 1991 by Allen Bergin, professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, considerable evidence indicates that religious involvement reduces "such problems as sexual permissiveness, teen pregnancy, suicide, drug abuse, alcoholism, and to some extent deviant and delinquent acts, and increases self esteem, family cohesiveness and general well being.... Some religious influences have a modest impact whereas another portion seem like the mental equivalent of nuclear energy.... More generally, social scientists are discovering the continuing power of religion to protect the family from the forces that would tear it down."<sup>13</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Professor Bergin's summary was echoed two years later by nationally syndicated columnist William Raspberry: "Almost every commentator on the current scene bemoans the increase of violence, lowered ethical standards and loss of civility that mark American society. Is the decline of religious influence part of what is happening to us?  Is it not just possible that anti-religious bias masquerading as religious neutrality is costing more than we have been willing to acknowledge?"<sup>14</sup>  Other reviews<sup>15</sup> also list the positive effects of religious belief and practice in reducing such problems as suicide, substance abuse, divorce, and marital dissatisfaction. Such evidence indicates clearly that religious practice contributes significantly to the quality of American life.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Given this evidence, <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Congress should:</b><ul>
<p>
<li> Begin a new national debate to help renew the role of religion in American life;
<p>
<li> Ask the General Accounting Office (GAO) to review the evidence on the beneficial effects of religious practice in the relevant social science literature and report its findings to a national commission formed to promote the consideration of religious practice among U.S. citizens;
<p>
<li> Fund federal experiments with school choice that include religiously affiliated schools;
<p>
<li>Pass a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that data on religious practice are useful for policymakers and researchers as part of the public policy debate; and
<p>
<li> Mandate a census question on religious practice. It violates nobody's freedom of religion for Congress to know the level and intensity of religious practice in America.
<p>
</ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The President should:</b>
<p>
<ul>

<li> Appoint judges who are more sensitive to the role of religion in public life, with the Senate ensuring that such is the case by ascertaining the stand of judges on matters of religion and its relationship to the Constitution;
<p>
<li> Direct the Bureau of the Census to record levels of religious practice in the census for the year 2000 (time is running out for preparation of the census questionnaire); and
<p>
<li> Issue a directive to all federal agencies making clear that cooperation between government entities and the social, medical, and educational services of faith-based organizations does not violate separation of church and state.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The U.S. Supreme Court should:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> Review the decisions in which it has changed the laws of the land by changing commonly held beliefs regarding the Constitution and religion and send to Congress those that should have been the object of legislative action rather than judicial reinterpretation.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>America's religious leaders should:</b>
<p><ul>
<li> Be much more assertive in emphasizing the contribution of religion to the health of the nation and in resisting efforts to minimize religion in public discourse;
<p>
<li> Make clear to their congregations that they are contributing not only to their own welfare, but also to the well-being of the nation by their regular attendance at religious worship;
<p>
<li> Take special care of the religious formation of children, especially during the transition period from childhood to adolescence, when they are most likely to lose their religious faith;
<p>
<li> Recognize that the church in the inner city, especially the black church, has a vital role to play in helping its people escape from the degrading culture of inner-city poverty; and
<p>
<li> Encourage education leaders, social scientists, and social policy practitioners to rely more on religious belief and worship to achieve social policy and social work goals.
</ul><p>

<b>RELIGION AND HAPPINESS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever since Aristotle outlined the goal of a sound civil order in his <i>Politics</i>,<sup>16</sup> social and political scientists and social psychologists have been particularly interested in what makes human beings happy. Happy people tend to be productive and law-abiding. They learn well, make good citizens, and are invariably pleasant company. It turns out that the practice of religion has a significant effect on happiness and an overall sense of personal well-being. Religious affiliation and regular church attendance are near the top of the list for most people in explaining their own happiness<sup>17</sup> and serve as good predictors of who is most likely to have this sense of well-being.<sup>18</sup>  Happiness is greater and psychological stress is lower for those who attend religious services regularly.<sup>19</sup>  Those pursuing a personal relationship with God tend to have improved relationships with themselves and with others.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A large epidemiological study conducted by the University of California at Berkeley in 1971 found that the religiously committed had much less psychological distress than the uncommitted.<sup>21</sup>  Rodney Stark, now of the University of Washington, found the same in a 1970 study: The higher the level of religious attendance, the less stress suffered when adversity had to be endured.<sup>22</sup>  Similarly, in a longitudinal study of 720 adults conducted by David Williams of the University of Michigan, regular religious attendance led to much less psychological distress.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1991, David Larson, adjunct professor at the Northwestern and Duke University Schools of Medicine and president of the National Institute of Healthcare Research, completed a systematic review of studies on religious commitment and personal well-being. He found that the relationship is powerful and positive; overall, psychological functioning improved following a resumption of participation in religious worship for those who had stopped.<sup>24</sup><p>
<b>RELIGION AND FAMILY STABILITY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is a growing consensus that America needs to pursue policies aimed at re-strengthening the family. The beneficial effects of religious worship on family stability clearly indicate one way to help accomplish this. Professors Darwin L. Thomas and Gwendolyn C. Henry of Brigham Young University's Department of Sociology sum up earlier research<sup>25</sup> on the quest by young people for meaning and love: "Research on love clearly indicates that for many, love in the social realm cannot clearly be separated from love that contains a vertical or a divine element.... Young people see love as the central aspect of the meaning of life; they believe that religion is still important in helping form judgments and attitudes."<sup>26</sup>  Their conclusion: "Family and religious institutions need to be studied simultaneously in our efforts to understand the human condition better."<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Middletown," one of the century's classic sociological research projects, studied the lives of inhabitants of a typical American town, first in the 1920s and for the third time in the 1980s. Based on the latest round of follow-up research, Howard Bahr and Bruce Chadwick, professors of sociology at Brigham Young University, concluded in 1985 that "There is a relationship between family solidarity -- family health if you will -- and church affiliation and activity. Middletown [churchgoing] members were more likely to be married, remain married and to be highly satisfied with their marriages and to have more children.... The great divide between marriage status, marriage satisfaction and family size is... between those who identify with a church or denomination and those who do not."<sup>28</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Four years later, Professor Arland Thornton of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan likewise concluded from a Detroit study of the same relationship that "These data indicate strong intergenerational transmission of religious involvement. Attendance at religious services is also very stable within generations across time."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"With striking consistency, the most religious among us [as Americans] place a greater importance on the full range of family and friendship activities," concluded a Connecticut Mutual Life report in 1982.<sup>30</sup>  A group of Kansas State University professors reached the same conclusion: "Family commitment is indeed a high priority in many American families and it is frequently accompanied by a concomitant factor of religious commitment."<sup>31</sup>  In yet another study conducted during the 1970s and 1980s, professors Nick Stinnet of the University of Alabama and John DeFrain of the University of Nebraska sought to identify family strengths. From their nationwide surveys of strong families, they found that 84 percent identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families.<sup>32</sup>  It should be noted that the same pattern appears to hold for African-American families: Parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidelines.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Marital Satisfaction.</b> Couples with long-lasting marriages indicate that the practice of religion is an important factor in marital happiness. Indeed, David Larson's systematic reviews indicate that church attendance is the most important predictor of marital stability.<sup>34</sup>  Others have found the same result.<sup>35</sup>  Twenty years ago it was first noted that very religious women achieve greater satisfaction in sexual intercourse with their husbands than do moderately religious or non-religious women.<sup>36</sup>  The <i>Sex in America</i> study published in 1995, and conducted by sociologists from the University of Chicago and the State University of New York at Stonybrook, also showed very high sexual satisfaction among "conservative" religious women.<sup>37</sup>  From the standpoint of contemporary American media culture, this may appear strange or counter-intuitive, but the empirical evidence is consistent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Divorce and Cohabitation.</b> Regular church attendance is the critical factor in marital stability across denominations and overrides effects of doctrinal teaching on divorce. For instance, black Protestants and white Catholics, who share similarly high church attendance rates, have been shown to have similarly low divorce rates.<sup>38</sup>  Furthermore, when marital separation occurs, reconciliation rates are higher among regular church attendees, and highest when both spouses have the same high level of church attendance.<sup>39</sup>  Findings on the other end of the marital spectrum reinforce the point: A 1993 national survey of 3,300 men aged 20-39 found that those who switch partners most are those with no religious convictions.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, cohabitation before marriage poses a high risk to later marital stability,<sup>41</sup> and premarital cohabitation is much less common among religious Americans. "The cohabitation rate is seven times higher among persons who seldom or never attend religious services compared to persons who frequently attend," writes David Larson of the National Institute of Healthcare Research. "Women who attended religious services once a week were only one-third as likely to cohabit as those who attended church services less than once a month."  Furthermore, "If the mother frequently attended religious services, both sons and daughters were only 50 percent as likely to cohabit as adult children whose mothers were not actively religious."<sup>42</sup>  Rockford Institute President Allan Carlson summarizes the pattern: "Social scientists are discovering the continuing power of religion to protect the family from the forces that would tear it down."<sup>43</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact is that too many social scientists have failed to appreciate the significance of research on the relationship between family and religion. As another researcher of the same period concludes, "We may have underestimated this 'silent majority' and it is only fair to give them equal time."<sup>44</sup>  The centrality of stable married family life in avoiding such problems as crime,<sup>45</sup> illegitimacy,<sup>46</sup> and welfare<sup>47</sup> has become indisputable. If such a stable family life is linked closely to a lively religious life, as these studies indicate, then the peace and happiness of the nation depend significantly on a renewal of religious practice and belief.
<p>

<b>RELIGION AND PHYSICAL HEALTH</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In public health circles, the level of educational attainment is held to be the key demographic predictor of physical health. For over two decades, however, the level of religious practice has been shown convincingly to be equally important.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As early as 1972, researchers from the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health found that cardiovascular diseases, the leading killers of older people, were reduced significantly in early old age by a lifetime of regular church attendance. By contrast, non-attendees had higher mortality rates for such other diseases as cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, and arteriosclerosis, in addition to other cardiovascular diseases and even suicide.<sup>48</sup>  Research on mortality patterns among the poor confirmed a decade later that those who went to church regularly lived longer.<sup>49</sup>  Since then, other studies have reinforced this general finding.<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Blood pressure, a key factor in cardiovascular health, is reduced significantly by regular church attendance, on average by 5mm of pressure.<sup>51</sup>  Given that reducing blood pressure by 2 to 4 mm also reduces the mortality rate by 10 to 20 percent for any given population,<sup>52</sup> a reduction of 5 mm is a very significant public health achievement by any standard. For those over 55 years of age, the average decrease was 6 mm. Among those who smoked -- a practice that increases blood pressure -- regular church attendance decreased the risk of early stroke by 700 percent.<sup>53</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nor are the health benefits of religious commitment confined to the cardiovascular system. In 1987, a major review of 250 epidemiological health research studies -- studies which examined the relationship between health and religion and measured such additional outcomes as colitis, cancers of many different types, and longevity measures -- concluded that, in general, religious commitment improves health.<sup>54</sup>  A 1991 study of two national samples<sup>55</sup> also concluded that the degree to which people prayed and participated in religious services significantly affected their health status, regardless of age.<sup>56</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In what must be one of the most unusual experiments in medical history, Dr. Robert B. Byrd, a cardiologist then at the University of California at San Francisco Medical School, conducted a random-sample, double-blind study of the effects of prayer -- not <i>by</i> the patients but <i>for</i> the patients -- on the outcome of cardiac surgery. The study was published in 1982. None of the patients knew they were being prayed for, none of the attending doctors and nurses knew who was being prayed for and who was not, and those praying had no personal contact with the patients before or during the experiment. Outcomes for the two sets of patients differed significantly: Those prayed for ha
d noticeably fewer post-operative congestive heart failures, fewer cardiopulmonary arrests, less pneumonia, and less need for antibiotics.<sup>57</sup>  To date, this study has not been replicated, though the intriguing results challenge the academic and medical community to verify or disprove them.<p><b>RELIGION AND SOCIAL BREAKDOWN</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The practice of religion has beneficial effects on behavior and social relations: on illegitimacy, crime and delinquency, welfare dependency, alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, depression, and general self-esteem.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Illegitimacy.</b> One of the most powerful of all factors in preventing out-of-wedlock births is the regular practice of religious belief. Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births, their effects,<sup>58</sup> and the huge social and economic costs to national and state budgets, this should be of major interest to policymakers.<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It has long been known that intensity of religious practice is closely related to adolescent virginity and sexual restraint and control. This general finding, replicated again and again,<sup>59</sup> also holds true specifically for black teenage girls,<sup>60</sup> the group with the highest teen pregnancy rates among all demographic subgroups.<sup>61</sup>  Reviews of the literature demonstrate that, nearly without exception, religious practice sharply reduces the incidence of premarital intercourse.<sup>62</sup>  The reverse is also true: The absence of religious practice accompanies sexual permissiveness and premarital sex. This is confirmed in numerous studies,<sup>63</sup> including a 1991 analysis of the federal government's National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.<sup>64</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The impact of religious practice on teenage sexual behavior also can be seen at the state level: States with higher levels of aggregate religiousness have lower rates of teenage pregnancy.<sup>65</sup><p
>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In an important study published in 1987, a group of professors from the Universities of Georgia, Utah, and Wyoming found that the main cause of problematic adolescent sexual behaviors and attitudes is not only family dynamics and processes, as previously thought, but the absence of religious behavior and affiliation. They further concluded that healthy family dynamics and practices are themselves caused to a powerful degree by the presence or absence of religious beliefs and practices.<sup>66</sup>  The same results also hold true in international comparisons.<sup>67</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As with drugs, alcohol, and crime, the religious behavior of the mother is one of the strongest predictors of the daughter's sexual attitudes.<sup>68</sup>  It also has long been known in the social sciences that daughters of single mothers are more likely to engage in premarital sexual behavior during adolescence.<sup>69</sup>  These mothers are more frequently permissive in their sexual attitudes, and religion for them has less importance than it has for mothers in two-parent families.<sup>70</sup>  These findings also have been replicated.<sup>71</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The religious practices of parents, particularly their unity on religious issues, powerfully influence the behavior of children. Thus, for policymakers interested in reducing teenage (and older) out-of-wedlock births, the lesson is clear: Religious belief and regular worship reduce the likelihood of this form of family breakdown. One faith-based sex education course that included both mothers and daughters, for example, was aimed specifically at reducing the teenage pregnancy rate. The results were notably successful: Out-of-wedlock births among the at-risk population were almost eliminated.<sup>72</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Crime and Delinquency.</b> A review of the small amount of research done on the relationship between crime and religion shows that states w
ith more religious populations tend to have fewer homicides and fewer suicides.<sup>73</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A four-year longitudinal, stratified, random-sample study of high school students in the Rocky Mountain region, published in 1975, demonstrated that religious involvement significantly decreased drug use, delinquency, and premarital sex, and also increased self-control.<sup>74</sup>  A 1989 study of midwestern high school students replicated these findings.<sup>75</sup>  Similarly, young religious adults in Canada were found in a 1979 study to be less likely to use or sell narcotics, to gamble, or to destroy property.<sup>76</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What is true for youth is also true for adults.<sup>77</sup>  Religious behavior, as opposed to mere attitude or affiliation, is associated with reduced crime.<sup>78</sup>  This has been known in the social science literature for over 20 years.<sup>79</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In research conducted in the late 1980s -- controlling for family, economic, and religious backgrounds -- a research team from the University of Nevada found that black men who eventually ended up in prison and those who did not came respectively from two different groups: those who did not go to church, or stopped going around ten years of age, and those who went regularly.<sup>80</sup>  This failure of faith at the onset of adolescence parallels the pattern found among those who become alcoholics or drug addicts. Clearly, the family's inability to inspire regular religious worship among emerging young adults is a sign of internal weakness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Welfare Dependency.</b> In his classic study <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, Max Weber, the preeminent German sociologist of the first half of the 20th century, demonstrated the connection between religious practice and financial well-being among Protestants. Other work on the same theme shows that this is not confined to Protestants, but that it applies across a longer period of history and across denominational lines.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This link between religion and prosperity has important implications for the poor. In 1985, for instance, Richard B. Freeman of the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that:
<p><blockquote>
	[Church attendance] is associated with substantial differences in the behavior of [black male youths from poverty-stricken inner-city neighborhoods] and thus in their chances to "escape" from inner city poverty. It affects allocation of time, school-going, work activity and the frequency of socially deviant activity.... It is important to recognize that our analysis has identified an important set of variables that separate successful from unsuccessful young persons in the inner city. There is a significant number of inner city youth, readily identifiable, who succeed in escaping that pathology of inner-city slum life.<sup>81</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ongoing studies by Professor Ranald Jarrell of the Department of Education at Arizona State University West show the power of religious belief and practice in encouraging a spirit of optimism among socially at-risk but advancing children. The subjects are students at the De La Salle Academy, an independent school in the upper west side of Manhattan serving primarily poor inner-city black and Hispanic middle school children who show substantial academic promise. Within this group, the highest concentration of pessimists is found among students with the lowest attendance at church. Those who attend church weekly or more frequently, on the other hand, exhibit the following profiles:
<P><ul>
<li> They are more optimistic about their futures;
<p>
<li> They have better relationships with their parents;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to have serious and realistic goals for their futures;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to see the world as a friendly place in which they can achieve, rather than as a hostile world with powerful forces arrayed against them; and
<p>
<li> They are more likely to see themselves as in control of their own futures, whereas those who do not attend church are more likely to see themselves as victims of oppression.<sup>82</sup></ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the best national sample for tracking the development of America's youth from the late 1970s, clearly indicate the difference regular religious practice makes for those who grew up in poverty in the 1970s and 1980s. Among those who attended church weekly in both 1979 and 1982, average family income in 1993 was $37,021; among those who never attended church in 1979 or 1982, however, average family income in 1993 was $24,361 --  a difference of $12,660.<sup>83</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Other studies also show that growing up in an intact family correlates significantly and positively with future earnings.<sup>84</sup>  However, the NLSY data show that regular religious practice benefits both those who grow up in intact families <i>and</i> those who grow up in broken families. The other differences remain, but the positive impact of religion on both groups is evident.<sup>85</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Alcohol and Drug Abuse.</b> The relationship between religious practice and the moderate use or avoidance of alcohol is well documented,<sup>86</sup> regardless of whether denominational beliefs prohibit the use of alcohol.<sup>87</sup>  According to general studies, the higher the level of religious involvement, the less likely the use or abuse of alcohol.<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Persons who abuse alcohol rarely have a strong religious commitment.<sup>89</sup>  In their study of the development of alcohol abuse, David Larson and William P. Wilson, professors of psychiatry at Northwestern University School of Medicine, found that nine out of ten alcoholics had lost interest in religion in their teenage years, in sharp contrast to teenagers generally, among whom interest in religion increased by almost 50 percent and declined by only 14 percent.<sup>90</sup>  Robert Coombs and his colleagues at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine found that alcohol abuse is 300 percent higher among those who do not attend church.<sup>91</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Drug and alcohol use is lowest in the most conservative religious denominations and highest in non-religious groups, while liberal church groups have use rates just slightly lower than those for non-religious groups. But for all groups, religious commitment correlates with absence of drug abuse.<sup>92</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, involvement in any religious denomination or group generally decreases the level of drug use regardless of whether the denomination teaches against the use of alcohol, although denominations that teach against any use of drugs or alcohol exhibit the highest rates of drug avoidance. Among traditional American religions, Mormons have the highest denominational association between religious doctrine and drug avoidance; they also have the most restrictive proscriptions against drug use. On the other hand, Roman Catholics have the highest alcohol use rate; their religion condemns the abuse of alcohol but does not proscribe its use.<sup>93</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Attendance at church and related religious activities has special significance for drug use among teenagers. In a 1985 study of young girls aged between 9 and 17, less than 10 percent of those who reported attending religious services weekl
y or more often indicated any drug or alcohol use, compared with 38 percent of all those studied.<sup>94</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The parental attitude to religion also is important in dealing with alcohol use. A 1985 study indicated that if the mother and father have deep, competing differences toward religious belief and practice, their children are more likely to use or abuse alcohol than are children whose parents do not differ on matters of religion. Conversely, if their parents' religious beliefs and practices are similar, children are far more likely to abstain from alcohol or to drink with moderation.<sup>95</sup>  Almost three decades before these findings, Orville Walters, then a research fellow at the Menninger School of Psychiatry in Topeka, Kansas, found that alcoholics who came from religious backgrounds tended to have mothers who were highly religious but fathers who were more non-religious.<sup>96</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For over four decades it has been known,<sup>97</sup> and replicated,<sup>98</sup> that alcoholics with a religious background or strong religious beliefs are much more likely to seek help and treatment. Indeed, Alcoholics Anonymous, the major organization combating alcoholism in America, has known for over half a century that the most effective element in its program is its religious or spiritual component.<sup>99</sup>  David Larson of the National Institute for Healthcare Research notes: "Even after alcoholism has been established, religion is often a powerful force in achieving abstinence. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) uses religion, invoking a Higher Power to help alcoholics recover from addiction."<sup>100</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Paralleling the research on alcohol addiction, an early review of studies of drug addiction found a lack of religious commitment to be a predictor of who abuses drugs.<sup>101</sup>  Many more recent studies replicate this finding.<sup>102</sup>  As in so many other research studies, the best 
measurement of religious commitment is frequency of church attendance: "Overall church attendance was more strongly related to [less] drug use than was intensity of religious feelings."<sup>103</sup>  This is true for both males and females. According to Jerald G. Bachman of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, "Factors we found to be most important in predicting use of marijuana and other drugs during the late 1970's remained most important during the early 1980's. Drug use is below average among those with strong religious commitments."<sup>104</sup>  The more powerfully addictive the drug being considered, the more powerful is the impact of church attendance in preventing its use.<sup>105</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In results almost identical to those for alcoholics, researchers at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a section of the National Institutes of Health and the nation's premier drug abuse research facility, found in their interviews of narcotic addicts that "the addict had neither current religious preference nor a history of attending religious services.... In addition... the addicts' fathers were much less involved in regular or frequent religious practices, than were a parallel group of control fathers.... Religiously, the mother was far more involved than her husband, the difference in regular religious participation between the addict's parents being twice that for the control's parents.... Religiously, the addicts were significantly less involved in reading the Bible, and praying."  They also had far more frequent loss of interest in religion during adolescence.<sup>106</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Louis A. Cancellaro of the Department of Psychiatry at the Veterans Administration in Johnson City, Tennessee, writes that, "Like their fathers, addicts are less religiously involved than their normal peers, and during adolescence, less frequently make decisions either to become more interested in religion or to commit themselves to a re
ligious philosophy to live by."<sup>107</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In reviewing the religious treatment of addicts, research psychiatrists at the Duke University Department of Psychiatry concluded in 1992: "[The] role of religious commitment and religiously oriented treatment programs can be significant factors which ought to be considered and included when planning a mix of appropriate treatment alternatives.... Perhaps the greatest advantage of religious programs is their recourse to churches as a support system.... Religious treatment programs are not suitable for everyone. For those men and women who can accept the creeds, rituals, and commitments required of such programs there seem to be certain advantages."<sup>108</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Suicide.</b> The practice of religion reduces the rate of suicide, both in the United States and abroad.<sup>109</sup>  In fact, the rate of church attendance predicts the suicide rate better than any other factor (including unemployment, traditionally regarded as the most powerful variable). Those who attend church frequently are four times less likely to commit suicide than those who never attend. Conversely, the national decline in church attendance is associated with a heightened suicide rate; fluctuations in church attendance rates in the 1970s paralleled the suicide rates for different subgroups: whites, blacks, men, and women.<sup>110</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Steven Stack, professor of sociology at Pennsylvania State University, in a landmark 1985 study on the demography of suicide has found that "Families and religion change together over time.... As the importance of the domestic-religious institutional complex declines, the study finds a rise in the rate of suicide, both for the general population and for the age cohort at the center of the decline, the youth cohort."<sup>111</sup>  In another, earlier study, Stack broke new ground in finding that the effect of unemployment in causing suicide is greatl
y diminished when religious behavior is factored into the equation.<sup>112</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In inter-state comparisons, higher levels of church attendance are associated with lower rates of suicide.<sup>113</sup>  The same holds true in international comparisons.<sup>114</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Depression.</b> Religion appears to reduce the incidence of depression among those with medical problems. For instance, University of Michigan Professor of Sociology David Williams conducted a randomized survey of 720 adults suffering from leg and hip injuries in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1990. Those who attended religious services regularly were less depressed and less distressed by life events than those who did not. This finding held across age, race, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and religious affiliation. Religious affiliation alone did not have these effects, but religious behavior did.<sup>115</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Younger people also tend to experience fewer of the anxieties of growing up if they are religious. For instance, both male and female Texas high-schoolers found that religious beliefs gave meaning to their lives and reduced the incidence of depression among them.<sup>116</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Self-esteem.</b> The absence of self-esteem weakens the personality and puts the person at greater risk for crime, addictions, and other social maladies.<sup>117</sup>  In all religious denominations, psychological weaknesses decrease as religious orthodoxy increases.<sup>118</sup>  Among college students, for instance, the practice of religion was shown in 1969 to have a positive effect on mental health;<sup>119</sup> students involved with campus ministries were much healthier and made much less use of mental health services.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, self-esteem is linked to a person's image of God. Those with high self-esteem think of God primarily as loving, while those 
with low self-esteem think of God primarily as punitive.<sup>120</sup>  This was observed by Carl Jung, one of the most influential pioneers of modern psychology and psychotherapy: "Among all my patients in the second half of my life... there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life. It is safe to say that every one of them fell ill because he had lost that which the living religions of every age have given their followers and none of them has been really healed who did not regain his religious outlook."<sup>121</sup>  Other evidence exists that people with a religious commitment, whether young or old, who become emotionally or psychologically distressed are much more likely to seek help.<sup>122</sup><p><b>UNDERSTANDING "INTRINSIC" AND "EXTRINSIC" RELIGIOUS BEHAVIOR</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Recent advances in the investigation of religious behavior have led social scientists to distinguish between two distinct categories or orientations: "intrinsic" and "extrinsic."  Intrinsic practice is God-oriented and based on beliefs which transcend the person's own existence. Research shows this form of religious practice to be beneficial. Extrinsic practice is self-oriented and characterized by outward observance, not internalized as a guide to behavior or attitudes. The evidence suggests this form of religious practice is actually more harmful than no religion: Religion directed toward some end other than God, or the transcendent, typically degenerates into a rationalization for the pursuit of other ends such as status, personal security, self justification, or sociability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The difference between these two forms of religious practice have implications for future research and for the interpretation of all research on religious practice. There is a radical difference between what religious people know to be conversion of the spirit or heart and simply conforming external behavior for its own sake, or for benefits derived from religious behavior.<sup>123</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;William James, professor of psychology at Harvard University in the early 1900s and a pioneer in the psychological study of religious behavior, was the first to make the social science distinction between the two forms of religious practice. Gordon Allport, his successor at Harvard in the late 1960s, concluded: "I feel equally sure that mental health is facilitated by an intrinsic, but not an extrinsic, religious orientation."<sup>124</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The two orientations lead to two very different sets of psychological effects. For instance, "intrinsics" have a greater sense of responsibility and greater internal control, are more self-motivated, and do better in their studies. By contrast, "extrinsics" are more likely to be dogmatic, authoritarian, and less responsible, to have less internal control, to be less self-directed, and to do less well in their studies.<sup>125</sup>  Intrinsics are more concerned with moral standards, conscientiousness, discipline, responsibility, and consistency than are extrinsically religious people.<sup>126</sup>  They also are more sensitive to others and more open to their own emotions. By contrast, extrinsics are more self-indulgent, indolent, and likely to lack dependability. For example, the most racially prejudiced people turn out to be those who go to church occasionally<sup>127</sup> and those who are extrinsic in their practice of religion.<sup>128</sup>  These findings have been replicated<sup>129</sup> in a number of different forms.<sup>130</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;T
he contrasting effects show up in college students. Intrinsically religious students tend to have internal locus of control, intrinsic motives, and a higher grade point average.<sup>131</sup>  By contrast, a 1980 study indicated that extrinsically religious students were more dogmatic and authoritarian, less responsible and less motivated, had less internal locus of control, and had a lower grade point average. Intrinsically religious students were found to have a greater concern for moral standards and to be more conscientious, disciplined, responsible, and consistent, while the extrinsic were more self-indulgent, more indolent, and less dependable.<sup>132</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, intrinsics are less anxious about life's ups and downs, while extrinsics are more anxious. Further, the religious beliefs and practices of intrinsics are more integrated; for instance, they are more likely to worship publicly as well as pray privately. By contrast, those who pray privately but do not worship publicly tend to have a higher level of general anxiety -- a characteristic of extrinsics generally.<sup>133</sup>  In an ironic set of findings on anxiety about death, extrinsics fared worst of all: worse than intrinsics and worse than those without religious beliefs.<sup>134</sup>  From a purely social science standpoint, the intrinsic form of religion is thus good and desirable, and the extrinsic form is harmful. Religious teachers, without being utilitarian, would agree.<sup>135</sup>
<p>

<b>RELIGION AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is a tension between practitioners of social science and religious belief.<sup>136</sup>  Darwin L. Thomas and Gwendolyn C. Henry, professors of sociology at Brigham Young University, write: "From the work of Freud and others, much of the early history of the social sciences is characterized by the expectation that involvement in and reliance upon the religious institution will be associated with people who have a low sense of personal well-being."<sup>137</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is repeated evidence that much the same hostility to religion -- a hostility at variance with the attitude of the vast majority of Americans -- persists among members of America's professional elites.<sup>138</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Stephen L. Carter, professor of law at Yale University, points out that "One sees a trend in our political and legal cultures toward treating religious beliefs as arbitrary and unimportant, a trend supported by rhetoric that implies that there is something wrong with religious devotion. More and more, our culture seems to take the position that believing deeply in the tenets of one's faith represents a kind of mystical irrationality, something that thoughtful, public-spirited American citizens would do better to avoid."<sup>139</sup>  However, the available evidence renders such opposition unreasonable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Professor David Larson of Duke University Medical School draws attention to similar biases in the mental health professions. Consider <i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i>, the standard reference manual for the classification of mental illnesses, which essentially defines the practice of psychiatrists, clinical psychology, and clinical social work and is central to the practice, research, and financing of these professions. In the third edition, religious examples were used only as illustrations in discussions of mental illness, such as delusions, incoherence, and illogical thinking. The latest edition has corrected this bias.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider also the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, one of the most widely used of all psychological tests. In the MMPI, all the positive religion-connected traits -- self-discipline, altruism, humility, obedience to authority, conventional morality -- are weighted negatively. Thus, to choose the self-description "I am orthodoxly religious" is to detract from one's mental health standing. Conversely, several traits that religious people would regard as diminishing themselves, at least in some situations -- self-assertion, self-expression, and a high opinion of oneself -- are weighted positively.<sup>140</sup>  The latest editions of the MMPI have removed the biased items.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite this general hostility among social science and mental health professionals, the empirical evidence shows religion to be a very powerful and positive part of everyday life. Patrick McNamara, professor of sociology at the University of New Mexico, explains the difference between social scientists and religiously affiliated people generally: "Sociologists tend to see concern for personal challenge -- e.g. to get one's own moral life in order -- as somehow secondary to social challenge or the effort to identify and criticize those socioeconomic structures that inhibit the individual's own group from attaining a fuller human existence."<sup>141</sup>  McNamara continues: "In [the] typical social science analysis, the demands of the inner life are neglected and personal agency and autonomy exercised in the choice to examine one's own life and put it in order according to an internalized ethic of repentance... is not acknowledged."<sup>142</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite the attitude of many professionals, Gallup surveys continue to indicate that one-third of the American people regard religious commitment as the most important dimension in their lives. Another third regard religion as a very important, though not the single most dominant, factor in their lives.<sup>143</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Totally secular approaches to many issues -- public policy, psychotherapy, and education -- use an alien framework for this two-thirds of the population. The plain fact is that religion plays a powerful role in the personal and social lives of most Americans. It is a role that should be understood clearly by the professions, by policymakers, and by the media.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From many other areas of social science research -- family dynamics, group dynamics, marital dynamics -- positive reciprocal relationships with others are known to be powerful across a host of areas similar to those reviewed in this paper: stress, ability to relate with others in general, productivity, and learning, to name just a few. The core of the religious commitment is an intention to have a positive relationship with another Being, a transcendent and therefore all-available Being. Viewed in this fashion, the documented effects of religious commitment are not mysterious, but an extension of the effects which we know arise from positive relations between human beings. Thus, the findings on religion fit with the general corpus of what is known about relationships from the existing body of social science research.
<p>

<b>POLICY IMPLICATIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The evidence indicates strongly that it is a good social policy to foster the widespread practice of religion. It is bad social policy to block it. The widespread practice of religious beliefs is one of America's greatest national resources. It strengthens individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole. It significantly affects educational and job attainment and reduces the incidence of such major social problems as out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol addiction, crime, and delinquency. No other dimension of the nation's life, other than the health of the family (which the data show also is tied powerfully to religious practice) should be of more concern to those who guide the future course of the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The original intent of the Founding Fathers was to bar the establishment by the federal government of a state-approved religion, not to bar religion from the operations of the state. Thomas Jefferson made this distinction very clear in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (January 16, 1786):
<p><blockquote>	
We, the General Assembly of Virginia do enact that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief: but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities.<sup>144</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;George Washington summed up the importance of religion to the new nation with particular eloquence in his farewell address:
<p><blockquote>
	Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness -- these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice?  And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;'Tis substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric?<sup>145</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A policy can be friendly to the general practice of religion, and to the many different faiths in a pluralistic society, without in any way implying the establishment of a particular religion. Federal policies encourage many other institutions: the marketplace, education, medicine, science, and the arts. Even religion itself is explicitly encouraged by the tax treatment of contributions to religious institutions. It makes no sense, therefore, not to encourage the resource that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation. Congress and the President can help to accomplish this by acting decisively in at least six specific areas:
<p><ul>
<li> Congress, and the Senate in particular, should lead a new national debate on the renewed role of religion in American life. With his recent guidance to school administrators on prayer in school, President Clinton has opened the national discussion. The Senate once was the chamber for debate on the great issues of the day. It is time for it to take up that role again on the relationship between the practice of religion and the life of the nation, on the health of America's families and the content of its culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America needs a major national debate on the true role of religion in a free and pluralistic society. For many decades, the once-prominent place of religion in society has been eroded. Religious leaders, who should be in the forefront of moral and spiritual renewal, have been cowed into a strange timidity. Americans of religious belief should not be bullied into believing that in all things related to the public good, religion is to remain off limits. The constitutional freedom of religion does not mean the constitutional barring of religion from the public square.
<p>
<li> Congress should pass a resolution affirming that data on religious practice are important to the nation, to policymakers, and to the research needed to inform the public debate. The gathering of data that touch on religious practice often is blocked in research on social issues funded by the federal government.<sup>146</sup>  Because government funds a huge proportion of the nation's funded social research, this has a chilling effect. But the relationship between religious practice and the social issues under investigation by government, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime and delinquency, addiction, economic dependency, medical and psychiatric problems, and learning capacity, should be explored. A sense-of-the-Congress resolution would remove the excuse that it is not permissible for federally funded research to touch on this aspect of life.
<p>
<li> Congress should mandate a census question on religious practice. The census for the year 2000 ought to ask about frequency of attendance at church or synagogue. It violates nobody's freedom of religion for Congress to know the level and intensity of religious worship in the United States. Also, many of the annual sample surveys conducted by the Bureau of the Census would be significantly better informed if similar information were gathered in those surveys.
<p>
<li> Congress should commission research on the relationship between regular church attendance and social issues. This research should focus on the social issues which continue to increase the burden borne by the American taxpayer, including crime, drug use, health of the elderly, out-of-wedlock births, and poverty.
<p>
<li> Congress should fund federal experiments with school choice that include choice of religiously affiliated schools. To deny financial support to parents who cannot afford to send their children to religiously oriented schools is to deny such education to those children who may need it most and confine it to those rich enough to afford it. The United States of America and the now-defunct Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are the only major modern states to deny funding to faith-based schools.
<p>
<li> The President should appoint, and the Senate should confirm, judges who are sensitive to the role of religion in public life. Religion should not be crowded out of every activity in which government is involved. And yet, this is precisely what has been happening for the last 30 years as government has encroached more and more on virtually every area of American life: family, school, and marketplace. This does not make sense for any society -- and it has weakened ours.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Columnist William Raspberry has put his finger on the problem. In his historic majority opinion in the 1947 <i>Everson v. Board of Education</i> case (330 U.S. 1), notes Raspberry, Justice Hugo Black wrote that government is forbidden to "pass laws which aid any religion, aid all religion, or prefer one religion over another." 
<p><blockquote>
	The first and third elements in the Black proscription seem to me to jibe with the "establishment" clause of the Constitution. The middle one suggests that the only proper position of government is hostility to religion -- which seems to be the prevailing view among civil libertarians and a majority of the Supreme Court.<sup>147</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This calls to mind the words of the late William O. Douglas, one of the most liberal of Supreme Court Justices, who wrote in the 1950s:
<p><blockquote>
	We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. We guarantee the freedom to worship as one chooses. [When] the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, [it] respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs. To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups. That would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.<sup>148</sup>
</blockquote><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate should ask all future candidates for federal court appointments to clarify their opinions regarding both the role of religion in the life of the body politic and their understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent on this issue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But this problem is far too important to be left to government. America's religious leaders and individual citizens also must act:
<p><ul>
<li> They must draw attention to the enormous and beneficial effects on society of the true practice of religion. As leaders of the nation's religious communities, they should assert their right to be regarded as critical in the nurturing of stable marriages and healthy families. Religion performs the foundational work that ensures the success of secular society's other four basic institutions: family, school, marketplace, and government.
<p>
<li> They must emphasize the need for religious formation. While the social works of mercy carried out by religious congregations will be needed more and more to repair the damage from the breakdown of the family, only a religious institution can give a religious orientation to those who are searching for answers to the mysteries of human life: love and suffering in birth, marriage, family life, and death. Religious beliefs help the individual acquire central organizing principles for life and an understanding of God. Aided by this sense and these principles, an individual can avoid the unnecessary suffering that stems from bad choices and attain the benefits that flow from good choices followed steadily through life. Today, schools are forbidden to participate in this critical work. Only religious leaders can provide this all-important service to society.
<p>
<li> They must take special care of the religious formation of children at risk of losing their faith in God, especially during the transition period from childhood to adolescence. The empirical research indicates that there is a critical stage in the development of young adults, from around ten years of age through later adolescence, during which they decide whether they will engage in the religious dialogue of searching for ultimate truths and meaning. The young adolescent who turns away from religion at this stage may well lose his anchoring in the community and is at greater risk for a host of problems that can subvert his personal happiness for a lifetime. Increased attention to this aspect of religious ministry will yield great benefits to the nation. Of particular concern to public policy leaders are the problems that plague America's inner cities: out-of-wedlock births, addiction, and crime. These neighborhoods need the benefits of religious belief and practice. They are "mission" territories that beckon loudly.
<p>
<li> They must use the ability of inner-city churches, especially black churches, to help low-income African-Americans escape from the degrading culture of inner-city poverty. Many religious leaders, with the best of intentions, have concentrated on the material aspects of their work, forgetting that the most powerful help they can give is in the spiritual dimension, and that this has a significant effect on material well-being. Regular church attendance will do more to help a child get out of poverty than anything else the religious leader can provide. And it will transform the community if most people can be persuaded to become church members.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The available evidence clearly demonstrates that regular religious practice is both an individual and social good. It is a powerful answer to many of our most significant social problems, some of which, including out-of-wedlock births, have reached catastrophic proportions. Furthermore, it is available to all, and at no cost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America is at a crossroads. Political leaders as diverse as President Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich all have articulated popular concerns and fears about the level of the breakdown of American society.<sup>149</sup>  Almost simultaneously, Americans are becoming aware of the fundamental contribution that married family life and regular religious practice can make to preserving that society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the sake of the nation's future health, it is time to redirect public policy so that these two vast resources, instead of being weakened further, can be rejuvenated and encouraged. Many of the goals of social policy and social work can be attained, indirectly and powerfully, through the practice of religion. None of this invalidates education or social work, which operate at a different level of the human condition. However, as demands for social work outstrip (and give every indication of far outstripping) social work resources, it is good to know that the practice of religion is a powerful ally.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The practice of religion is good for individuals, families, states, and the nation. It improves health, learning, economic well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy. It reduces the incidence of social pathologies, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime, delinquency, drug and alcohol addiction, health problems, anxieties, and prejudices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Founding Fathers, in their passionate love of freedom, promoted the freedom of all Americans to practice their religious beliefs, but Congress and the courts have crowded religion out of the public square. It is time to bring it back. Religious practice can and should be factored into the planning and debate on the nation's urgent social problems. Americans cannot build their future without drawing on the strengths that come to them from the practice of their religious beliefs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The widespread practice of religious beliefs can only benefit the nation, and the task of reintegrating religious practice into American life while protecting and respecting the rights of non-practice -- rights that, despite persistent demagoguery on the subject, remain totally unthreatened -- is one of the nation's most important tasks. Academics of good will can do much in this area, and history will look kindly on those who help America achieve this wonderful balance.

<li>    Given the significance of these findings, which are now over 10 years old, it is telling that no further research seems to have been conducted along these lines by the welfare interest group in academia. In the business field, there is considerable anecdotal literature of the testimonial genre which recounts the effect of religious belief or conversion on work capacity and outcomes; in the academic literature, however, there seems to be little or none.

<li>The benefit of the intrinsic practice of religion certainly be obvious to most ordinary Americans. But in research results, many of the deleterious effects of the extrinsic practice of religion wipe out many of the benefits of intrinsic practice when adherents of both are mixed together in the same piece of research. Most religious research to date does not measure or differentiate between intrinsic and extrinsic practice of religion. Despite this shortcoming, the studies cited up to now do not distinguish between these types of religious practice, yet show a very positive outcome. This poses a number of important research issues, chief among them whether this is because there are only a few extrinsics among those who go to church most frequently. For researchers and those who commission research, there is an obvious need to measure whether the person's practice of religion, when it is present, is more intrinsic or extrinsic. Fortunately, a simple validated scale has been developed to measure the person's religious motivation. See Dean R. Hoge, "A Validated Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale," <i>Journal for Scientific Study of Religion</i>, Vol. 11 (1972), pp. 369-376.
<li>    In the view of this author, that tension arises from the effort of the social sciences to contain religion within the canons of the social sciences. However the canons of religion transcend these canons, and therefore cannot be reduced to the dimensions of any of the social sciences, though every social science can describe some facets of religious behavior.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With frustrated Americans focusing their anger increasingly  on Washington
and gridlock, many political candidates in 1994  successfully ran against
Washington, appealing to voters to &quot;throw  the bums out&quot; and replace
them with individuals who are more  honest and more devoted to the public
welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One result has been that ideas such as devolution and  federalism, ignored
for decades, are back in the forefront of public  debate. Because Washington is
seen as cumbersome, rigid, and  distant from the people, this Congress has
attempted to give the states  and local governments more autonomy and
responsibility in areas  such as welfare. The assumption is that this will
result in greater  experimentation, increased efficiency, and government that
once again  is closer to the people.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Contract With America emphasized the need for  devolution and a shift of
selected responsibilities from Washington to  state and local governments.
However, although devolution in its  many forms may produce benefits in selected
programs, by itself it  will not address the root cause of the many problems
plaguing  American society. The reason: The source of the problem is not an 
inefficient distribution of functions between the different layers of  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  ernment, to be corrected by
reshuffling. Nor is it bad people  holding public office, or even poorly
designed programs. The  fundamental problem is systemic: The Constitutional
system  established by the Framers has been largely dismantled, releasing 
government, especially the national government, from virtually all  restraint.
Unconstrained government inevitably has swept aside civil  society, replacing it
with political decisionmaking and  bureaucratic administration unaccountable to
the public. Together, these  have created the conditions within which the
economic and social  problems now burdening society have arisen and flourished. 
Encroachment by Washington also has blocked state and local  governments, as
well as civil society, from initiating innovative responses  to those problems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This has resulted in four dilemmas, all of which require action:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> the central purpose of the Constitution  limiting the  power
of government  has been forgotten, and many of the  mechanisms for enforcing
those limits have been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> the states  the key element in the American  constitutional
system  have been stripped of the ability to carry out  their constitutional
responsibility of checking and balancing the  national government, and this has
allowed Washington to assume an  unlimited and unchallengeable role in the
economy, in society, and  in the lives of individuals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> the resulting centralization of power in Washington and  the
unchecked expansion of its reach have undermined the  institutions of civil
society and thereby severely weakened the ability of  the people to exercise
self-government. Washington has replaced  civil 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  society with bureaucratic
rulemaking and administration  from above, and<B> </B>has<B> </B>made
decisionmaking in all areas of public  and private life more responsive to
political factors  and<B> </B>ideologies than to empirical results and the
preferences of the citizenry. In  addition, centralization has insulated
decisionmaking from  participation by the very people most directly affected by
government  programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> the federal judiciary has permitted, even mandated,  an
open-ended expansion of power by the national government,  arrogating to itself
the role of legislature of last resort and imposing  a liberal agenda explicitly
and repeatedly rejected by the electorate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The national government's rise to dominance has taken  many years. Some
steps, such as the popular election of Senators,  occurred for entirely
democratic reasons and with full public  support; others, such as the weakening
of the criminal justice system,  were accomplished by sleight of hand and
against solid public  opposition. Taken together, they constitute a virtual
rewriting of the  Constitution, the impact of which has yet to be fully
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What the Framers Intended</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A fundamental assumption of the Framers of the Constitution  was that the
American people were and would continue to be  largely self-governing, running
their own affairs by means of the  network of social relationships and voluntary
organizations  collectively known as civil society, such as families,
communities,  and churches. Government, especially local government  controlled

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  directly by the community, was
seen as a necessary ally of  civil society. But it was restricted to those
limited functions which  civil society could not easily perform for itself, such
as defense,  the police, and the coining of money. The purpose of government 
was to secure an environment within which free people would  control their own
affairs: in other words, an environment that makes  possible the individual &quot;pursuit
of happiness.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In writing the Constitution, the Framers had two objectives:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  To correct the failings of the Articles of Confederation,  due
largely to the states' domination of a weak national  government.</B> Thus, a
new national government was created with sufficient  powers to carry out a
limited number of crucial functions, such as  the regulation of international
and interstate commerce, and to  prevent the states from interfering in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  To limit the power of the new national government.</B>  Having
fought a revolution against what they defined as tyranny   the unchecked
exercise of power, regardless of motive  their  second, and far more important,
objective was to prevent its  reemergence from their own handiwork. They
therefore spent the bulk of  their deliberations on devising ways to limit the
power of the  national government.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Trusting neither the written word of the Constitution nor  self-restraint on
the part of officeholders to enforce the necessary  limits, the Framers devised
a complex system of checks and balances  in which various political actors were
placed deliberately in  permanent opposition to one another. This tension was
intended to  ensure that the energies and ambitions of the respective  groups 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  would be directed against one
another, thereby protecting  civil society from unwanted interference. The best
known of these  safeguards  the division of the national government into three 
competing branches: executive, legislative, and judicial  has  proven both
effective and durable despite two centuries of change.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Central Role of Federalism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even more essential to the intent of the Constitution were the  several
checks and balances between the national government and  the states, and the
division of power between them, a wholly new  system which came to be called
federalism. Despite the crucial  role assigned to it, however, federalism
remains widely misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federalism is commonly defined as the division of powers  among the federal,
state, and local governments according to which  performs them best. For
example, the national government has  general responsibility for defense; the
states, for most prisons  and roads; and local governments, for schools. Certain
powers, such  as taxation and the regulation of commerce, are shared. Advocates 
of federalism often assert that this division of powers is more  efficient than
centralizing all functions in Washington, and that  innovative approaches to
problems are more likely to emerge from  the experiments of 50 state governments
than from a monolithic  national bureaucracy. In addition, proponents generally 
emphasize the need to keep government as close to the people as possible  by
keeping its functions at the lowest possible level.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, all of these arguments in favor of federalism are  subsidiary to
its central purpose: limiting the power of government at  all levels. The
national and state governments were intended to  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  strain one another, not to work
hand-in-glove or parcel out  functions to that level of government which will
perform them  best. Thus, the new government was given the power to prevent  the
states from abusing their authority through such actions as  erecting trade
barriers against one another, and national legislation  was given preeminence
over state and local law in those limited  areas reserved to the national
government. In turn, the states were  expected to constrain Washington, as they
were regarded as the  only effective means of doing so.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>So crucial was the role of the states in limiting the  national government's
power that the Framers provided them with  several safeguards, including:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     A direct role</B> in the making of all laws and the
appointment of  all federal officials, including federal judges, through a
Senate  composed of members appointed by the states;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The ability to block</B> all constitutional amendments proposed 
by Congress and to bypass an out-of-touch national government  altogether by
means of a constitutional convention; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     A written guarantee</B> against Washington's assumption of 
additional powers in the form of the blunt and sweeping language  of the Tenth
Amendment, which reserved all powers not delegated  to the national government
by the Constitution either to the states  or to the people.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How the Safeguards Were Dismantled</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This carefully constructed system remained largely intact for  over 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  100 years; but beginning in the
early part of this century, the  ability of the states to perform their
constitutional role of limiting  the national government has been progressively
reduced to the  point that it has been virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The process was a lengthy and complex one, but its principal  landmarks
were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     The ratification in 1913 of the 16th and 17th
Amendments,</B>  which removed key restraints on the national government by
giving  it unlimited taxing authority and by mandating that Senators were  to be
elected by popular vote rather than selected by state  legislatures. As a
result, Washington secured the resources necessary  for an open-ended expansion
of its functions even as the states  were removed from the making of national
policy and eliminated as  the principal bulwark against expansion by the
national government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The national emergencies of the Depression, World War II,  and the
Cold War,</B> which legitimized political forces arguing  for greater power at
the national level to deal with domestic and  international problems. The powers

after their  original justification has passed. In fact, many of the emergency 
powers of the 1930s were vastly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s in  such
programs as the Great Society and the War on Poverty, each  of which further
increased Washington's power by giving it an  activist leading role in areas of

<P>Calculating the economic costs stemming from the demise of  federalism and
the expansion of the national government is  difficult, if only because of the
enormity of the task. These costs  include reduced economic growth for the
nation as a whole through  heavy taxation, burdensome regulation of businesses,
and the  skewed investment of resources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     As programs have expanded to cover all areas of
national life,  the federal budget has grown commensurately, both in terms of 
taxpayer dollars and as a percentage of the national economy.  In 1934, the
national government accounted for 10 percent of  gross domestic product (GDP).
In 1948, it was still only 12 percent.  By 1960, however, it had ballooned to 18
percent, and by 1994, to  22 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The tax burden also has necessarily expanded. In 1914, the 
first year of the federal income tax, Americans making from $4,000  to $20,000
were taxed 1 percent of their incomes. The rate  gradually increased to 7
percent for Americans making over $500,000.  Because those making over $4,000 in
1914 accounted for less than  1 percent of the population, the average family
paid no income  tax. Even by 1950, following the expansion of the national 
government during and after the New Deal, the average American family  with two
children paid only 3 percent of its income to the federal  government. In 1994,
federal taxes accounted for 24 percent of a  typical family's income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Though taxation has increased dramatically since World War 
II, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  spending has grown even faster. A
1991 study prepared for  the Joint Economic Committee found that for every $1
increase  in taxes since the end of World War II, expenditures have  grown
$1.59. The national debt now stands at $4.9 trillion,  representing more than
$18,500 for every man, woman, and child in the  country  an obligation that will
be paid by every individual and  family through higher taxes and lower living
standards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Roughly one-third of the average family's income tax today  is
used merely to pay interest on the national debt, a significant  reduction in
standard of living for which that family receives no  benefits. Much of this
debt and tax burden is used to subsidize  special interests with political clout
in Washington, from millionaire  peanut farmers to the affluent elderly.

 budgets every year, making the perennial accumulation of debt  difficult if not
impossible. Although all opinion polls show that there  is overwhelming public
support for a balanced budget amendment  to the Constitution, every attempt to
have Congress pass the  measure has failed. Powerful special interests lobby
behind closed  doors against any proposal which would force Washington to cut 
spending, and the government continues to borrow money and  obligate future

the states billions each year. The cost of incarcerating prisoners is

<P><B>II. The High Cost to Democracy</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More difficult to calculate, but nevertheless far-reaching, are  the high
costs to democracy that stem from the demise of  federalism. An oft-repeated
description of the American system of  government is that it is a &quot;government
of laws, not of men,&quot; meaning that  the rules which govern society are
openly formulated, apply equally  to all, and are reliably stable over time.
Laws are made by  citizens and their elected representatives; they are not
supposed to be  subject to the whims of individuals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, this characterization is no longer accurate. Even as  federal power
over the economy, society, and all facets of  public policy has grown, the
concentration of decisionmaking in  Washington has radically reduced the ability
of the public to affect  it. Whereas the American people once were described
routinely  as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  self-governing and self-reliant,
it is now virtually impossible  for individuals or communities to influence the
decisions which  directly affect them. Distant rule-making bureaucracies are 
immune from local pressure; Congress is overrun with powerful and  well-heeled
interest groups; and enormous coalitions of citizens  are required to get even
rudimentary attention from Washington.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As local and state governments have been reduced increasingly  to the role
of implementing federal decisions, elections for them  have lost most of their
importance. Regardless of who holds office,  and regardless of the electorate's
intentions when electing these  officials, Washington need pay attention to none
of them as it  imposes programs on state and local governments. Governor Ben 
Nelson (D-NE) has said that he often feels he is merely an  administrator for
the federal government, and Governor Michael Leavitt  (R-UT) has noted that his
constituents, when referring to government,  now think almost exclusively in
terms of Washington, not state or  local government. National elections, in
turn, are not about  individual issues, but about large combinations of them,
with the  individual voter unable to register his preferences. And each voter's 
choice must compete with those of 100 million others. With their  votes meaning
so little in terms of how decisions are made, it is not  surprising that the
percentage of the electorate which goes to the  polls has declined steadily over
decades.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the power of citizens has declined, however, that of  certain individuals
has grown. Committee chairmen in the House and  Senate, unelected staff, obscure
bureaucrats, and federal judges  wield vast powers which are often exercised out
of the public's  eye. Hundreds of bills with thousands of prescriptions,
allotments,  and prohibitions are passed each year, often with Members of  Con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  gress having only the haziest of
ideas about their content. An  endless stream of special interests brings
enormous financial and  organizational capacities to bear on Congress and the
executive  branch  often to secure enactment of agendas these interests know 
the public would not support if given the opportunity to decide  for themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Untethered Judiciary</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even if elected officials could be made more responsive to  the public's
preferences, however, they would remain subject to  the unelected judges of the
federal courts. The Supreme Court and  the federal judiciary as a whole have
arrogated to themselves a  dominant role in every public and private institution
in society.  Federal judges have taken charge of wide areas of state and local 
jurisdiction and imposed on them their own dictates, from which there  is little
appeal. Individual judges overturn and rewrite laws,  suspend whole sections of
state constitutions, impose detailed  mandates, order actions by officials at
all levels, and even mandate the  imposition of taxes on populations which
refuse to vote for them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No area of American life can escape detailed examination and  reconstruction
by the Supreme Court. Members of the Court  are bound by little but their own
self-restraint. Cynics often say  that the Constitution is whatever the Supreme
Court says it is. In  fact, no less an authority than Chief Justice Charles
Evans  Hughes stated in a 1907 speech: &quot;We are under a Constitution, but 
the Constitution is what the judges say it is.&quot;  But the reality is  even
worse: It is whatever any five of the Court's nine justices say it  is. A 5 to 4
decision one day can be abruptly reversed the next;  what was once legal may
become illegal, and vice versa;  wrenching 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  changes can be produced by the
replacement of a single  individual on the Court, or even by a change of opinion
by any one of  the justices, regardless of the language of the Constitution or
the  preferences of the public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Long-established rights may be cast aside, while newly  mined ones are put
in their place. No law, constitutional provision,  popular referendum, community
standard, or tradition, regardless of  its support among the people or their
elected officials, has any  meaning or standing other than that which the
federal courts choose  to give it. All may be set aside, and the public has no
recourse. It  is for this reason that the once-routine confirmations of  Supreme
Court justices have become brutal political contests.

<P><B>III. The High Costs to Civil Society</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of all the costs produced by the demise of federalism, the  greatest have
been those associated with the breakdown of civil society:  the individuals,
families, communities, and voluntary  organizations and institutions which
together enable individuals to control  the environment in which they, their
families, and their  communities live and operate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the Framers, the purpose of government was to establish  and secure the
general environment within which civil society  could operate essentially
unmolested. Within this environment, the  array of social institutions would
regulate the public aspects of the  community and intrude in the lives of
individuals and families as  little as possible. Government, especially local
government  controlled by the adult citizenry, was essential to maintaining this
order,  but only if its power was limited to narrow purposes. It was well 
understood that the more distant the government, the less control  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  citizens would have over its
actions, and thus the more damage  it could do.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Once the national government had freed itself from its  constitutional
restraints, however, its rapid expansion inevitably  undermined civil society,
because the purpose of expanded  government is to substitute itself for civil
society. The national government,  in centralizing power, inevitably has taken
control away from  citizens and communities and replaced it with  political
decisionmaking and bureaucratic administration. It also has  forcibly replaced
civil society's home-grown workings with its  own political and bureaucratic
vision of how society should be  structured and run, and with devastating costs.
Unconstrained  government and civil society cannot coexist; their respective 
resources are too unequal to permit competition. When government  expands,
society must retreat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The result has been a broad decline in civilized life, especially  in the
nation's cities where government activism has been  greatest. Among the results:
vastly increased crime and violence, a  breakdown of public order, a decline in
community life, erosion of  the family, the rise of illegitimacy, and the
pervasive mediocrity  of public education, among other ills.
</P>
<P>

<P>Social scientists profess bafflement at the emergence and  continuation of
these developments. Among the most common  explanations: America is an
inherently violent society, there has been  a &quot;war on the poor&quot;
stemming from hard-hearted budget cutters,  or endemic racism prevents progress.
The true source, however,  can be located directly in the engineered demise of
civil society and  its replacement by the federal government. Individuals,
families,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  communities have been stripped of
the ability to control  either their environment or the behavior of individuals
within it.

<P><B>The Rise in Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The rate of violent crime in the U.S. has risen dramatically   over 400
percent since the late 1950s. Some of this is attributable to  the increase in
the population aged 15-30, the age group  responsible for the vast majority of
felonies. But if demographics were the  sole factor, the rate should have
plummeted in the 1980s along  with this segment's share of the population. It
did not, and other  countries with similar demographics did not experience the
same rise  in crime. Liberals claim the reason is widespread availability of 
guns in the United States, but gun ownership has been common in  the United
States since the country's inception. Moreover, other  societies, such as
peaceable Switzerland, that actually require all  able-bodied men to maintain
guns in their homes experience no  upsurge in drive-by shootings. Why, then, the
vast and rapid increase in  the rate of violent crime in the U.S. and its
continuance at such  high levels?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two reasons. One is the breakdown in family structure  in America 
itself exacerbated by federal policies (see Chapter  6). The other is the
Supreme Court's radical reconstruction of  the criminal justice system in the
U.S., an all-embracing  exercise weighted consistently toward restricting the
policing power  of communities. Beginning in the 1960s, federal courts began 
viewing law enforcement, rather than criminals, as the principal  threat to
public safety and set out to restrict the power of police to  arrest criminals,
the ability of the judicial system to convict them,  and the right of society to
put and keep them behind bars. The  courts 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  vastly expanded, and even
invented, rights for criminals which,  if not actually written in the
Constitution, were held by the courts  to be &quot;inspired&quot; by its &quot;penumbras.&quot;
 However lofty this  solicitude for the rights of criminals may be, its
real-world impact has  been to create an America much more dangerous and violent
for  law-abiding citizens.<A HREF="ftnt14.htm#12">12</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To curb alleged coercion of defendants, the Supreme Court  has virtually
eliminated the ability of state and federal prosecutors  to use confessions by
the accused as evidence. In the mid-1960s,  with the Court's imposition of
arbitrarily detailed procedures for  arrest and investigation, the rate of
solved crimes plummeted  virtually overnight from the level of 70 percent in the
1950s to 40  percent, and hundreds of thousands of felons were never prosecuted 
even though ample evidence was available. In addition, severe  restrictions have
been placed on the collection of evidence; trials  increasingly focus not on the
defendant's innocence or guilt, but  on whether the police have adhered
sufficiently to procedural  minutiae.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The famous warnings to suspects of their rights
grew out of a  Supreme Court case in 1966. Although Ernesto Miranda had 
confessed to the brutal rape of a woman in Arizona with &quot;full  knowledge of

me,&quot; the Supreme Court ruled that the  police had failed to tell him he
could call a lawyer and ordered his  release from prison. Justice Thurgood

serious criminal cases are dropped every year because  exclusionary rule
restrictions eliminate the evidence needed for prosecution.  By 1992, an
independent report concluded that the number had  grown to 120,000, including
30,000 violent crimes and 90,000  serious property crimes. This figure does not
include either the tens  of thousands of crimes that could have been prevented
or the  cases that never came to trial because police are effectively 
prohibited from gathering evidence and questioning suspects regarding  these
crimes.<A HREF="ftnt14.htm#15">15</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The results of these and many other innovations have been  nothing short of
disastrous: the release of criminals, plea-bargaining  down to less serious

crimes of all types has been  reduced, so has the value of punishment as a
deterrent.

<P>The death penalty was abolished by the Supreme Court in  1972, despite
widespread public support. Although partially reinstated  in 1976, it remains
exceedingly difficult to use, even when  requested by the convict himself.

William Brennan stated  that he believed it to be unconstitutional and
prohibited &quot;under all  circumstances.&quot;<A

<P>The federal bench also has intervened to change the way  states deal with
felons convicted of crimes and sentenced to  prison terms. In state after state,
entire prison systems have been  taken over by the federal courts. Ostensibly to
eliminate  &quot;overcrowding,&quot; tens of thousands of prisoners have been
released onto  the streets. But &quot;overcrowding&quot; has never been
consistently  defined, so each judge is free to define it for himself on an
entirely  subjective basis. To several judges, therefore, it means not groups 
of prisoners crammed into single cells, but simply more than  one prisoner to a
cell, however large. Some federal judges even  refuse to allow convicted felons
to be sent to prison in the first place  because of &quot;overcrowding&quot; and
simply release them, even those  convicted of violent crimes and repeat
offenders. These released  felons have been responsible for tens of thousands of
additional  violent crimes.

<P><B>The Obsession with Prisoners' Rights </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal courts have demonstrated an amazing solicitude  for the small
minority of felons who actually reach prison, being  especially attentive to
suits claiming violations of the  Eighth Amendment's prohibition of &quot;cruel
and unusual punishment.&quot;   To help prisoners develop and file these claims,
the federal  courts have ruled that prisoners must be provided with 
state-of-the-art law libraries in their prisons, and even with law clerks. 
Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods has said that the law libraries  in state
prisons are equipped with better services and resources  than those in his own
office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As a result, the number of suits by prisoners claiming violations  of
constitutional rights has exploded in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1966, prisoners brought 218 suits in federal court for  alleged
constitutional violations in state and federal prisons. In 1993,  prisoners
filed over 53,000 suits, primarily against state prisons,  representing 25
percent of all cases handled in federal courts and  7,000 more suits than the
federal government itself filed against  criminals. Most of this litigation is
frivolous  inmates have sued,  for example, because they were given creamy
instead of chunky  peanut butter, were denied breast implants at public expense,
or  did not like the color of their cells  and ultimately are dismissed  by the
courts. But the cost to the taxpayers is still heavy, as the  state must treat
each case seriously lest it be lost by default.  Generally, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  prisoners pay no fees, claiming
indigent status.

<P>Keith Poladian, an inmate in New York's Auburn state  prison, brought suit
on Eighth Amendment grounds against the state's  use of razor wire on fences
used to contain prisoners, citing  possible injury to potential escapees. Of the

gives us a way to  be heard.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt14.htm#19">19</A>

<P>
</P>
<P>It is little wonder that most criminals show a psychology of  denial for
their criminal actions. Nevada Deputy Attorney General  Anne Cathcart says
criminals &quot;come into prison denying any  wrongdoing, and they are
constantly presented with further reasons  to blame others. Unlimited access to
federal courts gives them  an added tool to vent their anger and rebel against
the system.&quot;   But that is only one element. The total effect of the
federal courts  on the criminal justice system has been staggering. Thanks to a 
succession of messages to the potential felon  you won't be  arrested, you won't
be convicted, your sentence will be cut short,  prison isn't really so bad, and
your rights in prison are superior to  those of the administration, for example 
deterrence has been all  but destroyed. Even violent felons remain on the
streets, free to  commit crimes. Far from having a mysterious source, the 
enormous upsurge in crime was all but inevitable.

<P>The streets of the nation's cities have become a permanent  home for tens of
thousands of individuals collectively labeled  &quot;the homeless.&quot;  But
this alleged lack of shelter is due not to the  hard-heartedness of budget
cutters, but to the fact that up to  three-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  fourths of America's homeless are
mentally ill or  drug-dependent and unable to care for themselves. The advent of
drugs in  the 1950s and 1960s led to the widespread closing of institutions 
that cared for the mentally ill on the assumption that drug therapy  had
eliminated most of the need for institutionalization. At the  same time, in
addition to destroying viable communities, federal  urban renewal projects
eliminated much of the housing space available  to the very poor. Much of this
lost housing has been replaced by  shelters and other facilities, but many of
these people refuse to live  in shelters, citing endemic violence, drug use, and
corruption,  and many more individuals are clearly incapable of making  rational
choices for themselves. Community efforts to bring the  homeless into shelters
have been blocked by the federal courts because  of alleged violations of civil
rights; freedom of assembly is  claimed by those permanently squatting in public

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has a mixed record, at best, in the  area of
reducing the power of the federal government and  devolving power back to the
states. Clinton has assisted states in  accelerating the waiver process whereby
state welfare and health care  agencies can receive exemptions from a host of
federal requirements as  they attempt novel approaches to welfare and health
care reforms.  Unfortunately, most governors are still frustrated at the slow 
granting of waivers by the Administration and many believe the entire  process
is flawed in that they are seeking exemptions from  federal 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  laws they believe to be an
encroachment on state prerogatives.  For instance, the Clinton Administration's
proposal in 1994 to  revamp the nation's health care system envisioned a
diminishing role  for the states, which would merely administer a national
system  created and directed from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In areas such as environmental protection and federal  land-use policy, the
Clinton Administration has continued to support  a growing federal role and has
resisted attempts by the states to  devolve powers back to them. For instance,
this is most  evident among Western states, where Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt  has been promoting an overarching policy of environmental  protection
that dramatically increases the power of the federal government  in land-use
policy in federal, state-owned, and private lands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To the extent the Administration has even focused on federalism  it has
missed the true meaning of the word. For instance, Vice  President Al Gore's
calls for a &quot;New Federalism&quot;are embodied in  his efforts to streamline
and reinvent the federal government  through its National Performance Review.
Regardless of the merits of  the National Performance Review  which attempts to
make the  federal government more efficient through downsizing and 
restructuring  it has had little if anything to do with reestablishing a 
balance between the state and federal governments.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress has taken important first steps in the areas  of
devolution, federalism, and the restoration of constitutional  government. Under
the Contract With America, it passed  legislation that turns over most
responsibility for welfare to the states  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  allows them more flexibility and
authority in the administration  of welfare programs. Even more important, it
has put the country  on course for a balanced budget in seven years. While not
strictly  an issue of federalism, bringing spending under control is a 
prerequisite both for reimposing limits on government's ambitions and  for
rebuilding civil society. The federal government also has agreed  to reimburse
the states for part of the education, health care,  and other costs associated
with the incarceration of illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, a number of pending bills and resolutions are  designed to make
the federal government more responsive to its  constitutional limits. These
include requiring Congress to cite its  constitutional authority for each piece
of legislation, restricting the  ability of the federal judiciary to take over
state administrative  functions, and eliminating agencies of the federal
government which  exercise &quot;powers not delegated to the United States by
the  Constitution,&quot; among other proposals.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Correcting the many problems confronting American society  will involve more
than isolated reforms; a lasting solution will  require dealing with their root
causes, especially the federal  government's crushing impact on civil society.
This means more than  merely resurrecting the past. Too much has changed to
permit a  simple repeal of the many constitutional innovations of the preceding 
decades, and powerful and well-entrenched groups with  economic, political, and
ideological interests at stake are certain to resist  any change which
diminishes the power of Washington to reward  them from the public treasury and
impose their agendas on the rest  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  the country. Instead, new
approaches must be developed that  draw on the lessons learned in this century
about Washington's ability  to free itself, Houdini-like, from almost any
constraint.
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Devolve power to the states by returning taxes, not
just programs.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Contract With America has taken the essential first step  in reversing
the trend toward centralization of power in  Washington by curtailing some
entitlements and allowing states greater  discretion over welfare and other
programs, but several additional  measures are needed to ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current plans, the principal funding for programs  devolved to the
states will continue to be through block grants from  Washington. Although the
states gain flexibility, this formula  undermines accountability because the
federal government collects  the money but state and local governments spend it.
As a result,  the public is less able to connect the collection of taxes with
the  provision of services, and neither level of government has  sufficient
incentive to ensure that the money is spent wisely and frugally.  A far better
approach would be for Washington to bow out of  the picture entirely and return
the money to the people in the form of  a tax cut. The states could collect the
taxes themselves   and thereby assure a direct connection between taxes and
services   or allow individuals to retain the money for their own use. If this 
is not done, the likely consequence is that rising budgetary  pressures will
lead Washington simply to maintain current federal  requirements on the states
to deliver services while cutting back on  the federal grants to fund them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal argument for continuing a federal role in these  programs is
that it assures equality of treatment for recipients,  regard
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  less of whether they live in
high-income or low-income  states. This argument is based on a misunderstanding
of the actual  impact of federal spending. Federal funding for individual
programs  often does vary widely from state to state, but those variations 
largely disappear when a broader range of programs is considered.  For example,
if responsibility for the more than 70 programs that  comprise federal welfare
spending was turned over to the states  along with a broad reduction in the
federal income tax, only a few  states would be adversely affected, and none by
more than 5 percent  of current revenue. And this does not take into account
money  that states could save by providing services more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is also important for candidates to stress that devolution is  not
necessarily federalism. While state-friendly legislation passed  by Congress is
a marked improvement over past practice, the  current debate and decisionmaking
on devolution have been  conducted almost entirely from Washington's point of
view. The programs  to be transferred will continue to be subject to conditions
imposed  by the federal government, which can change them unilaterally at  its
discretion to suit its own needs. And Washington will retain  the ability to
reverse or modify its grant at any time. Devolution  is evidence not that
Washington has been restrained, but merely  that it has changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Hold a constitutional convention on federalism.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Calling a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution  is the route
most favored by those who seek a quick and  comprehensive solution to the
problem of Washington's overreaching.  Two-thirds of the state legislatures may
call a constitutional  convention by petitioning Congress to do so, a provision
the Framers  included 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  both to deny Congress a monopoly
on proposing amendments  and to prevent it from insulating itself from the
public will.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the two centuries since the Constitution's adoption, there  have been
several efforts to call a convention. The most notable  attempts in recent
decades include an effort in the 1960s to  overturn the Supreme Court's revision
of state constitutions regarding  the structure of state legislatures and
several efforts concerning a  balanced budget amendment, the most successful of
which reached  32 states by 1983.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal reason these and other efforts have not succeeded  is fear
that a &quot;runaway&quot; convention might lead to an extensive  rewriting of
the Constitution. But opponents generally do not  take into account the fact
that any amendment proposed by a  convention is exactly that: merely a proposal.
To become part of the  Constitution, it must be ratified by the same
three-fourths of the  state legislatures required for the approval of any
amendment put  forth by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents also ignore the fact that, in effect, two permanent 
constitutional conventions already exist: Congress, which can  propose an
amendment on any subject at any time, and the Supreme  Court. Although the Court
technically has no role in the amending  process, its rulings repeatedly have
had the same effect, adding  and deleting sections as the justices see fit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opposing a convention called by the states merely ensures  that Congress and
the Supreme Court  and thus Washington   retain their monopoly on changing the
Constitution while denying  the states and citizens any real opportunity to
participate. This  position 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  is understandable in those who
wish to keep power centralized  in Washington but somewhat perplexing when held
by  conservatives and others who profess a desire to restrict the federal 
government. Given the opposition, however, calls for a constitutional 
convention are not likely to be successful without considerable  public
education.

<P>
</P>
<P>Efforts to revive the Tenth Amendment occupy a special place  in the
movement to restore federalism. The Tenth Amendment is  the &quot;federalism
amendment,&quot; a written contractual guarantee  against the expansion of
federal power. It has not performed as  intended because the political and other
mechanisms designed to make  it effective have been removed and because the
Supreme Court  has been allowed to render it null and void.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Indications that the Supreme Court may revive the Amendment,  at least in a
limited fashion, are easily exaggerated. In a  recent case,<A
HREF="ftnt14.htm#22">22</A> the Supreme Court made headlines
by ruling that the  states cannot always be used as simple administrative arms
of the  federal government. This was the first time in six decades that the 
Tenth Amendment had been used to restrict federal power, but even  this
vestigial application was decided by a very narrow majority (5  to 4) and can be
reversed at any time.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A grass-roots movement to revive the Tenth Amendment has  been gathering
strength. Several state legislatures have passed  resolutions stating their view
that the Amendment remains fully in  effect, with several going further to
demand that the federal  govern
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  ment abide by its provisions.
However, this has occurred in  a largely uncoordinated and low-key manner, and
little  political pressure has been brought to bear on Washington.

<P>
</P>
<P>Though Congress has been an egregious violator of federalism,  it also has
the power to reverse its own excesses and curb those  of the executive and
judicial branches as well. The most  prominent effort in this regard is the
Contract With America's commitment  to returning to the states many functions
now performed by the  federal government, such as the primary responsibility for
 welfare. Efforts in other, more specific areas need to be made as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unwilling to part with its own money, Congress often has  resorted to
requiring state and local governments to pay for programs  that Washington
enacts and for which it takes the credit. Faced with  a growing revolt in the
states because of the unsustainable  burden these mandates impose on state
budgets, Congress in 1994  passed the Unfunded Mandates Act, advertised as
largely solving  the problem. However, the scope of the Act is very limited, 
covering only new mandates while leaving the truly burdensome  existing ones in
place. More important, the legislation puts no real  restraints on Congress at
all, as it requires Congress merely to  label an unfunded mandate as such before
enactment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As pressures on the federal budget increase, Congress may  be tempted to use
unfunded mandates to transfer responsibilities  for certain programs to the
states while keeping all or most of  the funding in Washington to balance the

Constitution; and prohibiting courts  from ordering the imposition of taxes.

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Propose constitutional amendments through Congress.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since it is unlikely that a constitutional convention will be  called within
the next few years, Members of Congress should  propose several amendments that
can be presented to the states for  debate and ratification. The following are
among the measures needed  to restore a balance between the state and federal
governments:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     A balanced budget amendment.</B> The last proposal
for a  balanced budget amendment passed the House but failed by one vote  to
achieve the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate. Passage  of such an
amendment must remain one of the highest priorities  for the 104th Congress or
its successors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     A &quot;states' veto&quot; amendment.</B> There are several
versions of  amendments which would allow a majority of the state legislatures 
to veto or recommit federal legislation. Governor George Allen  (R-VA) has
proposed a measure that gives that power to a simple  majority of the state
legislatures; other versions would require  a supermajority or merely request
that Congress reconsider the  subject legislation or regulation. Restoring to
states the ability  to block the most objectionable national legislation would
help  reduce some of the blatant disregard for state and local interests  that
has characterized Washington for so long.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     An amendment to allow states to propose amendments.</B> Under  the
amending formulas of Article V, the states may not propose  constitutional
amendments except by calling a constitutional  convention. Since there are a
host of perceived and real dangers in calling  such a convention, this route has
proven unusable, and Congress  retains 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  its monopoly on proposing
amendments to the Constitution.  However, amending Article V to allow the states
to propose  amendments without calling a convention, but subject to a 
congressional veto on such amendments, could overcome this obstacle.  Amendments
approved by Congress would be reintroduced in the  states for the three-fourths
approval needed to adopt an amendment  to the Constitution.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Support collective state action.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal factor in the demise of federalism and the growth  of
government in Washington is the undermining of the states'  ability to act as a
counterweight to the national government. The  states have been reduced to
subservience for so long that most have  lost the incentive to challenge
Washington and concentrate instead  on lobbying for better treatment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal problem confronting the states is fragmentation: 
Individually, states cannot have much influence in Washington;  only by
combining their efforts can they bring to bear the political  pressure needed to
deal with Washington as equals.  Unfortunately, however, the existing
organizations that serve state officials,  such as the National Governors'
Association (NGA), have not  succeeded in promoting an independent and effective
voice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A number of efforts in this area have been made in recent  years, the most
notable being the Conference of the States. Initiated  by Governors Mike Leavitt
(R-UT) and Ben Nelson (D-NE) in  1994 and joined by the NGA and other
organizations, along with  scores of state officials, the COS was designed to
create a process  by which the states could meet, discuss their common problems 
and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  recommended solutions, and bring
their collective influence  to bear on Washington.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For many reasons, the COS was not able to achieve the goals  it laid out for
itself, but some similar effort would prove to be  invaluable to the states in
their dealings with Washington.  Among the possible steps:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Suits against the federal government.</B> Several
states have  initiated or are contemplating suits against the federal government
 for abuse of its authority, especially on Tenth Amendment  grounds. Arizona
leads this effort; the legislature voted in 1994 to  establish a Constitutional
Defense Council and appropriated $1 million  for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Mandates recall.</B> Beginning with Alabama in 1992, a number  of
state legislatures have established annual meetings between  themselves and
members of their congressional delegations to  review the latter's votes on
unfunded federal mandates. Although  the states cannot compel attendance or
attentiveness, there is a  certain political cost for those who simply ignore
such requests, and  the meetings do provide a way for both sides to air their 
respective concerns.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Far more should be done to reconnect the state legislatures to  the making
of national policy. It once was common for state  legislatures to instruct their
representatives in Washington on how to  vote on particular issues, even if the
latter chose to ignore them.  On issues which affect a state, its legislature
certainly has at least  as much claim to represent the interests of the people
as does  any federal representative, and it should not hesitate to make its 
views 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  known.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Term limits.</B> An additional area for emphasis is imposing  term
limits on federal officials, the theory being that a guaranteed  turnover will
reduce the opportunities for elected officials to  insulate themselves from the
voters and guarantee a continuing infusion  of individuals who are closer to the
people. Term limits by  themselves, however, will neither constrain Washington's
power  nor erect a permanent barrier to activism, even on the part of 
short-termers. More important, the Supreme Court has ruled that  the people have
no right to impose term limits on federal officials,  and proponents are now
seeking other ways  including a  constitutional amendment  to advance this
objective.(See table below)

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q.What is the difference between devolution and federalism  and can they
contradict one another?  
</B></P>
<P><B>A.</B> Devolution legislation in Congress has dealt primarily  with
granting greater flexibility and decision-making authority to  state and local
governments in specific programs such as welfare.  Federalism, in contrast, is
concerned with the structure of  government as a whole and deals with the proper
balance that should exist  between the state governments and the national
government as  outlined in the U.S. Constitution. Current efforts to devolve 
selected powers from Washington to the states, however beneficial,  will have
only a small impact on the balance of power between  the federal and state
governments; Washington's primacy will  remain largely unaltered. For example,
the debate and  decision-making regarding devolution have been almost entirely
the product of  the Congress; state and local officials have played only 
secondary roles. As a result, the design and extent of the affected  programs
reflect Washington's preferences far more than those of the  states, and even
the devolved responsibilities remain subject to  unilateral revision by the
federal government. Devolution concerns the  reapportioning between the federal
and state governments of the  responsibility for current programs; federalism
addresses the  means by which Washington and the states can be made to limit 
each other's power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are there issues too important to entrust to state governments?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The domination of the national government by the states  under
the Articles of Confederation produced such chaos that the  Framers of the
Constitution sought to permanently redress the  balance. As a result, the
Constitution lists several powers reserved to  the national government and makes
its laws superior to those of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  states in these areas. That grant
of power, however, is strictly  limited. The Constitution specifies procedures
for amending the  document to alter that list should a sufficient majority of
the  country desire it, but it does not sanction federal action simply because 
it may be efficient or expedient. Under the system established by  the Founders,
state governments and the national government were  to have distinct and limited
powers in order to serve as a check  on one another.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The presumption throughout much of this century, however,  has been that the
national government is progressive and the  states regressive, and therefore
that progress requires a centralization  of power in Washington. Once achieved,
however, the result has  been not only to shift most decision-making to the
federal  government, but to make possible the vast expansion of government 
throughout every area of society, with decidedly negative results.  Whatever the
past failings of the states, they pale in comparison with  those of the federal
government. Federalism is not based on the  assumption that one level of
government is necessarily better than  another; instead, it holds that limited,
constitutional government  is the goal and that the different levels are needed
to restrain  one another.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Q. If states assume more power under a reinvigorated  federalism, how will
civil rights be protected?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A. A reinvigorated federalism would not reduce the power of  the federal
government to protect the civil rights guaranteed by  the Constitution. The Bill
of Rights, and especially the Fourteenth  and Fifteenth Amendments, provide the
federal government with  sufficient powers to enforce the civil rights of all
Americans. In  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  past, the political will to
exercise these powers was often  lacking, a failing which has been more than
made up for over the past  four decades. Nevertheless, advocates of an activist
federal  judiciary often cite the need for an unelected protector of civil
rights  to guard minorities against the inevitable abuses of the  majority.
However, the contempt for the citizenry this attitude is based on  is wholly
contradictory to the theory of the American  government &quot;which rests on the
consent of the governed.&quot;  The  assumption must be that the majority wants
the rights of minorities (of  which everyone is a member of at least one) to be
fully guaranteed,  and for this reason has brought into being a Constitution
which has  that objective as one its principal goals. To assume that the purpose
 of government is to override and suppress the desires of a  thuggish and
intolerant majority is to believe that self-government is  an impossibility.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Q. Isn't the U.S. economy becoming so sophisticated that a  national
economic and regulatory regime is needed to maintain  competition in the global
economy? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A. Taken to its logical conclusion, this approach would argue  for the
superiority of international regulation over national  regulation. However, one
of the most important phenomena of the last  quarter of the 20th century is the
widespread realization that the costs  of governmental control over the economy
greatly exceed its  benefits. Communist economies have collapsed; socialist and 
heavily regulated economies have stagnated; and free-market  economies
increasingly have demonstrated the benefits of reducing the role  of the state
through such measures as privatization and the  lowering of trade barriers.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To this has been added the new pressures and opportunities of  the emerging
global economy, which is rapidly undermining the  idea of separate national
economies. This new economy places an  emphasis on flexibility and the ability
to adapt quickly to  changing economic and commercial realities. Slumbering
central  governments are proving to be grossly inadequate to such a challenge. 
A renewal of federalism would not replace Washington's  regulation with that of
the states as much as it would allow the latter to  experiment with policies
that are more conducive to  economic growth. Every state would have an interest
in promoting its  own economic growth, and competition between them would 
ensure that only the most beneficial policies survived. The federal  government
would continue to exercise its crucial function of  preventing the states from
erecting their own barriers against one another.  The overall limitations on
government at all levels that this  system would encourage would ensure a more
positive environment  for economic growth.

<h3>LIBERATING PEOPLE FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT	</h3>
<b>By Stephen Goldsmith</b>
<P> Stephen Goldsmith is the mayor of Indianapolis, Indiana.  He spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s Resource Bank Annual Meeting in Chicago, Illinois, on April 25, 1996.

<p>
Let me begin by stating the obvious: We do not have enough wealth in this country, or in the state of Indiana or the city of Indianapolis, to redistribute it fast enough to buy our way out of poverty. This is true for a couple of reasons: because there is not enough wealth and because it is a self-contradictory process. 
<p>

Indianapolis is the 12th largest city in the country, and we have the same problems as the other top 25. If we do what the mayors of the other large cities have done, particularly east of the Mississippi, we get elected and raise property taxes so we can do more good deeds for the people who are in our communities. But when we raise property taxes, people figure out that since wealth is mobile, they can pick up their business, pick up their home, and move to the other side of the city line. When anyone moves to the other side of the city line, by definition the city is a little less wealthy, just because one wealthy guy got up and left. So we have to raise taxes a little bit more to make up for the guy who left, and then raise taxes a little bit more, and so on.
<p>

As reflected in an interesting study done a couple of years ago by the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia, there is a supply side curve in property taxation, in addition to enormous out-migrations of wealth and populations from urban centers, in part because of the policy decisions made by mayors, and, to some extent, governors. In a global economy this problem is even more pronounced because firms do not have to stay in Washington, D.C., or Chicago, and you don't have to manufacture on this side of the ocean. You have a number of other choices about where to invest, and this mobility means we have to think about our issues somewhat differently.
<p>

My office is on the twenty-fifth floor of the City-County Building in Indianapolis. On a clear day, I can look out my window and see the dollar bills float across the city line and land on the other side where the schools are better, the crime is less, the property taxes are lower, and the dollars find a more hospitable place to land. This is a concept that you can repeat in any large city in the country. That is one dynamic. Another important dynamic is that top-down, autocratic, control-driven systems do not work. 
<p>


<b>Creating Systems That Don't Work</b><p>


Ever since the 1930s, government has been very interested in control mechanisms: how to control purchasing, how to control hiring, how to control everything. But no matter how much good we want to do through government, we are creating systems that cannot do so. These big rule-driven systems insure that we do not have enough discretion in the way we deliver public services to tailor those services to the needs of a highly diverse population. If we take a situation in which wealth is mobile and add to it this dynamic that big systems do not work very well, we begin to get a sense of the problem.
<p>

Let me give you a story about big systems and competition to illustrate this. In Indianapolis, we have a severe labor shortage and tens of thousands of people on welfare simultaneously. This is perverse, to say the least. So I invited America Works to come to Indianapolis. America Works is a for-profit organization, and we pay them a performance fee when they take someone off of welfare and that person has a job for six months or more. Inviting them to Indianapolis was controversial because even there, there is a feeling among social service providers that you cannot both make a profit and do a good deed -- a particularly socialist view of life.
<p>

About 45 days after America Works came to Indianapolis I asked them how they were doing, because I had a lot of political capital involved in this experiment. They said, "Not very well."  I said, "Why not?  Can't you train anybody to secure a job?"  And they said, "That's not the problem. We have lots and lots of employers who want the employees. We can't get the welfare department to refer anybody to us."
<p>

So I decided to visit the welfare department. Each week I do a different city job. I've done this for a long time; it's a good way to learn what goes on. Welfare is run out of the state. So I called the state and said, "I want to go to the welfare department."  The state director of welfare said, "You're not welcome."  I responded, "The police department still works for me and I'm going." 
<p>

So I went to the welfare department, stood behind the desk, and watched state employees administer the system. They were not slovenly; they were not lazy. They were doing their job, which was to verify eligibility and hand out a check. They had a little check sheet that said, "Have you looked for a job?"
<p>

But there was nothing in their job description that connected their performance rating to whether welfare recipients found jobs. There was a total disconnect between the bureaucracy and the values that we claim we are trying to implement. Furthermore, everybody had to be treated the same in this rule-based system. If the applicant's problem was that her husband beat her up, or that her son was a drug addict, or that she could not get a voucher to get to the bus system, or whatever the case might be, the system did not allow enough discretion to solve the problem because it is a "one size fits all" system.
<p>

<b>Competition Creates Value</b><p>
Another key point is that competition creates value. I had a chance-of-a-lifetime opportunity to have breakfast with Milton Friedman about six weeks ago. We talked about schools. I kept saying "public schools," and he kept saying, "They're not public schools. They're government schools, and there's a difference."  I said, "What difference does it make?"  He said, "Here is the difference. You can't have innovation if you don't have markets. And you can't have markets if you don't have customers. And you can't have customers in the ordinary sense in a monopoly. That's a big difference."
<p>

The same is true in every service I deliver in city government. Absent competition, absent customer choice, we cannot create maximum value. Every time we touch a public service and open it up to the marketplace for bidding, we drive up the quality and drive down the price. We can take city employee work groups that have done total quality management for 20 years, ever since it was invented, and say to them, "You're going out of business if you don't bid to keep your jobs," and they will drive down their overhead costs in 60 days.
<p>

Competition always creates efficiencies. We have a wastewater treatment plant in Indianapolis. My City-County Council, who disagree with me on virtually all of these issues, asked me to evaluate the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant. I agreed. We hired Ernst & Young. They came in and said, "Congratulations, yours is the most efficient wastewater treatment plant in the country. You can save five percent if you really tighten down."  I said, "Let's try this differently. Let's bid it out and see what happens."
<p>

We had five bids from all over the world, most of which were European, because in the United States this is really a government business and there are few private providers. The winning bid reduced our costs by 44 percent or $65 million -- and we already were the most efficient wastewater treatment plant. When government benchmarks itself against other government monopolies, it is meaningless. We need to open up our services to the marketplace.
<p>


<b>Bureaucracy: The Enemy of Devolution</b><p>
I mention these things just to set the stage for my theme, which is that I am an enthusiast for devolution and I think it has no chance of working. I find nothing inconsistent in my position. A state bureaucrat is still a bureaucrat. No matter how well-intentioned bureaucrats may be, and while they may be a little closer to the public, they are still making decisions in place of customers or parents or other individuals who are in need of public goods. I don't think we can create the organizational culture, going back to the welfare department example, that will allow devolution to work.
<p>

Nevertheless, devolution sets in place a chain of events which I hope will allow bold governors and mayors to downsize government. I was a prosecutor for 12 years, have been mayor for five, and yet realize that government is the problem, not the solution.
<p>

Let me talk about where the devolution revolution might take us. Although obviously there is a role for government-produced public goods, generally the marketplace, whenever it can be used, is a much better way to deliver those goods. There has been terrible confusion -- obviously not in this room, because you are the ones responsible for good ideas, but among public officials -- about what is a public good and whether government needs to produce it. We need to address that question.
<p>

For example, I went to HUD two-and-a-half years ago and asked, "Would you do me a favor?  I'd like to give a voucher to every one of the recipients of public housing. Let them pick where they want to live, and if they don't want to live in my public housing units, then I'll tear them down. Let me go out of business."
<p>

As we think about the devolution revolution, the first principle should be to use the marketplace wherever we can. That means either using tax policy instead of grant policy -- tax policy is much more efficient because it appeals to the customers -- or using vouchers. I don't believe that is a very robust part of the current conversation about devolution. Devolution today is taking a federal program, delivering it to the state house and having a state bureaucrat run it as contrasted to asking, "What can we do to help citizens make decisions on their own?"
<p>


<b>Importance of Religion and Mediating Institutions</b><p>
A second point: as we consider these issues, we must underscore the importance of values and religion. If you have not read the Heritage publication on why religion matters, it shows the correlation and/or causation between belief in religion and stable families, belief in religion and rising out of poverty, belief in religion and crime-free environments. It is extremely important.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

Government has a responsibility, if it can do nothing else, to stop supplanting religious institutions and mediating institutions. We should support them. One way is to abolish welfare. Don't abolish helping people, but abolish the government welfare delivery system and deliver necessary services through neighborhood-based and religious-based organizations. If your path to the future is a government check, the check itself is part of the problem.
<p>

Two summers ago, I took the job training money that mayors generally waste and said, "Let's connect kids in tough neighborhoods with a church because a church is virtually always the most important asset in those communities. Let the churches do job training for the summer."  We did it, and it was a great success. At the end of the summer, the state regulator knocked on my door and said, "You've violated the terms of the grant."  I said, "Why?"  He said, "The problem is that you allowed" not required but allowed "the participants in the program to say a prayer before lunch."
<p>

It may seem like a silly example, but the point is that religion matters. Government could at least get out of the way. We continue to try to work through "charter welfare" programs, and we have turned over 20 of our parks to neighborhood churches to maintain. We do everything we can to help inner-city kids connect with religion.
<p>

So we need to understand the role of mediating neighborhood institutions, and particularly religious institutions, in devolution, and they need to be much more visible and much more activist in the public policy arena.

<p>

<b>How to Make a Difference</b><P>
When I got elected, I identified seven neighborhoods, 8,000-20,000 people each, with the greatest problems -- poverty, single-family head of households, and all the rest -- and said, "We're going to try and make a difference. How?  By doing the things I'm supposed to do well and stop doing everything else."
<p>

My fundamental responsibilities as mayor are really to make sure the streets are smooth, the sewers work, and you don't get beat up on your way to work, church, or school. Yet in most urban communities government is not fulfilling its real responsibilities and instead is redistributing wealth and saying that the problem is that we don't have enough social programs.
<p>

In Indianapolis, we have saved $240 million through competing out city services. We have reduced our non-public-safety work force 40 percent, competed out 65 city activities, and created an infrastructure fund of $500 million, without increasing taxes. We have invested our savings in public safety, in streets and sewers and sidewalks, and in cleaning up neighborhood parks. We have tried to help neighborhood leaders take back their parks and their streets. We have tried to make a difference with how we provide our core responsibilities. We see neighborhoods come back together. When the police, the community, and the infrastructure are solid, businesses will invest.
<p>

After I began making these changes in city government, I sent a letter out to every small business in these tough neighborhoods and said, "What is the most important factor that would make you decide to expand or invest in your neighborhood?"  I expected them to say, "The cost of raw materials or the price of my competitor's goods."  But the first two problems with whether they would expand were taxes and regulation. It is interesting that the top two items for the business community in determining whether they would invest in their current sites were government and government. So we began to clear out the regulatory burdens and the other issues they addressed, and sure enough they did in fact invest.
<p>

This approach is inherently populist. Our small-government approach to big-city problems is only fair to those citizens in our community who lack opportunity. When we artificially put a cab cartel together because we don't trust the marketplace to deliver cab services, when we artificially restrict mass transit, when we drive up the price of housing through silly regulations, when we hire middle-class folks that are public bureaucrats to run inferior services in inner-city neighborhoods, all of those things are inherently unfair to the people who need the most help.

<p>

<b>The Ultimate Arrogance</b><p>
The ultimate arrogance is when we tell parents in failing school systems that, because they are poor, their children are banished to poor education. For people like me, who believe that the welfare system is bad for the recipients, not just the taxpayers, the path to the future is a job. And education is essential to getting a good job. It is irresponsible to allow these government-run monopolistic schools to deny parents choices.
<p>

In the City of Indianapolis we have 12 school systems. In the main central school system, there are third grade classes where every child in the class has failed the standardized tests. If you are a poor parent of a second grader in that school, your child will go to that third grade class. The only way out is if you have enough money to move or to send your child to a private school, or if you're fortunate enough to have a voucher that is paid for as the result of the civic concern of a private business.
<p>

Let me give you a couple of statistics about the results of these vouchers, taking children with similar demographics. A second grader in the city public schools is 14 percent behind the state average. A second grader from the inner city enrolled in a Catholic school as a result of a voucher is 9 percent behind the state average. By the time he gets to the eighth grade, the Catholic school child has reached the state average. The public school child is 25 points behind the state average. Every year the child stays in public school, he or she is worse off. Eventually, over 50 percent drop out -- and that's in Indianapolis. We are not good, but there probably are worse examples around the country.
<p>

While fighting the charter school battle and the voucher battle, we had a clarifying event in the Indiana General Assembly last year when the teachers union, which is the most powerful political group in the state of Indiana, came forward and all but said that you can't trust parents to make decisions about where their children should attend school.
<p>

<b>The Fundamental Requirement</b><p>
All of these issues have consistent themes. The Congress of the United States favors public ownership through the tax code. They make me pay police officers more for overtime through the Fair Labor Standards Act. They tell me how much I should pay someone who paints a part of my HUD-owned buildings. They tell me who can work and who cannot work, and a whole range of other things.
<p>

As they push authority down, and as we advocate for devolution, we need to remember that it will not work unless it is just the first step toward a market-based system that recognizes that the way to create true value is to let citizens and taxpayers make decisions that are in their own best interests. There is no better way for our country to allocate public resources and create opportunities.

<h2>Big-Government Junkies</h2>
<b>by John P. Walters</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The great budget debate between President Clinton and Congress is about more than the level of federal spending and taxes. The fundamental conflict is over the responsibility for addressing America's great social crises. President Clinton wants Washington -- Congress, federal bureaucrats, federal judges -- in charge. Republicans in Congress argue that Big Government has failed to address the human needs of America. They want to return that responsibility to where it has historically rested -- with families, communities, churches and synagogues, and state and local governments.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The conflict was dramatically illustrated when Clinton threw down the gauntlet last January in his State of the Union address: "I challenge Congress not to cut out support for drug-free schools." In June 1995, the president  vetoed legislation to limit the Department of Education's "Drug-Free Schools and Communities" program. With teenage drug use rising rapidly since 1992, who could oppose antidrug programs for America's youth? But the central question is who bears the responsibility for taking action. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The GOP Congress voted last year to cut by 60 percent the $465-million budget for the antidrug program. With cameras rolling, Clinton vetoed the bill in the Rose Garden and called Republicans "extremists" opposed to drug education. His message shows how federal programs diffuse responsibility and undermine citizenship at the local level. No one doubts the importance of reducing illegal drug use. And the federal government has important responsibilities in the fight against illegal drugs: targeting drug trafficking from abroad, for example, as well as interstate commerce in illegal substances and money-laundering.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But teaching children that drug use is wrong and harmful is primarily the responsibility of parents and local communities -- youth organizations, religious institutions, schools, and police. Federal funding is neither necessary nor sufficient for conveying this lesson by word and deed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, the program in question provides roughly $7.25 per pupil. So by the time this money makes its way through the various state and local bureaucracies, many schools receive less than $3 per student. The president suggests that all those parents and teachers who seek to dissuade young people from using illegal drugs will cease to do so if they fail to receive a federal subsidy of $3 a child.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Drug-Free Schools program began in 1987 during the Reagan administration's expansion of the war on drugs. With good intentions, Congress and the executive branch decided to spend more on federal, state, and local efforts to prevent and treat drug abuse and enforce narcotics laws. Our nation's leaders were particularly anxious to contain the explosion in crack addiction. Later, it became clear that crack use had peaked in 1985 and declined rapidly -- proving that efforts by parents and communities were working long before any federal program tried to "help" them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government increased the appropriation for the Drug-Free Schools program from $200 million in 1987 to more than $624 million in 1992, but paid very little attention to what was actually happening to them. According to former Michigan drug czar Bob Peterson, "The health-education lobby misled educators into believing that drugs only pose another personal health choice. In doing so, federal drug funds underwrote controversial sex-education expansion and condom giveaways and enriched health-education consultants." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before Governor Engler and the state's education department put a stop to it, $32 million in antidrug funds were diverted to the Michigan Model for Comprehensive School Health. More than $81,000 was used to purchase giant plastic teeth and toothbrushes. Kids who brush, said the "experts," do not use drugs. Another $1.5 million was spent on models of the human torso that were used just once. A Washington, D.C., school used federal antidrug money to take its basketball team to a restaurant. According to testimony before a congressional committee, 400 students at Dallas's Sunset High School received "A"s for a federally funded course about substance abuse that never met and had no teacher.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the damage is much greater than fiscal waste. Such federal grants do not empower local communities; instead, they turn the federal government into a tax collector for state and local educational bureaucracies and in so doing make them wasteful and unaccountable to their communities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However well-intentioned, the nationalization of local obligations undermines responsibility and accountability. By claiming that effective antidrug education depends largely on federal programs, President Clinton has done America's youth a tremendous disservice. Parents, teachers, and communities should not leave to the federal government a responsibility that really belongs to them.

<h2>Bus-jacking the Revolution</h2><br>
<b>by John Walters</b>
<p>
	Long before "devolution" became a Washington buzzword, Indianapolis mayor Stephen 
Goldsmith turned to private companies to deliver municipal services in Indiana's capital city. He 
started with trash collection and moved on to waste-water treatment; in May 1994, Indiana's 
state legislature passed a bill allowing him to use state funds to improve the city's inefficient 
public-transportation system. The idea was simple: Add independently operated buses to the 
city's recently deregulated taxicab and jitney services to provide more efficient, cleaner, and 
cheaper transportation for the people of Indianapolis.
<p>
	But Goldsmith has been forced to confine his competitive program to state-funded 
transportation systems because of a roadblock thrown up by Congress. Bowing to the 
anticompetitive policies of the ancien
regime, the "revolutionary" 104th Congress approved an 
amendment offered by Texas Democrat Ronald Coleman which severely limits efforts to re-limit 
government. That amendment reaffirmed section 13(c) of the 1964 Federal Transit Act, which 
stipulates that any public-transit worker "negatively impacted" by competition may receive six 
years of salary and benefits. By seconding this mandate, the GOP-controlled Congress 
institutionalized the government monopoly in American mass transit and hurt the poor urban 
residents that the federal subsidies were designed to help.
<p>
	Section 13(c) ties federal mass-transit funds to a bundle of mandates aimed at protecting 
unionized city workers. The estimated cost of these transportation mandates to states and 
localities is two to three times the value of the subsidy. The federal government contributes less 
than 5 percent of all mass-transit operating funds -- about $4 billion a year -- but its mandates 
gobble up 10 to 15 percent of local mass-transit costs. Ron Utt of The Heritage Foundation 
calculates that section 13(c) regulations alone cost local transit authorities approximately $2 
billion to $3 billion each year. 
<p>
	How did this happen? In the 19th century, the mass-transit industry was private, but it turned 
to government to protect it from competition. Regulation protected and hobbled private 
enterprise. Cities imposed price controls, mandated service routes, and gave in to demands by 
labor unions for strict work rules and wage formulas. 

<p>
When private mass-transit companies began to fail in the 1940s and 1950s, they were taken over 
by cities. These municipalities remained wedded, however, to the inefficient management 
techniques that drove private transit firms to bankruptcy. Under pressure from public-employee 
unions, they sought an alternative source of revenue: the federal government. 
<p>
	In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Urban Mass Transit Act, granting localities up to three-
fourths of funds needed for local transit projects -- provided that authorities do business only 
with transit unions approved by the U.S. Department of Labor. In a brazen attempt to fight 
union-busting, Johnson supported section 13(c) of the bill, which offered a federal guarantee of 
the right to collective bargaining.
<p>
	As a result, labor unions could threaten the loss of federal mass-transit subsidies in 
negotiations with local officials. Unable to cut labor costs and improve efficiency, transit 
authorities were forced to scrimp on maintenance and hold off on new equipment. Ridership 
declined as commuters found car travel cleaner, safer, and less expensive. 
<p>
	The 1964 act is just one of many Great Society programs that placed local responsibilities 
under the purview of the federal government -- with disastrous results. Since federal subsidies 
began 30 years ago, government at all levels has showered mass-transit projects with $200 
billion in subsidies. But in that time transit ridership has dropped 15 percent and operating costs 
have increased 105 percent. 
<p>
	The salaries for municipal bus drivers are often three to four times those in the private sector. 
According to Wendell Cox and Jean Love, consultants at the American Legislative Exchange 
Council, competition could save mass transit 20 to 60 percent of its costs each year. With 
expanded routes and better service, ridership would rise by 50 percent. Most importantly, an 
estimated 100,000 new workers, including many poor minorities, would be added to the 
economy.
<p>
	Transportation is a local priority best met by local officials and markets working together. 
When Indianapolis allowed competitive bidding for its "Open Door" service for the disabled, it 
enjoyed dramatic improvements in service and served more than twice the number of daily riders 
for the same amount of money. 
<p>
	By cutting counterproductive federal regulations, urban areas could spend their resources on 
more pressing concerns such as crime and stifling tax rates. Says Mayor Goldsmith, "Our fiercest 
competition for jobs and growth is not Chicago, Cleveland, or Atlanta, it is the 100 miles of 
rural, low-tax communities that surround us." Too bad Congress is ensuring this competition is 
one-sided.

<title>How Milwaukee's School Choice Program Helps Poor Children Succeed In School - Heritage</title>

<h3>HOW MILWAUKEE'S CHOICE PROGRAM HELPS POOR CHILDREN SUCCEED IN SCHOOL</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 120<br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

School choice for poor children is likely to be an issue this year in many state and congressional races. The idea that low-income parents should be able to select the schools -- public or private -- they think best for their children strikes at the very heart of America's educational <i>status quo</i>. Lawmakers and parents therefore need to pay close attention to the quality of academic evaluations of school choice programs, including the samples used and methodologies employed. Evaluations of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, school choice experiment are a case in point.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1990, Milwaukee instituted the nation's first publicly funded school choice program, giving low-income parents vouchers to send their children to private schools. In February 1996, data from the Milwaukee school choice experiment were made available. Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of Houston Center for Public Policy and Paul E. Peterson of Harvard University's Program in Education Policy and Governance have conducted a detailed assessment of this information.<sup>1</sup>  Their study, released at a conference this summer, reveals that:
<p><ul>
<li> The reading scores of choice students in their third and fourth years were, on average, from 3 to 5 percentile points higher, respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school students.
<p>
<li> Math scores, on average, were 5 and 12 percentile points higher for the third and fourth years, respectively.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The implications of these findings are extremely significant. As Greene and Peterson note, "If similar success could be achieved for all minority students nationwide, it could close the gap separating white and minority test scores by somewhere between one-third and more than one-half."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before the release of the Greene and Peterson study, the Milwaukee school choice program had been evaluated each year by the man who designed it: political science professor John Witte of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Witte had concluded that "This school experiment [has] not yet led to more effective schools.... Choice creates enormous enthusiasm among parents... but student achievement fails to rise."<sup>3</sup>  Because Witte and his fellow researchers did not release their data for secondary analysis by other members of the academic community until this year, their evaluation was the sole source of information on the test performance of Milwaukee school choice students. Many academic specialists, foundations, and policymakers therefore had concluded that while school choice clearly satisfied parents, it was not effective in improving the education of low-income central-city students.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Based on their own examination of the data, however, Greene and Peterson found that the statistical model used by Witte and his colleagues failed to replicate the "character" of the MSCP experiment. The most significant flaw was that Witte's group compared choice school students with a much less disadvantaged cross-section of Milwaukee public school students. Witte had compared the choice students to a general sample of public school students, a group which was significantly different in several ways. For example, the choice students were more likely to come from households headed by poor, minority, single mothers, making any comparison between them and the public school sample misleading.<sup>4</sup>  Correcting for these errors, Greene, Peterson, and their colleagues at the University of Houston and Harvard designed their own study -- a study which confirms a growing collection of evidence showing that private school vouchers are the key to educational success for students who are financially trapped in failing inner-city public school systems.
<p>
<b>HOW THE HOUSTON-HARVARD STUDY WAS DONE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greene and Peterson designed an analysis that would correct for the methodological errors of the Witte study. The difference between their conclusions and Witte's is the result of a scientific methodology made more rigorous in several ways. Among them:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Random assignment of students to the test and control groups.</b>
<p>
The Houston-Harvard analysis compared the choice students with students who applied to the choice program but were not admitted. The mandate imposed on the Milwaukee voucher program by the Wisconsin state legislature required Milwaukee's choice schools, if oversubscribed, to admit applicants at random; the result was two randomly selected groups of students: those who were chosen to participate in the program and those who were not. The system thus set up a unique opportunity for researchers to compare students in the choice program with public school students from otherwise eligible families whose parents had made an effort to seek an education for them at a private school. This improved "control" for the extent to which families value education and desire to participate in the program meant that any differences in outcome could reasonably be attributed to the experimental condition of choice. 
<p>
<li><b> Controlling for grade, year, and school.</b>
<p>
Students seeking to participate in the Milwaukee choice program applied each year for a place in a particular grade in a particular school (with spots, as indicated above, to be assigned randomly if the program was oversubscribed). The evaluation data allowed the Houston-Harvard researchers to control for both the grade to which a student applied and the year of application. Although the specific schools to which students applied were not included in the data, researchers were able to control for that variable by taking into account the ethnicity of applicants. Over 80 percent of the choice students attended one of three schools; and virtually all of the students who applied to one of these schools were Hispanic, while virtually all who applied to the other two were African American.<sup>5</sup>  The Witte study had failed to take into account that the selection of students was random only by grade, school, and year.
<p>
<li><b> Measuring academic effects as cumulative.</b>
<p>
Rather than merely measure the changes in test scores from year to year as Witte did, the Houston-Harvard researchers measured the cumulative effect of the choice program on test scores for each child for the entire time the child was in the program. Controlling for gender, the test scores of choice students were compared with those of "non-selected" students who had applied the same year for the same grade and were of the same ethnicity. The effects of choice schools on test performance were small during the first and second years; during the third and fourth, however, choice students made substantial gains. According to statistical tests, positive results of this magnitude would not appear had Milwaukee choice schools had no effect on academic performance. One of the most egregious errors of the Witte study was that it controlled for a student's test score in the prior year, in effect controlling for the outcomes of the choice program and incorrectly assuming that students learn at uniform rates.
<p>
<li><b>Testing for possible errors due to limited data.</b>
<p>
As Professor Witte states, "In terms of demographic characteristics, non-selected... students [and choice students] came from very similar homes....  They were also similar in terms of prior achievement scores and parental involvement."<sup>6</sup>  However, the data available to the Houston-Harvard researchers covered only 76.2 percent of the selected students and 58.7 percent of the non-selected students. To ensure that these two percentages accurately represented the selected and non-selected groups overall, the Houston-Harvard researchers made several additional analyses:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Family background.</b> Controlling for family background was difficult. Both test and background questionnaire data were available for only 36.7 percent of the families of selected students and 21.8 percent of the families of non-selected students. Even among those parents who did return a questionnaire, many did not respond to all of the items. Trying to balance between controlling for additional factors and preserving the size of the sample, the Houston-Harvard team controlled for family income and the mother's education. Those factors were chosen for two reasons: 1) Past academic research shows that these factors strongly affect a child's educational performance, and 2) most parents who returned questionnaires responded to those particular questions. Adding these two variables to the analysis decreased the sample size but changed the results very little. This confirmed that there were no significant differences in family background between those for whom complete background data were available and those for whom they were not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Prior test scores.</b> Two groups randomly assigned to two categories, as was the case in this study, can be assumed to be similar. Thus, the Houston-Harvard study did not control for test scores prior to the Milwaukee program. Because of missing data, however, the researchers checked and found that at the time these two groups applied to the Milwaukee choice schools, the available data showed that they had essentially the same test scores. In fact, those who were not selected scored one percentile point higher in both reading and math. Although the sample size for this analysis was reduced by the fact that test scores at the time of application were available only for a limited number of applicants, a statistical analysis was run on the figures that were available. With only one exception -- the fourth year reading scores, which had to be based on only 26 observations -- the results controlling for prior test scores were not substantially different from those found in the main analysis. This confirmed that there were no significant academic differences between those students whose prior test scores were reported and those whose scores were not reported.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Potential "selection effects."</b>  The Houston-Harvard study's main analysis clearly revealed statistically significant effects in the third and fourth years of a student's program. This presents two possibilities: 1) Either students benefit in measurable ways from the choice experience only after participating in the program for three or more years, or 2) students remain in the program for three to four years only if they are benefiting from it. To determine which was the case, the Houston-Harvard researchers analyzed the first and second year scores of students for whom test results were also available in years three and four. The effects of the first two years were no different from the effects for all first and second year students. This would imply that the positive effects of school choice accumulate over time and are not due to different student retention rates.
</ul>
<p>
<b>OTHER RELEVANT STUDIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Houston-Harvard analysis is more methodologically sound than previous studies of the Milwaukee school choice program. More important, its basic conclusions are supported by a growing body of research on the value of private schools among urban poor and minority children.
In 1990, the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, California, examined the academic performance of children in New York City's public and Catholic school systems. The results were startling: Some 95 percent of Catholic high school students graduated, for example, while only 25 percent made it out of the public schools. Similarly, 75 percent of Catholic students took the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but only 16 percent took it in the public schools.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A 1982 study headed by education scholar James Coleman of the University of Chicago found that students in Catholic schools were one grade level ahead of their public school counterparts in mathematics, reading, and vocabulary.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1993, the New York State Department of Education found that Catholic schools with 81 percent to 100 percent minority composition outscored New York City public schools with the same percentage of minority enrollment in Grade 3 reading (+17 percent), Grade 3 mathematics (+10 percent), Grade 5 writing (+6 percent), Grade 6 reading (+10 percent), and Grade 6 mathematics (+11 per cent).<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the 1993 New York State Department of Education study also found that Catholic and public schools have similar percentages of students from troubled families with low incomes, Anthony Bryk from the University of Chicago reports that Catholic schools expel far fewer children.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Derek Neal, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, in a study conducted for the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found that among urban blacks and Hispanics nationwide, the probability of high school graduation rises from 62 percent to 88 percent when a student is moved from a public to a Catholic high school. The probability of college graduation for these children rises from 11 percent to 27 percent. In addition, when compared with their public school counterparts, minority students in urban Catholic schools can expect roughly 8 percent higher wages in the future simply because they are more likely to complete high school and college.<sup>11</sup>

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
School choice is becoming increasingly popular, and polls show it is most popular among urban African Americans --  the very group served by a program like Milwaukee's. Because black parents are less satisfied with public schools, they want an alternative. A recent study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that specializes in research on African Americans, found that only 5.7 percent of African Americans rated their local public schools "excellent," compared with 19.9 percent of the general population. Conversely, 16.5 percent of the black sample rated their schools "poor," compared with only 7.4 percent of the general population.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to the claims of the education establishment, choice does not leave children of poor families in failing schools. Rather, it is their ticket out. Schools of choice have proven their ability -- and their desire -- to improve the academic outcomes of poor children. Recently, Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York offered to take the lowest performing 5 percent of students in New York City's public schools into New York's Catholic schools, where they can succeed. This also would be a huge financial advantage for taxpayers. New York's Catholic schools educate students at about a third of the cost of public schools. A 5 percent transfer would save New York City over $250 million a year.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The academic success of Milwaukee choice students, as well as other students who have been fortunate enough to escape failing urban schools, is now a matter of record. It is time for state legislators and Members of Congress to give other lower-income children the same opportunity.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress soon will be considering major legislation that would enable poor children to attend the schools of their choice. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive legislative initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Title II, the Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would establish an education choice scholarship program that includes both private and religious schools in "renewal communities."  Each locality would determine the value of the scholarship for poor children, but the maximum value of the scholarship would not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a local public school. The scholarships available to poor children would have a minimum value not less than 66 percent of the per capita cost of educating children in the local public schools or the tuition normally charged by the private school. Parents would not be forbidden from using scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools, and local authorities would not be able to discriminate against parents or children who do so. The scholarship program would be supported from existing federal funds.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where their children go to school is a serious question for parents. President and Mrs. Clinton are willing to pay an annual tuition of more than $11,000 to send their daughter Chelsea to the exclusive Sidwell Friends School. Vice President and Mrs. Gore chose St. Albans School, a few blocks from Sidwell, for their son, as did D.C.'s Shadow Senator Jesse Jackson. The Clintons, like the Gores and many other parents among the nation's social and political elite, have made a conscious decision that the Washington, D.C., public schools, recently the subject of failed congressional reform efforts, are not good enough for their children. They also have decided that a school with religious affiliation is important.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While most Americans intuitively understand what is best for their children, public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose the school they prefer. Indeed, implicit in public policy is the assumption that where a child goes to school is unimportant. But the evidence is in: Where a child goes to school matters a good deal -- better a good school than a bad school.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More important, the empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority youngsters. Yet for more than a century, public policies in the United States have made it virtually impossible to provide public funds for children to attend private schools.<sup>3</sup>  In this regard, the United States stands virtually alone among the world's democracies.<sup>4</sup>  With enactment of the Watts-Talent bill, this dubious distinction would come to an end.
<p>
<b>THE CHANGING INTELLECTUAL CLIMATE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For many years -- in the 1960s and 1970s in particular -- a body of thought developed in this country which emphasized a child's "background" characteristics, which were assumed to be paramount. Success in school was the luck of the socioeconomic draw. It made little or no difference where children went to school, whether urban or rural, north or south, east or west, public or private; what was important was what they brought to school with them.<sup>5</sup>  If they were poor and dispossessed, they probably would do poorly. If they were poor and members of a minority group, they were almost certain to do poorly. By way of contrast, advantaged youngsters from enriched backgrounds did well. That was -- and is -- the argument. That it flies in the face of experience and common sense has done nothing to temper its enthusiastic reception among policymaking elites.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The modern incarnation of this general argument emerged from both the incomplete interpretation and the substantial misinterpretation of early work by James Coleman, a nationally prominent sociological researcher, then at Johns Hopkins.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In research conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Office of Education (predecessor to the U.S. Department of Education), Coleman and his colleagues initially found little in the way of school effects; factors like race, income, and parental level of education were stronger than school characteristics as predictors of school performance. What did seem to make a modest difference was who you went to school with; poor black youngsters appeared to do better in integrated settings. But as any competent policy analyst knows, absence of proof is not proof of absence. Because "school effects" were elusive or hard to find and measure did not mean they did not exist.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To the contrary, if "school effects" really were only weak (or worse yet, if they did not exist at all), the whole rationale of public education would come tumbling down. Indeed, so might that of private schooling. If nothing matters, there is no point in worrying about the right way to educate children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was, however, a widespread desire to believe a variation of such an unlikely interpretation. Among liberals who believed in vigorous, interventionist government, the lack of "school effects" was interpreted to mean that these effects were not sufficiently robust. What was needed was "more" impact: more money for schools. If race and socioeconomic status (or SES in the jargon of sociologists) were more powerful determinants of school performance than schools themselves, the schools must be weak. Other larger, even more ambitious government programs would be in order.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as geography was destiny in the 19th century, SES became destiny in the 20th. The ironies in this development were many. In liberal hands, it became an argument designed to bolster the theory that the only good school is a rich school (and a rich public one at that). At the same time, it became an argument that absolves the existing school of its obligations to its students. It "blames the victim."  The school is not at fault if students do not learn. Schools have little or no effect; it all depends on the raw material.<sup>7</sup>  This sentiment is nicely encapsulated in a song ("Gee, Officer Krupke!") from Leonard Bernstein's classic <I>West Side Story</I>: "Hey, I'm depraved on accounta I'm deprived."
<p>
<b>WHY SCHOOLS MATTER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such conventional liberal theory is bad pedagogy and worse public policy. Indeed, it fell to James Coleman, then a professor at the University of Chicago, to reopen the argument with extraordinarily powerful research that demonstrated the strong effect of Catholic schools, particularly on poor black children.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This research, widely reported in 1981 when it appeared in summary form in <I>The Public Interest</I>, is as valid today as it was then. Coleman also noted the embarrassing fact, still a stark feature of today's school choice debate, that "there are many who vigorously oppose making private school attendance easier and at the same time have their own children enrolled in private school."<sup>9</sup>  Coleman set out to answer three vital questions:
<p><ol>
<b><li></b> Do private schools provide better education?
<p>
<b><li></b> If they do, what is the public policy interest in denying poor children access to them?
<p>
<b><li></b> Is it true, as opponents of public funding allege, that private schools racially segregate children?
</ol> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first hurdle was methodological: how to distinguish "the effects of selection from the effects of the school itself" to control, "even to the extent of overcompensating," for selection into the schools. This he did. His academic findings are hardly surprising: "higher learning in the Catholic schools than in the public school."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The literature in this area is not restricted to Coleman's seminal work, as John Convey's 218-page <I>Catholic Schools Make a Difference</I> reveals.<sup>10</sup>  Convey reports that in a series of studies based on National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data, Lee and Stewart "documented consistently higher scores of Catholic school students compared with public school students."  For example, the average Catholic school student in grades 4 and 8 scored significantly higher in reading and writing.<sup>11</sup>  In addition, Andrew Greeley's analysis of data from the High School and Beyond longitudinal study showed superior performance among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in Catholic school by every single category (Vocabulary, Reading, Math 1, Math 2, Science, and Writing), and Marks and Lee, writing in 1989, found higher scores in Catholic schools in grades 3, 7, and 11 among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in every single category for math, science, and reading.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most imposing studies, however, are those of Coleman and his colleagues. Catholic school sophomores, for example, scored 10 percent higher in science and 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading, and vocabulary. Catholic school seniors also consistently outscored public high school students: 10 percent to 17 percent higher in reading, mathematics, and vocabulary, and from 3 percent lower to 7 percent higher on three tests that measure ability more than achievement.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last finding strongly suggests that the explanation for higher scores lies not in some "ability" differential, but in what the schools do with what they have. Catholic schools expect much of their students, whatever their race and background, and expecting much, get much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Coleman found even higher scores in non-Catholic private schools, the more important sample is Catholic schools, which are the dominant force in the non-government school market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman also was concerned with other issues, most notably the impact of choice on racial integration. Here the findings were equally unambiguous: A child is more likely to attend school with a child of another race in the private sector than in the public sector. The importance of this early finding would be hard to overstate; "suburban schools within the public sector are used as a haven to a much greater extent than in the private sector."  Counterbalancing "bright" flight to the suburbs is the behavior of students in Catholic school. Coleman's figures on dropouts are striking. Among white students in public school, 13.1 percent dropped out compared with 2.6 percent in Catholic schools; among Hispanic students, the difference was two to one (19.1 percent to 9.3 percent); and among black students, the difference was more than 3.5 to one (17.2 percent to 4.6 percent).<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first finding concerning school effects should have been received with rejoicing by the professional educators who had endured their share of bad press. Their magazines and journals should have featured articles on why schools make a difference. So also should the nation's civil rights leadership have reacted positively to Coleman's finding about racial integration in the private sector. Indeed, the refusal of the U.S. Supreme Court to establish "metropolitan" remedies for past cases of racial discrimination makes the Coleman finding all the more important, because private school attendance is almost never geographically based. Private schools, already better integrated than public schools, offer more fertile fields for expanded racial integration over time than do the public schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such reactions, however, were rare, and the reason is not hard to fathom. Had Professor Coleman's rigorous social science work revealed stronger public than private school effects, there would have been joy in the great halls of the education establishment.<sup>15</sup>  But because one of the bastions of "good schooling" is the private sector,<sup>16</sup> public school educators could not -- would not -- accept his findings. Coleman, on the other hand, did no such disservice to the authorities who run the public schools. He followed the evidence where it led and found that all schools that exhibit similar characteristics have strong school effects. All schools, whether public or private, that exhibit the same cluster of attributes -- high expectations, a focused curriculum, good order and discipline, caring teachers, enterprising students -- have relatively robust "school effects."  What is important is that these characteristics are found more readily and more often in private schools.
<p>
<b>THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to his school effects work, Professor Coleman returned to the questions that had intrigued him originally: Even if some schools are better than others, what difference does what the student brings to school make?<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What are the cultural and social traits that make a difference?  The potential for synergy is obvious, as are the public policy implications.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Social capital" is the cluster of skills, attitudes, and (to a lesser extent) knowledge that the student acquires in the non-school environment. Clearly, a child who is disruptive and unruly and who has only weakly developed academic interests is less likely to do well in any school, "good" or "bad," while youngsters who bring with them a love of learning, disciplined and orderly habits, and respect for themselves and other students, as well as for the teacher, are much more likely to do well, all other things being equal. These traits -- what might be called pro-academic traits -- are the product of caring and supportive communities, voluntarily created and maintained. Though they may include people who look alike, in the final analysis they are not defined by race, socioeconomic status, or ethnicity; they bridge all those gaps. They are associative communities made up of superficially similar or different people who share common values and virtues. In a school setting, to use a quaint term, they are "communities of scholarship."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Members of Congress and state and local legislators alike should recognize the public policy implications of "social capital."  The most important single thing they can do in this regard is to encourage its formation and continuance by underwriting education choice. Not only does choice permit the expression of "social capital;" it builds and reinforces the habits of mind that are essential to voluntary association -- the same habits of mind that are essential to civil society. In a school setting, choice imposes the burden of choosing; there is no escape. One must make one's bed and lie in it; no one else does it for you. School choice proposals, including the school choice component of the Watts-Talent legislation, foster democratic habits of mind that are essential to a free society.
<p>

<b>THE HIGH STAKES IN SCHOOLS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reasons for the high quality of private schools are several and have to do largely with organization, incentives, and rewards. Most simply, voluntary association makes a difference. In the public sector, the organizational climate conspires against dedicated teachers and hard-working students; in the private sector, it encourages and rewards high levels of performance. In short, monopolies are no better in the public sector than in the private sector. They serve only the interests of the "owners," never the interests of workers or clients.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the public sector, of course, the "owners" do not literally own the schools. Rather, they are managers and bureaucrats, and the schools are run for them, not for teachers and students. This rather unappealing picture is not restricted to the public sector; managerial capitalism also looks a good deal like this, which is why it is under fire from liberal and conservative critics alike. The Watts-Talent legislation would permit parents of poor children to "own" their own schools instead of having to submit to the bureaucracy that runs government schools.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's policymakers seem willing to tolerate failures and weaknesses in education that they would not tolerate in any other area of public policy. Coleman's findings are so powerful that were he dealing with any other area of public policy -- health, welfare, housing, transportation, or juvenile justice -- shifts in public policy would begin to reflect the new knowledge he contributed. But public schooling is a nearly immovable object; public schools are run for the convenience of, and at the pleasure of, their managers, not for the benefit of students and their families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	When they debate the issue of school choice, Members of Congress should consider the "school effects" literature in terms of academic outcomes; its conclusions are wholly unsurprising. In light of their "environment," one would expect private schools to "do better."  They must if they are to survive. All parents who enroll their children in private school go through at least a two-step process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First</b>, they must decide to enroll their children in a non-government school and find the financial wherewithal to deliver on this decision. Almost without exception, this involves the payment of substantial tuition and fees out of pocket. Indeed, because people value what they pay for, "full-ride" scholarships are almost unknown in private elementary and secondary education. Even -- perhaps particularly -- schools like Father Clemens's Our Lady of Angels in Chicago charge at least a modest tuition.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second</b>, the financial commitment families make to send their children to private school is a proxy for a personal commitment to education, the importance of which is hard to overestimate. It makes schools and their families partners in a way that the a public sector monopoly can never hope to achieve.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Probably the most important "school effects" issue is not the measured academic "outcomes" of schooling, but the school's impact in the market. In a market, a school must "sell" and parents must "buy."  That is the market<I>par excellence</I>. Goods and services that do not sell have no effect; indeed, they do not stay in the market. Only monopolists -- particularly government monopolists -- stay in markets when no rational consumer wants their product or service. Poor children, for all practical purposes, today have no options.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This issue came to a head this year when Congress considered school choice as part of the Washington, D.C., FY 1996 appropriations bill. Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) offered an amendment that would have given scholarships of up to $3,000 for students whose family incomes were at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for students whose family incomes were not more than 185 percent above the poverty level. The Senate, however, when presented with this opportunity to expand choice for children in Washington's failing public school system, refused to do so. Only four members of the Senate had sent their children to D.C.'s public schools.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The obvious assumption, of course, is that D.C.'s public school system is tolerable for poor children but not a serious option for members of the United States Senate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On the wisdom of these official restrictions, let the late Professor James Coleman answer the critics. His is an eloquent summation of the case for justice and dignity:
<p><blockquote>
	There may be a rationale for some protective barriers to encourage participation in the public schools, but certainly not those that exist now, which harm most the interests of those least well-off and protect most those public schools that are the worst. In short, the tuition barrier to private schooling as it exists now is almost certainly harmful to the public interest, and especially harmful to the interests of those least well-off.<sup>20</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Members of Congress consider the Watts-Talent school choice provisions, they have another chance to do the right thing.

<li>    The most important work in this field is that of the late sociologist James Coleman. A researcher of towering intellect and erudition who also was devoid of ideological predisposition, Coleman followed the data wherever they led, often at the cost of personal peace of mind. He was vilified by the American Sociological Association for taking the politically incorrect position that public support of private schooling was a defensible public policy option (although, to its credit, the ASA retracted its condemnation to award him a medal shortly before his death). Coleman never wavered in his quiet and determined defense of the truth as he understood it. While his prose style and the heavy quantitative emphasis of his major works are a bit daunting for the generalist, his articles are clear, concise, and lively. A perfect example -- as current today as when it was published -- is "Public Schools, Private Schools, and the Public Interest," <I>The Public Interest</I>, No. 64 (Summer 1981). Father Andrew M. Greeley's work is on point as well. In particular, see <I>Catholic High Schools and Minority Students</I> (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1982).<p>

Glenn, one of the nation's leading authorities on public funding for attendance at private schools, for 21 years was the Massachusetts State Department of Education official responsible for civil rights and urban education opportunity. Recognizing the failure of busing, Glenn pioneered education choice programs.<p>
<li>   One long-standing trend, the concentration of high test scores in the Northern tier of states from Maine to Montana, led Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) to propose facetiously the following policy remedy to states concerned about low test scores: Move your state north.<p>
<li>    Coleman's first major study which permitted a systematic examination of this and related questions was prepared under the terms of a major grant from the U.S. Office of Education, part of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). Titled <I>Equality of Educational Opportunity</I>, it was released in 1966 and caused an immediate sensation. Coleman and his colleagues could find no school effects of consequence; indeed, any school effect seemed to be overwhelmed by student background characteristics. Policymakers were led in two different directions by this surprising "non-finding."  Many analysts concluded that school effects were minimal (at least from a public policy standpoint; they still put their own children in "good" schools). Needless to say, their public policy conclusion was a counsel of despair; after all, the whole American experiment in self-governance was based on the Founders' conviction that an educated citizenry is essential to democracy. The other direction, equally misleading, fueled the notion that black children could learn only if they were integrated with white children. While racial integration is a laudable objective, it is patronizing in the extreme to argue that black children must be integrated to learn. More to the point is the quality of facilities, books, teacher preparation, and the like.<p>
<li>   As the Manhattan Institute's Sy Fliegel wryly notes, it is like the excuse offered by the swimming teacher who says, "I taught them to swim but they sank."<p>

<li>    Although most Americans are convinced that private schools are simply better than public schools, this is not an altogether implausible proposition. It was true in Australia, leading the Australian Labour Party (similar to the Democratic Party in the United States) to support public aid to private schools. Sparked by the work of Father James Carroll, who later became Bishop of Sydney, public funding was made available on the basis of the following argument: Catholic schools are inferior (by almost any academic or fiscal measure) and will remain so unless public funding is provided; Catholics (and non-Catholics who attend these schools) will not abandon their schools; and no good public end is served by denying poor Australian children a quality education in the schools in which they chose to enroll. For more on this interesting situation, see Denis P. Doyle, "Family Choice in Education: The Case of Denmark, Holland and Australia," in <I>Private Schools and Public Policy: International Perspectives</I>, ed. William Lowe Boyd and James G. Cibulka (New York, N.Y.: Falmer Press, 1989), and "Why Congress Should Give Poor Children Choice of Religious Schools," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</i>, forthcoming.<p>

<li>  
 Not to put too fine a point on it, but private schools are a red flag to the public school bull. The intensity of the hostility most public school leaders feel for private schools is understood more easily in psychological terms than in logical terms. Private schools, for example, are accused of being "elitist," a sin as serious as racism or sexism in the modern pantheon of bad attitudes. But the facts, as Coleman and others have revealed, are otherwise. For a longer disquisition on this general subject, see "A Din of Inequity?  Private Schools Reconsidered," <I>Teachers College Record</I>, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Summer 198l).<p>

For a more scholarly treatment, see James S. Coleman, "Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital," <I>American Journal of Sociology</I>, Vol. 94, Supplement (1988), pp. S95-S120.<p>
<li>   An example of more than passing importance, Father Clemens's school operates on an extended day and year, is in the middle of the ghetto, has a waiting list, accepts only children from families on welfare, and still charges tuition. His reasoning?  If they can afford a phone, a TV, sneakers, and Bulls jackets, they can scrape together some tuition. Moreover, all families are expected to give time to school projects -- not just the PTA, but painting and fix-up activities as well. Finally, families that really cannot afford any tuition are allowed to "work off" the obligation: Families that pay something are families that take school seriously.<p>

<title>Why Vouchers Are Needed For Poor Children - Heritage</title>

<center><h3>WHY VOUCHERS ARE NEEDED FOR POOR CHILDREN<sup>1</sup></h3>

Special Report to the House Appropriations Committee<br>
Committee Brief No. 26<br>
May 10, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> reported recently that Congress has identified more than 750 education programs in various departments and agencies of the federal government.<sup>2</sup>  One program -- the largest and most ambitious in the federal arsenal -- is Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged (formerly Chapter One), which provides funding for local education agencies and schools in areas with high rates of poverty in order to provide additional educational assistance to low-achieving students.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Title I was an invention of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Enacted in 1965 with great fanfare, it was designed to reach poor children across the board from all geographic regions, of all races and ethnic groups, in all school settings: public, private non-sectarian, and private religious schools. The terms of its enactment were so unusual that they bear re-examination.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Until Johnson's elevation to the Presidency in 1963, no President had even attempted a major federal education program for elementary schools. Americans were skeptical of, even hostile to, the idea of federal encroachment on education. Local control was a tradition as old and as venerable as the Republic, and citizens of both parties and all regions guarded their prerogative jealously. While President Dwight Eisenhower had adopted a number of education programs in response to Sputnik, reflecting a tradition one and one-half centuries old, the nation as a whole was reluctant to support general programs of federal aid to elementary and secondary schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to the robust and long-standing commitment to local control, another factor was at work: If there were federal aid available, would it be for all children, without regard to whether they attended public or non-public school, or would it be restricted to public schools only?  Not to put too fine a point on it, the question was whether poor children in Catholic schools would receive aid on an equal footing with children in public schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is not an academic point. Indeed, the whole fate of the federal role in education hinged on this issue alone. The decision of the Congress in 1965, at the urging of the President, was that all eligible children should receive federal support regardless of whether they attended public or private school. Interestingly, this issue was raised by, and the decisive votes cast by, big-city Democrats. Indeed, they withheld their votes subject to meeting the condition that all poor children must be eligible, not just public school children. This was an historic and honorable compromise. Federal aid to public schools would not have become a reality without it. In this case, at least, the public schools' best friends were private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Let me provide some sense of scale. Between 1966 and 1995, the federal government spent nearly $100 billion on education aid to the disadvantaged, of which the vast majority was for Title I; about three percent of that money made its way to the support of private school students, the fact that they make up about 12 percent of total enrollment notwithstanding. Even though private school support had led to enactment of Title I, public school officials across the nation were slow to include private schools in Title I programs; yet Title I represented the greatest single windfall for public schools in their history. It is important to re-emphasize this little-noted fact: The windfall was thanks to, and at the expense of, private schools. But public school officials had short memories and a weakly developed sense of obligation to their counterparts in private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even though the public schools had been slow to respond, respond they finally did; and the relationship that emerged, if not cordial, was correct. In spite of significant bureaucratic hurdles, Title I funds for private school children flowed -- not in amounts as large as might have been expected, but the program, limited though it was, worked.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Twenty-five years later, the portion of Title I that supported private school children was virtually destroyed, first by action of the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Aguilar v. Felton</I> (1985), then by congressional inaction. Public school officials never raised their voices to support private education. The Court struck down 25 years of a relatively successful program through which private school students received limited services. The Court ruled that the existing educational practices by which Title I funds were delivered to non-public schools created "excessive entanglement between church and state," thus violating the constitutional ban against public support for religion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, the number of private school children served by Title I has fallen significantly, and the cost of services to them has risen dramatically. The reason?  The extraordinary lengths to which the <I>Aguilar</I> decision has driven even well-intentioned school districts. New York City, for example, with the largest Title I program in the country, has been using Title I buses (something like bookmobiles of old) to bring Title I services to eligible private school students. No longer permitted (by <I>Aguilar</I>) to send public school teachers into Catholic and other religious schools, the buses pull up at the curb (which is public space), and the children leave their school as they set foot in this mobile classroom.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to buses, Title I "infrastructure" for non-public school students includes computers that are programmed to work only with Title I programs in them. Imagine: a computer with a "v" chip that prohibits children in religious schools from studying anything except secular subjects!
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If it were not true, it would be funny. New York City reports that $16 million of its Title I funds will go for infrastructure, not instruction. It is a Kafkaesque solution to a problem created by a Supreme Court clearly unable to make sense out of its own history of tortured interpretations of the constitutional requirement that church and state be separated. In striking down the practices that led to the <I>Aguilar</I> decision, the Court put the ball back in Congress's hands -- not implicitly, as all decisions do, but explicitly and deliberately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Supreme Court invited Congress to fashion a constitutionally defensible method of funding children who attend non-public schools. In particular, Mr. Justice Powell, writing in his concurring opinion in <I>Aguilar</I>, makes the point that if Congress could develop a strategy for helping children in denominational schools --without using public schools -- the Court would be likely to accept it. Congress could create, for example, a Title I voucher system, an approach that would survive judicial scrutiny.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That the Congress did not respond to this invitation is public knowledge. The reason for it is not. The public schools -- which had been the principal beneficiaries of Title I over the years -- refused to come to the aid of their private school compatriots, whose initial support had permitted the program to come into existence in the beginning.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is time for the worm to turn.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is now widely recognized that there are two major problems with Title I. The first, and in some respects the most formidable, is that the program does not produce what researchers call "sustaining effects."  Put most bluntly, Title I does not appear to make a difference in the lives of children. While the program appears to do no harm -- the first test for any helping service, as all physicians know -- it is not clear that it does much good. Or, if it does do much good, it is not clear for whom and in what circumstances. The fact that Title I does not do what it was intended to do -- significantly improve the academic performance of low-income and low-achieving students -- means that the current program configuration can no longer be seriously defended.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, there is a growing body of evidence about what does make a difference in the education of poor children: Researchers and practitioners alike know that a school with a shared culture and a shared commitment to academic excellence makes a difference. They know that expectations make a difference. They know that high standards make a difference. They know that a safe and orderly learning environment makes a difference. Most important, it is clear that religiously affiliated schools share all these characteristics. The work of the late Professor James Coleman of the University of Chicago, perhaps the nation's most important research sociologist, makes the point unequivocally: Poor youngsters -- particularly poor black youngsters -- do better in parochial school than in public school.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Critics assert that Coleman's work is flawed. No doubt it is in some small ways, but the overall findings have not been challenged. Indeed, in any other field -- housing, health, transportation, the environment -- findings as robust as Professor Coleman's would form the basis of new policy, as they should for Title I. Originally launched as a demonstration, fueled as much by hope as by fact, Title I should continue to be the source of flexibility and innovation, not a program cast in the bureaucratic concrete of the Great Society. Indeed, both the spirit of Title I and research of the kind produced by James Coleman present Congress with the opportunity -- in fact, the obligation -- to make significant program changes. I will return to those later.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The second problem is that schools across the country -- but most notably in New York -- are at their wits end with <I>Aguilar</I> compliance. It is so clumsy and bureaucratic -- and so obviously so -- that not even these giant bureaucracies can tolerate it any longer. As a consequence, they are seeking relief. New York is going to Court to get <I>Aguilar</I> overturned. According to <I>Education Week</I>, Secretary Riley supports New York City.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this connection they have some reason to be optimistic. The United States Supreme Court has changed since <I>Aguilar</I> and now appears ready to change its decision. Five justices have expressed an interest in doing so. (As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, reminds us in his wonderful article "What Do You Do When the Supreme Court Is Wrong?"  you wait, as the Court's "most enduring practice is to reverse itself.")
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In an energetic and robust democratic republic, however, the possibility, even the probability, of the Supreme Court reversing itself should offer only scant comfort. In particular, Congress has within its power the opportunity and the capacity to do the right thing on its own, in which case the Court can simply ratify the action at some later date. More to the point, the Court is a blunt instrument, and Congress can legislate with surgical precision.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To be precise, the Supreme Court will not institute aid to individuals, but Congress can. The best that could be expected from the Court, with no new statute to interpret, in reversing <I>Aguilar</I> is a return to the <I>status quo ante bellum</i>. That is not good enough. It is time to return to first principles. Indeed, the only intellectually defensible federal role in education is one in which Uncle Sam supports all Americans equally. The U.S. Congress has no more interest in a narrow program of support for public schools <I>qua</I> public schools than it would have in a program detrimental to public schools. The congressional test should be neutrality and equal treatment of equals, just as the original Title I legislation was based on the conviction that all poor children -- no matter whether they attend government or private school -- should be beneficiaries of federal largesse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is the principle of the famous GI Bill for higher education; it should be no less a principle in lower education. Indeed, in a little-known footnote to the GI Bill, servicemen and women were eligible to use their GI Bill benefits to complete high school, and some significant number did just that.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The guiding principle for Title I reform, then, should be reconnecting the Title I program to its true beneficiaries -- students, not schools. As it is, Title I now commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child; if that money were available as a Title I voucher, it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs, whether public, private non-sectarian, or private religious. Now, $1,000 a child may not sound like much in the public sector, particularly in cities like Washington, D.C., where per pupil expenditures are about $10,000 a year in public school, but the facts of the private school world are quite different.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
True, the First Child's private school, Sidwell Friends Academy, costs well over $10,000 a year, but that is the exception, not the rule, in the world of private schools. Nationally, there are about 28,000 private schools, and they are, on average, low-cost institutions. For example, in 1990, average tuition in Catholic secondary schools was $2,878 per year, and average tuition in Catholic elementary schools was $1,243; average tuition in non-Catholic private secondary schools was $4,395, and in private elementary schools, it was $1,780. In the private school world, $1,000 is a lot of money. (By way of contrast, average per pupil expenditures in public schools in 1990 were $6,472 in secondary schools and $5,177 in elementary schools.)
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A number of communities across the country are trying vouchers or voucher-like mechanisms to see if they will make a difference in the lives of children. The two most notable examples are Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Cleveland, Ohio; in those communities -- in any community anywhere in the nation -- flexible Title I funding (letting dollars follow children) could make an enormous difference. In this connection, beware the critics; unhappily, in schools as in other parts of public life, self-interest is paramount. At a minimum, even the most ardent member of a special-interest group should be pressed hard as to why Congress should not at least permit states and localities to use their Title I funds as vouchers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Members of Congress should keep two crucial points in mind.
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First</b>, no program could be more appropriate to the pedagogical needs of today; public schools in our big cities have become bureaucratic nightmares, often frightening places to teach in or attend. Teachers are as much losers in this equation as students. Title I vouchers would free the teacher as they free the student. At issue is not competition for Title I vouchers (though there would be some, and it would be welcome). One thousand dollars a child will not unleash massive competitive pressures. What it will do is permit families to choose schools that are consistent with their values. And it will permit teachers, who ultimately manage these resources, to do so with more professional autonomy and flexibility.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second</b>, it is by now universally recognized that the nation faces a moral as well as a public school crisis. Not surprisingly, the two issues are intertwined inextricably. They cannot be separated. From the time of the ancient Greeks to the present, thoughtful men and women have known that the single most important purpose of schooling is character formation, to turn boys and girls into men and women who know right from wrong, good from bad. Successful schools impart the values of democratic capitalism -- honesty, self-respect, respect for others, tolerance, enterprise, diligence, moderation, forbearance, courage. It is precisely to these issues that religious schools are most committed.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most recent report of the Public Agenda Foundation indicates that Americans across the board prefer private to public schools; families with the resources have long acted on this. Witness the First Child. Witness the behavior of Members of Congress, of whom about one-third use private schools. Witness the behavior of public school teachers. Of those with the means (twice the median family income), as many as half -- in big cities -- enroll their children in private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The effect of <I>Aguilar</I> has been to actively discourage poor children from attending non-government schools by penalizing them if they do. The price of <I>Aguilar</I> is to lose benefits or to make it so awkward to claim them that it is hardly worth the candle. It is a bizarre commentary on modern times that a nation founded on a fundamental commitment to religious freedom would produce policies actively hostile to religion. More bizarre yet is that the burden should fall most heavily on the poor.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Congress has before it an historic opportunity to convert Title I into a voucher program. Let poor families -- not bureaucrats -- decide where their children will go to school: government or non-government, secular or non-secular, as the case may be.

<title>How Congress Can Help Trigger Reform in DC Schools -- Heritage</title>

<center><h3><i>HOW CONGRESS CAN HELP TRIGGER REFORM IN D.C.'S SCHOOLS</i></h3>
By James F. Hirni<br>
<a href="/heritage/welcome.html.cgi">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 440<br>
November 1, 1995<br>
</center><hr width=50%>
<p>
Nowhere in America is there a greater need for innovative approaches to education than in the nation's capital. Amid the intense debate in Congress and around the country over education and the future of America's schools, little is being done to improve the educational system for the children of the District of Columbia. Fortunately, however, at the request of House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), the Task Force on D.C. Schools and Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) have developed a plan that takes the first step towards giving the District's children the education they have a right to expect.
<p>
The dismal record of the District's schools is a national embarrassment. The city spends an average of almost $9,000 per year on its more than 80,000 enrolled students. This is the third-highest spending rate of any state or equivalent jurisdiction, some $3,000 above the average. Its student-teacher ratio (14.4 to 1) is the fourth-lowest of any state or equivalent jurisdiction. Yet SAT scores in the District rank 49th out of 51 (50 states plus D.C.), and its graduation rate is also 49th out of 51.
<p>
It is time for a drastic overhaul of the District of Columbia school system. Ideally, the pressure for this should come from within the District, but reformers have been frustrated by the fierce opposition to change, led by the school bureaucracy and the teachers union, that so far has stymied action from within the city. Congress, however, has a unique role in the District. Within the District of Columbia appropriations bill, it has an opportunity to help trigger local reform by adopting Representative Gunderson's proposal to improve educational opportunities for the District's children.
<p>
The Gunderson proposal authorizes the establishment of independent public charter schools, using existing D.C. public and private schools as well as new schools created with the help of universities in the District. It even authorizes many federal institutions within D.C., including the National Science Foundation and Smithsonian Institution, to help establish public charter schools.
<p>
The establishment of charter schools would help restructure the existing public school system, allowing innovative school principals and teachers to work with parents and academic institutions to overhaul the system. Under the Gunderson proposal, lower-income parents would have the right to choose an effective private school if they are not satisfied with their child's public school. This would hold the public schools to account.
<p>
Specifically, Representative Gunderson's proposal gives scholarships of up to $3,000 for students whose family income is at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for students whose family income is not more than 185 percent above the poverty level. These scholarships would allow low-income D.C. families to send their children to any private, independent religious or non-religious school located in the District of Columbia and the surrounding counties of Northern Virginia and Maryland. They also would cover the cost of fees and other expenses for tutoring and instructional services after school hours and the costs of transportation for a student enrolled in a District of Columbia public school, public charter school, or private school participating in the tuition scholarship program. 
<p>
The Gunderson proposal establishes a special panel to develop tests to monitor the progress of the District's schools so that parents have real information on which to evaluate D.C.'s schools. This World Class Schools Panel would be responsible for developing a core curriculum for kindergarten through 12th grade. In addition, it would encourage more private-sector involvement in the District's schools.
<p>
The Gunderson proposal does not tell D.C. residents what schools they must have. Rather it creates the conditions and incentives for change. It is still up to parents, teachers, principals, and District institutions to take advantage of this opportunity.
<p>
The plan is not without its weaknesses. For one thing, it does nothing to help the D.C. Superintendent or parents break down the suffocating bureaucracy that swallows education dollars and thwarts reform. And while a "D.C. Desk" in the Department of Education might help D.C. schools locate resources and expertise to assist reform, there is a real danger that it will become just another force blocking reform. Despite these weaknesses and its limited scope, Representative Gunderson's proposal would be the crucial first step in ending business as usual in the District's school system. It would give parents, students, and innovative educators the tools they need to force change on a fossilized system. And it would give low-income families the chance to escape those public schools that refuse to give children the education they should expect in the nation's capital.

<h3><i>WHERE TEACHERS SEND THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO SCHOOL</i></h3>
By Denis Doyle and James Hirni<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Business/Education Insider No. 42<br>
October-November 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<blockquote>"If teachers and their organizations reject the institutions they are teaching in and feel free to choose a private alternative, on what basis should other parents, particularly the poor and dispossessed, be denied this option?"</blockquote><p>
  This pointed question was posed by Denis Doyle, Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Educational Policy, during a recent lecture in Washington on his latest study, which shows where public school teachers send their children to school.
<p>
Drawing on 1990 Census data, Doyle finds that, taken together, public and private school teachers nationwide are only slightly more likely than the general public to choose private schools (17.1 percent to 13.1 percent). But in America's most troubled cities, the pattern is quite different:  Public school teachers are two to three times more likely than the general public to use private schools. For example, in Washington, D.C., 25.7 percent of the children of the city's public school teachers who make less than $35,000 attend private school. This is more than double the national average; among public school teachers nationwide, 11.9 percent enroll some or all of their children in private school. The pattern continues in cities like Boston (24.4 percent), New York (21.4 percent), Miami (35.4 percent), and Los Angeles (18.9 percent). As Doyle observes, "in America's cities, where the schools are arguably the worst, a large number of teachers abandon the institutions in which they work and enroll their offspring in private schools."
<p>
Doyle's study also analyzes the relationship between race and a public school teacher's use of private schools. Doyle finds that, nationally, black public school teachers use private schools more than white public school teachers (12.9 percent to 11.9 percent), and Hispanic public school teachers use private schools more than non-Hispanic public school teachers (16.5 percent to 11.9 percent). Meanwhile, white parents are somewhat more likely than nonwhite parents to send their children to private school. In the United States as a whole, 13.1 percent of all parents, 14.2 percent of white parents, 8.1 percent of black parents, and 10.8 percent of parents of other races send their children to private schools. Some 13.4 percent of Hispanic parents send their children to private school, while 10.1 percent of all non-Hispanic parents do so.
<p>
Doyle notes that black public school teachers are almost as likely as the public at large to use private schools (12.9 percent compared with 13.1 percent). He concludes that "black teachers who can afford a choice exercise it:  they are 50 percent more likely than black parents in general to enroll their children in private school. This might explain the high support for publicly funded school choice programs among minorities--they are often in the worst school districts and are more inclined to put their children in private schools when they can afford it."
<P>
Doyle says that "teachers--public and private, white and black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic, low income, middle income, and high income--know how to address the nation's education crisis:  they vote with their feet and their pocket books. They choose private schools for their children when they think it serves their interests best."
<p>
"When public-school teachers choose private schools," says Doyle, "the truth is self-evident:  although they work in public schools they choose private schools for their own children because they believe the latter are better. They are connoisseurs."

<b>WISCONSIN PRIVATE PHILANTHROPISTS SUPPORT CHOICE</b>
<p>
In response to an August 25 Wisconsin State Supreme Court injunction halting the expansion of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (MPCP) to include religious, independent, and newly founded schools, private citizens in Wisconsin donated more than $1.8 million as of September 22 to help give the children of Milwaukee the right to stay in the schools of their choice. The campaign was led by Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE), Milwaukee's privately funded scholarship program. Of the $1.8 million raised for the fund, $1 million came from the Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee and $125,000 was donated by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.
<p>
The Court's August 25 ruling put a stop to the Milwaukee choice expansion program and left more than 2,300 children stranded after they had already signed up for classes in the religious schools of their choice. The state and local teachers' unions, along with the ACLU, backed the lawsuit which resulted in the temporary injunction.
<p>
The case is to be heard soon by the Wisconsin State Supreme Court, and a decision is expected before the end of the year. According to the Landmark Legal Foundation of Kansas City, Missouri, which is providing legal support for the children, "the Milwaukee school choice litigation will ultimately result in a major U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing school choice programs that include religious programs."
<p>
<i>Copies of the July 1995 Wisconsin statutes enabling the expansion of Milwaukee's Parental Choice Program to include religious schools and the affidavits filed recently in the Wisconsin Supreme Court are available from the Blum Center for Parental Freedom in Education, Marquette University, PO Box 1881, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-1881.</i>
<p>
<b>HIGH MARKS FOR WISCONSIN SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</b>
<p>
In a related development, Family Service America (FSA), the largest international non-profit association dedicated to strengthening family life through education and research, has completed its independent, third-year evaluation of the Partners Advancing Values in Education scholarship program in Milwaukee.
<p>
PAVE is the nation's largest privately funded school choice program. Its design closely resembles Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson's recently expanded Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, which is publicly funded. In the 1994 school year, PAVE provided scholarships to 2,654 low-income students who attended 84 elementary and 13 secondary private or parochial schools in Milwaukee.
<p>
FSA's first-year evaluation of the program reported high levels of parent satisfaction (96 percent) and involvement (97 percent) among the 960 (63 percent) families who completed a survey. The second-year evaluation investigated seventh graders' academic achievement and reported that PAVE students scored higher in reading and math than did representative samples from Milwaukee public schools.
<p>
The purpose of the third-year evaluation was to determine whether parental satisfaction and involvement were consistent over the three years of PAVE's scholarship program for low-income families in Milwaukee.
<p>
<b>Findings of the third-year evaluation:</b>
<p>
"The overwhelming majority of parents were satisfied with the performance of the schools."  The responses indicated the following levels of satisfaction:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>96 percent</b> with the teacher's performance,
<li><b>94 percent</b> with the principal's performance,
<li><b>92 percent</b> with the discipline of the school,
<li><b>97 percent</b> with the program of instruction,
<li><b>96 percent</b> with textbooks,
<li><b>96 percent</b> with amount child learned,
<li><b>97 percent</b> with opportunities for parental involvement, and 
<li><b>97 percent</b> with school location.
</ul><P>
Some 92 percent of respondents rated their school "A" or "B."  Almost twice as many parents in each category were "very satisfied" rather than "satisfied."  And according to the study, parents became significantly involved in the schools of their choice:  96 percent attended parent-teacher conferences.

<b>WASHINGTON UPDATE</b>
<p>
<b>AmeriCorps</b>
<p>
Backed by an unfavorable report from the General Accounting Office (GAO), the nonpartisan investigative arm of the national legislature, Congress is trying to end what critics call one of the federal government's largest boondoggles:  AmeriCorps, President Clinton's national service program. The House took the first step by voting to end funding for this high-priced program. The Senate, in  a 52 to 47 vote, followed suit on September 26. If enacted as part of the budget, this change would save the American taxpayers $575 million in FY 1996.
<p>
While the Clinton Administration and its supporters hail AmeriCorps as an innovative effort to expand educational opportunity through volunteerism, opponents say it has evolved into a big-government, pork-barrel project.
<p>
The August GAO report found that the new Clinton program cost $26,654 per participant to run, or more than 40 percent higher than the Administration's most recent estimates. Some 93 percent of the funding for the program comes out of taxpayers' pockets.
<p>
Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) argues that in an era of budget deficits, the Administration was asking the American taxpayer to fund bureaucracies and paperwork while forcing the Congress to look elsewhere for cuts. Grassley also claims that the program does little to help American families pay for college, destroys the spirit of volunteerism, and removes participants from the local communities where they are needed most. Indications that AmeriCorps improperly funds political activities sealed the program's fate in the Senate's debate.

<b>Direct Lending</b>
<p>
Congress is debating the future of President Clinton's direct lending program for student loans.
<p>
While the Clinton Administration has portrayed its direct lending program for college students as essential to the educational future of young Americans, the evidence suggests otherwise. The direct government lending program appears to be bad for taxpayers, bad for students, and bad for schools. 
<p>
The Senate has recommended an appropriation of $378 million for FY 1996. While this is $94.4 million more than the 1995 amount, it is $172 million less than the Administration's request. This has the effect of capping the program at 20 percent. The House has voted to zero out the program.
<P>
<b>Question of Cost.</b> Much of the congressional debate over direct loans turns on the crucial question of cost:  Replacing guaranteed loans with direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. When the direct loan program was enacted in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) initially estimated it could save $4.3 billion over five years. But this estimate ignored the long-term costs. The FY 1996 budget resolution amends the Credit Reform Act to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of the direct loan program. 
<p>
A revised CBO report, released in July and based on changes in official budget scoring, projects that a fully implemented direct loan program would save only $115 million over the next seven years. Indeed, according to the CBO, eliminating the direct loan program entirely while maintaining a guaranteed loan program would save $1.5 billion in budget outlays over the next seven years. According to Representative Bill Goodling (R-PA), the guaranteed loan program is "one of the most successful" public-private sector partnerships.
<p>
The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided through private institutions. But under the Clinton plan, the federal government would borrow the money needed to provide capital for the loans. This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each year. According to Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK), a complete shift to direct loans could add up to $348 billion to the national debt by the year 2014.
<p>
<b>Army of New Employees.</b> The U.S. Department of Education is expanding to handle the new program. The agency is hiring 600 new employees to administer the Clinton program and anticipates needing another 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational -- if Congress changes its mind and funds the program.
<p>
There are other worries about the direct lending program. Currently, some 75 percent of all available college financial aid comes from the federal government. If the federal government takes complete control of the loan program, colleges and universities in effect will become dependent on a single lender to support their students. The Department's power to control loan revenue, along with its expanded regulatory authority and enforcement power, will give the government vast influence over post-secondary education. Such financial power could provide the federal government an opportunity to influence or force curriculum changes, or to mandate such things as politically correct "diversity standards."
<p>
Today's guaranteed loan program is by no means perfect. Taxpayers still bear all the risk. But there have been several recent improvements in the program. For example, the loan application process has become simpler in recent years. The default rate also has been cut significantly.
<p>
There is little support for a government takeover of the guaranteed lending program. According to a nationwide poll of 1,000 respondents, 72 percent of Americans believe student loans should continue to be offered through private financial institutions, not the federal government. Congress would better serve both the students and the universities of America by eliminating the direct lending program and allowing the more economical and guaranteed lending program to provide the money to students.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Clinton Administration has portrayed its direct lending program for college students as essential to the educational future of young Americans. Nothing could be further from the truth. The direct government lending program is bad for taxpayers, bad for students, and bad for schools. Later this week, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee will consider the statutory changes necessary to achieve the spending targets for the 1996 federal education budget. They could expand, cap, or eliminate the Clinton direct lending program. The best choice for taxpayers, students, and schools would be to end it.
<p>

<b>STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
The primary source of student financial aid in America is federally guaranteed student loans. Since it was created in 1965, this program, now known as the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL), has funded 74 million student loans worth over $180 billion.1  More than six million loans totaling nearly $22 billion were disbursed in FY 1994 alone.2  Private lenders provide the capital for the loans, and private and state guarantor agencies process them. The federal government subsidizes the interest rate, guarantees the loans in cases of default, and exercises regulatory authority over the program. This relationship, while by no means perfect, has worked relatively well in providing loans to millions of American college and university students.3<p>In 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed replacing this program with direct lending by the federal government, extending a limited pilot program approved in the 1992 Higher Education Act. The Administration claimed this would be more efficient. While schools would administer the program, the federal government would borrow the money necessary to provide capital for the loans and would service and collect the loans itself. This plan would radically change the federal government's three-decade involvement in college lending programs by effecting what Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) called "a total federal takeover of a successful public-private sector partnership."4<p>Congress initially rejected a full direct lending program, but approved a trial phase-in over at least five years:  5 percent of loan volume in 1994-1995, 40 percent in 1995-1996, 50 percent or more in 1996-1998, and 60 percent or more in 1998-1999. The U.S. Department of Education in July 1994 began making direct loans to 104 schools, representing 5 percent of the loan volume. In a sign that schools are hesitating to participate, the 1995-1996 loan volume will end up at around 28.7 percent -- far short of the 40 percent target.5  The Administration hopes to accelerate the program to reach 100 pe
rcent participation in 1997-1998, and is willing to require colleges and universities -- including those that object to the program -- to participate.6<p><b>BAD ECONOMICS</b><p>Much of the debate over direct loans turns on the question of cost:  Replacing guaranteed loans with direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. The FY 1996 Clinton budget claims $4.1 billion in savings over the 1996-2000 period if the direct loan program is fully implemented.7  Recent cost estimates tell a very different story.<p><b>Eliminating the direct loan program saves money.</b> Prior to 1990, the long-term financing and administrative costs of all student loans were ignored in budget scoring, and direct loan capital outlays were considered current year expenditures. This problem was corrected with the Credit Reform Act of 1990, which required calculation of these long-term costs for guaranteed loans but not for direct loans. When the direct loan program was enacted in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office initially estimated the program could save $4.3 billion over five years.8  This estimate ignored the long-term costs of direct loans in accordance with the Credit Reform Act. The 1996 Budget Resolution, however, amended the Credit Reform Act to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of the direct loan program. The revised report of the Congressional Budget Office, released in July and based on these changes in official budget scoring, projects that a fully implemented direct loan program would save just $115 million over the next seven years. Indeed, according to the CBO, eliminating the direct loan program and maintaining the guaranteed program would save $1.5 billion in budget outlays over the next seven years.9<p><b>The direct loan program adds considerably to the national debt.</b> The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided by private sources. But under the Clinton plan, the federal government would borrow the money necessary to provide capital for the loan
s. This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each year to provide enough capital for the program. According the Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK) in congressional testimony last spring, a complete shift to direct loans could add $348 billion to the national debt by the year 2014.10  Two independent analyses in 1993, conducted by leading accounting firms, argued that such amounts of government borrowing could increase interest rates on the public debt. One noted that this would "wipe out the saving claimed for direct lending" and warned lawmakers that they "may be on the verge of making a serious public policy mistake" if they shifted to direct lending.11<p>Furthermore, the direct loan program is fiscally irresponsible. A key feature of the Clinton direct loan program is the "income contingent repayment plan" for students. The goal of this plan is to reduce the debt repayment burden on graduates struggling with repayment, thereby also reducing the rate of loan defaults. Instead of a regular monthly installment, repayment is contingent on future income. Students choosing this option, however, could well end up increasing their personal debt by stretching out their repayment period and actually increasing the principal on the loan. Nor will this help the default problem. According to the Congressional Research Service, "direct lending is largely irrelevant as a means of reducing [default] costs" and "may well increase default costs."12  If borrowers stretch out their repayments to 25 years, as encouraged by the income contingent repayment plan, the accumulated debt will simply be forgiven. Loan defaults would be permitted and assumed by the government.<p><b>BAD EDUCATION POLICY</b>
<p>
Direct lending centralizes control of student loans within the U.S. Department of Education. The Department is hiring 600 new employees to administer the program and anticipates 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational. The government already is funding this expansion with an unencumbered $2.5 billion authorization. This not only builds a new government bureaucracy, but also creates the potential for vast inefficiencies and unconstrained program costs. 
<p>
The Department of Education is notoriously disorganized and mismanaged. It has proven that it cannot manage the existing student aid program,13 and already is having problems dealing with the current small-scale direct lending program. Among other things, students are experiencing delays and complicated paperwork.14  In 1994 the Department of Education gave out $700 million in direct loans but was unable to account for some $100 million.15  The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, created by Congress as an independent advisory body on student aid, concludes in a recent study that the direct loan program is "potentially exposed to multiple loans, overawards, loans to ineligible students, and excessive cash drawdowns" and, in general, cannot "ensure program integrity."16 <p>The Administration has proposed turning to another bureaucracy to solve the problem of loan collection:  the Internal Revenue Service. A joint study by the Education and Treasury Departments, however, concludes that "it is not feasible to expand the participation of the IRS in the collection of student loans."  IRS involvement in loan collection would "strain IRS resources, interfere with its primary mission, and decrease higher dollar tax collections, without improving student loan program administration or customer service."17  Without the IRS, however, the burden falls back on the Department of Education.<p>There are precedents for failure with direct loans. In the early 1970s, Congress experimented with direct loans through the Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) program. It was poorly managed, and because the government was ineffective at collecting the loans, default rates soared above previous levels. It was phased out in 1976. Largely because of this failure, there emerged the current decentralized system that relies on private lenders and guarantors.
<p>
The direct loan program also is bad for academic freedom. Three quarters of all available college financial aid comes from the federal government.18  If the government takes over the loan program, colleges and universities will become dependent on a single lender to support their students. Its power to control loan revenue, together with its regulatory authority and enforcement power, will give the government vast influence over post-secondary education. The very possibility that the federal government might use this new authority to force curriculum changes or mandate racial preferences should breed caution. This is no farfetched theory; it is the very question settled in favor of the government in the 1984 Supreme Court case of <i>Grove City College v. Bell</i>.19  There currently are efforts to centralize further the college accreditation process (which allows a college's students to be eligible for financial aid in the first place) as a way of enforcing nationwide multicultural education standards.20  One can only imagine the temptations presented to some education reformers if the power of accreditation is combined with government control over student loan money. If recent history is any guide, further government intrusion can only harm college and university education.21 <p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>The existing guaranteed loan program is not perfect. Taxpayers bear all the risk, and schools, students, and lenders should bear greater responsibility. The system must be based on genuine risk sharing that minimizes government costs without destabilizing the current loan program. At the same time, recent improvements in the program should not be overlooked. The loan application process has become simpler in recent years, and the default rate has declined significantly. All of these improvements would be even greater if some of the streamlining ideas in the direct lending program were applied to the guaranteed loan program.
<p>
The solution is not to nationalize the multi-billion-dollar student loan program. That would mean new costs and bureaucracy. Moreover, Americans believe strongly that student loans should continue to be provided through private financial institutions, not the federal government.22 <p>Nor is the solution to maintain the program at some arbitrary level. This only postpones the final program decision, validates the creation of a new education bureaucracy, and delays the reforms needed to strengthen and improve funding prospects for America's educational future.23 <p>The only prudent and fiscally responsible answer is to eliminate the program.<p><b>Endnotes:</b><p><ol><li>For a review of the loan programs and ways to reform them, see Scott A.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
As the Senate considers the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill, it must consider funding for AmeriCorps, President Clinton's national service program. The House already has voted to end funding for this program. While it is hailed by the Administration and its supporters as an innovative effort to expand educational opportunity through volunteerism, it actually has evolved into a big-government, pork-barrel project. In an era of budget deficits, the Administration is asking the American taxpayer to support a program that funds bureaucracies and paperwork while forcing the Congress to look elsewhere for cuts in order to fund the President's pet program. 
<p>
Although supporters maintain that AmeriCorps is a successful "program that encourages Americans to do volunteer work, helps people go to college and disperses decision-making power from Washington to the states,"1 the rhetoric contrasts sharply with reality. The Senate should follow the bold lead of the House of Representatives and terminate AmeriCorps because it:
<p><ul>
<li>Does little to help American families pay for college;

<li>Destroys the spirit of volunteerism;

<li>Removes participants from local communities where they are needed and uses them to enlarge the federal bureaucracy; 

<li>Improperly funds partisan political activities; and

<li>Costs the taxpayers too much.
</ul>
<p>
FAILING TO HELP AMERICAN FAMILIES PAY FOR COLLEGE
<p>
AmeriCorps does little to help working families pay for college and fails to accomplish its stated goal of "expanding educational opportunity."2  The program's eligibility criteria allow any individual, regardless of income, to qualify for its benefits. For example, President Clinton's daughter Chelsea could receive the same educational award voucher as more needy participants and could be selected over youth from families who need help to meet the rising cost of post-secondary education. The only requirements are the following:3
<p><ul>
<li>Participants must be citizens or legal resident aliens aged seventeen or older at the commencement of service in many cases.

<li>Participants may serve before, during, or after post-secondary education.

<li>Participants must have a high school degree to receive education vouchers.4</ul><p>Thus, the children of wealthy and influential people can elbow out poor students. As Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) has noted, for every one AmeriCorps participant (who may or may not need financial assistance) who receives college benefits, many more needy students could qualify for Pell Grants.5<p>	Chart 1 indicates that if the federal government took one AmeriCorps award of $26,700, and converted it into a means-tested program, it could provide approximately 18 students with college Pell Grants for each AmeriCorps participant. If the President's goal is to help those who need funding for higher education, means-tested programs would provide more opportunity to more people.<p>UNDERMINING THE SPIRIT OF VOLUNTEERISM
<p>
The generosity of AmeriCorps' benefits also sends a mixed message about volunteering. Taxpayers do not need another program to do what millions of Americans already are doing. Private sector community service is thriving. There are numerous state and local volunteer programs that idealistic young people may join. Surveys by Independent Sector show that in 1994, 89.2 million Americans 18 and over volunteered in some capacity, for an average of 4.2 hours a week. They were not moved by the lure of a lucrative government job, but by a spirit of true volunteerism and genuine service.
<p>
	In particular, volunteer activity is flourishing among college students across the country. Campus-based volunteer student groups are expanding, and more schools are encouraging students to volunteer by broadening their regular curricula to include service jobs.6 The federal Commission on National and Community Service is calling on schools and colleges to encourage more students to perform volunteer work,7 but almost every college and university in the United States already gives students opportunities to earn school credit for participating in community service activities. For example, Rutgers University, the site chosen by President Clinton to announce the AmeriCorps program, integrates community service into the undergraduate curriculum, through its Civic Education and Community Service Program. The course work includes a combination of traditional academic disciplines related to volunteer services performed in the communities that are home to Rutgers campuses.8<p>	Similarly, Loyola University in Chicago features programs designed to inspire students to help alleviate Chicago's urban blight. It sponsors partnerships with area schools and a community policing project for criminal justice and sociology students. Other academic programs attract students to service-oriented careers, such as social work and nursing.9<p>	Even Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., the private school attended by Chelsea Clinton, requires community service. There are student work programs and voluntary service projects on and off campus for all grades, mandatory service projects for ninth-graders, and 30 hours of off-campus community service required for graduation, according to a Sidwell brochure.
<p>
	By providing payment for "volunteering," however, AmeriCorps weakens the spirit of volunteerism and undermines efforts to promote true community service. Moreover, AmeriCorps creates a huge bureaucracy to do what 51.1 percent of Americans over the age of 18 already do.10 As Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) has noted, " [With] federal bureaucrats involved, you need a federal bureaucracy to write the grant announcement, a federal bureaucrat to oversee and review the grant applications, another federal bureaucrat to issue the grant, then you need a state bureaucrat to write the grant, a state bureaucrat to establish a `dialogue' with the local communities, and you will need several staff at the local level to make sure that they are complying with all the guidelines and red tape required by the federal government."11  AmeriCorps embodies all of the principles of enlarging rather than reinventing government.<p>	AmeriCorps further corrupts and undermines true volunteerism by encouraging successful, independent, local volunteer organizations to become dependent upon federal funding. AmeriCorps makes participating programs look to the federal bureaucracy for money and solutions to the problems in their backyards rather than take the initiative to solve community problems themselves.
<p>

ENLARGING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY
<p>
In 1993-1994, AmeriCorps employed about 20,000 "volunteers" described as "working all over America, helping people -- person to person."12  In reality, a significant number of these highly paid "volunteers" are working in federal or state bureaucracies, government-funded programs, or political action organizations. Of the 20,000 "volunteers" currently participating in the program, 2,053 are working inside the federal bureaucracies on programs funded by the federal government. Chart 2 presents a breakdown of AmeriCorps participation within the federal government.
<p>

ENGAGING IN PARTISAN POLITICS
<p>
Several AmeriCorps programs have ignored the Corporation's mission statement of addressing the nation's problems through direct community service. Instead, they have engaged in advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense of the taxpayers. 
<p>
	 Section 132(a)(3) of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 clearly states that:  "any approved national service position provided to an applicant will not be used to perform service that provides a direct benefit to any... partisan political organization.... "
<P>
	But in San Francisco, the AmeriCorps "Summer of Safety" program last year organized 40 groups to rally against the federal crime bill's "three strikes and you're out" provision.13 Elsewhere, one of the biggest abusers of AmeriCorps' mission statement was a non-profit group located in Cole, Colorado, which was supposed to use its "volunteers" to help people in northeast Denver neighborhoods. Instead, according to state records, leaders of the Cole Coalition sent program participants to hand out political fliers directly attacking a local City Councilman, Hiawatha Davis. "The 'volunteers' had to draft campaign fliers and distribute them door-to-door in April and May (1995) when Davis and [Mayor Wellington] Webb were fighting for re-election."14  According to 21-year-old volunteer Joseph Taylor, "We realized there was something politically partisan. The more we began to pose a threat to blowing the whistle, the more they tried to pacify us. They kept saying... this was a great position we were in, making public officials accountable for their jobs."15  The Cole Coalition was stripped of its funding, but the example shows the potential for abuse.<p>HEAVY COST TO TAXPAYERS<p>During the debate on AmeriCorps in the 103rd Congress, several Senators made floor statements offering to eliminate the program if it proved too costly and was found to be unsuccessful. One was Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), who declared that "Congress will not, and should not, fund a program if it is unsuccessful. I do not believe it will happen but if it does I would favor cutting the program."16<p>	The General Accounting Office (GAO) has just released a report requested by Senator Grassley on the costs of the AmeriCorps program.17 Senator Grassley asked for the investigation of the costs after the 103rd Congress approved a 96 percent increase in funding that raised program spending from $217.3 million in Fiscal Year 1994 to $427.3 million in Fiscal Year 1995 (including the National Service Trust and AmeriCorps grant).18 The Administra
tion is asking the American taxpayers to pay for an expensive program that cannot provide evidence of its benefits to the taxpayer or to the local communities it is suppose to serve. Further, the Corporation for National and Community Service, which oversees AmeriCorps, is not required to evaluate the program rigorously over the long term.19<p>	The GAO report highlights important discrepancies between the Clinton Administration's estimates of how much AmeriCorps costs and the true costs. According to the GAO, the cost is approximately $26,700 per volunteer for ten months work. This estimate, as noted by the GAO, is substantially higher than the Clinton Administration's. Eli Segal, chief executive officer of AmeriCorps, stated in congressional testimony this March that the total cost, which includes all benefits and education vouchers, per "volunteer" would be no more than $18,800.20 The GAO's research, however, reveals that costs are more than 40 percent higher than the Administration's most recent estimates. The Administration now claims that the $17,600 figure was intended to represent only the federal contribution.<p>	Chart 3 summarizes GAO estimates of the cost per "volunteer."	As the GAO report clearly points out, the federal government is the primary source of funds for the program. Only 7 percent of the AmeriCorps budget comes from private sources, with the federal government responsible for 79 percent of the costs and state and local tax dollars covering 14 percent. This is the opposite of the Administration's intention when the program was created. In a February 28, 1993, <i>New York Times</i> op-ed, President Clinton stated that the program would receive its funding primarily from the private sector:
<p>
<blockquote>	While the Federal Government will provide the seed money for national service, we are determined that the participants -- the individuals who serve and the groups that sponsor their service -- will guide the process. Spending tens of millions of tax dollars to build a massive bureaucracy would be self defeating.21</blockquote><p>	The program has failed to demonstrate an ability to leverage other private sector money and is spending far more of the taxpayers' money.<p>	According to the Corporation for National Service, the total direct compensation package for an AmeriCorps "volunteer" is worth nearly $13,000 for approximately 10 months of work -- nearly $15,900 on an annual basis. This is more than the amount that 42.3 percent of young householders, ages 15-24, take home as pay on an annual basis.22 Moreover, AmeriCorps "volunteers" have a greater opportunity to obtain additional benefits and grants than many workers in the private sector, including those with secondary degrees and years of work experience. For instance, each "volunteer" is paid a $7,400 cash stipend along with a $4,725 tuition credit. In addition, the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, the legislation which created AmeriCorps, allows states and service organizations to supplement the federal compensation package. These "volunteers" can be paid up to twice the minimum wage, or $8.50 per hour, and still be eligible for the $4,725 education credit and free medical and child care benefits.
<p>
	Although the average AmeriCorps "volunteer" receives approximately $13,000 in benefits, the GAO found that the total average cost per "volunteer" is nearly $27,000. Therefore, more than half of the cost is going to bureaucracy and overhead -- not even to the young people participating. For instance, the Navy's Seaborne Conservation Corps costs $66,715 per "volunteer" and $49.06 per hour of direct service; the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps costs $42,758 per participant and $31.44 per hour of direct service; and Magic Me of Baltimore, Maryland, costs $49,652 per participant and $36.51 per hour of direct service.23<p>	Surprisingly, in a recent editorial, <i>Washington Post</i> journalist E.J. Dionne, Jr., suggested that AmeriCorps should continue because "government agencies can accomplish useful things at a low price."24  But AmeriCorps is not low cost, and it is still a mere assertion of opinion that agencies are accomplishing useful things. Regardless of where the resources come from, "volunteers" are compensated better than many young adults in the private sector.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>In proposing the AmeriCorps program, President Clinton declared that "National service will be America at its best -- building community, offering opportunity, and rewarding responsibility. National service is a challenge for Americans from every background and way of life, and it values something far more than money."25  The President's rhetoric is appealing. However, despite a $1.7 million public relations budget, the laudable goals of AmeriCorps do not match its reality. AmeriCorps sounds good on paper, but it is nothing more than an expensive and largely bureaucratic government jobs program. It does little to promote the true spirit of volunteerism and lacks any means-testing assurances that its financial rewards actually will go to those most in need of college assistance. 
<p>
	 Congress should repeal the AmeriCorps program.

<P>Americans want a clean, healthy environment. They also want  a strong
economy. But environmental protection is enormously  expensive, costs jobs, and
stifles economic opportunity. On the  other hand, before government stepped in,
robust economic activity  such as manufacturing led to a deteriorating and
unhealthy  environment. The challenge is how to achieve both a strong economy 
and a healthy environment. After all, what Americans actually want  is a high
overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Three decades ago, as people perceived that their quality of  life was
beginning to deteriorate, they began to support  aggressive policies to reduce
pollution. These policies frequently failed to  live up to their sponsors'
claims; they also became increasingly  and unnecessarily expensive. But the
environment did improve,  especially in the early years. Now, however, Americans
are  becoming aware that many of these policies are unreasonable and that,  even
when they work, they result only in small improvements at a  heavy cost in jobs
and freedom. Americans also are beginning to  recognize that there often is no
sound scientific basis for assertions  of environmental harm or risk to the
public. The pendulum  finally has begun to swing the other way.

<P>Conservatives, like Americans generally, have no wish to return  to the days
of black smoke billowing out of smokestacks. But they  do believe common sense
can be brought to bear in dealing with  the environment: that it is possible to
protect the environment  without sacrificing the freedoms for which America
stands.  Conservative candidates and legislators therefore should stress the 
following themes:
</P>

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Examples of regulatory abuse.</B> It is important to show
that  &quot;good intentions&quot; often are accompanied by oppressive, senseless

conserving  or efficiently using  natural resources is not in dispute.  The

<P>While pollution levels have fallen dramatically since 1970,  most reductions
were achieved early and at relatively low cost.  From 1970 to 1990, total
emission levels fell 33.8 percent. Over  the same period, lead levels in the air
fell 96.5 percent, and  carbon monoxide levels in the air fell 40.7 percent. But
reductions  have slowed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As recently as 1985, the annual cost of environmental  protection was $82
billion. Since then, it has more than doubled to $171  billion, while
environmental gains have slowed to a trickle. The  estimated $171 billion spent
in 1995 represents about 3 percent  of America's gross domestic product (GDP).
Put another way,  these poorly crafted environmental regulations cost each 
American household almost $1,800 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The pattern is consistent: What economists call the marginal  rate of return
on investment falls dramatically as government runs  out of easy fixes and then
attempts to eke out minuscule  improvements in the environment at skyrocketing
extra cost. The resulting  drain on the economy is both enormous and
unnecessary.

unintended consequences for  businesses  especially small businesses, which are

<P>Regulatory abuses like these usually are a direct result of the  way
government bureaucracies attack environmental problems.  Typically, these
agencies regulate without regard to the cost  imposed on individuals and
businesses. Yet it makes no sense to issue  a regulation for which the burden
far outweighs any benefit  that might be conferred. In fact, it often is unclear
whether there will  be any benefit at all because the science on which many 
regulations are based is so poor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also, instead of setting realistic performance standards and  giving
businesses the freedom to develop innovative ways of  meeting them, agencies
typically rely on inflexible  command-and-control regulations that, for example,
specify what technologies  companies must use. Since businesses differ in their
operating  structures, this one-size-fits-all approach rarely leads to
cost-effective  solutions compared to more flexible and dependable performance 
standards. Moreover, by eliminating the incentive for companies  to seek out
these cost-effective solutions, it stifles innovative  technologies or
techniques that reduce costs. In the end, of course,  the consumer is the one
who pays.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the most troublesome aspect of current  environmental policy is the
fact that bureaucrats and liberal lawmakers  generally consider regulation the
only option. Creative solutions shown to  be less expensive, more effective, and
more respectful of human  liberty are rejected out of hand. Instead of setting
up a system of  incentives to lure businesses into operating with environmental 
impact in mind, the system relies on punishment regardless  of whether this
accomplishes the desired goal or creates  unintended consequences.

<P><B>Rejecting Property Rights</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Regulations have become increasingly unfair. The  Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), Department of the Interior (DOI),  Army Corps of Engineers, and
other federal agencies operate on  the premise that property should be used to
satisfy government's  needs and objectives without regard to who owns the
property or the  financial burden imposed on them. It is this mentality that 
leads government reflexively to reject the creative solutions advanced  by
free-market advocates, including incentive-based approaches  to protecting
endangered species. By ignoring property rights,  establishment
environmentalists, bureaucrats, and liberal legislators  also ignore the
benefits to be derived from free trade and free markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most unfair and burdensome hardship inflicted by  government &quot;regulatory
takings&quot; is that property owners are not  compensated for their losses. For
instance, if an elderly husband and wife  spend a large portion of their
retirement savings to buy land on which  to build their dream home and that land
subsequently is designated  a wetland, they lose the value of their property as
well as their  savings. They are stuck with property they cannot use and the 
government does nothing to reimburse them for their loss.  Unfortunately, tales
of financial hardship caused by government designation  of land as wetland or
endangered-species habitat have become  common. For instance:

farm family may lose its life savings. The government,  however,

so-called wetland is a bone-dry hillside which almost never  collects water.
Says Reverend Murray Southwell of the Freewill  Baptists, &quot;this obvious
misinterpretation of wetland law made it  necessary for us to purchase an

he might disturb: $93,950 per snake. Says Oates, in an  age of &quot;depleted

<P>Hundreds of such stories have surfaced over the past few  years, and many
analysts suspect that far more are never made  public. According to Bob Adams,
Project Director for Environmental  and Regulatory Affairs at the National
Center for Public Policy  Research, &quot;the stories we have compiled are just
the tip of the  iceberg, but many people are simply too scared to come forward 
or feel powerless against the government.&quot; <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>Ironically, federal agencies and the Clinton Administration  argue that it
would cost too much money to compensate  landowners. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  Leon Panetta, then Director of the
Office of Management  and Budget, told the House Committee on Public Works  and
Transportation's Subcommittee on Water Resources and the  Environment on May 26,
1994, that paying compensation for  wetlands regulation would be &quot;an
unnecessary and unwise use of  taxpayer dollars&quot; and a drain on the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Property owners counter that regulatory takings are a drain on  the family
budget. Nancie Marzulla, President of Defenders of  Property Rights, points out
that &quot;what people don't realize is that  these landowners typically are not
wealthy and powerful  corporations, but normal Americans  schoolteachers and
elderly couples   whose lives are destroyed by stretched interpretations of a 
single environmental law.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#8">8</A></B></TT>
 Moreover, the federal government  already owns about one out of every three
acres in the country (with  even more owned by state and local governments).
<A HREF="ftnt4.htm#9">9</A>  If the federal  government can
afford to maintain one-third of the nation's land,  it should be able to pay
landowners for regulatory confiscation  of their property. If not, maybe it
should consider selling the  least ecologically sensitive land from its vast
holdings to pay for  the land it wants.

</P>
<P><B>Lost Opportunities, Lost Lives</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ask the average American how much a human life is worth,  and the answer
likely will be that &quot;no amount is too much.&quot;  This  is how Congress
and federal agencies justify imposing  sometimes staggering costs on businesses
to reduce the risks of death by  infinitesimal amounts. What policymakers fail
to understand is  that wasting resources in this way means not being able to use
them  in other ways that might well produce better results and save  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  more lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If lawmakers ever did consider which environmental policies  actually save
the most lives, they would scrap many existing  rules, freeing up resources to
be used in other ways. This  commonsense approach would lead to regulation that
is very different, in  its scope and fundamental assumptions, from that which 
burdens America today. In fact, as the following charts illustrate, if  the
private resources used to comply with federal mandates were to  be left with the
industries or individuals concerned, or used in  other ways in the local
economy, in many cases Americans would  benefit more, and far more lives would
be saved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ill-conceived environmental regulations designed to  &quot;protect&quot;
people may even cause deaths. The best example is the set of  Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, intended to  conserve energy and encourage lower
oil prices. The only way  auto makers can meet the CAFE standards is by building
lighter  cars. Unfortunately for drivers and passengers, however, lighter cars 
are less able to withstand the impact of crashes. The result: more  highway
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution and John Graham  of the Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis have found that 2,500  highway deaths should be
expected as a result of CAFE's impact  on the weight of cars made in the 1989
model year  alone. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#10">10</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some environmental regulations may cause deaths indirectly.  Statistical
analyses have shown that for every $7.5 million in costs  the government imposes
on the economy, lower overall living  standards cause one additional statistical
 death. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#11">11</A></B></TT>  When
this formula 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  is used to compare the number of
lives &quot;saved&quot; by a  particular environmental regulation with the
number lost through lower  living standards, it becomes obvious that many
regulations  actually increase the death toll. For example:

<P><B>What America Thinks About the Environment</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When asked by the media, pollsters, or politicians, Americans  routinely
answer that they want a clean and healthy environment.  Indeed, the majority of
Americans consider themselves  &quot;environmentalists.&quot;  This does not
translate, however, into automatic  acceptance of the environmental lobby's
agenda. Conservative  candidates need to make this clear to discourage voters
from  supporting policies they do not believe in simply because they are 
portrayed as &quot;pro-environment.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The dichotomy in public opinion shows up in polling data.  When respondents
are asked general or theoretical questions that  involve little personal
sacrifice, or that do not identify those  burdened, government intervention
fares well. In one poll, for instance,  60 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  percent of respondents agreed
that we must protect the  environment even if it costs jobs in the  community.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#13">13</A></B></TT>  In another,
72 percent of respondents said they would pay somewhat higher taxes  if the
money was used to protect the environment and prevent  water and air pollution.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#14">14</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the other hand, when respondents are asked questions that  are more
specific, that involve greater sacrifice, or that identify  the people losing
jobs, government intervention is less popular.  When respondents are asked to
pay much higher taxes to protect the  environment, support drops by almost half.
By the same token,  only one-third would be willing to accept cuts in their
standard of  living. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#15">15</A></B></TT>
 When asked to pick between spotted owls and  Northwest workers who stand to
lose their jobs because of efforts to  protect the owls, respondents choose jobs
by a margin of 3 to  2. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#16">16</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More Americans than not believe that environmental  organizations are too
extreme  a perception that is partially responsible for  recent significant
declines in membership among these groups.  Perhaps the most consistent finding
is that Americans think EPA  is doing a poor job: More than two-thirds think the
country gets  poor value for its investment in environmental  protection. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#17">17</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the most refreshing change in attitudes in recent years  is the
recognition that the country can have economic growth  and environmental
protection simultaneously. Vice President Al  Gore has made the point that
economic growth and environmental  protection are not incompatible. This is
true, but only if  America's environmental laws are structured correctly to
encourage  responsible behavior as part of the business decision-making 
process. Gore advocates stringent command-and-control regulations  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  are inconsistent with growth and
lead to little real gains in  environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Whenever this question comes up, Americans must be told  that the way to
promote both environmental protection and  economic growth is to allow them to
work hand in hand. The  government must stop regarding them as mutually
exclusive and stop  pitting economic freedom against the environment. Laws must
be  based on, and work with, a free market. Only then can Americans  maximize
their economic and environmental quality of life.
</P>
<P>The Need for Common Sense 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given Americans' ambivalence on the question of  environmental protection,
it is all the more important for conservatives to  approach the issue in a
commonsense way. People must  understand that environmental protection need not
come at the expense  of jobs, but will cost jobs if the socialist model of
centralized  control for protecting the environment is not set aside. It doesn't
 work. Rather, the country should adopt a reasonable, commonsense  approach to
environmental protection that is based on:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Freedom with Responsibility.</B> Conservatives
traditionally  have stressed economic growth while ignoring the importance of 
environmental problems. Thus, they have fought  environmentalists step by step
and have lost step by step. The reason, while  unpleasant, is not complicated.
Environmentalists have had the moral  high ground, even though they typically
have not provided the  most beneficial solutions. In short, conservatives have
been on  the wrong side of an emotional issue. <TT><B><A

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First,</B> leftists and the public at large understand that
 publicly owned goods, free of constraints on usage, will be depleted  over
time. Garrett Hardin, Professor Emeritus of Human Ecology at  the University of
California, in his seminal 1968 work 
<I>The Tragedy of the Commons</I> showed that when a good is publicly owned, 
or &quot;owned&quot; in common, no one has an incentive to conserve or  to
manage it. In fact, there is a perverse incentive to use the  good inefficiently
 to deplete it. This fact is at the heart of most  environmental problems, such
as air and water pollution and  species extinction.

</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> if there are incentives to conserve resources, people  will

 will provide them voluntarily,  without coercion.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>When it came to certain resources like air and water,  conservatives tended
to ignore the first lesson, and consequently lost the  opportunity to implement
the second. In this one area, conservatives  have been inconsistent with the
principles that define their  movement: that decisions should be left to
individuals who are accountable  for their actions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>&quot;Freedom with responsibility for one's actions&quot; should be the 
conservative message. Responsibility restrains wasteful  behavior. Ironically,
the old environmentalist slogan &quot;Make the  polluter pay&quot; is consistent
with this message. But when they say this,  conservatives and liberals mean
different things. As Al Cobb,  then Director of Environment and Energy at the
National Policy  Forum, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  has said, &quot;What the
environmental lobby means by that phrase  is that corporate polluters should be
punished severely for any  pollution whatsoever. What conservatives mean,
however, is that  polluters should bear the full cost of environmental
degradation,  but no more.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#19">19</A></B></TT>  At the same time,
individuals and corporations  also should be rewarded for conservation and other
 environmentally sound practices.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Conservation Through Property Rights.</B> The free
market  reflects the conservation ethic better than any command-and-control 
regulation from Washington. A free market can occur, however,  only when private
citizens engage in trade, and people can trade  only what they own: some form of
property. Thus, property is the  cornerstone of a free market. If property
rights are insecure or  publicly owned, a market cannot function effectively.
Some  critics misleadingly call this &quot;market failure,&quot; but it is
really a failure  to use markets and their main engine: property rights. As a 
result, both environmental protection and personal liberty suffer. A  resource
that is not owned will deteriorate or be depleted  because neither protection of
nor damage to that resource is part of  the individual's usual decision-making
process. Others, however,  are still forced to bear the consequences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should concentrate on explaining the  innovative
ways in which property rights can be used to protect  the environment. The most
efficient method  and the most  protective of individual rights and freedoms  is
to enlist self-interest in  the service of environmental protection.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     In the decade from 1979-1989, East
and Central African  elephant herd populations dropped from more than 1 million
to less  than half that. Yet, in Zimbabwe, elephant herds have increased 
dramatically. The difference is that hunting in Zimbabwe is  permitted as a
property right. Small villages that own the land on which  elephants live and
graze charge safari operators to conduct  hunts. Since the villages profit
directly, they have an incentive to  promote herd growth to increase their
income. In surrounding  African countries, government bureaucrats seem unable to
curb  incessant poaching; in Zimbabwe, however, villagers are constantly on  the
lookout for poachers because poaching means lost income.  Zimbabwe and a few
other countries reward the conservation of  elephants by allowing the
conservationists themselves to profit  from their protective behavior. In each
country that has adopted  this approach, herd sizes are increasing.

fishing has  burgeoned in recent decades. Property rights to fishing sites have

purchase fishing rights  access. <B><TT><A

Owners of fishing rights on  various stretches of the rivers charge others for
the right to fish. These  rivers are not overfished because it is not in the
owner's best  interest to allow the fish population to be depleted. Because he
wants  to continue charging fishermen for the foreseeable future, the  owner
conserves his fish stock, allowing them to reproduce, and  prevents pollution
from entering his stretch of the river. If a  municipality pollutes the water
upstream, the owner of the fishing rights can  sue

shown the  power of property rights to achieve environmental goals. Ducks 
Unlimited, a group consisting of hunters and non-hunters alike, is  dedicated to
enhancing duck populations. To do this, it has  purchased property or
conservation easements with privately raised  funds. Unlike other groups (for
example, the National Wildlife  Federation) that began as organizations of
hunters and outdoorsmen  but later lost much of their original focus and joined
forces with  the more extreme elements of the environmental lobby, Ducks

restored or created about 50,000 acres  of wetlands. <TT><B><A

itself pays for the habitat  it protects, in many ways it embodies the essence

this has been interpreted as protection  primarily against the physical taking

by chlorofluourocarbons (CFCs), a  refrigerant. After widespread media coverage

<P>Instead of merely responding to tabloid claims or politically  motivated
studies by federal agencies and environmental  organizations trying to justify
their budgets, regulations should be based on  credible scientific findings open
to public scrutiny. For instance,  agencies should use consistent methodologies
to determine risks.  Currently, they use different methods. Thus, for example,
risk  assessments by different agencies may turn up different answers as  to
whether a chemical at a particular dose level causes cancer.  Theoretically,
exposure to some level of a chemical could be found  to be both deadly and
perfectly safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government assessments also should reveal the assumptions  and uncertainties
in their analyses. Typically, because of missing  data, most studies use certain
assumptions to estimate these  uncertainties. These assumptions, sometimes
unreasonably gloomy,  usually determine the conclusion reached. For instance,
sometimes an  estimate of the likely risk from some chemical is multiplied 
thousands, or even millions, of times just to be &quot;conservative.&quot;  Yet 
the analyses used to justify these enormously expensive  regulations often are
obscure as to their assumptions. Moreover, the  reports 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  rarely reveal the level of
uncertainty involved in arriving at  their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Whenever regulations that address risks are considered,  each agency should
be required to conduct risk assessments  if only  to aid in intelligent
decision-making  that are consistent, that  are transparent to public scrutiny,
and that fully detail their  assumptions and levels of uncertainty. Moreover,
each study should  be reviewed before a regulation is pub-lished to ensure that 
scientific guidelines are strictly followed. If federal agencies cannot  meet
even this very limited standard, it is unconscionable for them  to impose costly
standards on others.

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     The Need To Set Priorities.</B> The economy has a
limited capacity  to absorb environmental regulations. Simply put, the country 
cannot afford to eliminate every risk. Thus, there is a trade-off:  Attempting
to regulate one risk out of existence may mean that  another risk (or other
risks) will have to be tolerated. In most cases,  the cure is worse than the
disease. Misguided and excessive  regulation can cost lives, so it is critical
that regulators recognize the costs  of their actions. Spending enormous amounts
of money to  eradicate small or even hypothetical risks means that those dollars
cannot  be used in other productive ways  public or private  that might  be of
greater benefit to the nation.

regulate risks that are thousands of times safer  simply because they are less

Regulating these  less serious risks costs the economy enormous sums while 
providing little or no benefit to those supposedly being protected.

<P>This is why it is essential that policymakers develop a priority  list of
environmental problems, based on the extent of the possible  risk each appears

dollar spent.  Americans finally will get the maximum environmental &quot;bang

 Certainly the country and planet have environmental  problems that need to be

<P>

<P>The concern is that the buildup of these gases in the  atmosphere could warm
the planet more than otherwise would be the case,  and that this change could
lead to adverse changes in the world's  ecology. Some environmentalists even say
that rising sea levels  caused by melting polar caps could lead to flooding and
tidal waves  and that drought-induced crop failures could trigger global famine.

failed

<P>The reason the Act does not work is simple. As U.S. Fish  and Wildlife
official Sam Hamilton says, &quot;The incentives are all  wrong here. If I have
a rare metal on my property, its value goes up.  But if a rare bird occupies the
land, its value disappears. We've got  to turn it around to make the landowner
want to have the bird on  his property.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#37">37</A></B></TT>  Hamilton's words
illustrate why environmental  laws that do not take individual rights into
account are  counterproductive. A serious problem has developed, known as &quot;shoot,
 shovel, and shut up.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#38">38</A></B></TT>
 Landowners that find, say, a listed plant on  their property sometimes pull the
plant rather than lose their life  savings. Even when landowners take no hostile
move against  species, few have any incentive to provide what endangered species
 need 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  most: habitat. As Larry McKinney,
Director of Resource  Protection for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,
says, &quot;While  I have no hard evidence to prove it, I am convinced that more
 habitat for the black-capped vireo, and especially the  gold-cheeked warbler,
has been lost in those areas of Texas since the listing  of these birds than
would have been lost without the ESA at  all.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#39">39</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In contrast to the harmful effects from confiscatory  regulations,
encouraging the willing cooperation of landowners has led to  some striking
successes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps the most notable success story was the recovery of  the wood
duck which was rapidly headed for extinction early in  the century due to a loss
of nesting habitat and over-hunting.  Friends of the wood duck, in the best
tradition of voluntary association  and private conservation, spent the rest of
the century asking  the nation's private landowners to allow them to erect
artificial  nest boxes for the birds,&quot; says R.J. Smith, Senior 
Environmental Scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. &quot;Most 
landowners were more than willing to help. There was no downside. If  the ducks
utilized the nest boxes, the landowners would not be  prevented from using their
lands. If we had had an ESA in 1920,  the wood duck would likely be extinct
today  instead of the  second most common duck in the eastern flyway. Similar
efforts  have worked for... bluebirds, screech owls, barn owl kestrels  (sparrow
hawks), purple martins, and even prothonotary warblers [as  well as] wild
turkeys, ruffed grouse, prairie chickens, and many  species of quail.&quot;

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Numerous controversies surround ESA, such as whether it is  appropriate or
worthwhile to protect endangered sub-species that  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  almost identical genetically to
other non-endangered  sub-species. But these are side issues. As currently
enforced, ESA forces  landowners  without compensation  to surrender many of 
their property rights if listed species are found. If the incentive  problem
that pits landowners against species instead of aligning their  interests was
eliminated, the threat to species would likely become  a thing of the past. But
this would occur only if the fear of  punishment for having habitat was replaced
with the promise of  reward for providing habitat. Issues such as which species
need the  most protection could be debated dispassionately with a view to 
getting the maximum return for public funds spent to preserve these  species.
Since federal wildlife managers would be forced to  implement the most efficient
and beneficial uses of those funds,  species most needing protection would be
the most likely to benefit.

<P><B>Wetlands</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Wetlands, traditionally known as swamps or bogs, have been  disappearing at
a rapid rate during this century, primarily  because they are unique ecosystems.
They are valued by many  Americans for the very practical reason that they can
act as a buffer  against flooding and can purify streams and rivers. Others
despise  wetlands as &quot;mosquito-infested swamps,&quot; and they typically 
are breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes. While  most Americans
historically have fallen into the latter group,  increased public recognition of
the positive qualities of some wetlands  in recent decades has led to demands
for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the confusing and onerous nature of wetland  policy has made
wetland protection a politically contentious issue.  In practice, the Clean
Water Act has been used as the legislative  ve
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  hicle to restrict any disturbance
of wetlands even though  wetlands are not mentioned in the legislation. The EPA
and Army Corps  of Engineers rely on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to 
regulate landowners that wish to disturb wetland on their  property. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#41">41</A></B></TT>  There are four principal
problems with current wetland policies:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First,</B> the statutory authority itself is questionable.
Indeed, for  isolated wetland, known as &quot;non-adjacent&quot; wetland,
federal  authority seems clearly lacking. Obviously, federal agencies should not
 pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor any statute  allows them to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> the definition of what constitutes a wetland is 
unnecessarily broad. According to the 1987 Delineation Manual now in  force, a
wetland is any land that meets each of the following criteria:  It must be
inundated or saturated to 12 inches deep for at least 7  consecutive days and 5
percent of the growing season, and more  than 50 percent of the dominant plant
species found are found  in marshes and swamps regardless of whether they are
found  elsewhere as well. This language is so unnecessarily inclusive  that land
which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed  a wetland.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> the nation already has achieved the Bush-Clinton  wetland
goal of &quot;no net loss&quot; in a given year. In recent years, the nation 
has been increasing its wetland stock. In 1994, the likely net gain  was more
than 100,000 acres; the expected loss rate was 102,000  acres, while the
expected &quot;creation&quot; rate due to federal programs  was 195,000 acres.
Additionally, wetland restoration is taking place  on public land and through
strictly private initiatives. In 1994,  for example, Ducks Unlimited alone
restored or enhanced  51,260 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  acres.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> the financial resources of many Americans are being 
destroyed as owners are forced to surrender, without  compensation, their right
to use their property. Because many affected  individuals make their living or
pay their mortgages from income  derived from the land, their savings can be
wiped out.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In short, this legislation has led to often absurd results. Based  on
questionable legal authority, federal agencies can force  landowners to
sacrifice their life's savings to protect land with little  ecological value
against the now-obsolete threat of net loss of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pesticides and the Delaney Clause </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the onerous aspects of pesticide regulation is Section  409 of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, known as  the Delaney Clause, enacted in
1958 to ban any additive in  pro-cessed food that has been shown to cause cancer
in humans or  laboratory animals. The Delaney Clause seemed reasonable at the
time  because scientists could test for traces of chemicals only in  quantities
of about one in a million. Today, however, with improvements  in technology,
they can test for many of these chemicals in  quantities of less than one in a
quadrillion (a billion million). Some  chemicals can be detected almost down to
the level of a molecule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This means that extremely small trace quantities that were  undetectable 37
years ago  and thus allowable  now form the  basis for a court order requiring
EPA to eliminate dozens of  pesticides. Many of these same pesticides are
completely safe up to  certain levels, according to EPA's own findings, but the
law requires  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  they be banned. Under Section 408
of the same Act, which  relates to raw foods, EPA has issued regulations setting
the tolerance  level deemed safe for consumption. Thus, under Section 409   the
Delaney Clause  EPA will ban pesticide residues in  processed foods that it
allows and proclaims safe in raw foods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even EPA Administrator Carol Browner has called for a change  in the law: &quot;We
have gotten to a point where we have to say  we know a lot more about these
chemicals than we did 35 years  ago when the law was passed.&quot;  <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#42">42</A></B></TT>  Unfortunately, the 
environmental lobby applied severe pressure on the Clinton Administration,  and
Browner backpedaled from her position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The issue is not simply cutting costs. Pesticides are responsible  for an
explosion of food production in this country and around  the world while the
land use has remained relatively constant. As  the <a href="envir_4.gif">chart</a> below shows, if
pesticides were eliminated, the amount  of land used for agriculture to produce
the same amount of  food would triple. Moreover, pesticides are directly related
to  lower world food prices. This increases food consumption, including  the
consumption of fruits and vegetables, which in turn lowers  cancer rates. In the
words of Bruce Ames, Professor of Biochemistry  and Molecular Biology at the
University of California at Berkeley  and perhaps the world's foremost expert on
cancer risk, the best  known way to prevent cancer is to &quot;eat your 
veggies.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#43">43</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, the fact that some chemical pesticides test positive  for cancer
when huge doses are fed to test animals is not  necessarily cause for alarm.
After all, says Ames, of the 22 chemicals found  in coffee that have been tested
in animal cancer tests, &quot;17 are  carcinogens. There are 10 milligrams of
known carcinogens in a  cup 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  of coffee and that's more
carcinogens than you're likely to  get from pesticide residues in a year....
We're eating natural  pesticides, which are chemicals that plants use to try to
kill off insects that  try to eat them. And we eat roughly 1,500 milligrams of
them per  day. We eat 0.09 milligrams of synthetic pesticide residues. So  we're
talking about incredibly tiny amounts of synthetic pesticides,  and yet the same
percentage [roughly half] of natural chemicals  come out positive&quot; when
tested for cancer. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#44">44</A></B></TT>

<P><B>Superfund </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,  and Liability Act
(CERCLA), the program for cleaning up  hazardous waste sites, is up for
reauthorization. Superfund, as CERCLA  is known, not only is one of the most
complex laws now in force,  but also is widely regarded as the most wasteful and
ineffective.  Even the Clinton Administration admits the program does not  work.
Despite expenditures of between $20 billion and $30  billion, Superfund has
cleaned up only a small fraction of the  nation's worst hazardous waste sites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Superfund was enacted after widespread press attention to the  exposure of
residents to high levels of dangerous chemicals at  Love Canal near Niagara
Falls, New York. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#45">45</A></B></TT>
 Unfortunately, the  law was hurried through Congress in the final days of the
Carter  Administration, so many provisions are ill-considered. Much of  the
money has been spent not on cleanup, but on legal fees and  other &quot;transaction
costs,&quot; and while program costs have  ballooned, cleanups have proceeded
slowly. Only 291, or 24 percent, of  the 1,238 &quot;worst&quot; hazardous waste
sites  sites placed on the  National Priorities List (NPL)  have been cleaned
up. To clean up the  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  maining sites now on the NPL will
cost an estimated $40  billion. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#46">46</A></B></TT>  If the cost of cleaning
up federal facilities is added to the  equation, the total could exceed $750

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are four basic flaws in the Superfund program:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. The law as written is designed to reduce the level of 
chemicals in the ground, not to reduce risks to people.</B> Yet fully one-third 
of the sites pose only hypothetical future risks based primarily on  the
assumption that residential housing will be built, thus  exposing future
residents to these chemicals. It is utterly unrealistic to  assume any
residential housing will be built on any  untreated Superfund site; no developer
would attempt it, or get permits if  he did.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. The program's unreasonable standards require that  hazardous waste
sites be cleaned up to a pristine level no matter what  the location, resulting
in a poor return on the investment.</B> For  instance, polluted soil at
industrial park sites must be cleaned up to a  level that makes it essentially
clean enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Hazardous wastes by their very nature are local problems,  but
listings, cleanup decisions, and program authority are run by a  federal
bureaucracy.</B> If there is any federal environmental law  for which a
legitimate case can be made for devolving authority  back to the states, it is
CERCLA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. The law's retroactive, strict joint and several liability  scheme
results in endless legal battles as potentially responsible  parties (PRPs)
fight EPA, then each other, and then their insurers to  shoul
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  der the costs of cleanup.</B> It
is little wonder that the program is  derisively called the &quot;Super
scholarship fund for lawyers' children.&quot;   The liability scheme is designed
to find someone with &quot;deep  pockets&quot; to pay the cost of cleanup
regardless of how much  or  how little  that individual may have contributed to
the waste  problem. This forces individuals and small businesses to pay 
enormous sums for what most people would consider innocent acts, some  of them
committed generations ago.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>All of these characteristics drive up costs while blunting  the program's
effectiveness. Moreover, all have led to numerous  horror stories of people
caught in the Superfund liability web.  For instance:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Russ Zimmer was named a PRP for a
Superfund site at a car  battery cracking plant in Torrington, Wyoming. His
contribution  to the problem?  He sold a bag of dog food in 1977 and a bag of 
seed in 1984, and took a third-party check as payment for the  items. Since the
checks had been issued by the now-bankrupt  company that had owned the battery
cracking plant, Zimmer was sued as  a PRP by another company caught in the
Superfund liability  scheme. Zimmer decided, on advice of counsel, that he
should settle  to avoid even more in legal costs. He agreed to pay $3,500  even
though he had nothing to do with the matter.  <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The entire town of Triumph, Idaho, located just
a few miles  away from the famous ski resort town of Sun Valley, has suffered 
terribly under EPA's administration of the Superfund law. The  town, which had a
silver mine until 1957, has plenty of lead in  the ground. So the EPA put the
mine on the Superfund list, with  the highest &quot;worst&quot; Superfund score
ever  almost half again as  high 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  as the nuclear production site at
Hanford, Washington. As a  result, banks red-lined the town, and homeowners
cannot sell their  homes because banks refuse to lend on them. EPA officials
summoned  an emergency meeting at which they told the 50 families their 
children might have extremely high levels of lead in their blood.  EPA conducted
tests for lead contamination but refused to disclose  the results, so the town
did its own tests. It turns out that lead  poisoning was not a problem because
the well water in Triumph was  not contaminated. In fact, lead levels in
Triumph's water are below  the national average, well within safety limits. Now
the  townspeople are unified against the federal government's treatment of 
their community. In March 1995, a resident, Donna Rose, testified to  a House
Commerce subcommittee that EPA &quot;terrified us. They  committed atrocious
acts on our community.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#49">49</A></B></TT>
 Unfortunately for  Triumph, however, the suffering caused under Superfund 
continues. Rose, who like many of her townsfolk believes Triumph was  chosen for
designation as the worst of the worst sites because  EPA needed a trophy as
Superfund came under attack, testified  that &quot;We can't sell our houses.
We're trapped there forever until this  is resolved.&quot; <TT><B><A

<P><B>CAFE Standards </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards  were enacted in
response to the oil crisis in 1973 and were designed  to stabilize oil prices at
lower levels. Today, support for the  program comes primarily from the
environmental lobby, which sees  the standards as a way to preserve fuel, and
perhaps to drive up  the cost of autos. The program currently requires that cars
 average 27.5 mpg (miles per gallon) and that light trucks average  20.7 mpg.
Now the Clinton Administration is considering tightening  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  standards. The problem is that
this law costs both lives and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most serious problem with CAFE standards, to put it  bluntly, is that
they kill people. According to economists Robert  Crandall of the Brookings
Institution and John Graham of the  Harvard School of Public Health, 1989 model
cars are about 500  pounds lighter than they would have been without the 27.5
mpg  economy standard. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#51">51</A></B></TT>
 They estimate that this weight reduction is  responsible for 2,500 additional
deaths and 25,000 additional serious  injuries per model fleet year. This is too
high a price to pay for any  government program. Raising the standard would only
increase  the death toll. Raising standards to 40 mpg, for example, would 
likely mean another 4,800 to 8,600 deaths per  year. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#52">52</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other problem with CAFE, especially with raising the  standard, is that
it makes little economic sense. A study by  Charles Rivers Associates has found
that increasing standards would  raise the average price of cars by $1,500 and
the average price of  trucks by $2,100. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#53">53</A></B></TT>  This would lead
consumers to retain their older  autos longer, thus minimizing the very
decreases in fuel  consumption regulators hope to see and increasing pollution
by an estimated  4 percent by the year 2010 (assuming a 30 percent increase in 
the mileage standard). <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#54">54</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Finally, raising CAFE standards would be devastating to  average families.
The reason the traditional full-size family station  wagon no longer is made is
that car manufacturers found it difficult  to meet the 27.5 mpg standard with
these gas-guzzlers in their  fleets. Thus, the market for even less
fuel-efficient minivans  exploded, since they only had to meet the light truck
standard of less than  21 mpg. If standards for light trucks were raised, then 
manufacturers 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  would be forced to raise prices
dramatically to cut sales of  the minivan so their fleet average could remain in
compliance.  Thus, most families no longer could afford the only vehicle
designed  for families.

<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION

<P>
</P>
<P>Slowly, methodically, and steadily, the Clinton Administration  has been
pushing a consistently liberal environmental agenda.  The most prominent aspect
of this agenda is its high-flown  rhetoric, especially since the advent of the
104th Congress. While much  of this rhetoric has little to do with reality, the
attack has been  quite effective against a Congress that seems to lack  the
Administration's unified sense of purpose. Vice President Al  Gore, EPA
Administrator Carol Browner, and Interior Secretary  Bruce Babbitt all have been
heavily engaged in criticizing the new  Congress, with Gore dismissing
Congress's attempts at  environmental reform as a &quot;jihad.&quot; <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>The Superfund reform advocated by the Administration in  1994 and 1995, for
example, partially addressed some of the most  egregious aspects of this law,
but created perhaps as many problems  as it solved. Thus, the Administration was
able to claim that it  wanted to eliminate some of the worst aspects of the law,
such as joint  and several liability, while attempting to substitute provisions 
that were not much better, such as the allocation scheme it  devised. Meanwhile,
it insisted on seemingly innocuous provisions  that would have created an
environmental welfare program by  diverting up to 4 percent of Superfund's money
to environmental  activists. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#56">56</A></B></TT>

<P>The Administration's environmental agenda is one of  increased government
control and production mandates. Steered by  Vice President Gore, author of <I>Earth
in the  Balance</I>, the Administration has fought for numerous regulations,
executive orders, and  international agreements that are anti-business,
anti-growth, and  ultimately anti-consumer. One common theme among these 
regulations is the seeming lack of any serious consideration of their  relative
costs and benefits.

so that it would not require  that greenhouse gas production be scaled back to

to reconstrue the language of the treaty to mean exactly that,  and later
proposed costly actions to achieve this end. Even  though most countries will

troublesome  were its recommendations that fuel economy (CAFE) standards  be
raised so that cars would average 45 mpg (and light trucks  34 mpg) by the year
2007 and 75 mpg and 56 mpg by the year  2025. These recommendations, if
implemented, would have  increased the death toll on the road by many thousands
every year, since  cars meeting these standards necessarily would have to be
lighter to  be more fuel efficient, and thus would be less crashworthy. 
Fortunately, the committee was unable to issue a consensus report  because the
auto and oil industries refused to support its  recommendations, which wound up
being presented as the so-called  Majority Report by other members of the

While its plan to stop global  warming stopped short of a carbon tax, for
example, it does include a  Climate Change Action Plan that will impose a $60
billion burden  on the economy  a burden that may well be wholly unnecessary. 
The plan is widely thought to be an inadequate response to the  problem of
greenhouse gas emissions; thus, even if one assumes  global warming to be a real
threat, the Administration has embarked  on an effort that will waste over $600

<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 103rd Congress, which left office in 1994, accomplished  very little
with respect to the environment. The House and Senate  leadership failed either
to reauthorize any of the major  environmental laws up for reauthorization or to
pass any new ones (with the  exception of the California Desert Protection Act).
 Environmental lobbyists worked successfully to block any reauthorization  that
included one or more of three reforms: compensating  property owners for losses
caused by environmental rulings, giving  states relief from unfunded federal
environmental mandates, or  requiring that risk assessments be conducted before
expensive  regulations designed to alleviate some hypothetical risk are put into
place.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Environmentalists so feared passage of these reforms (which  they called the
&quot;unholy trinity&quot;) that they decided it was better to  have no
environmental legislation adopted at all. But conservatives  kept offering the
amendments, which also were supported by  many 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  moderates, so the Democratic
leadership refused to let the  reauthorization bills come up for a vote  even a
bill that would  have raised EPA to Cabinet level as the Department of the 
Environment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the 104th Congress accomplished little more in  the
environmental area during its first session, although it did pass  the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), one part of  the &quot;unholy trinity.&quot;
 While this Act covers regulation generally,  the most burdensome mandates on
local governments typically  have been environmental regulations. For instance,
prior to the  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, regulators continued to issue  new
prescriptive regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act  that imposed
enormous costs on local communities by requiring  what some local officials
called gold-plated solutions. After passage  of UMRA, the Senate voted
unanimously for a bill that would  allow smaller communities to develop and use
less costly  alternative standards on condition that they protect the public 
health. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#60">60</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While property-rights and risk-assessment bills have been  debated
thoroughly by both chambers and passed by the House, the  Senate has yet to vote
on them, and President Clinton has threatened  to veto them if they reach his
desk. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#61">61</A></B></TT> 
Congress also has failed  to reauthorize the major environmental laws. The
reason: Few  reforms of the current laws could avoid a veto by the President, 
and the leadership does not have the votes to override a veto.  Moreover, as of
publication, Members so far have failed to embrace  an environmental vision of
their own.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As of publication, EPA appropriations for FY 1996 have not  become law.
Congress passed the EPA appropriations bill as part  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  the Veterans Affairs, Housing and
Urban Development, and  Independent Agencies appropriations bill on December 14,
1995,  but President Clinton vetoed the bill four days later. His main 
objection was that EPA's funding level of $5.7 billion was too low,  especially
in the enforcement area. While EPA's funding under  the bill would have been
reduced by 21 percent as a necessary  incident to balancing the budget, it is
unlikely this would interfere  seriously with EPA's mandate. Although no new
major environmental  laws have passed  and only one has been amended since  1989
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#62">62</A></B></TT>  the level of
funding that Clinton vetoed as too deep a cut is almost  10 percent higher than
when President Bush took  office. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#63">63</A></B></TT>  In reality, EPA's growth
has far outstripped growth of both the economy  and the federal government; the
funding of $5.7 billion merely  reflects an attempt to rectify this imbalance.

<P>If the science of climate change were more precise than it is,  and the
evidence more consistent with the dire predictions of  some proponents of the
global-warming theory, it could make sense  for the United States and other
countries to take urgent,  expensive action to deal with the potential threat.
But the science is far  from certain. Rather than rush to &quot;do something&quot;
at huge cost, the  wiser and more mature course would be to try to find out more
 precisely what actually is happening to the Earth's atmosphere. Yet 
environmentalists are trying to redirect funding from research on  climate
change to research on its effects  on the assumption that  global warming
definitely will happen. As noted by Jeffrey Salmon,  Ex
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  ecutive Director of the George C.

<P>ESA should be reformed to eliminate the adversarial  relationship between
landowners and species fostered by the current Act.  If landowners, who are
closest to the species needing protection,  had an incentive to provide habitat
or encourage reproduction on  their property, there is little doubt these
species would flourish. Just  as the country pays auto makers to produce Jeeps
for the Army,  it should pay landowners to produce members of endangered 
species that need protection. Not only would this reform allow the Act  to work

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't regulatory reform mean rolling back regulations  that protect
our environment?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Regulatory reform means introducing common sense  into the
equation when decisions are made about whether, for  instance, a chemical should
be banned or regulated. At its most basic,  regulatory reform means making sure
the government knows what it  is doing before it does it by requiring agencies
to analyze  realistically the risks and compare the costs and benefits of their
actions.  It means making sure the process is open to scrutiny by making  it &quot;transparent&quot;
so that shoddy procedures or wildly unrealistic  assumptions used in risk
analysis, and thus in making decisions,  do not go unchallenged. Also, by
requiring these agencies to  estimate the likely risks  not just the most
extreme conceivable risks   the country can have a better idea of what it is
buying with its  scarce economic resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Currently, federal agencies typically use only worst-case  assumptions
multiplied by other worst-case assumptions. The likely  risk of chemicals, for
example, is multiplied millions of times.  Thus, the risk is artificially
inflated to seem unacceptable. By that  mathematical logic, leaving your house
in the suburbs to pick up a  carton of milk from a convenience store would be
deemed an  unjustifiable risk because of your chance of dying from a falling 
airplane. Without accurate risk assessments, federal agencies such as  EPA
promulgate costly regulations which yield few or no benefits,  and many of which
probably would not be seen as desirable if  the agency were adequately
self-informed about the likely risks  and benefits of its actions.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the federal government compensate property  owners for the
loss of property rights? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There are plenty of good reasons. For one, the Fifth  Amendment
states, &quot;nor shall private property be taken for public  use, without just
compensation.&quot;  Unfortunately, the Supreme  Court has interpreted this to
apply primarily only when the  government physically takes your land.
Bureaucrats exploit this legal fine  print by allowing people to retain title to
their property  and pay  taxes on it  even as they take away the owner's right
to decide how  his property should be used. Nor are property owners reimbursed 
for their losses. This is both unfair and economically devastating.  For
instance, if an elderly husband and wife spend a large portion  of their
retirement savings to buy property on which to build  their dream home and that
property then is designated a &quot;wetland,&quot;  the value of their property 
and their savings  is destroyed.  Unfortunately, tales of financial hardship
caused by government  designation of land as wetland or endangered-species
habitat have  become common. This is unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the public benefits, then the public  not some hapless  landowner  should
pay to provide that benefit. Thus, if the  government takes away your right to
determine for yourself how to  use your $100,000 property, it should compensate
you for the loss  in value it created by taking away that right. The fundamental
 question is whether they took away your right to use your  property; how much
they should pay is merely a function of how much  that right was worth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Conservatives often fight regulations that encourage  energy 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  conservation. Why? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives are not against conserving energy when it  makes
sense to do so, but responsible adults who must weigh the pros  and cons of
their actions  and who must pay for the energy  are  the best judges of when it
makes sense to conserve or expend  energy in their daily lives. The fact is that
federally mandated energy  conservation is costly in terms of money, human
suffering, and  increased deaths, and sometimes is even counterproductive. For 
instance, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards  are now supported
primarily by the Clinton Administration and  environmentalists as a way to
preserve fuel. The most serious  problem with CAFE standards is that the weight
reductions necessary  to meet them make cars less safe because lighter cars are
less  crashworthy. In fact, about 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000  additional
serious injuries occur per model year. Although raising  the standard would
raise the death toll even more, that is exactly  what Clinton wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Energy conservation mandates also cause other unintended  consequences.
Increasing CAFE standards would raise the average  price of cars by as much as
$1,500. And with higher priced autos,  many people would keep their autos on the
road longer, thus  minimizing the very decreases in fuel consumption regulators
are hoping  to achieve. On top of that, older autos kept on the road longer 
would mean increased pollution, not lower pollution. Saving some  oil hardly
justifies the death and suffering imposed by  ill-considered command-and-control
federal regulations such as CAFE.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't cutting EPA's funding just a backdoor attempt by  conservatives
to gut the enforcement of environmental laws they  don't 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  like? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> A.</B> No. The simple truth is that our country cannot afford  ever
more expensive government if we are to eliminate the budget  deficit that
threatens the economic future of our children.  Balancing the budget requires
tough choices, and all federal agencies   even the IRS  will be forced to
streamline their operations.  EPA should not be an exception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The administration of environmental laws will not be affected  adversely by
the budget. EPA still will have a bigger budget than  it had when President Bush
took office, so charges of gutting  EPA's ability to enforce the law are
specious. The fact is that EPA,  instead of concentrating on how we can protect
our  environment under the law, has pushed for ever more paperwork and  control
over the private sector. It uses these new costly programs to  justify its
requests for ever greater funding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What these cuts do is require EPA, just like any business  in America, to
evaluate its procedures to cut the fat from its  programs while simultaneously
improving the environment. For  instance, EPA currently does an expensive but
very poor job of  sporadically monitoring factory air and water emissions. It
should allow  companies to hire independent certified contractors to certify
that  they have met certain compliance requirements, much as  accountants
certify tax law compliance. With EPA maintaining a  spot-checking function,
independent contractors would be motivated to  provide honest reports, and &quot;cheating&quot;
and pollution would likely be  reduced considerably. The government also would
save  enormous sums.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Conservatives talk about reducing costs and saving jobs,  but what
about saving lives by controlling toxic chemicals? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> How many dollars or jobs is a child's life worth?  Who can  put a
price tag on human life?  These are impossible questions,  but they are not
really the issue. The issue is how to structure our  laws so that we get the
highest quality of life, which includes a long  and healthy life, but at
reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Reducing costs and saving jobs actually saves far more lives  than many
federal &quot;risk reduction&quot; regulations. Money wasted on  ineffective
programs is not available for more beneficial  purposes, including saving more
lives. Recent studies have made this  point crystal clear. Scholars have
recently discovered that, for every  year of life extended, the average cost for
federal toxin regulations   the kind for which EPA is renowned  is $2.8 million;
by  contrast, the average cost for medical treatments is $19,000, and the 
average cost for injury reduction efforts is $48,000. Thus, the average  toxin
control program costs roughly 58 times more for every year of  life extended
than the average injury prevention program and  146 times more than the average
medical program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The question thus is not whether $2.8 million is too little or  too great.
The question is whether we want to save the most lives  possible with our
economic resources or squander those scarce  resources in an attempt to
eliminate what are often hypothetical  risks while ignoring that real people
still will die from some other  cause. If lawmakers seriously considered which
environmental  policies actually save the most lives, they would scrap many
costly  rules and use the freed-up resources in other ways that save more 
lives. This commonsense approach would lead to levels and types  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  regulation that are radically
different from those that  burden America today. In many cases, if the private
resources used  to comply with federal mandates simply were left in the 
industries concerned, or used in other ways in the local economy,  Americans
would benefit far more  and far more lives could be saved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Experts and governments from all over the world have  concluded in
the last year or so   that industrial activity adds to  global warming. When
will conservatives take their heads out of the  sand and admit it?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Actually, scientists and experts all over the world have  been
coming to a very different conclusion. Fears of global  warming have been
reduced as knowledge has increased, and the dire  predictions of global warming
are beginning to resemble the dire  predictions of the coming Ice Age  also
supposedly man-caused   that was supposed to turn the planet into a frozen
wasteland.  President Bush jump-started serious scientific research on  climate
change a few years ago, increasing the annual budget 25  percent annually. The
results of these billions of dollars are that we  have consistently  vastly 
overstated the risk. Now that we are  armed with much more information, it is
clear the models predicting  global warming were fatally flawed and biased to
show  warming when in reality the planet is cooling. The truth is that despite 
the hysterical language often associated with this issue, we know  the planet
has not warmed at all since we started keeping highly  accurate satellite data
in the late 1970s. Yet environmentalists  now claim even the blizzard of '96 is
an example of global  warming. While it might be nice to dismiss the climate
change theory  altogether since environmentalists are so inconsistent about 
whether the temperature will soar or plummet  although it will be  man's 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  fault either way  this would be
unwise. The wise thing to  do would be to continue funding so that we know what
is really  happening. What gives the environmentalists away is that many  of
them are now calling for elimination of research on whether  and how climate
change is occurring in favor of research on what  effects global warming will
have, based on the assumption it  will happen.

<h3> HOW TO TALK ABOUT PROPERTY RIGHTS:<br>
WHY PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS BENEFITS ALL AMERICANS </h3>

Talking Points No. 15<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government increasingly passes the costs of its policies on to private property owners. To protect species under the Endangered Species Act, to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act,<sup>1</sup> or to effect some other such goal, the government typically prohibits or constrains property owners from using their property as they wish-- for example, by forbidding them to build on their land. And when the government wants to build a new federal facility, the property owner can be forced to surrender title through eminent domain. To be sure, when the government wants to take privately held property for its own purposes, it has the power under the Constitution to force a sale of the property. But in these cases, it at least has to pay the owners just compensation for their property. The problem is that when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This  <I>de facto</I> taking of property-- the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction -- is now being questioned. Under this type of regulatory taking, property owners can face heavy financial burdens or even have their entire life savings wiped out.<sup>2</sup>  For example:<ul>

<p><li>John Sabanovich, an elderly man from Reading, California, saw his net worth plummet from $900,000 to $3,000 after being successfully sued in March 1996 for the purchase price of land he had sold: land that subsequently had been designated a wetland.<sup>3</sup>

<p><li>Bob and Mary McMackin of Arrowhead Lakes, Pennsylvania, built their retirement home and planted trees and shrubbery on dry land in 1989 after obtaining all necessary permits. But the couple were threatened by the Army Corps of Engineers four years later with $50,000 daily fines unless they quickly dug up their entire yard and created a wetland surrounding the house --just five feet away from the structure  --thus threatening the house's structural integrity. They were instructed to do this to restore the site to wetland status, and also to create another wetland off-site two times the size of the house to mitigate the lost wetland area on which the house sat. No one, including the government authorities who issued the various permits, had informed the McMackins that a wetland permit might be necessary for dry land.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the belief of most Americans that seizing people's property by regulation without compensating them is inherently unfair and somehow un-American, few people -- including policymakers -- understand why protecting property rights is so essential.<sup>4</sup>  This is why Congress has yet to complete serious action to stop federal regulators from forcing individuals to surrender their property rights without compensation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Numerous bills have been introduced in the 104th Congress to address this problem, but none has become law. In March 1995, the House passed H.R. 925, the Private Property Protection Act of 1995. Introduced by Representative Charles Canady (R-FL), and part of the Contract with America, the bill as passed would require compensation by the regulating federal agency whenever regulatory restriction of property rights under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exceeds 20 percent of the value of the regulated parcel. It also would allow the owner the option of requiring the federal government to purchase the entire parcel whenever governmental restrictions cause more than a 50 percent reduction in the value of the land -- in short, when the government's interest in the property exceeds the owner's -- and would establish procedures for resolving disputes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate has not acted on H.R. 925, but is considering the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995 (S. 605), also introduced in March 1995 by then-Senator Robert Dole (R-KS).<sup>5</sup>  S. 605 would require compensation by federal regulating agencies whenever the taking of some "portion" of property diminishes the value by 33 percent. The Senate bill also would establish voluntary alternative dispute resolution, would require a takings impact analysis, and would establish certain administrative rights for property owners under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Majority Leader Trent Lott's (R-MS) office has indicated plans to bring the bill to the floor for a vote this legislative session.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While lower percentage thresholds are preferable because more property owners will be provided relief, the difference in devaluation levels before compensation is required is not the most significant distinction between the House and Senate bills. More significant is that the Senate bill is more expansive in holding regulators accountable for their actions -- for example, by requiring that they assess the monetary impact to property owners of regulatory takings. Moreover, it uses a more expansive definition of property, including protection of contract rights, than the House version. The scope and focus of the Senate bill would be clarified if this definition were narrowed -- perhaps to real property, fixtures, and water rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite Senator Dole's departure, property rights legislation should not be shelved in the Senate this year. Property owners deserve protection from federal bureaucrats who increasingly resort to these regulations to take control of private property without regard to the burden imposed on American citizens and families.<sup>6</sup>
<p>

<b>THE IMPERATIVE OF PROPERTY PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are important constitutional, economic, and fairness reasons for protecting private property rights. To understand why legislative protection is necessary, one must understand why property rights exist.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The U.S. Constitution recognizes the importance of property rights.</b><sup>7</sup> The Fifth Amendment implicitly recognizes that the federal government may take property for public use. In fact, the implicit power of government to take property -- known as eminent domain -- was recognized by the Supreme Court as early as 1795 in <I>Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance,</I> in which the Court found that "the despotic power, as it has been aptly called by some writers, of taking private property, when state necessity requires it, exists in every government.... [G]overnment could not subsist without it."<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Fifth Amendment, however, explicitly mandates that government must pay the property owner for the land confiscated. Although the government may take private property for public use, the clause "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," ensures that the cost is borne by those who benefit -- the public -- and not by the citizen unfortunate enough to own the land the government requires. The Constitution does not balance the importance of such governmental action against the importance of compensating individuals. The right to compensation is absolute. Thus, balance is built into the system: The government is permitted to take property unilaterally for public use, but at the same time is required to pay for it and protect private owners from having to bear the financial burden of pursuing that new use. In its most basic sense, compensation is a fairness issue. Why should one American bear the entire burden of the government's pursuit of a national good?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Just compensation for regulatory takings preserves individual civil rights.</b> Having seen the detrimental effects of King George's policies, the founders understood that property rights are essential to preventing the usurpation of other rights under the Constitution. It is this relationship to which Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was referring in <I>Lynch v. Household Finance Co. Inc.</I> when he stated that there is a "fundamental interdependence... between the personal right to liberty and the personal right to property."<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Practically speaking, governments can control a wide range of individual activity if they can control whether individuals remain financially secure or surrender their property. Thus, the majority truly can tyrannize a disfavored minority. As James Madison wrote in Federalist 10, "[pure] democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been incompatible with personal security or the rights of property."  It was the desire to restrict just such tyranny over individuals that motivated the framers to put severe limits -- like the requirement of just compensation -- on the unchecked will of the majority.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Property protection reduces the incentive for the federal government to confiscate property.</b> If property is to be put to its best and most highly valued use, it must be owned by individuals who appreciate its fair market value. The nation's founders well understood the positive economic consequences of protecting owners' investments in their property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If government had a free hand to take property without payment, the incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small public benefit would be overwhelming. In fact, that is exactly what has happened. The federal government now owns 30 percent of America's land, with even higher percentages in the West (for instance, 61 percent of Idaho), and is using regulatory takings with increasing frequency to enhance its effective control over even more extensive tracts. The rationale: The cost to the government of compensating owners of the land would be too high. The problem with this approach is that the potential for relatively small public benefits through regulatory takings can lead to ruinous costs to private owners, who must shoulder costs the government deems too steep for itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reality, federal enforcement officials have found that they can use regulations to gain control of property while circumventing the just compensation requirements of the Constitution. Federal property rights legislation thus is needed to provide a standard that will force federal regulators to consider the costs and benefits of taking private property. When the government decides it is in the public interest to constrain the use of private property for the public good, compensating the property owner at least ensures that the cost of providing the public good is spread fairly across all taxpayers and not just a few unfortunate individuals.
<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Supreme Court has been clear in requiring federal, state, and local governments to pay just compensation whenever they take or occupy land or real estate.<sup>10</sup>  Essentially, the Court has held that, even if just a square foot of land is taken and less than one percent of the value is lost, a taking has occurred and just compensation is required.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear and consistent, leaving executive branch agencies with wide latitude in decisions regarding the enforcement and interpretation of laws. Thus, the federal government can take property through regulations in most cases without payment. Legislative protection is therefore necessary, both as a philosophical and as a practical matter. Only then can property owners be secure in the knowledge their rights will be respected, and able to invest their savings accordingly.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the United States was founded on the principle that government should not be allowed unfettered power to impose its will on law-abiding citizens or seize their property, federal agencies have found a loophole that allows them to usurp property through regulation. These regulatory takings can strip any American of the right to use his land as he wishes. In some cases, they even can almost wipe out the value of that land -- and with it, the life savings of individual citizens.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In light of the ambiguous and limited nature of existing protections against uncompensated regulatory takings, compounded by the increasing tendency of bureaucrats to use this ill-considered and unwise approach, legislative action is necessary to ensure that private property rights are fully protected.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One of the principal goals of government regulation is to protect the public and save lives. But how efficiently does today's system of regulation achieve that goal?  Federal agencies are criticized increasingly for imposing ineffective, costly regulations on individuals and businesses that do little to improve public health and safety. The criticism ranges from accusations of poor-quality science being used to estimate the magnitude of health risks, to the growing trend of agencies to regulate purely hypothetical health risks that likely pose no danger whatsoever. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year due to the current command-and-control system, chiefly by squandering billions of dollars on eliminating risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The traditional rhetoric of those who support the current regulatory system -- that increased regulation saves lives -- is simply wrong. Well-intentioned regulations can kill. Alarmists have succeeded in convincing the public that a reformed regulatory system would "roll back protection" -- for example, that women would be denied life-saving mammograms and our food supply would not be safe from deadly <I>e.coli</I> bacteria. This is untrue. A reformed system would allow us to devote more resources, not less, to the types of activities which we know save lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress has been unsuccessful in its efforts to frame the issues clearly for Americans. But, rather than passively allow the assertions of alarmists and regulatory extremists to go unanswered, reformers can and should seize the moral high ground in the debate over risk regulation. They should point out that their reforms and solutions actually will save more lives. In effect, they can help Americans get "more bang for the regulatory buck."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Reformers must understand and effectively communicate five simple truths about risk regulation to convince the public that regulatory reform will result in more protection, not less:
<P><ol>
<b><li>Not every risk is avoidable.</b> While eliminating every risk from life is desirable, it also is impossible. People make decisions every day regarding the types of risk they choose to face, and accidents do happen. A 100 percent risk-free, accident-free society is an impossible goal, and it is unwise for regulators to act as if it were achievable.<p>

<b><li>All risks are relative.</b> Almost everything we do every day carries some degree of risk. But some risks obviously are greater than others. Some risks may sound catastrophic while actually being relatively trivial because the likelihood of harm is so low. For example, many Americans still fear airplane flight despite clear evidence it is one of the safest modes of transportation available. By contrast, commonplace everyday risks such as driving to work pose a greater health hazard because they occur more frequently and the chance of accidents is greater.
<p>
<b><li>Wealthier is healthier.</b> Higher incomes increase living standards which, in turn, improve health and increase life expectancy. As the standard of living improves, overall public health and safety improves. Conversely, actions which lower living standards typically increase risk and shorten life expectancy. Thus, the more burdensome the regulations, the greater the drain on the economy and on the prosperity and health of Americans. This cost must be balanced against any benefit from a regulation.<p>

<b><li>Regulations can have adverse side effects, thus creating more risk and less protection.</b> While some regulation saves lives, some federal regulations actually cost more lives than they save by discouraging innovation, decreasing incomes, destroying economic output and job opportunities, and creating other new risks in pursuit of policy objectives. For example, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations meant to guarantee the safety of drugs or medical devices often delay the release of these products, placing millions more lives at risk.
<p>
<b><li>More lives would be saved if risks were prioritized.</b> If federal regulators identified and prioritized risks more effectively, as many as 60,000 additional lives could be saved each year.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

These truths constitute the foundation of how to talk about risk regulation. This study is intended to help policymakers communicate in clearer terms the problems underlying today's system of risk regulation and describe a framework for reform.
<p>
<b>LIFE AND RISK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

We face risks every day of our lives. It is risky to eat, breathe, and walk down the street. Tragedy can strike from unknown and improbable sources. The world is full of risk, and no one is free from its dangers. But we also put ordinary risks in perspective. Even though people are constantly exposed to potentially dangerous circumstances, few decide to live in seclusion merely to avoid a slight chance of harm. While people wisely avoid unacceptable risks, they also wisely ignore or take only minor precautions against the vast majority of potential dangers facing them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Common sense tells us that risk is a relative matter. All other things being equal, less risk is better. But not all other things <I>are</I> equal -- sometimes it is better to accept small amounts of risk because the rewards are so great. In fact, humans do this every day when they risk poisoning by eating food or taking medicine or when they drive to work. The reason: Even with reasonable government protections and private precautions, there is a risk. But while the possibility of, say, food poisoning, remains real, usually it is very small and the alternative is unacceptable to most people. People calmly accept commonplace risks everyday. Life is a series of prudent trade-offs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, this is not understood by government bureaucrats who continue to craft regulations with the goal of eliminating all risk from society. These regulators, in an effort to be cautious and "safe," often impose great economic burdens on those they regulate to eliminate the slightest risk of death or injury. Even the smallest element of risk in society typically is deemed intolerable and unacceptable. The enormity of the cost often is irrelevant to regulators as they pursue a "zero-risk" or "no-risk" society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Risk trade-offs and opportunity costs.</b> While these policymakers are well-intentioned, they ignore the important point that risk is neither created nor eliminated in a vacuum. Every action has consequences. Any attempt to decrease or eliminate risk will entail a corresponding trade-off. Every action taken by an individual or organization means that other opportunities are closed off. Economists refer to these lost opportunities as opportunity costs. More specifically, the opportunity cost of a given action refers to the forgone benefits that could have been obtained by employing resources in an alternative way.<sup>1</sup>  For example:
<p><ul>
<li>On an elementary level, most people enjoy watching television as well as reading books or magazines, but understand there is a trade-off between the two at any given time. The opportunity cost of watching television is the lost chance to read.
<p>
<li>On a more complex level, the opportunity cost of prohibiting a business from hiring and paying workers at whatever wage they can afford may be an overall loss in employment and income for the economy.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
<li>Likewise, federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which require increased fuel economy in American automobiles, undoubtedly have saved fuel. But this has come at the expense of many thousands of lives lost, because auto companies were effectively forced to manufacture much lighter-weight cars to meet the fuel economy standards, and these cars were not heavy enough to protect drivers and passengers as well in accidents.<sup>3</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In each case, a trade-off is made, although the trade-off may not be consciously understood. Consequently, opportunity costs are incurred. Such costs can range from very expensive to fairly trivial; hidden to visible; extremely complex to easily understood. Whatever their magnitude, there are real costs and trade-offs associated with every regulatory decision.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In an important new book, <I>Risk vs. Risk</I>,<sup>4</sup> John Graham, Director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis and President-elect of the Society for Risk Analysis, and Jonathan Baert Weiner, Associate Professor in the School of Law and the School of Environment at Duke University, develop a conceptual framework (referred to as "Risk Trade-off Analysis" or "RTA") to help policymakers and the public better understand the nature of risk trade-offs. Graham and Weiner argue that the best way to understand the dangers inherent in the risk assessment process is to plot on a chart the relationship between "target risks" and "countervailing risks."  Target risks are those risks that regulations are designed to reduce. A countervailing risk is the unintended and undesirable consequence that results from attempts to reduce the target risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For example, consider Graham's and Weiner's hypothetical example of how someone might go about reducing the risk of a headache. To alleviate the target risk, the headache, the sufferer could take several aspirin. While taking several aspirin usually will lessen the headache, it often comes at the cost of a countervailing risk -- a severely upset stomach. As the chart below reveals, if the recommended remedy for the target risk is merely to take several aspirin while ignoring any side effects, improvements can be made along the target risk axis. Yet alleviating the target risk may increase the risk of severe stomach problems, moving us backwards on the countervailing risk axis. Thus, both types of risks must be acknowledged so that the proper balance can be struck or alternative treatments found to remedy the target risk without creating heightened countervailing risks.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Risk Trade-off Analysis, as developed by Graham and Weiner, simply draws attention to the inevitable trade-offs policymakers face when attempting to eliminate target risks. Actions taken to alleviate target risks may come at the expense of heightened countervailing risks. When legislators and regulators ignore the opportunity costs of such trade-offs, the results can be unfortunate and even deadly. A clear case of this is the CAFE standard mentioned earlier. Increased fuel economy in cars (the target risk) was achieved, but at the expense of increased highway fatalities (the countervailing risk).
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Graham and Weiner provide many other examples of how RTA can be used to examine inefficient risk analysis:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Regulations aimed at decreasing solid waste in landfills from disposable diapers can decrease this target risk by encouraging increased use of washable cloth diapers.</b> Yet this produces a countervailing risk: more air pollution created by increased energy-intensive washing and household pickup services by high-polluting trucks.
<p>
<li><b>Banning the pesticide EDB may have eliminated the very slight cancer risk it posed, but only at the expense of a more dangerous cancer-causing fungus left on the food</b> that used to be treated with the pesticide.
<p>
<li><b>In 1991, Peru suffered a massive outbreak of cholera, which killed 7,000 people and afflicted over 800,000 others. This was caused by Peru's decision to ban the chlorination of drinking water, based on American risk studies</b> that had shown there might be a slight chance of developing cancer due to chlorine. But the chances of cancer death from chlorinated water turned out to be far less than the risk of death due to a contaminated drinking supply.
<p>
<li><b>Asbestos abatement efforts actually pose a greater risk to human health than non-action, since the substance has been shown to be virtually harmless if left alone.</b> Thus, regulations requiring asbestos removal not only have wasted scarce public health dollars, but also have placed workers removing it and others at greater risk from dust stirred up once it was agitated.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clearly, as shown by these examples, if Congress ever hopes to fix the grave problems of the current risk assessment and management systems, it must be aware of the opportunity costs that are inextricably entwined with all risk regulation trade-offs. While the benefits of some regulations may outweigh the cost, more often they do not. And that means lives are lost unnecessarily. Why is this the case?
<p>
<b>How Well-Intentioned Regulations Can Cost Lives</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Attempting to save lives by trying to eliminate every risk from life actually can increase the overall death toll for many reasons. The primary reason: Avoiding one risk necessarily implies accepting others. Even in the United States, with a gross national product of $7 trillion, there are limited resources that can be devoted to reducing risk. At the very least, policymakers should acknowledge that saving lives by taking one action precludes using those same resources to save other -- and perhaps more -- lives. In many cases, if the private resources used in complying with federal mandates were left to the individuals affected, or used in other ways in the economy, Americans would benefit more. The country cannot afford to eliminate all risk, since trying to do so can reduce safety.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As Supreme Court Justice Stephan Breyer noted in his 1993 study of risk regulation, <I>Breaking the Vicious Circle</I>, while it would be wonderful to eradicate every last bit of risk from life, trying to "go that last mile" can be pursued "to the point where it brings about more harm than good."<sup>5</sup>  Few additional gains are made in terms of public health and safety when such a strategy is followed, Breyer argues, since "[r]emoving that last little bit can involve limited technological choice, high cost, devotion of considerable agency resources, large legal fees, and endless argument."<sup>6</sup>  To better understand Justice Breyer's point, critics of the onerous current system must learn to speak in terms of "wealthier is healthier."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Assuming the moral high ground: Why a higher standard of living keeps people safer.</b> Increasingly, academics, expert analysts, and even government officials argue that large increases in regulatory spending can result in more lives lost than saved. But while true, this is counter-intuitive for most people. After all, regulation ostensibly is designed to protect people, and this usually would be true if the benefits of regulation existed in a vacuum with no costs, including opportunity costs. Regulation neither exists in a vacuum nor necessarily corresponds with more protection; yet it always entails costs. When the cost of well-intentioned risk regulations is a corresponding decrease in the overall economic welfare of average citizens, the net result can be lost lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There is an old saying that health is wealth. The converse is also true: Wealth is health. As <a href="tp13c2.gif">Chart 2</a> and <a href="tp13a1.gif">Appendix 1</a> suggest, comparing average national income levels to life expectancy and infant mortality in 132 surveyed countries reveals a strong correlation. More children survive and adults live longer in countries with higher incomes. Why does this occur?  There are many reasons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One reason is that increases in economic production make possible innovations such as medical technology, antibiotics, weather-resistant shelter, and safer modes of transportation. These factors in turn increase life expectancy. Another is that wealthy, robust economies encourage job creation, which also lowers deaths by reducing the ranks of unemployed workers, who suffer from higher mortality rates. Moreover, increased wealth extends life expectancy for those already fully employed by giving them opportunities to buy better food and shelter, purchase more health insurance, drive safer cars, and otherwise live a less stressful life. Furthermore, a healthier population produces even more wealth, so the wealth-health cycle becomes self-perpetuating.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

These advances have done more to reduce the very real everyday risks Americans face than the great majority of risk regulations currently on the books. Despite "Chicken Little" claims by some alarmists, life is getting less risky all the time. The easiest way to see this is to compare turn-of-the-century life expectancy figures with today's. Total life expectancy in the year 1900 was just 48 years; today, it is 76 years. This remarkable 60 percent jump is due primarily to the ever-increasing standard of living enjoyed by Americans over the span of this century. Steadily rising incomes have allowed individuals and families to make ongoing investments in risk-alleviating measures that increase their health and that of their families. In fact, two scientists in the early 1980s estimated that for every 1 percent change in income, mortality is reduced by approximately 0.05 percent.<sup>7</sup>  Again, wealthier is not only healthier, but highly risk-reducing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is also worth noting that these large gains in human health and longevity occurred just as rapidly before the onset of most federal regulatory programs in the early 1970s as they have since. In fact, from 1900 to 1969, life expectancy at birth rose by an average of 0.8 percent per year (see <a href="tp13c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). By way of comparison, from 1970 to 1990, life expectancy grew by only 0.3 percent per year. Policymakers need to ask themselves how these amazing gains were made prior to 1970 without federal health and safety rules. The answer, of course, lies in the wealth-health phenomenon.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Regulation: The other side of the story.</b> Regulations, including those that ostensibly are supposed to reduce risk, can cause fatalities whenever they destroy wealth, confiscate property, or discourage employment and product innovation. This should be taken into account whenever a regulation is proposed. Jobs are lost and wealth is destroyed when output is restricted, resources are used inefficiently, or entrepreneurialism in general is discouraged. Product innovation likewise is suppressed whenever government too strictly regulates the development, distribution, and use of products with life-saving potential.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Several recent regulatory and judicial decisions support this concept. For instance, the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has noted that for each additional $7.5 million increase in the regulatory burden imposed on Americans, one human life is lost.9  According to OIRA, the reduction in economic activity due to the burden of regulation itself actually increases risk because living standards are reduced, and this causes mortality rates to rise. This increased mortality, however, reflects only the heightened risk caused by the economic effects of regulations and is separate from reduced risks that could be achieved by devoting expenditures to other uses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using this estimate:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $119 billion</b> to avert just one death under an OSHA-based formaldehyde occupational exposure limit, 331 new drugs could be developed and brought to market.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $168 million</b> to avert one death under an EPA-based benzene regulation, 3,064 police officers could be placed on the street.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $653 million</b> to avert one death under an EPA-based dichloropropane water standard, 4,353 new fire trucks could be purchased -- equivalent to 10 per congressional district.<sup>12</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The late risk expert Aaron Wildavsky made clear exactly why regulation can have such counter-productive effects. He explained that the quest for a no-risk society through overzealous regulation "is the highest risk of all"<sup>13</sup> because it prohibits or interferes with the enormously beneficial trial-and-error process that weeds out unsafe products or processes and replaces them with superior alternatives. As Wildavsky noted in his influential work <I>Searching for Safety</I>, proponents of a no-risk society demand "trial <I>without</I> error," which in reality is more deadly, since "[i]f you can do nothing without knowing first how it will turn out, you cannot do anything at all.... [I]f trying new things is made more costly, there will be fewer departures from past practice; this very lack of change may itself be dangerous in forgoing chances to reduce existing hazards.... [E]xisting hazards will continue to cause harm if we fail to reduce them by taking advantage of the opportunity to benefit from repeated trials."<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Those who support the current regulatory system apparently want policymakers and the public to believe that thousands of pages of new rules and hundreds of additional bureaucrats would do more to improve human health and safety than more police on the beat, more fire trucks in local communities, or more pharmaceutical drugs on the market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In summary, because regulatory policy often requires that private resources be employed in sub-optimal ways, enormous costs are imposed on businesses and individual Americans alike.<sup>15</sup>  Unfortunately, as critics of the current system can now argue, these costs may often include the loss of human life.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>A real world example: CLIA.</b> Take the case of CLIA, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. Despite little evidence that any serious problems existed with current laboratory testing methods, Congress became fixated on a few highly unusual cases in which laboratory testing error contributed to the death of a patient. Congress felt that even a single fatality caused by testing error was one death too many. With truly noble intentions, legislators set out to insure lab tests would be perfectly safe from that point forward -- again, the creation of a "no-risk" society was the theme. Yet, despite these good intentions, the results have been less than encouraging and have placed the lives of average Americans at even greater risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The eight-page law led to 1,600 pages of regulations as well as thousands of pages of additional guidelines. Faced with enormous paperwork costs and threatened with fines for non-compliance with this needless paperwork, tens of thousands of small private medical practices have been forced to stop administering basic patient tests or have shut down their operations altogether.<sup>16</sup>  As a result, the cost of routine laboratory tests for things such as strep infection, cholesterol levels, pregnancy, and Pap Smears has risen dramatically. With fewer patients (especially those who are poor) therefore able to obtain basic clinical tests, the overall quality of care has been reduced, and more lives are now at risk than before CLIA was passed. Good intentions have led to disastrous results. Thus, like many other regulations whose stated purpose is to reduce risk to society, CLIA is likely costing more lives than it is saving.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This real-world example provides several important lessons that apply to all risk regulation:
<P><ul>
<li><b>First, it illustrates that every regulation involves trade-offs and corresponding opportunity costs, including the cost of human life.</b> In the case of CLIA, trying to make labs completely safe is placing individuals at even greater risk.
<p>
<li><b>Second, it shows that "two wrongs don't make a right."</b>  A few chance accidents do not justify overzealous regulatory initiatives that actually create more problems than they solve. Again, it is not possible to avoid every single risk in life, and attempting to do so can lead to more harm than good.<p>

<li><b>Third, and most important, as economists Richard J. Zeckhauser and W. Kip Viscusi note, "When thinking about these tradeoffs, one should remember that improvements in mortality and morbidity have come primarily from technological progress and a higher standard of living, not from government regulation or private forbearance."</b><sup>17</sup>  Innovation, trial and error, acquired knowledge, and the corresponding benefits of progress and wealth expansion are the true keys to a safer, healthier society -- not a more onerous regulatory regime.
<p>
<li><B>Finally, where command-and-control tactics are used, whether by the FDA, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), the EPA, or other regulatory agencies, fewer lives are being saved than many policymakers and average Americans have been led to believe.</b> In many cases, as with CLIA, lives may be lost because countervailing risks are being ignored.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

When federal policymakers accept the validity of regulations such as CLIA without carefully considering the costs they impose, they fail to understand that resources are being used inefficiently and people often are dying as a consequence. Tammy O. Tengs of Duke University summarizes this phenomenon: "[W]hen we spend resources on interventions that save lives at a high cost, we forego the opportunity to spend those same resources on interventions that save lives at low cost."<sup>18</sup>  With federal regulatory spending growing without restraint,19 the conclusion is clear: The pursuit of a "no-risk" society through expensive and inefficient federal regulatory activity is killing Americans.
<p>
<b>How to Manage Resources Better to Reduce Risk</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The central question facing policymakers and regulators is how to obtain "more bang for the buck" when trying to reduce risk. Since economic resources in society are scarce, it is essential that policymakers examine the cost-effectiveness of measures designed to reduce risk. This requires a common reference point to measure benefits. In the scholarly literature on risk analysis, this is often done in terms of how many "life-years" are saved by a particular measure. Assuming an average woman's life span of 80 years of age, a measure that prevented her premature death at age 50 would save 30 "life-years."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In examining the cost-effectiveness of various kinds of risk-alleviating measures, recent studies using life-year analysis generally have grouped the measures into three categories: 1) medicine and medical treatments, 2) fatal injury reduction efforts, and 3) toxin control. Although rules and methods can be found in each category that save lives very efficiently, medical treatments typically generate the greatest life-year benefits for the least cost while toxin control measures produce few benefits at the highest   cost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What generally saves the most lives?</b>  The most cost-effective way to save lives generally is to increase medical treatment and, to a somewhat lesser degree, to curb fatal injuries. Trying to save lives by regulating pesticides or other toxins, on the other hand, generally uses up far more resources and saves fewer lives -- meaning that shifting resources from toxin regulation to medical testing on balance typically would save lives. While it is true that some toxin regulations do save lives (for example, restrictions on the release of nuclear wastes), most do not fit into this category. A seminal study that recently surveyed 587 risk-reducing methods, programs, and rules reveals that the median cost per life-year saved -- or extending a single life by one year -- for toxin control measures is $2,800,000. In contrast, the median cost per life-year saved is $19,000 for medical treatments and $48,000 for fatal injury reductions.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just how cost-<I>ineffective</I> are the great majority of these toxin control measures?  To put the numbers in perspective, Graham notes, "the median toxin control program costs 58 times more per year of life saved than the median injury prevention program and 146 times more than the median medical program (see <a href="tp13c4.gif">Chart 4</a>)."<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is ironic since, intuitively, most policymakers and ordinary Americans assume that toxin control is perhaps the most cost-effective method of reducing risk. Many Americans generally have come to believe that federal regulations banning or severely curtailing the use of products that sound very dangerous are extremely cost-effective and represent wise public policy. It turns out that nothing could be further from the truth. For example, the following list of five federal toxin control regulations reveals the enormous costs that would have to be incurred by society in trying to save just one life-year for each of these regulations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If citizens were forced to incur these expenses to save one life-year per regulation, and if the regulatory costs for these five regulations were totaled, it would cost society roughly $189 billion for just five life-years saved. By way of comparison, spending $189 billion on developing new life-saving drugs typically would allow an additional 526 new drugs to be developed and brought to market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It should be noted that this does not mean the nation is now actually spending $189 billion to alleviate the risk posed by these five toxins. Rather, this is how much would have to be spent to save just five life-years. The numbers are extraordinarily large precisely because the risks being regulated are so small, perhaps even illusory. In reality, the nation now spends much less on implementing these five rules but does not buy five years of life for that amount.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Current policies = 60,000 extra deaths per year.</b> As noted earlier, an important new study by Tammy Tengs estimates the magnitude of this resource misallocation. In her doctoral dissertation at Harvard, Dr. Tengs notes that from a survey of 185 life-saving interventions: 
<P><blockquote>
	 Results indicate that we incur opportunity costs of approximately $31.1 billion, 60,200 premature deaths, or 636,000 years of life lost every year in order to maintain our present pattern of investments in these 185 life-saving interventions. At our current level of resource consumption, we could double the survival benefits of our expenditures. Alternatively, we could retain our present level of risk reduction and, in addition, save billions of dollars. This could be accomplished by simply attending to the cost-effectiveness of investment options.<sup>22</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, Dr. Tengs notes, "[W]e pay a large price for this pattern of investments and policy makers would be well advised to examine whether retaining the status quo results in non-survival benefits that are worth the cost and loss of human life."<sup>23</sup>  John Graham observes bluntly, "This perverse pattern of investment amounts to 'statistical murder' of American citizens. Policy makers need to ask harder questions about whether our public health and environmental protection dollars are well spent."<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The bottom line:</b> If the current pattern of regulation and structure of costs continues, risks actually will increase for average Americans.
<p>
<b>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given this misuse of resources and the corresponding costs of current federal policies and priorities, policymakers and regulators should reconsider how to reduce real risks to Americans. The aim should be to provide more protection at less cost. A better distribution of scarce societal resources to achieve this goal would:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Improve risk decision-making and minimize inefficient federal spending.</b> Risk assessment methods need to be improved (for example, by using sound science), and agencies need to establish a clear distinction between assessing risks and deciding how to manage them. Federal agencies should work closely with the scientific community to improve risk assessment guidelines. Today, agencies too often allow policy decisions about how risk should be managed to influence how risk is determined. When a risk is identified, a policy decision is made about how to handle it. If certain federal toxin control efforts produce little or no benefit for society, however, they should be abandoned, since they waste resources that could be used better elsewhere. Other programs, such as fatal injury programs, also would be scrutinized to ensure that resources could not be used better elsewhere, such as for medical treatments.
<p>
<b><li>Require that decisions about how to manage risks be made with due consideration for scientific, economic, and constitutional concerns.</b> In those cases where governmental solutions are viewed as inevitable, regulators should be required to take into account all possible outcomes and potential side effects of their actions. Scientific, economic, and constitutional concerns all must be given due consideration in this process. Moreover, Congress should demand that regulators meet stringent standards of proof before allowing them to overrule individual action and choice. External peer review mechanisms and judicial review opportunities also should be established to guarantee accountability. Proper prioritization of serious risks will aid in this process.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Encourage market-based solutions that produce incentives to reduce risk.</b> Achieving a wealthier citizenry would do more to decrease risks and reduce mortality than most public programs. Better use of market pricing and strict enforcement of property rights claims through the common law system would produce risk-alleviating incentives. For example, by applying property rights to water usage in Scotland, river users have reduced pollution by others in the waterways since they have an economic incentive to conserve and keep clean the natural resources they now own.<sup>26</sup>  Fundamental reform of tort law that results in a fairer compensatory system and better deters harmful conduct without over-punishing behavior also would help achieve this goal.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Improve both public and private risk information efforts.</b> The public needs to understand the types of familiar risks they face everyday, such as being struck by lightning, and how these compare with unfamiliar risks, such as exposure to a particular chemical in the community. This would ensure that individuals possess the maximum amount of information to make wise, safety-conscious decisions on their own. For example, smoking, alcohol abuse, poor dietary standards, sun tanning, dangerous recreation activities and vehicles, and other potentially hazardous lifestyle habits are among the most risky activities engaged in by most Americans, according to experts. However, government regulation is rarely the solution and traditionally has not been the approach in these areas. An informed citizenry, with the liberty to make personal decisions, is the optimal goal.
<p>
<b><li>Give states and localities the flexibility to target resources more effectively to address the risks they face.</b> States and localities can target resources more precisely to the needs of their communities, such as sanitation, hazardous waste cleanup, and traffic safety. Moreover, they are more likely to know and be more responsive to the unique needs and concerns of their citizens than are distant federal regulators. Restricting federal efforts to clearly interstate and national concerns in those cases where private, state, and local efforts fail would be a much more effective division of responsibility.
</ul><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Eliminating every risk from life is impossible. But in pursuit of the mirage of a "risk-free" society, regulators oftentimes pursue quixotic and unattainable goals that place the lives of ordinary Americans at even greater risk. The traditional rhetoric surrounding the debate over risk -- that increased regulation saves lives -- is fraudulent. Regulations can kill, especially when they are formulated as a rash response to hypothetical risks and divert resources from other activities that would reduce real risks. The new rhetoric of risk regulation must be based on sound science, prioritization, and an understanding of the wealth-health trade-offs government regulations force on society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, not all federal risk regulations can be eliminated. But those that regulate illusory risks can and should be eliminated. Moreover, other regulations that alleviate small amounts of risk often can be crafted in better ways or carried out at the state or local level to ensure that they are cost-effective and truly beneficial. Obviously, there is no one panacea that policymakers can rely on in determining whether federal intervention is necessary. Judgment is needed. But if the proper tools and concepts are applied consistently when contemplating legislation or regulation of risk, those judgments would be much more sound than they are today. In the end, many more Americans would live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

"Opportunity benefits," on the other hand, focuses on the beneficial results that could have come about if a different path had been followed. <I>Ibid</I>., p. 39.<p>
<li>Although almost all risk experts agree this relationship holds over the long run, the short-run effects of economic wealth and personal health are disputed. That is, as "permanent income" (average income over the long run) increases or decreases over time, health risks and mortality generally decrease. See generally Wildavsky, "Richer Is Sicker Versus Richer Is Safer," in <I>Searching for Safety</I> , pp. 59-75. However, fluctuations in "transitory income" (short-term income changes during business cycle upturns and downturns) do not always exhibit a similar correlation. In fact, some scholars have noted that a perverse relationship exists between health/mortality risks and short-term increases in income brought on by improving economic conditions. For example, some ailments such as heart attacks, accidents, and cirrhosis tend to increase with improving economic times since they often are the result of an increased tendency and ability among individuals to consume greater quantities of luxuries that may have adverse health effects. See John D. Graham, Bei-Hung Chang, and John S. Evans, "Poorer Is Riskier," <I>Risk Analysis</I>, Vol. 12, No. 3 (1992), pp. 333-337. In general, though, these are health risks that individuals accept despite the side effects associated with them. More important, permanent income is generally a more important gauge of overall societal well-being and is hurt by federal policies that generate enormous costs and produce few benefits.<p>

<title>What the Gas Tax Costs State Economies - Heritage</title>

<center><h3>WHAT THE GAS TAX COSTS STATE ECONOMIES</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 100<br>

<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
<a href="fyi100.gif">Table 1</a>: Estimated Revenue Raised by 4.3 Cent per Gallon Federal Gas Tax, 1996
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is now considering repealing the 4.3 cent federal tax imposed under the 1993 budget plan championed by the Clinton Administration.  Gasoline prices at service stations across the country have risen sharply over the last few months, raising concerns over the impact of these rising prices on already strained family budgets.  Nationally, since the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen approximately 16 cents.  In California, where prices have risen even more dramatically, gasoline now costs more than $2 a gallon in some areas.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While recent gas price hikes are an unwelcome added cost to family budgets, they actually are far exceeded by the total gas taxes paid by Americans.  Combined federal and state gas taxes per gallon of gasoline now average 37.7 cents, more than twice the recent short-term spike caused by market conditions.  These taxes raise the cost of driving a car an average of $310 per year.  In response to the growing public concern over prices and the economic impact of the tax burden, Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) introduced a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1727:">bill</a> on May 2 which would repeal the 1993 federal fuel tax of 4.3 cents applying to gasoline and diesel.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) also is expected soon to offer a bill that will repeal the gas and diesel tax and possibly may roll back the 4.3 cent tax on jet fuel as well.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Eliminating the 1993 gas tax is a good start.  While gasoline would still be subject to a 14 cent federal tax, as well as substantial state taxes, repealing the 4.3 cent tax would benefit the economy by reducing transportation costs.  It also would help family budgets.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unlike the rest of the federal gasoline tax, the 4.3 cent levy is not earmarked for transportation costs.  It flows instead into general revenues.  As Senator Dole has said, at least the previous gasoline taxes "helped build highways and bridges, but this tax was just for deficit reduction.  It doesn't do a thing for highways or bridges.... If we repeal this tax, it'll be 4 cents cheaper at the pump.  If we can find an offset, then we should repeal this tax."  Melvin Sherbert, Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the National Service Station Dealers and owner of two service stations himself, confirmed that tax savings would be passed on directly to consumers.  Sherbert testified on May 3 before theSenate Finance Committee that "We would pass the savings on because we are just waiting to lower prices [because] that helps us sell more gas while still making the same profit [per gallon]."<sup>1</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The poor and lower middle class would be the biggest beneficiaries of this repeal.  Susan Perry, Senior Vice President of the American Bus Association, testified on May 3 before the Senate Finance Committee that as the result of higher fuel costs since the imposition of the fuel tax, "there are fewer bus stops [and] the very poor, very elderly and very rural are mostly affected" because they disproportionately ride buses and fuel costs are passed on to passengers.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, since the fuel tax is a flat 4.3 cents per gallon, it is regressive.  Because three-quarters of those Americans earning less than $10,000 per year commute to work in privately owned autos, a flat tax rate falls disproportionately on these poor as a percent of their income.<sup>3</sup>  Indeed, 1987 Bureau of Labor statistics data show that the poorest 20 percent of Americans devote 8.8 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil while the wealthiest 20 percent devote only 3.1 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil.<sup>4</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The benefit to the economy of repealing the fuel tax would be significant.  Carol Hallett, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Air Transport Association of America, testified that the airline "industry estimates that passing on this [4.3 cents per gallon tax] cost results in five million fewer passengers a year [due to higher ticket prices.  This] correlates to a loss of 1 passenger per flight.  This statistic alone is enough to drop many flights into the loss column, and will surely result in airlines cutting back."<sup>5</sup>  And according to the trucking industry, the 4.3 cent tax adds about $600 per truck annually to the cost of operations.<sup>6</sup>  These costs in turn are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher priced products.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The burden of this tax for 1996 is $5.3 billion for gasoline alone and $7.4 billion total, based on Department of Energy daily use estimates.<sup>7</sup>  Too often ignored, however, is the regional and state disparity in the impact of this tax.  To assess the state-by-state impact of the 4.3 cent tax on motor, distillate, and jet fuel, we calculated the tax for each state based on Department of Energy state summaries of usage patterns for 1993, the most recent year for which complete data are available.<sup>8</sup>  While the pattern among states may have changed slightly between 1993 and today, the estimates of the tax burden in general would be higher than our state-by-state figures because of increases in consumption.<sup>9</sup>  According to this calculation, the drain on California alone is $772 million based on 1993 usage, while New York and Pennsylvania combined, with about the same number of people, have a cost of $586 million.

<title>What the New Farm Bill Will Mean to State Economies and Farmers - Heritage</title>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The agriculture legislation recently enacted by Congress and signed into law (P.L. 104-127) by President Clinton marks the most dramatic change in U.S. farm policy since the current command-and-control programs were created during the Depression. Today's system of centrally planned commodity support programs, export subsidies, supply controls, acreage allotments, production quotas, and restrictions on trade imports holds back American farmers. This makes it impossible for them to benefit from the growing world market and denies farming-related industries the economic boost of higher farm production. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The new legislation was based on bills first debated last year by Congress: the<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.2195:"> Freedom to Farm Act</a> (H.R. 2195), sponsored by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), and proposals advanced by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) during the consideration of balanced budget legislation. These bills called for sweeping changes in American agriculture policy to create freer markets, reduce subsidies, and generally permit farmers to run their businesses to take advantage of market opportunities rather than comply with bureaucratic regulations. The bills also were in line with calls for fundamental reform voiced by many farmers and research organizations, such as The Heritage Foundation. In <I>Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity</I>, Heritage analysts proposed last year that Congress immediately end all supply control programs, phase out subsidies, and end other restrictions on farmers.<sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
P.L. 104-127, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996, eliminates federal government programs that manipulate the production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction programs. Farm subsidies for these crops are to be replaced by steadily decreasing, but fixed, "market transition" payments. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, the FAIR Act failed to reform the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Allegedly an environmental program, the CRP actually has functioned more as a supply control program, more often than not paying farmers to take potentially productive land out of use. The CRP at least should have been reformed to allow farmers to remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program. The FAIR Act also failed to reform the sugar and peanut programs, which continue the archaic policy of restrictive allotments and quotas that gouge American consumers; nor did it eliminate the milk market orders which force Americans to pay above-market prices for milk.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite these shortcomings, the new farm legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous new opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of this restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. farm economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which would mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by Heritage Senior Fellow David Winston, using an econometric model of the agriculture economy developed last year by Heritage, the new law will mean:
<p><ul><b>
<li>Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li>Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<P>
<li>Taken together, the agriculture community as a whole thus will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion of income. 
</ul></b> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This increase in agriculture activity will have a "multiplier" effect on other industries, leading to a total economic boost to the nation of $74.6 billion between 1996 and 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The states in which farmers will be at least $1 billion better off over the next seven years are:

<h3>APPENDIX: <br>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION MODEL</h3>
</center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Heritage Foundation Farm Income Projection Model, described in detail in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, projects what would happen to future farm income (1996-2002) under the Freedom to Farm Act, based on historical analysis of the farm sector from 1990-1993. In our model we assumed that, overall, about 95 percent of ARP and 50/92 land would come back into production. These additional acres would yield only 95 percent as much as land currently being farmed, and costs of production would be 5 percent higher. For all cropland in our analysis, yields would increase 0.5 percent each year through 2002 due to productivity gains. Finally, we assumed that because of growing overseas demand, the increase in supply would have a minimal impact on prices. The greatest effect would be in 1996, when prices would drop 4 percent. By 2002 this loss would be more than recouped.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In keeping with estimates of the gain in farm income contained in Freeing America's Farmers, the Heritage Foundation's more comprehensive estimates of increased economic activity are conservative in their assumptions. In the model to estimate farm income gains, we assumed that future productivity gains would be only 0.5 percent annually and estimated relatively higher costs of production for new acreage relative to existing acreage. Thus, the model significantly understated potential income gains, and our conclusions about changes in farm income presented the worst case scenario, suggesting that some states would take much longer to become net farm income winners.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Some states would take longer because the model assumed that farmers would continue to grow whatever crops they previously produced or currently were producing and that production on new acreage would simply reflect their historical growing patterns, even when this would cause a loss of income. However, if allowed to produce for the marketplace rather than for the government, farmers would not use their acreage to produce any crop that resulted in a negative income. If there is no alternative crop available to generate a net profit from production on the new acreage, the farmer's rational decision would be to leave that land idle rather than produce a crop at a loss. Therefore, our model showed income losses for farmers when, at worst, there would have been no gain.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In estimating the additional economic activity generated by increases in farm income, we assumed that most, though not all, of the new product would be sold overseas to meet the growing demand for food in Africa and the Pacific Rim. While it is true that increased production could trigger faster development of new consumer products and new uses for the domestic market as well as for the international market, we estimate only the increase in economic activity that would be derived from increases in exports.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Heritage analysis is based on the gross business multiplier of all agricultural exports developed by Gerald Schluter and William Edmondson of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. Their multiplier factor is based on a recognition that "in a highly interrelated economy like that of the United States, many more people benefit from agricultural exports than just farmers and exporters and their employees."  Schluter and Edmondson point specifically to firms that provide materials and services used by farmers and others to provide the export goods as beneficiaries of increased economic activity that leads to business growth, in addition to businesses which sell consumer goods and find that customers spend more when trade expands.<sup>2</sup>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The House of Representatives this week will consider 
H.R. 2854, the Agriculture Market Transition Act, to reform the nation's farm programs. This bill is 
companion legislation to the Senate-passed farm bill, S. 1541, the Agricultural Reform and 
Improvement Act of 1996, which falls far short of significant reform. S. 1541 also includes many 
costly nutrition, rural development, and environmental provisions that were added to get it passed 
in the Senate. Lawmakers in the House now have the opportunity to rectify the deficiencies of the 
Senate bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Both S. 1541 and H.R. 2854 replace traditional subsidies 
for the four major crops -- wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice -- with a system of fixed, declining 
payments through the year 2002. They also would eliminate acreage reduction programs. These 
reforms would give producers the needed flexibility to make planting decisions based on the 
demands of consumers rather than on supply controls from Washington, which have idled millions 
of acres of productive U.S. farmland and undermined U.S. agricultural competitiveness in world 
markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; However, both bills also retain the marketing loan 
provisions for the four major crops, in addition to soybeans. Marketing loans allow producers to 
repay to the government only what they receive for their crops, even if it is less than the amount of 
the loan, and pocket the difference. Retaining these marketing loans means that cotton and rice 
producers, in particular, would be able to circumvent the payment limitation. Leaving this 
mechanism in place runs the risk that future loan rates might exceed the market-clearing level, 
causing the United States either to lose export markets or to force the taxpayer to finance wasteful 
government-stimulated overproduction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Furthermore, neither the Senate-passed bill nor the bill 
pending in the House reforms the $1.5 billion-a-year Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); 
instead, both merely cap it at the current 36.4 million acres. Only about 7 million of the acres in the 
CRP are highly erodible, while the majority -- or close to 20 million acres -- constitute some of the 
most productive land in the United States. The remaining acres are quite capable of sustainable 
production if used in conjunction with appropriate conservation practices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Senate bill also retains permanent law. This means 
that, if no further legislative action is taken before 2002, farm programs would revert to the 1938 
and 1949 Acts, leading to the return of traditional subsidy and supply control policies. As reported 
out of the House Agriculture Committee, H.R. 2854 repeals permanent law. If the Senate provision 
prevails over the House version, supporters of a centrally planned agriculture in the future could 
point to any slight downturn in commodity prices or land values as justification for returning to 
government controls. The only way to prevent a return to these failed policies is to repeal 
permanent law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Unfortunately, both S. 1541 and H.R. 2854 reauthorize 
the sugar and peanut programs for seven years, with only inconsequential reforms. Although both 
bills do terminate marketing allotments for sugar and implement a one cent-per-pound penalty on 
forfeited sugar, they also freeze the support price at a level roughly twice the world market price 
rather than legislate any real reduction or phase-down. In the case of peanuts, for instance, both 
bills reduce the quota support rate from $678 a ton to $610 a ton, still well above the world price, 
and fail to reform the restrictive quota program. Moreover, while the Senate bill also fails to reform 
the dairy program, the dairy provisions included in H.R. 2854 actually would expand the extent of 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

<b>Costly Add-ons to the Senate Bill</b> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Several costly items are attached to the Senate bill. S. 
1541 authorizes an additional $1.4 billion for a new Environmental Quality Incentive Program, 
supposedly intended to make it easier for farmers and ranchers to apply for assistance with 
conservation projects. The Senate bill also reauthorizes the food stamp program for seven years 
without any reform. Although traditionally considered in conjunction with the commodity 
programs, the food stamp program was added to the bill on the Senate floor to gain additional votes 
and without any consideration of how this might affect overall reform of the welfare delivery 
system. Finally, S. 1541 creates a new Fund for Rural America, authorizing $300 million for the 
next three years to be used for housing and infrastructure grants and loans. None of these provisions 
is included in the House bill. As there is no need to move these provisions at this time to meet the 
deadline of the 1996 crop season, they should be dealt with in a separate piece of legislation. 

<p>
<b>The House's Opportunity</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The House is expected to consider H.R. 2854, the 
Agriculture Market Transition Act, as early as February 28. If the House Rules Committee 
approves a rule allowing for amendments, there would be an opportunity to provide greater reform 
in the House bill than was achieved in the Senate. If there is such a rule, the House can achieve real 
reform of agricultural policy by taking the following actions:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Conservation Reserve Program.</b> The House should include a provision that would 
give producers the flexibility to remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program. 
Farmers holding CRP contracts on such land should be given the option to withdraw from the 
program. The millions of sustainable acres in the program should be eligible for planting now, 
when demand for U.S. grain and oilseeds is at record levels. The government should not stand in 
the way of this opportunity to produce for strong prices and growing markets.
<p>
<li><b>Sugar and Peanut Programs.</b> Real reform of these programs can be accomplished by 
providing market-driven transitional phase-downs of support prices and elimination of restrictive 
quotas and allotments. Without such reform, the existing sugar cartel -- a handful of wealthy 
processors -- will continue to determine who has the right to produce sugar in this country, and the 
peanut quota system will continue to restrict production to a limited few, based on inheritance.
<p>
<li><b>Dairy Program.</b> The House should scrap the provisions in H.R. 2854 which expand 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry and replace that section of the bill 
with a program that phases out the subsidy system and eliminates the archaic Milk Marketing Order 
system. To phase out the subsidies without getting rid of the marketing orders means that the 
government continues to manipulate the dairy markets and to determine winners and losers, putting 
dairy farmers in certain regions of the country at an unfair disadvantage.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Marketing Loan Program.</b> The House should eliminate the marketing loans for 
wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, and oilseeds, thus eliminating the huge payments that circumvent 
the payment limitations and go primarily to the wealthiest farmers. 
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; With minor exceptions, the Senate has failed to reform 
agricultural policy in its version of the farm bill. However, the House has an opportunity to make 
significant changes in the bill reported out of the House Agriculture Committee. Lawmakers should 
seize that opportunity to craft a farm bill that lets farmers and consumers in the market, rather than 
bureaucrats in Washington, determine what should be grown and produced in America and where 
that production should take place.

<h3>HOW THE PROPOSED DAIRY "REFORM" WILL IMPOSE HEAVY COSTS ON 
AMERICANS</h3>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The <a href="http://www.house.gov">House of 
Representatives</a> is scheduled this week to consider <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov">H.R. 
2854</a>, the Agricultural Market Transition Act, as part of the reauthorization of the nation's farm 
programs. In several respects, the legislation is similar to the "Freedom to Farm" provisions 
included in the Balanced Budget Act, in that H.R. 2854 would lead to significant and valuable 
reforms of some farm programs, particularly those covering wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Unfortunately, H.R. 2854 does not include necessary 
reforms of the indefensible sugar, peanut, or conservation reserve programs. Worse still, the dairy 
provisions of H.R. 2854, as reported out of the House Agriculture Committee, not only fail to 
provide any reform of the dairy program, but instead would greatly expand the extent of 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry. This approach is wholly 
inconsistent with the fundamental premise of H.R. 2854, which is to provide for a transition away 
from government control over agriculture. It also departs from the approach of the Freedom to 
Farm legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Specifically, the dairy provisions do not move toward a 
market-oriented economy in any manner. Nor is there even an attempt to provide changes equitable 
with what is being done for some other agricultural commodities. Instead, H.R. 2854 artificially 
raises prices for producers through unprecedented mandates, unwarranted manipulation of the 
market, and increased government regulation that benefits a few narrow interests at the expense of 
processors, consumers, and taxpayers. To read the press releases coming out of the House 
Agriculture Committee, one would think that real reform of the dairy program would be achieved 
by this legislation. But the true nature and costs of these anti-competitive proposals are not 
disclosed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By law, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is 
required to estimate the direct costs of the dairy provisions on processors and manufacturers of 
dairy products. The CBO estimates that the extra cost of $800 million to $1.1 billion annually 
imposed on processors and manufacturers will be passed on to consumers. This estimate is derived 
from the bill's requirement that milk sold for fluid uses contain greater amounts of nonfat solids 
than currently required, and from a provision that would lock in higher fluid milk prices under the 
archaic Milk Marketing Order System.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As far as the CBO estimates go, they probably are 
accurate. However, because these estimates analyze only direct costs, and fail to take into account 
the cumulative effects of all the dairy provisions, they seriously understate the additional indirect 
costs that would be imposed on the dairy processing and manufacturing sector of the industry, on 
taxpayers, and on the consumer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The legislation also includes a price support increase, 
subsidized exports, and other provisions. According to some estimates, these provisions will 
impose additional costs on the processing and manufacturing industry of at least $1.4 billion 
annually, based on current prices. The CBO did not score the direct costs of these provisions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Most important, the CBO's estimates of the direct costs of 
higher mandated prices and increased regulation of the dairy industry do not take into account that a 
national mandate in the legislation would force the addition of nonfat solids to milk, as included in 
this legislation, requiring the use of an additional 400 million pounds of nonfat dry milk each year. 
The last time there was a short supply of nonfat dry milk, similar to what could be expected as a 
result of this requirement, was 1989. That episode suggests that resulting prices would be 
substantially higher than the current price used in the CBO analysis. Ultimately, fluid milk prices to 
consumers are likely to increase by roughly 50 cents per gallon. No one has estimated how such an 
increase would affect retail sales of milk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The cost of this legislation would fall most heavily on the 
poor. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1994 data indicate that dairy products account for 
over 10 percent of consumer expenditures on food products. For the poorest Americans, that 
percentage would be even higher, which means that the hidden milk tax being proposed by the 
House Agriculture Committee would hit hardest those people least able to afford it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The CBO thus has failed adequately to estimate the cost 
of this mislabeled dairy "reform" bill on processors, manufacturers, and consumers. The CBO even 
claims that the dairy provisions will save the federal treasury almost half a billion dollars, compared 
with the FY 1996 budget resolution baseline, over the next seven years. This estimate, however, 
does not account for the legislation's increased costs to the federal government's feeding and 
nutrition programs. According to USDA's estimates, the cost of child nutrition and food stamp 
programs alone would rise by $1 billion over the FY 1997-2002 time period. Women, Infants and 
Children (WIC) program costs would increase by more than $130 million over the period if the 
present caseload were maintained.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When Congress considers H.R. 2854 this week, 
lawmakers need to be aware that the legislation's present dairy provisions will impose additional 
direct costs on dairy processors, manufacturers, and consumers which far exceed the estimates 
made by the CBO. Members of Congress also need to be aware that CBO has not even considered 
the costs of the legislation to USDA's feeding and nutrition programs. This anti-reform measure, 
disguised as reform, actually could impose a hidden milk tax of almost $4 billion annually on 
consumers, passed on in the form of a 50 cent increase in the price of every gallon of milk. On top 
of that, the taxpayers will take an additional hit of close to $500 million. The House Agriculture 
Committee's dairy legislation is costly, but it is not reform.

<p>
<a  name="intro"></a><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

	As part of congressional budget reconciliation, the House Agriculture Committee considered the Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195) on September 20. This legislation, sponsored by Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), would significantly change the wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice programs. Before the legislation was considered in committee, Roberts also incorporated serious reform of the dairy program into the Act. With certain modifications, the proposal represents serious reform of America's obsolete farm programs.1<p>	Unfortunately, Chairman Roberts' attempt to provide a beginning for real reform suffered a setback when entrenched special interests, led by the National Cotton Council, succeeded in lining up a majority of the committee to vote against his bill. Nevertheless, the possibility for real reform is not yet dead, because the proposal may be considered again later this week, either by a reconvened House Agriculture Committee or by the House Budget Committee. Because a majority of the members of the House Agriculture Committee already have demonstrated their hostility to reform, the prospects for success appear better in the House Budget Committee.

<p>	Later this week, the Senate Agriculture Committee also will address budget reconciliation, and Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN), who has been an advocate of fundamental reform, may propose incorporation of a number of provisions drawn from the Freedom to Farm Act. Unlike the House, the Senate Agriculture Committee must resist the pressure of entrenched special interests and support the end of farm welfare.
<p>
	While the Freedom to Farm Act proposes reform for some programs, other important programs are overlooked. The Act does not include reform of either the sugar or peanut programs, even though these programs also face reauthorization this year and must be addressed, either in budget reconciliation or in the 1995 farm bill. Their anti-competitive and tightly controlled production systems limit the supply of these commodities while insulating these industries from the demands of the market. Removing supply restrictions will allow these industries to respond more effectively to new market opportunities and contribute to the nation's economic growth.2
<p>
	In July, during consideration of the House agriculture appropriations bill, Chairman Roberts promised reform-minded Members that they would have an opportunity to offer amendments to reform the sugar and peanut programs during floor consideration of the farm bill. These promises, and the argument that Members should wait for the farm bill to offer amendments that change agricultural policy, succeeded temporarily in slowing the drive for reform. But whether these programs are dealt with in the farm bill or in reconciliation, any proposals considered must represent real reform.
<p>
	The Agriculture Committees must not take the politically convenient course and adopt policies that preserve the anti-competitive aspects of the sugar and peanut programs. While the budget reconciliation instructions might provide the impetus for them to accept some sort of phase-down or phase-out of the more expensive commodity programs for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice, there is no similar pressure to reform the sugar, peanut, and dairy programs. These programs are different because wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice are supported through subsidies based on what is produced. This amounts to a direct transfer of funds from taxpayers to producers. In no-net-cost programs, however, the commodity is supported through tightly limited production. This amounts to a transfer of funds from consumers to producers at little or no cost to the Treasury. Nevertheless, no-net-cost programs still impose significant economic costs on the nation.
<P>
<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>
<p>
<a name="sugar"></a><b>REFORMING THE SUGAR PROGRAM</b>
<P>
	The current sugar program operates as a cartel in which a handful of wealthy processors determine who has the right to produce sugar in this country. Production is supported by loans of 18 cents per pound for raw cane and refined beet sugar, an amount determined by a formula that supposedly reflects the relative difference in producer returns for sugar beets and sugarcane. The result is a U.S. price nearly twice as high as the world price. The law requires that this program be operated at "no-net-cost" to the government, which means prices must be maintained at levels high enough to avoid forfeiture to the government. To assure this, the government imposes import quotas and a system of domestic marketing allotments to limit the amount of sugar processed for domestic use. While the amount of sugar refined may exceed the marketing allotment, it may not be sold in the United States. This further stifles domestic production.
<P>
	Because there is no cost to the taxpayers,3 defenders of the sugar program argue that it should be preserved. However, this program -- which controls sugar prices, limits imports to keep the prices high, and then dictates how much domestically produced sugar can be sold -- does impose a cost of $1.4 billion annually on U.S. consumers,4 who are forced to pay it through higher prices for products containing sugar. Moreover, consumers are not the only ones hurt. Because of its excessive subsidies, the program has forced a number of refineries that process raw sugar to close, eliminating domestic jobs and displacing workers.
<P>
	There have been discussions within certain segments of the sugar refining industry and among Agriculture Committee members about offering an alternative to the current sugar program that would reduce the support price from 18 cents per pound to 14 cents in the 1996 crop year, 13 cents in the 1997 crop year, and 12 cents in the 1998 crop year. Thus, the support price would have a floor of 12 cents per pound even though the world price is now at about 11 cents per pound and frequently has been much lower. This proposal also would terminate the sugar marketing quota and allotment program, but without making the sugar industry responsive to the world market price. It therefore fails to correct the problems of the current system.
<P>
	The sugar program is big government and corporate welfare at their worst. Almost half of its $1.4 billion in benefits goes to one percent of sugar growers. In fact, 33 growers and corporations each receive more than $1 million per year, and one Florida family received more than $65 million in one year alone.5
<P>
	The Sugar Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 1687), introduced by Representatives Dan Miller (R-FL) and Charles Schumer (D-NY), and a Senate companion bill (S. 847) introduced by Senators Judd Gregg (R-NH), Harry Reid (D-NV), and Bill Bradley (D-NJ) represent real reform that would benefit both farmers and consumers. Both the support price and the domestic marketing allotments would be eliminated immediately, allowing farmers to produce sugar to meet the demands of a free market. Unfortunately, all proposals introduced so far maintain existing import restrictions which artificially raise domestic prices for consumers. If the sugar program was eliminated, a market-oriented and internationally competitive policy would provide both reasonable sweetener prices and adequate supplies.

<a name="peanut"></a><b>REFORMING THE PEANUT PROGRAM</b>
<P>
	Incredibly, the peanut program actually restricts the right of Americans to produce peanuts. By establishing a quota system, it gives a limited few the exclusive right, based on inheritance or purchase, to produce peanuts in the United States for the U.S. market at a guaranteed high level of price support. These "quota" peanuts are supported at a much higher price ($678 per ton) than non-quota or "additional" peanuts, which are supported at $132 per ton. Only quota peanuts can be marketed in the U.S., while non-quota peanuts must be exported, sold to a processor responsible for exporting them, or sold to the government. To protect holders of peanut quotas even more from the effects of competition, peanut imports also are severely restricted. 
<P>
	 The peanut program is unfair not only to any farmer that would like to grow peanuts but cannot obtain a license, but also to those who succeed in buying or renting the right to produce peanuts. Two-thirds of those who own peanut growing licenses are not farmers, so farmers often must rent licenses from others. In fact, this usually is the most significant cost of producing peanuts. Although the cost of this program to taxpayers has been growing in recent years, the greatest cost falls on consumers who -- again -- are forced to pay higher prices.
<P>
	Proponents of maintaining the status quo are not concerned with the cost to consumers. They want to make the peanut program into another "no-net cost" program in the hope of preventing radical change. One way to do this is by merely reducing the support for quota peanuts from $678 a ton to $600 or $550 a ton. But while this approach might reduce the cost to taxpayers temporarily, based on current market prices, there is no assurance that costs would remain limited in the longer term. Nor would there be any expected reduction in the $300 million the program annually costs consumers; if world prices drop, the cost of the domestic program will increase.
<p>
	The only way to be sure that there is no cost while retaining the present structure is to restrict production further by reducing the amount of quota peanuts that can be produced. But, such a regressive action would penalize domestic consumers even more while reinforcing the barriers to entry in growing peanuts. Defenders of the status quo also have suggested that reducing the amount of quota peanuts -- in other words, reduce the supply to inflate the price -- could reduce the cost of the program.
<P>
	Such "reform" proposals are nothing but a hoax. The peanut program, like the sugar program, is beyond repair and no amount of tinkering can improve it. The only genuine reform of the peanut program is contained in the Peanut Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 2008), introduced by Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Andrew Jacobs (D-IN), and the companion Senate bill (S. 1027) introduced by Senators Hank Brown (R-CO) and Bill Bradley. These proposals would eliminate the program immediately. In addition, Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Richard Lugar have introduced S. 1188, which would phase out the quota system by the year 2000. Ending the quota and allotment systems will benefit farmers directly by removing one of the most significant costs of production -- rental of quotas -- and ending the discrimination against U.S.-grown non-quota peanuts. Eliminating the unproductive overhead costs will increase the share of consumer expenditures returned to the producer while, at the same time, increased domestic production of lower-cost peanuts will benefit the American consumer directly.

<a name="dairy"></a><b>REFORMING THE DAIRY PROGRAM</b>
<p>

	The dairy program guarantees that the federal government will purchase, at an established price, unlimited quantities of surplus cheese, butter, and dried milk. The law provides a mechanism by which the guaranteed purchase price can be lowered or raised, depending upon whether the government's purchases are expected to exceed or fall short of a preestablished level. Under no circumstance, however, can the support price drop below a floor price of $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk.
<P>
	When government guarantees that it will purchase any surplus production that cannot be sold in the marketplace, producers have no incentive to compete against each other. Thus, incentives for efficiency and innovation also disappear. Processors have no incentive to take the risks necessary to develop new products demanded by American and foreign consumers, so the industry is sluggish and unresponsive to the ever-changing demands of both domestic and international markets. 
<p>
	In addition, the nation's milk supply is regulated by an unbelievably complex and archaic system of federal milk marketing orders. Ostensibly designed to assure adequate supplies in all regions of the country, these marketing orders restrict the sale of milk between different regions. These pricing policies tend to raise the effective support price in high-cost regions of the country, encouraging farmers to increase production instead of permitting fluid milk to be shipped in profitably from lower cost regions. It is estimated that milk marketing orders cost consumers between $621 million and $851 billion in 1985 (in 1995 dollars, from $839 million to $1.15 billion).6  The program has hindered the U.S. dairy industry's ability to take advantage of the export market. There should be no restrictions on where milk is sold or marketed and no government attempts to manipulate interstate commerce in dairy products.
<p>
	However, the industry's reform proposal would make the situation even worse. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) has outlined a proposal that would eliminate price supports for butter and powder. But it would retain price support for cheese, require the Secretary of Agriculture to buy about 2.4 billion pounds of dairy products, and mandate an increase in price supports, thereby further pushing up prices. By keeping the support price on cheese and requiring additional payments when lower world market-priced butter is used to produce other U.S. products, this proposal would insulate American dairy producers from the impact of eliminating price supports on butter and powder.
<p>
	In effect, this proposal would establish a two-tiered pricing system with a lower export price on butter and nonfat dry milk and a higher domestic price on fluid milk and cheese. U.S. manufacturers of products which use nonfat dried milk would be required to pay a higher price for that ingredient than would foreign manufacturers using the same U.S. product. This amounts to imposing a "powder tax" on domestic manufacturers.
<p>
	The expectation is that decoupling nonfat dry milk and butter from support prices would cause prices for these commodities to fall to world market levels and become competitive in international trade. However, requiring a higher price on nonfat dry milk and butter used as a domestic food ingredient would lead to a two-tier system for nonfat dry milk, with a higher price for domestic purposes than for international purposes. Ice cream, cheese, or confectionery manufacturers and bakers in the U.S. would be required to pay more for nonfat dry milk used to produce their products than would manufacturers in other countries using U.S.-made nonfat dry milk.
<p>
	Such a two-tiered pricing system not only would violate the GATT agreement, but also would make it virtually impossible for U.S. manufacturers of value-added products to compete in the world market. This will discourage expansion of that increasingly important potential export market while providing even more barriers to entry for those who are not in the industry at the present time, further limiting growth in the domestic market where 98 percent of U.S. production is consumed.
<P>
	The NMPF proposal also includes consolidating the 40 or so existing milk marketing orders into 8 to 12 market order areas. There have been other suggestions that existing federal and state milk market orders be consolidated into a single national order for all milk produced in the United States, thereby dramatically increasing the federal government's control over the marketing of milk. But consolidating milk marketing orders does nothing to reduce the federal government's involvement in and regulation of the dairy industry. In fact, mere consolidation will make the already unresponsive pricing system even less responsive to market forces.
<P>
	Two recent proposals represent real reform. For a time, there was only the Dairy Freedom Act introduced by Representative Thomas Petri (R-WI), which would end the trade-restrictive marketing orders on January 1, 1996, and phase out the dairy support program over five years. More recently, however, Chairman Roberts has incorporated a dairy reform proposal by Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI), Chairman of the Dairy Subcommittee. Similar to what Chairman Roberts has proposed for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice in the Freedom to Farm Act, Gunderson's proposal would eliminate the milk marketing orders' pricing and regulatory functions on July 1, 1996, and end the price support program on January 1, 1996, replacing it with transition payments to be made over the next seven years.

<a name="concl"></a><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
	If the House and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairmen can overcome the entrenched special interests standing in the way of reform and report the Freedom to Farm Act out of their respective committees, their committees will be making history by setting the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs on the path to reform. However, the true test of sweeping, fundamental reform will come when Congress decides what to do with the sugar, peanut, and dairy programs. Incremental changes are not enough. Congress needs to adopt real reform of these programs:  either outright elimination or reform comparable to what both Chairmen have proposed for the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs. By doing so, Congress will benefit farmers and signal clearly to the rest of the world that the United States intends to pursue an aggressively pro-growth agricultural policy into the 21st century.7<p><b>Endnotes:</b><ol><li>For a complete discussion of changes needed to improve the Freedom to Farm Act, see John E.

<h3>GETTING NATO BACK TO BASICS</h3>
By John Hillen<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1067<br>
February 7, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever since the Cold War ended, the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization has been in the midst of an identity crisis. When it lost the Soviet threat in the early 
1990s, the Atlantic alliance went on a search to redefine itself. There have been many stops on this 
inchoate journey of redefinition. The Bush Administration used NATO forces, structure, and 
modus operandi to build a framework for the coalition that defeated Saddam Hussein in the Persian 
Gulf War. Since President Clinton took office, NATO has gone in even more directions. Between 
1993 and 1995, NATO acted as a combat subcontractor for the United Nations in the former 
Yugoslavia, implementing and enforcing a "no-fly zone" over Bosnia and providing close air 
support to U.N. peacekeepers. Now, of course, NATO is involved in an ambitious peace 
enforcement operation in Bosnia:  a mission for which NATO was not originally designed and in a 
country that is not a member of the Atlantic alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO has traveled far from its original mission of 
deterring a Soviet attack on Western Europe. It stands to reason that it should do so, NATO 
planners maintain, because the original raison d'etre of the alliance -- the Soviet threat -- has 
disappeared. What is needed, they argue, is to make NATO more up-to-date and more relevant to 
solving messy conflicts like Bosnia. Peacekeeping and "out-of-area" military operations (whereby 
NATO becomes involved in conflicts outside the treaty area) are supposed to save NATO from 
irrelevance. Unless NATO adapts to new circumstances, they aver, it will wither away and become 
extinct.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These advocates of a trendier NATO have it backwards. 
Unless NATO returns to its core mission, it will not survive. That mission is to preserve the 
freedom and security of Europe as a whole -- to prevent the general conflagration of Europe -- and 
not to put out every brushfire that breaks out in every corner of the continent. Put in the parlance of 
the strategist, NATO's core mission is to prevent the domination of Europe by a hostile power or 
bloc of powers which strive to deny the continent of its overall freedom and security.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That mission -- preserving the basic security condition of 
Europe -- is as relevant today as it was during the Cold War. Moreover, it is especially important in 
defining the American role in European security and NATO. The U.S. has a vital interest in the 
freedom and security of Europe regardless of whether a hostile attack is imminent. Who is to say 
whether Russia or some other country may or may not be a threat to Europe ten or twenty years 
from now?  It is not the immediacy of the threat that counts, but the depth of America's vital interest 
in the basic security condition of Europe. If even a potential threat to that interest exists, the U.S. 
must be prepared to deter major power aggression and defend European security and freedom. It 
makes no sense for America to leave Europe and return, as it did in the last two world wars, only 
when Europe is in flames and the threat is practically on America's doorstep. It is far better to keep 
100,000 troops in Europe to maintain the peace than to send 1 million GIs to fight a European war 
that broke out in America's absence.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The more NATO drifts away from this core mission, the 
less likely it will survive in the long run. It will not work to create new roles and missions for which 
the alliance is poorly suited and in which the U.S. is reluctant to become involved. Military make-
work will cause the interests of alliance members to diverge and will accelerate the demise of the 
alliance. If peacekeeping and other crisis management operations take NATO too far afield of its 
core mission, the cohesion of the alliance will be diluted and the U.S. will lose interest over time. 
Getting NATO involved in "out-of-area" operations for their own sake will not do the trick either. 
Having a baby to save the marriage is neither good family practice nor a sound basis for military 
strategy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO needs to get back to basics. It needs to refocus on 
its core mission of ensuring that peace and freedom in Europe as a whole are not threatened by a 
hostile power. The greatest threat to NATO's cohesion today is the possibility of failure in 
Bosnia.<sup>1 </sup>  No other issue has such a potential to tear NATO apart -- not the debate over 
NATO enlargement or disagreements about how to handle the Russians. If NATO trips up today, it 
will not be over a disagreement concerning its core mission, but over some tangential but 
seemingly urgent problem (like Bosnia) which Europeans and Americans mistook as being 
fundamentally and strategically important to the security and freedom of Europe as a whole.
<p>
<b>Why NATO? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO countries need to explain to their peoples why 
NATO is needed regardless of what happens in Bosnia. American leaders in particular need not 
only to articulate more clearly to a skeptical public why NATO should exist, but also to establish 
clearer principles for when the U.S. should or should not become involved in Europe's wars. In 
addition, leaders should make an effort to define how America will become involved in other 
European security affairs. This will promote a clearer and more sensible division of labor that can 
be understood by Americans and Europeans. Accomplishing these tasks would give NATO 
direction and purpose. There are three reasons why NATO should exist. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #1:</b>  NATO is needed as insurance to 
maintain the freedom and security of Europe. This is vitally important to the freedom and security 
of the United States. A Europe dominated by any power hostile to America, her interests, and her 
values would be a direct threat to the security, stability, and prosperity of the United States itself. 
America fought two world wars and sustained over 40 years of a Cold War military commitment to 
prevent Europe's domination. It should be no less committed to this goal today, even though the 
immediacy of the threat has diminished.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO is a strategic insurance policy. Insurance exists to 
protect against catastrophe, no matter how remote the threat may be. Because the cost of 
catastrophe is so high, people are willing to pay insurance premiums to protect them in case it 
strikes. Even when the likelihood of a household fire is remote, most people still take out fire 
insurance because the cost of a fire is so devastating, and far greater than the cost of the premiums.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So it is with NATO. The threat today in Europe is not as 
great as it once was, but neither are the premiums. One hundred thousand troops deployed in 
Europe today is far more economical, both in blood and treasure, than the cost a world war would 
impose on America tomorrow. Twice this century, Americans have seen what happens when fire 
sweeps over Europe. Anything that would prevent such a catastrophe would be well worth the 
price. Indeed, for this reason, NATO is even better than insurance. It actually helps to prevent 
catastrophe. That makes it a double bargain. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #2:</b>  NATO is needed to provide general 
economic and political stability in Europe, which is vitally important to the U.S. economy. A major 
power threat to Europe would cause economic disruption that would be devastating to U.S. markets 
and economic stability. The U.S. economy is greatly dependent on the economic stability of 
America's principal trading partners, and access to trade and resources in Europe is a vital 
American interest. Europe is America's second largest trading region and accounts for billions of 
dollars in two-way trade per year. Many millions of jobs in the United States are directly dependent 
upon American trade with Europe and European investment in the U.S. The prosperity of America 
depends in large measure on a free and prosperous Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #3:</b>  NATO is an important vehicle for 
consolidating and spreading freedom and democracy in Europe. While NATO ultimately is an 
alliance of collective defense, it also is a functional vehicle for promoting democracy and freedom 
in Europe. It is not only practically important from the standpoint of providing stability in Europe, 
but it has a moral component as well. NATO is an organization of democratic states and a reflection 
of America's identity in the world, an anchor for American values both abroad and at home. This 
stability, born of political freedom and economic prosperity, should be brought by NATO to 
Central Europe, a region historically characterized by political instability.
<P>
<b>When Should America Become Involved? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; It is not enough to know that America should remain in 
the NATO alliance. The far more pressing problem is to know when and under what circumstances 
U.S. combat troops should or should not become involved in a range of military operations in 
Europe. In order to have a coherent strategy and promote a sensible division of labor in Europe, the 
U.S. should adhere to some basic guidelines. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #1:</b>  America's principal military role is 
to serve NATO's core mission of collective defense. The main mission of the U.S. armed forces in 
Europe should be to prevent Europe from falling victim to a hostile hegemonic power. Thus, 
America's main military mission is collective defense -- to protect NATO member states from a 
major power threat. While the U.S. should never rule out participation in less threatening scenarios 
or turn its back on out-of-area operations, in general it should concentrate its military efforts on 
achieving NATO's core military mission. This will lend definition and purpose to NATO and the 
American role.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #2:</b>  U.S. forces must make a unique 
contribution to the military operation. As a rule, if U.S. forces duplicate the efforts of European 
allies that can provide the same capabilities, the European forces should get the nod. The United 
States is NATO's military leader because of its unique and powerful military capabilities. It is not 
just another European military power; it is a world power with many strategic commitments. A 
significant U.S. military role in NATO must be guided by the singular capabilities that America can 
bring to bear.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #3:</b>  The U.S. force contribution should 
be decisive. The use of large numbers of American combat forces should make the difference 
between winning and losing or drawing. If the American people perceive an American-led NATO 
chasing peripheral security crises with the reluctant participation of prosperous European allies, 
public support for NATO will erode quickly. The U.S. military role in NATO must be a unique and 
decisive contribution towards the core mission of the alliance.
<p>
<b>Enlarging NATO. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Expanding the Atlantic alliance to include Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia would enhance NATO's capability to perform its core 
mission of defending the basic security condition of Europe. The profound geopolitical security and 
stability this will bring to Central Europe far outweighs the technical and financial difficulties of 
limited enlargement. To do this, the Clinton Administration must stop dragging its feet. Clinton has 
taken the exclusive counsel of his fears and has given too much weight to complaints from 
Russians who oppose NATO enlargement. The President has given Russia a <i>de facto</i> veto 
and has used the Partnership for Peace plan as little more than a bureaucratic delaying tactic. 
Clinton needs to act now by making a political commitment to these four Central European states 
and demonstrating the same kind of vision and courage that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
President George Bush showed in pressing for German unification in the face of Soviet opposition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A NATO Revitalization Act. To spur the President to 
revitalize NATO, the Congress needs to act. The Clinton Administration has not done a good job of 
giving NATO a sense of purpose and mission in the post-Cold War era. The Congress should 
consider passing a NATO Revitalization Act that not only spells out the reasons for the American 
people about why the U.S. should be involved in NATO, but also clearly defines the strategic role 
of the U.S. in fulfilling NATO's core mission of collective defense. This Act also should define the 
principles governing U.S. military participation in NATO, thereby urging the Europeans to take 
more responsibility for peacekeeping and other marginal military missions. Finally, it should call 
expressly for the rapid inclusion of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in NATO 
and substantial modification of the Clinton Administration's Partnership for Peace program.
<p>


<b>NATO'S IDENTITY CRISIS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has proven to be 
the most effective security alliance of modern times. Its stated aim was to "safeguard the freedom, 
common heritage and civilization of [its] peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, 
individual liberty and the rule of law."  The treaty signatories also sought to "promote stability and 
well-being in the North Atlantic area" and were "resolved to unite their efforts for collective 
defense and for the preservation of peace and security."<sup>2 </sup>  That NATO achieved these 
goals with small loss of life in the face of an adversarial and expansionist Soviet Union was truly 
remarkable. Underpinning this success story was the enormous and expensive political and military 
commitment made by America to NATO, a commitment that did not waver during the many crises 
of the Cold War.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is the ironic fate of alliances that their success ultimately 
can spell the end of their existence. Such is the case with NATO, where the moment of the 
alliance's greatest triumph contained within it the seeds of the identity crisis that now threatens its 
viability and even its existence. The demise of the Soviet Union brought calls for a "peace 
dividend" the world over. Politicians and strategists proposed a restructuring of alliance 
commitments, defense requirements, and security architecture to meet the more unpredictable but 
less apocalyptic threats of the new world disorder. The American public demanded that its 
politicians focus on troubles at home. The 1992 presidential campaign was about "the economy, 
stupid," and foreign policy issues dropped out of the immediate consciousness of 
America.<sup> 3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the meantime, NATO has struggled for a post-Soviet 
identity that can inspire its members to remain completely committed. It is still not clear that this 
can be accomplished in the absence of a clear and present danger that would cause the interests of 
all NATO members to converge. Consequently, the struggle to find a new identity for the alliance 
has been marked by an inchoate and inclusive program of NATO enlargement (further muddled by 
the Partnership for Peace program), a dabbling in combat support to U.N. peacekeeping, a proposal 
to refocus NATO on the Mediterranean and the implicit threat of nationalist Islam, and the out-of-
area peace enforcement operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;None of these operations has served to inspire solid 
support for NATO from the American public and Congress. While a majority of Americans (56 
percent) support America's basic commitment to the alliance, public support for the American role 
in NATO's Bosnian intervention has peaked at around 40 percent.<sup>4 </sup>  In addition, while 
support for NATO is stable in Congress, the Bosnian mission has met strong congressional 
opposition in both the House and Senate. Many congressional leaders question the utility of an 
American-led alliance that created a supposedly vital American interest in Bosnia, an area of 
marginal strategic interest for the United States. Indeed, President Clinton used American 
leadership and credibility in NATO as the chief justification for the American role in Bosnia. 
NATO became the end in itself, no longer an appropriate means to the relative end of preventing a 
major power threat to Europe. 
<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR A WORKABLE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States needs alliances of all sorts in an 
interdependent world. Economic alliances allow the U.S. to remain the number one trading nation 
in the world and sustain American prosperity at home. Political alliances ensure that America is 
involved in decisions the world over that may influence the peace and prosperity of the United 
States. Military alliances give America partners in fighting her enemies and defending her interests, 
thereby lessening the costs to the U.S. in time of war and peace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. has many national interests throughout the world, 
but not all are equally important. The principal task of American statecraft is to discriminate among 
these interests, set strategic priorities, and choose policy options commensurate with their 
importance. Such an approach distinguishes among vital national interests, important interests, and 
marginal interests.<sup>5 </sup>  Naturally, America has a vital national interest in defending the 
physical territory and airspace of the United States and ensuring the safety and well-being of 
Americans abroad. To protect these vital interests, the U.S. should be willing to wage war if 
necessary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, the U.S. has vital national interests that lie 
beyond American shores. For both political and economic reasons, it is in America's vital national 
interest that Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf are not dominated by a hegemonic power or 
bloc of powers. It is also in America's vital national interest that the U.S. have unimpeded access to 
foreign trade and natural resources. American prosperity overwhelmingly depends on the stability 
of international markets and free trade regimes. Political scientist Benjamin Schwarz has written 
that:
<p><blockquote>
	Economic interdependence dictates security commitments. As long as world politics 
remain what they have always been, Europe and East Asia will be potentially 
unstable. And as long as U.S. prosperity is understood to depend upon the stability 
of those regions, the United States must pacify them. America's worldwide security 
commitments are a truly permanent burden.<sup>6 </sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, Schwarz and many others also recognize that 
this permanent burden ultimately could turn into a "wasting proposition."  America, without a 
coherent strategy, and in order to sustain its prosperity, will run itself ragged trying to preserve the 
stability of the entire world. Its engagement in world affairs therefore must be selective. The U.S. 
must set clear priorities that allow it to use its political capital and military forces for the tasks that 
most matter to America. If the U.S. tries to do everything, it will overextend itself and accomplish 
nothing.<sup> 7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to avoid becoming the world's policeman, the 
U.S. must operate within security alliances. These alliances must preserve the conditions necessary 
for American prosperity, and must do so by "stretching" American resources through an intelligent 
definition of America's exact role and principles for sharing burdens with allies. These alliances 
must unequivocally lay out the roles that make the most sense for America and her goals abroad. 
NATO, in particular, needs to be refocused to avoid being drawn into an expensive "wasting 
proposition" that the American people will not support.
<p>

<b>WHY NATO?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most military alliances in the world can only hope to 
attain the level of political and military credibility enjoyed by NATO. However, in order for NATO 
to sustain public and congressional support in the U.S., its fundamental purpose must be refocused. 
American leaders should explain exactly why NATO is critical and should define America's basic 
role in the alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are three principal reasons why the U.S. should be a 
member of NATO. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #1:</b>  NATO is needed as insurance to 
maintain the freedom and security of Europe. The U.S. has been a major European power 
throughout the 20th century, intervening in three world wars (two hot and one cold) to prevent a 
hostile power or bloc of powers from dominating the continent. An American commitment to this 
basic security condition of Europe is an insurance policy that works to prevent another great power 
war in Europe. The premiums that America pays on this policy are commensurate with the benefits. 
A focused and clearly defined policy will ensure this balance is retained. In fact, the costs of these 
premiums have dropped tremendously since the end of the Cold War. In 1989, the United States 
military had over 313,000 servicemembers permanently stationed in Europe. That number is now 
down to 100,000.<sup>8 </sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As with any insurance policy, the cost of being insured 
through NATO is far less than the cost of not being insured at all. A major power threat to the 
political freedom of the European continent was the condition that inevitably drew the U.S. into the 
enormously expensive campaigns of World Wars I and II and the Cold War. It is far better to have 
100,000 troops peaceably deployed in Europe now than have to commit a million later to fight a 
war that broke out in the absence of the one power that could guarantee the core security condition 
of Europe:  Less expensive to live as lodgers now than as liberators later. Even the most superficial 
and cursory look at modern history supports this view.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #2:</b>  NATO is needed to provide general 
economic and political stability in Europe, which is vitally important to the U.S. economy. A U.S. 
commitment to the collective defense of Europe is necessary to preserve the economic prosperity of 
America. The system of international trade upon which American prosperity depends is predicated 
on free, stable, and orderly political conditions. In 1993, Europe was America's second largest 
customer, taking 31 percent of American exports. It also was the U.S.'s second largest supplier, 
providing 29 percent of imports. While the U.S. runs a large trade deficit with Asia, it has relatively 
balanced trade with Europe. More important, almost 50 percent of direct American investment 
abroad is in Europe, and over 60 percent of direct foreign investment in the U.S. comes from 
Europe. Finally, and closer to home, nearly 3 million Americans are employed in the U.S. by 
European-owned firms, and another 1.5 million American workers are supported directly by U.S. 
exports to Europe.<sup> 9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A great power threat to Europe would cause the wholesale 
disruption of the European economic order. The stability of world markets and international trade 
depend on a stable and thriving Europe. The United States cannot afford to cut itself off from the 
world market. Neither could the U.S. long sustain its economic growth if Europe as a whole were to 
enter an economic crisis born of insecurity or protracted instability. America's very standard of 
living depends on stable international financial and commodity markets, of which Europe is a 
critical element. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #3:</b>  NATO is an important vehicle for 
consolidating and spreading freedom and democracy in Europe. America's defense of Europe 
through NATO strengthens America's values and identity as a nation. NATO is a community of 
democratic nations. It is based on a common set of ideals that originated in European thought but 
have become uniquely American. Helping to secure these ideals in Europe anchors the values of 
freedom and democracy at home, giving them a larger life on the world stage, and by so doing 
deepens their roots in America's own political culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to reinforcing these ideals and values, 
American commitment to NATO serves as a solidly practical vehicle for expanding democracy and 
freedom. NATO represents not only a "zone of peace and security," but a "zone of democracy" as 
well. Democratic systems and market economies produce free and prosperous societies and are 
stabilizing forces that serve to lessen tensions and prevent the conflicts NATO is intended to deter. 
While the main mission of NATO, as a defensive alliance, is not to crusade for democracy, it must 
be recognized that democracy is both a cause and effect in NATO. An alliance of free and 
democratic nations that wish to preserve their political and economic systems, NATO provides the 
security and stability in which democracy and economic prosperity can flourish.
<p>

<b>THE U.S. ROLE IN NATO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these compelling reasons for American 
involvement in NATO, the American public will not support such a commitment if it is not 
supported by a clear and coherent military strategy. A commitment that does not discriminate 
between situations where American power is necessary and those where it is merely a substitute for 
that of reluctant Europeans will cause the American people to balk at an expensive transatlantic 
responsibility. A recent poll by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy 
Attitudes shows that over 70 percent of Americans believe the United States should work 
principally through alliances or coalition structures to relieve America of some of its security 
burden. More conclusively, 71 percent of Americans said the U.S. is playing the role of world 
policeman "more than it should be."<sup>10 </sup>  Americans want multilateral security structures 
that make sense for America. This means working through military alliances, not the United 
Nations. Americans want the U.S. involved in alliances where the U.S. role is clearly understood, 
the burden is shared, and American participation is essential for success.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans need to understand clearly the criteria that 
determine the American role in NATO and NATO's role in Europe. In the identity crisis that has 
characterized NATO's search for a post-Cold War role, many new or revised missions have been 
entertained and questions raised. Should NATO operate only in its traditional area of operations, or 
should it consider out-of-area missions?  Should NATO concentrate on traditional notions of 
military deterrence and warfighting, or should it engage in peacekeeping, peace enforcement, and 
military operations other than war?  Should NATO extend its nuclear guarantee to new members or 
associate members? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These questions are based on the search for relevant and 
viable missions that would justify the existence of NATO in the absence of a threat to its core role 
as a defensive alliance. As guidelines for determining the future American role in NATO, they 
completely miss the point. The U.S. role in NATO, a fundamentally American alliance, should be 
determined by principles of engagement, not by geographic parameters or mission types. Stating 
that the U.S. will undertake NATO operations only in certain areas or will not participate in certain 
types of missions unnecessarily limits American flexibility. Instead, the American role should be 
considered through guidelines that point the way to a successful and sensible role in 
NATO.<sup>11 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #1:</b>  America's principal military role is 
to serve NATO's core mission of collective defense. NATO's mission is collective defense, not 
collective security. Collective defense seeks to tie many nations to a collaborative effort in 
defending their territory. It is inherently limited, focused, and reactive in its political nature. The 
missions of collective defense are straightforward and focused:  defend members from outside 
attack. Collective defense seeks to deter through military strength and defeat an aggressor when 
deterrence fails. Collective defense organizations cannot afford to do anything except succeed 
spectacularly. Any other result amounts to failure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Collective security arrangements are different from 
collective defense. They seek to provide a forum through which members can organize cooperative 
responses to security problems, especially those below the threshold of war. Collective security 
missions can include many quasi-military efforts such as humanitarian intervention, support for 
nation-building, peacekeeping, and peace-enforcement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States already is involved in a collective 
security organization in Europe, and it is not NATO. It is the 54-member Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Established in 1973, the OSCE has become increasingly 
institutionalized since the end of the Cold War. It is an organization that can act as a forum in 
which the nations of Europe can coordinate and integrate their common efforts towards preserving 
peace and stability. Along these lines, it has undertaken very limited fact-finding, sanctions-
monitoring, and observation missions in the former Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, 
Ukraine, Albania, and even Chechnya.<sup> 12</sup>  However, the OSCE is viewed largely as a 
toothless talking-shop. There is too much disparity among its members to institutionalize the 
military resources and structures needed for more significant military operations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The failure of the OSCE and the United Nations (another 
collective security organization) to deal competently with problems like Bosnia has thrust NATO 
into the picture. In short, events are taking NATO down the road to becoming something it never 
was:  a collective security organization. By default, not design, NATO has been consigned to fill 
the collective security gap in Europe. This means that NATO might become involved in even more 
ambiguous security missions like Bosnia. As it does so, it will find that the inevitable divergence of 
opinion over these operations will dilute its unique and formidable cohesion. NATO drew its 
strength from its core identity, which united all members. A lack of focus on its principal mission 
of collective defense will continue to weaken the alliance. As one U.N. scholar recently recognized, 
"NATO's biggest advantage over the UN, historically, has been agreement on some clearly defined 
defensive purposes, whereas the UN has an almost infinite range of responsibilities."<sup>13 </sup> 
 Using NATO for contentious collective security missions will only serve to erode that unique 
advantage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. public and Congress will not support an 
American-led alliance running hither and yon from one media-generated crisis to another and 
lacking criteria for distinguishing the roles of America and its European allies. The U.S. should 
refocus its role in NATO on the core mission:  to prevent a major power threat to Europe by a 
hostile power or bloc of powers. While U.S. participation in NATO peacekeeping operations 
should not be ruled out, it should be undertaken only if participation affects NATO's core mission 
or some other vital U.S. national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #2:</b>  U.S. forces must make a unique 
contribution to the military operation. The United States is the only military superpower in the 
world today. It has an enormous edge in intelligence-gathering systems, military technology, and 
the size, lethality, and professionalism of its armed forces. No other nation alone, and few 
combined, can challenge the combined air, land, sea, and space-based military capability of the 
U.S. But while America's military capabilities are enormous, they also are thinly spread. The Soviet 
threat has collapsed, but global U.S. military commitments remain. The U.S. military has been 
reduced by over one-third since the end of the Cold War and has been greatly strained in trying to 
honor its commitments with such a reduced force. This situation is made worse by the defense cuts 
imposed by the Clinton Administration -- cuts that underfund President Clinton's own strategy by 
some $150 billion over five years.<sup>14 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since American military forces are stretched thin, the U.S. 
must deploy them only when their capabilities and effect are unique. As a rule, America should not 
duplicate the efforts of the European powers. If an American infantry battalion is needed to balance 
a NATO force on paper, but does not make a unique contribution to the force, it should not be 
deployed in place of a similar European unit. The United States is not just another European power; 
it is a world power with unique capabilities and a unique role in European security. The division of 
labor in NATO military operations should be based on this premise. The intention is not to help the 
U.S. shirk mundane tasks, but to ensure that the American public see clearly that, to paraphrase 
Lyndon Johnson, "American boys aren't dying where French boys should."  The intention of an 
intelligent division of labor in NATO is to preserve, at all costs, the fundamental American security 
guarantee to Europe. To do that, Americans must be convinced that every NATO nation is pulling 
the wagon in the best way it can, and is not merely along for the ride. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Does this mean that America would lose its leadership role 
in NATO, consigning itself to a specialist's role in the alliance?  Not at all. The U.S. need not match 
the Danes infantry battalion for infantry battalion to exert its leadership. At times the U.S. may need 
to deploy a large American combat formation in order to exercise its leadership in a NATO 
coalition of forces, even if the French, British, or Germans can match the size and type of 
contribution on paper. This is a unique contribution because it demonstrates the seriousness of the 
U.S. military commitment in a way that air, sea, or support forces cannot. A leader reserves his 
talents, time, and resources for important tasks that only he may be able to accomplish. It is good 
teamwork, but not always good leadership, for a leader to duplicate the efforts of others to the 
detriment of his unique responsibilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #3:</b>  The U.S. force contribution should 
be decisive. The last principle that should guide American military operations in NATO is that the 
American contribution should be decisive. The American military effort must make the difference 
between winning and losing or drawing. Ultimately, American support for a rich and prosperous 
NATO alliance cannot be sustained if the American public and Congress see that the basic security 
condition of Europe can be guaranteed without the United States. If that is the case, it is time for the 
United States to come home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States military contribution should push the 
effort over the top. In some cases, this may mean the limited deployment of special capabilities that 
dramatically enhance and multiply the effectiveness of a European-dominated coalition. For 
example, the U.S. may wish to deploy intelligence, logistics, air, sea, and specialized combat 
support units to assist a European effort in out-of-area peacekeeping. In the core missions of 
NATO, the U.S. may need to dominate the force structure, base its operations on American 
command and control structures, and take the lead in determining strategy and operations. This was 
the arrangement in the Persian Gulf War. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics might argue that this distinction robs the United 
States of a leadership role in day-to-day European events and reserves U.S. influence for some 
cataclysmic battle for Europe's future. Once again, this presents a narrow reading of the principle of 
a decisive role and discounts the role that competent American leadership can play in Europe. The 
United States can exercise American leadership in NATO and European security affairs in many 
ways. American diplomacy, political influence, and economic tools all can be decisive in conflicts 
outside of a great power threat to Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, randomly deploying American military forces 
on peripheral missions in order to "fill out" a European force structure and "preserve American 
leadership" will erode American support for NATO. It traps the U.S. into having always to "lead" 
in even the most marginal operations, because European security systems have no other viable 
alternative. In a recent address to Congress, President Jacques Chirac of France seemed to support 
this line of reasoning, stating that reform of NATO would "enable the European allies to assume 
full responsibilities, with the support of NATO facilities, whenever the United States does not wish 
to engage its ground forces."<sup>15 </sup>  America leads in NATO because of the conditions that 
leadership engenders, conditions that must be favorable to the United States. Leadership is not an 
end in itself.
<p>


<b>EXPANDING THE EUROPEAN ZONE OF PEACE AND FREEDOM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The immediate enlargement of NATO to include Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia would bring a level of stability and security to Central 
Europe that the region has never enjoyed throughout its tortured history. In short, it would expand 
the zone of peace and freedom that NATO has provided for Western Europe for almost 50 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, those who take a skeptical view of NATO 
enlargement raise questions about provoking Russia and drawing a "new Iron Curtain in Europe."  
They also point to the technical and financial difficulties involved in military integration and 
NATO interoperability. Other critics maintain that the countries of the former Warsaw Pact have 
not yet shown a sustained commitment to free market economies, democratic political institutions, 
and civilian control of the military.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The naysayers of NATO enlargement are making the same 
mistakes that opponents of German reunification made in 1990. At that time, it was widely thought 
that the Soviet Union would never accept a unified Germany. At most the Soviets might accept a 
long-term plan for confederation within a neutral Germany.<sup>16 </sup>  Among the many dire 
warnings that came from the Soviets was the prediction by then Foreign Minister Eduard 
Shevardnadze that "Europe could come again to ruin on German soil."  British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher and French President Franois Mitterand were adamantly opposed to German 
unification; many Germans balked at the tremendous costs to be borne by the West German 
taxpayer; and even after the reunification plan was announced, Soviet President Gorbachev warned 
the U.S. that a reunified Germany in NATO would be an absolutely "unacceptable shift in the 
balance of power."<sup>17 </sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ten months later, in October 1990, reunification was fact. 
More significantly, the reunified Germany was not some neutral European entity, but a leading 
NATO member. What was unthinkable to the world less than a year before was neatly 
accomplished due to the driving leadership and vision of President George Bush and Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. A comprehensive strategy was undertaken adroitly by these two leaders. President 
Bush in particular put forward a three-part plan which ensured that Germany would not work issues 
in isolation from the Soviets, that the Soviets would not feel forced into a corner, and that a unified 
Germany must be a full member of NATO.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This courageous approach should have been adopted for 
NATO enlargement from the beginning. In fact, the window of opportunity for bringing a 
guarantee of peace and stability to Central Europe is rapidly disappearing. The Clinton 
Administration has dragged its feet on NATO enlargement, taking the exclusive counsel of its fears. 
The Administration had hoped that the soft line on NATO enlargement would encourage Russian 
democratic reforms and make enlargement "easier" in the future. In essence, President Clinton has 
given Russia a veto over how, when, and where NATO will enlarge, ostensibly to gain Russian 
cooperation in Bosnia and stop a hard-line trend that already has occurred and is getting 
worse.<sup> 18</sup>  However, it is clear that being soft on NATO enlargement has not stopped 
the Russian drift away from democratic reforms. The election results in the Russian Duma and the 
appointment of hard-liner Yevgeny Primakov as Russian Foreign Minister should give notice that 
the trend is most likely in the other direction.<sup>19 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. needs a plan to admit Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, and Slovakia as soon as possible. The first pillar of this plan would offer full 
membership for these countries. To be sure, there will be technical difficulties, and these countries 
will put a financial burden on NATO. However, the costs are far outweighed by the greater 
geopolitical good of NATO enlargement. Full NATO membership for these Central European 
countries will bring them a security and stability they have never known.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A purely military line that distinguishes NATO from non-
NATO should stop for the time being after the admission of these four countries. As with German 
reunification, Russia must be convinced that while she has no veto, she is a partner in Europe and 
her security concerns are a consideration. Limited NATO enlargement will make it clear that 
enlargement is not intended to encircle Russia with an adversarial alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To reinforce this point, NATO must modify the 
Partnership for Peace program (PFP) by dropping its membership provision. Other useful aspects of 
PFP, such as association through defense cooperation, should be retained. PFP offers an official 
association with NATO and the implicit guarantee of full membership. However, it also perpetuates 
a damaging myth:  that NATO eventually can include every part of the former Soviet Union 
(including Russia). Such a move is unsound for several reasons. Admitting all the PFP states to 
NATO would dilute the cohesion of NATO as a focused alliance of collective defense. A NATO of 
some 40 nations, including Russia or other former Soviet Republics, would be a collective security 
organization as unwieldy and ineffective as the OSCE or U.N. NATO cannot be all things to all 
people; if it attempts to do so, it will lose the unique and formidable cohesion that makes it the most 
functional military alliance in existence.
<p>

<b>TOWARD A REVITALIZED NATO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has failed to develop a sound 
strategy for NATO. Lacking a practical vision for America's role in Europe, President Clinton has 
taken the alliance in dangerous directions. If the present course is not changed, it could threaten the 
survival of the alliance. To give NATO badly needed focus in the post-Cold War era, Congress 
needs to step into the breach opened by the President's failure to articulate a coherent NATO 
strategy. Congress should consider, as an amendment to the FY 1997 Defense authorization bill, a 
NATO Revitalization Act that:
<p><ul>
<li>Spells out America's vital national interests in Europe, explains the reasons for America's 
participation in NATO and the U.S. strategic role, and states that NATO is a political insurance 
policy that ensures Europe will not be dominated by a hostile power or bloc of powers;
<p>
<li>Defines the principles governing U.S. military participation in NATO, states that any 
significant American combat force commitment to a NATO operation must be firmly grounded in 
NATO's core mission of collective defense, and recognizes that U.S. forces must make a unique 
and decisive contribution to NATO military action;
<p>
<li>Encourages the Europeans to take lead roles in addressing marginal and peripheral security 
problems while guaranteeing an active U.S. support role in these endeavors; 
<p>
<li>Offers immediate NATO membership to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia 
and drops the implicit guarantee of membership for other countries in the Partnership for Peace 
program.
</ul><P>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO is an American alliance. It is a tool that America 
needs to defend its vital national interests in Europe. It does not need charity work in the form of 
attempting to reinvent itself as a pan-European alliance of collective security. NATO protects the 
political freedom and economic prosperity of the United States, and serves as an effective means to 
this end.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO needs to get back to basics. In the absence of a 
clear and present danger to Europe, it has lost its focus. It has tried to become relevant by 
embarking on military make-work programs for the United Nations, and now on its own behalf. 
These diffuse efforts have diluted NATO's cohesion and caused U.S. public support for the alliance 
to erode.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A NATO Revitalization Act will refocus the alliance and 
preserve American support for the U.S. role in Europe. It will enhance this support by laying out 
principles guiding U.S. military action in NATO. These criteria will serve to put forth a clearly 
understood and sensible division of labor in NATO that will keep the alliance strong. This strong, 
cohesive, and focused NATO must undertake limited enlargement to extend the zone of peace, 
security, and freedom to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. This will enhance 
NATO as an alliance of collective defense. Forestalling enlargement and failing to refocus NATO 
will, at best, turn the alliance into an incohesive and emasculated collective security organization 
that bears no resemblance to its robust predecessor.

<h3> What Are America's Vital Interests?</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, Ph.D.
<P>
Delivered February 6, 1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tonight I would like to outline a conservative internationalist foreign policy anchored in the foundation of vital American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I define those vital interests as developments that could concretely affect the security or economic future of America and our citizens. Before giving you my list of American vital interests, let me first touch upon the growing drift in U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. In other words, let's review current policy.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clinton's foreign policy has been formulated by a group of retreads from the Carter Administration who were uncomfortable, unconvinced, and therefore unsuccessful in waging the Cold War against the Soviet Union. They returned to office with Clinton and believed that they could successfully reorient American foreign policy to harness the American military for what they deemed to be virtuous crusades in far-flung regions of the world. But they neglected the fact that the American people supported distant interventions during the Cold War only on behalf of important American national interests, and specifically to oppose the spread of an expansionist, ideological, totalitarian system that was publicly committed to burying us.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
American foreign policy has drifted dangerously astray, especially since 1993. A large part of the problem is that the Clinton Administration appears to be incapable of distinguishing between America's vital interests and some liberal do-gooders' marginal interests. The Administration too often has resorted to questionable military interventions to promote its peculiar vision of American values in such countries as Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia, where there were no vital American interests at stake.
<p>
<b>The New World Order </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Remember the New World Order that some American foreign policy gurus were hoping to achieve?  The rest of us ordinary folks soon learned that it was long on new and short on order. Some of us have called this the age of chaos.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I can almost point to the very moment when American foreign policy began losing its purpose. It was that defining day in Moscow -- the day when the line at McDonald's became longer than the line at Lenin's tomb. That really happened, and when it did the communism versus capitalism argument was over. The tenor of the discussion in Russia went from "We will bury you" to "Do you want fries with that?"  But with it, too, went America's organizing purpose abroad. Our prior purpose had been containment of the Soviet Union and eventually, for us conservatives, liberation of the captive nations.
<P>
<b>Isolationist Right and Interventionist Left</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the United States has been searching for an intellectual framework for its foreign policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A band of conservative isolationists on the fringe wants America to withdraw from the world altogether, while a suddenly macho band of liberal interventionists seeks to remake Haiti, Rwanda, Somalia, and the rest of the world in its own preening self-image.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The isolationist right thinks that we have few vital interests and so we shouldn't join alliances, which only entangle us. The interventionist left distrusts America's power and our vital interests and seeks to deny them by putting our troops and interests under the authority of the United Nations. Both approaches reflect a defeatist attitude of an America in decline -- a pessimistic attitude that America cannot hold its own in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fringe isolationist right hides behind protectionism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in the international world economy. The interventionist left hides behind multilateralism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in values and in the integrity of its interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The real problem, it seems to me, is that neither group has any conception of America's true vital interests in the real world today.
<p>
<b>Clinton's Foreign Policy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's foreign policy reminds me of the man who said he wanted to take assertiveness training but that his wife wouldn't let him. It variously and alternately seeks to promote human rights, alleviate human suffering, recreate history by undoing coups, build Western-style nations in places that have no Western values, stop nuclear proliferation with vague unverifiable agreements, and advance democracy and international law while raising the planet's environmental conscience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When not engaged in these activities, the U.S. State Department, under mandates from earlier liberal Congresses issues reports on America's own human rights abuses and bemoans what it calls the historical and continuing oppression of African Americans, Native Americans, and Women Americans. Meanwhile, the U.S. foreign aid bill mandates that U.S. government agencies promote "harmony among diverse racial, religious, and ethnic groups" in foreign countries -- something we can't accomplish or even define at home. Elsewhere in our foreign aid program, it's mandated that we must "include the economic empowerment of women as a factor in the evaluation of projects and programs."  We're even supposed to stop discrimination by foreign governments against people with disabilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Currently, the ultimate foreign policy test is not the vital interests of the American people, but mushy compassion. I commend to you a scathing article in the current issue of the journal <I>Foreign Affairs</I> entitled "Foreign Policy as Social Work," which rakes the Clinton Administration over the coals for its feel-good foreign policy. Written by Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign policy scholar who is no conservative and initially supported the Clinton Administration, the article lambastes the Administration for a misconceived foreign policy that is aimed at relieving suffering in conflict-ridden regions of the world rather than promoting American national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton presided over three failed military interventions in his first year in office which then set the tone and much of the agenda for this Administration's foreign policy. 
These were:
<P><ul>
<li> The announced intention and subsequent failure to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia and bomb the Bosnian Serbs in May 1993;
<p>
<li> The deaths of 18 U.S. Army Rangers in a failed Special Forces operation in Somalia in early October 1993; and
<p>
<li> The dispatch of a U.S. Navy ship carrying military trainers and its subsequent recall due to anti-American demonstrations in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in mid-October 1993.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Clinton, American foreign policy has been transformed into an international social welfare program. Clinton has expended billions of dollars and scores of American lives in these naive military interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti -- three countries where the U.S. has no vital interests at stake.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Somalia, the Clinton Administration inherited a humanitarian intervention designed to feed starving Somalians. But while President Bush sent American troops to Somalia to feed people, President Clinton clumsily escalated the mission into a doomed scenario called "nation-building."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Bosnia, Clinton has zigged and zagged so many times, nobody is sure what U.S. policy actually is. But the same mission creep that led to disaster in Somalia is built into the ambiguous U.S. intervention in Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Haiti, Clinton has chosen to commit the U.S. to bring stability and democracy by working with an unstable leader, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a country that has never had a stable democracy. Slowly, it is dawning even on the President that the only way to sustain Aristide in office is to extend the stay of U.S. troops in Haiti. Our troops have become Aristide's palace guard. The intervention has already cost an estimated $1.9 billion. This is the equivalent of almost $300 for each of Haiti's 6.5 million people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration is a hawk on Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia -- in other words, causes that require only small-scale military actions, enjoy the cover of U.N. approval, and serve no clear-cut strategic interest of the United States. And yet it is a dove when it comes to standing up to North Korea, Iran, or some other hostile power that genuinely does threaten U.S. vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That is not all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's feel-good foreign policy focuses on peripheral international issues, often to curry favor with special-interest domestic political constituencies. For example, the Administration actively has intervened in Haiti to court African-Americans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These politically motivated actions are not only an unnecessary waste. They also come at the expense of important American foreign policy interests and defense needs. Humanitarian interventions and nation-building experiments have diverted attention from key items on the American foreign policy agenda.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These key items include:
<p><ul>
<li> Bilateral relations with Russia, whose recent elections have underscored a growing anti-Western backlash;
<p>
<li> China, which is becoming increasingly aggressive and belligerent in East Asia;
<p>
<li> Iran, whose clandestine nuclear efforts and continued export of terrorism have led Congress to seize the initiative and force the Administration to impose trade sanctions;
<p>
<li> NATO, whose future now has become entangled with the future of Bosnia, a military quagmire of uncertain resolution;
<p>
<li> Missile defense, a critical element of national defense that the Administration has woefully neglected; and
<P>
<li> The promotion of free trade, which the Administration allowed to fall by the wayside when it failed to gain fast-track negotiating authority for expanding NAFTA to include Chile.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, the expanding commitment of U.S. military forces to far-flung humanitarian and peacekeeping operations has stretched thin our military forces around the globe. These commitments have also undermined our ability to respond to dangerous threats to our vital interests elsewhere. A recent article in the <I>Washington Times</I> reported that Pentagon officials are concerned that the commitment of 30,000 American troops to Bosnia and the surrounding region will seriously undermine our ability to repel aggression in the Persian Gulf or on the Korean peninsula -- you see, in military and foreign policy, everything is connected to everything else. Thus, the diversion of U.S. combat troops to peacekeeping operations depletes our strategic reserves. It erodes military readiness by interfering with training to sharpen warfighting skills.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the concerns of the Pentagon, the Administration is now considering an additional peacekeeping operation -- the deployment of U.S. troops to the Golan Heights if a peace treaty is signed by Israel and Syria. Such a deployment is dangerous. It will be either too small to defend itself if another Middle East war erupts or too big, further straining our ability to meet other military contingencies around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, it will be an inviting target for a group of terrorists -- or an official party to the treaty (I refer to Syria and not, of course, to Israel). I say inviting target because the U.S. troops would be an especially attractive "trip wire" to bring the U.S. into the conflict or to drive the U.S. home, out of our more appropriate role in the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, America now has a foreign policy as chaotic as the world itself. I do not believe such a policy can possibly offer the leadership that is needed to protect American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have a policy of good intentions, as defined by a bunch of mushy-minded liberals. But in foreign policy, good intentions are not enough. We all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. As Mandelbaum noted in his article, "While Mother Teresa is an admirable person and social work a noble profession, conducting American foreign policy by her example is an expensive proposition."  And, I might add, an ineffective and inefficient one at that.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So what is to be done?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
My friends, first of all, the left-liberals in America need to get over this notion that it's somehow embarrassing or even immoral to have vital global interests. The isolationists need to get over the idea that, with Soviet communism gone, we no longer have global interests. The fact is, the United States is a global power. Responsibility as a global power requires us to behave like a global power. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We can protect neither our interests nor our values unless we remain a global power. As we approach the 21st century, we must apply the lessons we learned in the 20th century: It is too dangerous for us to hide and to put our heads in the sand.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world longs for America's leadership, the kind of leadership that led Ronald Reagan to stand there in Berlin in 1987 and demand, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"  Each day we find out more and more from Soviet archives how it was U.S. strength that freed the people of the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world is a freer, safer, more stable place when the U.S. is actively pursuing its own vital national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Leadership that we have because we are the world's only remaining superpower -- 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Militarily:</b> America's blue water Navy helps safeguard access to free trade and natural resources not just for the U.S., but for all nations. The guarantee of U.S. military support for the NATO alliance is critical to Europe remaining a free and prosperous community of nations. But that does not mean the U.S. should get involved in a local conflicts like the one in Bosnia. Resolving that thorny crisis is a European interest, not an American interest
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Economically:</b> Not only is the U.S. economy the world's largest, but Americans lead the world economy as both importers and exporters.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Educationally:</b> I don't need to tell you how many students from around the world come to America to study. When these students return home, they take with them experiences that bolster free ideas and free markets in their countries -- and that benefits us all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Technologically:</b> America leads the world in inventions and innovations of all kinds, and the whole world benefits. Look at the personal computer, soon to be as common and affordable as the television set. This tool empowers people everywhere to tap into the enormous wealth of information on the Internet and to share ideas unimpeded by national boundaries.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Entrepreneurially:</b> America's corporations know better than anyone how important it is to remain flexible in a global economy. Hence they are constantly innovating, finding ways to do more, to do it better, and to do it with fewer resources. When the world's largest economy does these things, it is felt around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Culturally:</b> You can travel anywhere in the world and see vivid signs of American culture like popular music and movie stars. Less vivid but more enduring, however, are the ideas of democracy and free markets that the United States has been sharing with the other nations of the world for over two centuries, helping to make the world safer and more prosperous for everyone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe that when America's vital interests are served, so are the values of political and economic freedom worldwide, because to the extent that America is a strong leader protecting its values, those same democratic values are safer and more vital elsewhere in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here, briefly, are what I believe America's interests to be.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #1: Safeguard U.S. national security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This means, above all, to protect America's territory, borders, and airspace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our borders are not threatened by the likes of Haitian boat people -- a situation created by our own economic embargo of that poor, desperate country. No, the biggest threat to the United States remains long-range missiles armed with nuclear weapons. Our response to this threat should include an anti-missile defense and a broad nonproliferation policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration vetoed Congress's defense bill recently, largely because it contained an aggressive program for building missile defenses for America by the year 2003. Yet Secretary of Defense William Perry just last month finalized plans for building a missile defense system for Israel in five years, using existing technology. To quote Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, "it will be a great contribution to the security" of the Middle East. But I believe it is inconsistent -- no, it is mad for the United States to help allies to defend themselves against missile attacks while denying our own citizens that same capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A broad nonproliferation policy also should be a vital component of American foreign policy. If diplomacy fails to discourage hostile powers from acquiring nuclear weapons, our vital interest could warrant the use of force -- unilaterally if necessary -- to stop renegade nations from becoming nuclear powers. I believe the civilized world would sigh with relief if we decided to eliminate those facilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This also means maintenance of the necessary conventional forces to protect our homeland.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #2: Prevent a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, or the Persian Gulf.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here threats include expansionist activities by Russia against her neighbors, an expansionist Iraq or Iran, or a nuclear-armed North Korea. And we should not focus simply on immediate threats. Today radical nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism, and -- although not as threatening as its original version -- neocommunism exist in places where the U.S. has vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Regarding Europe, it is a false economy to withdraw any more of our 100,000 troops just because Russia is not an immediate danger. To those who say, "Well, we'll just come back if or when Russia is a threat again," I say, "You mean like we did in 1944 on the beaches of Normandy?"  And to those who ask, "Why should America pay anything to defend Europe or East Asia?"  I say, "We're not paying for Europe's defense or Japan's defense. We're paying for <I>our</I> defense."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far better to keep 100,000 troops in Europe to maintain the peace than to send a million later to fight a war started in our absence. Far better to enter into strategic alliances -- like NATO and our mutual defense treaties with Japan and South Korea -- than to try to go it alone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A word about China: The rulers in Beijing must learn that it is in the national interest of the U.S. to stay a permanent Pacific power. This means that we will not tolerate any forcible activity from mainland China against Taiwan. Taiwan is much more than our 7th-largest trading partner. She has also become the model for a vigorous, democratic, free-market society in Asia. We will not tolerate an invasion, blockade, or aggressive activity by mainland China against Taiwan.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #3: Maintain access to foreign trade.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The greatest danger here comes not from outside U.S. borders but from inside, from those who fear America cannot compete. The protectionists who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT are pessimists about America's future. They favor the low-paying textile jobs of the past over the higher paying technology jobs of tomorrow. They are blind to the regenerative power of the free market, which they believe in devoutly for the domestic economy but not for the world economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
GATT was central to the Reagan and Bush agendas because those administrations recognized that the U.S. is the world's largest exporter, not just the world's largest economy. Yet some Republicans seem to forget this, and some of them even have edged toward playing politics with free trade. I hope those Republicans return to the party's long tradition of seeking open markets for the benefit of both U.S. consumers and U.S. exporters.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation supported the Clinton Administration on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and we supported it on GATT. We will continue to support further efforts toward expanded free trade, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile as the next step.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I have confidence that our great nation, with our great people, can compete economically with any country. I am distressed by those who don't have this confidence in America, that we can compete and win.
<P>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #4: Protect Americans against threats to their lives and well-being.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. has an obligation whenever possible to protect American citizens from terrorist activity and other international criminal activity. Yet, if a recent incident is any indication, I don't think the U.S. State Department quite understands this elementary concept.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Terry Anderson, who was held hostage for seven years by Lebanese terrorists, wrote a book on his captivity entitled <I>Den of Lions</I>. While he was writing it, the U.S. State Department refused to turn over any documents it had on his captors for two years because -- get this -- it felt compelled to protect their privacy!  The State Department said it could not give Anderson the documents unless he received written permission from the terrorists for the information's release.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is it any wonder the State Department seems to have a problem sorting out America's vital interests?  As the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, wrote to Secretary of State Christopher on the day after our seismic November 1994 elections, "It's about time there was an American Desk at the Department of State."
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #5: Maintain access to resources.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy depends on foreign oil, which now accounts for more than 50 percent of America's oil consumption and is expected to provide an increasing share of future oil consumption. A threat to our oil supply is a threat to our national interest. Tour the oil fields of Kuwait, as I did three months ago, and you will see first-hand why we must maintain our access to vital natural resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reduced to their basics, then these are America's five vital interests.
<P>

<b>Assertive Multilateralism: A Liberal Oxymoron</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Liberals, of course, often believe that where the U.S. has real interests is exactly where we should tread the lightest because these interests are somehow unseemly. As a result, America's foreign policy recently has pursued what is called "assertive multilateralism" -- a contradiction in terms if I've ever heard one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me add that using force multinationally is no more moral than wielding it unilaterally. The U.N. is filled with governments and dictatorships that do not represent the wills of their people. Why is the U.N. more moral than the U.S. Congress?  Yet President Clinton sought and received U.N. approval for invading Haiti but skipped the U.S. Congress. I believe multilateralism is the abandonment of America's leadership role in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, beyond these vital interests I've just mentioned, America has a number of other important interests, as well as many marginal ones, constantly tugging at us. The U.S. has an important interest in promoting democracy and free markets abroad, especially in regions where old totalitarian or authoritarian empires have collapsed. The more democratic the world becomes, the more peaceful it becomes, and therefore the more congenial for U.S. values and interests. Public diplomacy -- that is, reaching out above governments to tell America's story to the world -- is an important tool for promoting American interests and values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The problem, however, is that the marginal interests -- not the vital ones -- have been driving our foreign policy. This has undermined U.S. credibility abroad and casts doubt on the steadfastness of American foreign policy in many places. This situation will not endure. I'm reminded of what Winston Churchill said during World War II: "You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, but only after they exhaust all other opportunities."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So, in closing, I believe the United States eventually will do the right thing and recognize our own vital interests. We need not deny these interests. The world need not fear them. They are a stabilizing force for peace and prosperity. That we believe in democracy, freedom, and the power of open markets is something of which we should be proud, not ashamed. We should reassert this in a positive and forthright way. Maintaining the strength and the coherent international principles to protect those values is not a luxury. Rather, it is an obligation of the federal government written into our Constitution. It is the most basic obligation of all: "to provide for the common defense... and secure the blessings of liberty."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The poet Carl Sandburg wrote of American destiny that "Always there arose enough reserves of strength, balances of sanity, portions of wisdom to carry the nation through to a fresh start with ever renewing vitality."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe America's vitality and leadership abroad will return, but I think it will take a change of administration to accomplish this. It is a challenge and an opportunity that we, as a great nation, cannot afford to let pass.

<title>Who Are You, Comrade Zyuganov? -- Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3>WHO ARE YOU, COMRADE ZYUGANOV?</h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/volk.htm">Evguenii Volk</a>, Ph.D.<br>
Coordinator, The Heritage Foundation Moscow Office<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 108<br>
June 6, 1996<br>
<P><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to recent polls in Russia, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov ranks first among the Russian presidential candidates. President Boris Yeltsin, ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, social democrat Grigory Yavlinski, retired general Alexander Lebed, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and six other candidates are also competing for Russia's top job. On June 16, Zyuganov has a good chance of receiving a plurality of the vote -- roughly 30 percent. This percentage could allow him to participate in a runoff election four weeks later against the other highest vote-getter (most likely President Yeltsin).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's constituency consists largely of those who have lost out during Russia's progress toward a free-market economy and democracy. These people -- primarily the elderly, the unemployed, and unskilled workers who lack higher education -- are motivated not so much by communist ideology as by the hardships of day-to-day living and disappointment in the reform process. It is difficult to convince them that the communist pledges of a welfare state cannot be implemented, and that the social safety net promised by Zyuganov will require funds that are not available. The only way to raise these funds would be through a major increase in the money supply, which also would lead to hyper-inflation and even more economic hardship.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov claims to be the leader of a broad "national-patriotic" coalition and is supported by non-communist nationalist figures, such as influential Duma deputies Sergei Baburin and Alexei Podberezkin. One of the chief ideologists of Russian imperialism and militarism, Alexander Prokhanov, is among his staunchest allies.<sup>1</sup>  His political platform is a bizarre mixture of populist, communist, and Russian nationalist rhetoric that clearly implies a "communist revenge" -- turning the clock back to government ownership of Russia's industrial assets, aggressive regulation of the economy by the central government, fixed prices and wages, rationing and shortages of consumer goods, the stifling of basic freedoms, and strict control over the mass media, in addition to a new military buildup and renewed confrontation with the West. It is highly doubtful that such objectives can be achieved peacefully.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Zyuganov wins the presidential election, the potential for violence, both internally (as the communists move to crush the opposition) and externally (as Russia takes a more aggressive stance toward its neighbors and the West), will increase. The resulting destabilization could have dramatic ramifications both for Russian and U.S. vital interests. As president of Russia, Zyuganov not only would lead his country down the road of more confrontation with the U.S. and the West, but might even exaggerate his differences with the West to mobilize popular support and resentment at home.

<p>
<b>WHO ARE YOU, DR. ZYUGANOV?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On June 26, 1996, Zyuganov will be 52 years old. He was born in the village of Mymrino in the Central Russian region of Oryol, about 200 miles southwest of Moscow. The son of rural school teachers, he enjoyed higher social status, better living standards, and a richer intellectual environment than the other village children; but the post-collectivization and post-World War II hardships also affected his childhood. He graduated with honors from high school at age 17 and immediately began teaching. Zyuganov wed one of his pupils and now has two married children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1962, Zyuganov became a student at the physics and mathematics department of the local teachers college in Oryol. Less than a year later, while still a freshman, he was drafted into the army. Zyuganov served two years in a special nuclear and chemical reconnaissance unit of the Soviet troops stationed in East Germany and was sent to perform decontamination work in the South Urals after a major nuclear catastrophe in the late 1950s (a disaster hushed up by the Soviet authorities for decades). He apparently was exposed to nuclear radiation while serving in this unit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov proceeded along the typical Soviet <I>nomenklatura</I> career path. At the age of 21, while still serving in the army, he joined the Communist Party (CPSU). The fact that he was drafted into the party at such a young age indicates that he was very disciplined, politically astute and loyal, on good terms with his superiors, and sufficiently pragmatic to anticipate the benefits of early Communist Party affiliation. After resuming his studies at the college, he became a Young Communist League (Komsomol) activist and quickly went on to become a full-time functionary heading the Oryol city and regional committee. In 1974, he became a regional Communist Party deputy chief, responsible for day-to-day running of the region and for ideological questions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1978, he began postgraduate work at the prestigious Academy of Social Sciences under the Communist Party Central Committee, then the center of political training for top Communist Party <I>apparatchiks</I>. Recommendations from powerful superiors were needed to enter. He earned a Candidate (Ph.D.) at the Academy and 14 years later became a Doctor of Science in Philosophy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Completing the postgraduate course at the Academy of Social Sciences boosted his party career and allowed him to network with powerful Central Committee staff members. Soon Zyuganov was transferred to Moscow to become a bureaucrat in the CPSU Central Committee's omnipotent Propaganda Department (later renamed the Ideological Department). The Propaganda Department monitored and shaped the nation's communist indoctrination and exercised strict ideological control over all aspects of life in the USSR. In 1990, toward the end of his party career, Zyuganov was promoted to the position of deputy head of the Propaganda Department, but the fall of the Soviet Union prevented him from becoming one of the top decision makers. Moreover, the department lost influence during the perestroika years under Mikhail Gorbachev. These were not easy times for Gennady Zyuganov. He had to maneuver between his direct superior, Secretary for Ideology of the Central Committee Alexander N. Yakovlev -- the liberal "architect of perestroika" -- and hard-line Politburo Secretary Yegor K. Ligachev, who opposed Gorbachev's policies of glasnost.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov made his final choice in favor of the hard-line communists in 1990 when he joined the newly established Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which brought together all of Gorbachev's militant opponents. Zyuganov was immediately elected to the new party governing bodies and became one of the chief ideologists of the anti-democratic and anti-reform forces in Russia, working to consolidate them under his own leadership within the "national patriotic movement," a motley coalition of anti-Western, anti-reform, and anti-Semitic organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov co-authored the infamous "Word to the People" appeal, a declaration which called for reversing reforms, preserving the Soviet Union, and putting down the independence movements in the republics. Published in July of 1991 in the hard-line media  -- for example, in such newspapers as <I>Pravda, Segodnya</I>, and <I>Sovetskaya Rossiya</I> -- this declaration became an ideological basis for the August 1991 abortive coup, which was an attempt to restore totalitarianism in Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Zyuganov wrote in words, he did not implement in practice, being personally either cautious or cowardly. His behavior during and after the 1991 coup significantly tainted his political image among the communists. Despite his authorship of the "Word to the People," he neither actively supported the attempt nor opposed the subsequent banning of communist parties. In fact, the ban scared Zyuganov so much that he chose to lie low for a time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unemployed Zyuganov found asylum with the "Russian-American University" (RAU-Corporation),<sup>2</sup>  a center which became a rallying point for "national-patriotic" forces favoring a return to Russia's lost superpower status and "special way of development."  The U.S. Department of State denounced the RAU, calling it a CPSU and KGB front organization, and recommended that American government and private agencies refrain from contacts with it.<sup>3</sup>  Zyuganov plunged into the study of nationalist rhetoric. Alexander Barkashov, leader of the neo-fascist "Russian National Unity" party, once admitted that he had guided Zyuganov in mastering such concepts as the "Russian Idea" and "the Revival of the National Identity."<sup>4</sup>  These are shorthand for Russia's special national mission, geopolitical domination, and supposed racial superiority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact that no anti-communist purge took place after the 1991 coup attempt encouraged Zyuganov to resume his political activities. In 1992, he chaired such left-wing and ultranationalist organizations as the Council of Popular Patriotic Forces, the Duma of the Russian National Council, and the National Salvation Council, which vehemently opposed President Yeltsin's reform policies and called for his impeachment. He and his associates also filed a complaint in the Constitutional Court questioning the legitimacy of the presidential decree which had banned the Communist Party. Zyuganov and his comrades won, and the Russian Communist Party's legal status was restored in 1993. Now successful, he was elected Chairman of the Party's Central Executive Committee in February 1993.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, Zyuganov helped exacerbate the confrontation between Yeltsin and the "red-brown" opposition which had concentrated in the Russian Supreme Soviet, the old Russian parliament held over from the days of the Soviet Union. The conflict reached a tragic climax in October 1993 with fierce clashes between pro-government forces and opposing rebel fighters in Moscow's streets as the seat of the Russian parliament (the White House) was shelled and stormed by the army. However, Zyuganov avoided direct participation in this mutiny as well, and even condemned the appeal made by its leaders for a general strike. By standing aloof, Zyuganov managed to avoid trouble and run for the State Duma (new parliament) in the December 12, 1993, elections. Other militant opposition leaders had been banned from these elections. Curiously, Zyuganov ran while decrying the illegitimacy of the new Duma, condemning what he called the "presidential coup" which had dissolved the Supreme Soviet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Architect of the Communist Comeback.</b> The December 1993 election to the first State Duma of Russia put Zyuganov in the leadership position within the Duma's third-largest faction, after reformist Yegor Gaidar's "Russia's Choice" and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist Liberal Democrats. For the next three years, as he continued his unequivocal and belligerent criticism of the government, his popularity continued to rise. On December 17, 1995, in the second Duma elections, Zyuganov's Communist Party received 22 percent of the votes in the Duma. He was now the leader of its largest faction.
<P>
<b>THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COMRADE ZYUGANOV</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's newly emerged philosophy has little to do with traditional Marxist-Leninist communism. Rather, it is a concoction of statist, nationalist, messianic, populist, and even religious Russian Orthodox slogans based on a profound mistrust of the West. Believing that the Western way of development can lead only to a historical dead end, Zyuganov proposes "a breakthrough to a new socio-economic system built on the great Russian cultural and historical heritage."<sup>5</sup>  However, he never specifies exactly what the elements of such a system would be and seems to ignore the fact that all attempts to achieve such a "breakthrough" under the Bolsheviks failed, generating disasters that exhausted Russia and resulted in the worse crisis the country had experienced since 1917.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov has no firsthand knowledge of the West and speaks no foreign languages, but his background, upbringing, and adult experiences have prejudiced him against what he calls "Western capitalism."  He is susceptible to anti-Western conspiracy theories that circulate regularly among Russian communists and nationalists. These speculations lay the blame for all Russia's current hardships at the feet of "American imperialism" and its mysterious "agents of influence" in Russia, as well as Jews and Freemasons. Zyuganov claimed in 1995, for example, that the Soviet Union was dismembered as the result of a U.S. National Security Council directive adopted by John F. Kennedy after the Cuban Missile Crisis. He also believes that the purportedly secret "memoranda #1, 2, 3" drafted for George Bush were part of this strategy to undo the Soviet Union. He says that he obtained this information from a classified CPSU Central Committee "Special File" (<I>Osobaya Papka</I>) containing top secret documents allegedly obtained through intelligence channels.<sup>6</sup>  However, Zyuganov's relatively low position in the CPSU Ideological Department would not have given him access to top secret documents intended only for Politburo members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past few years, Zyuganov's aides and speechwriters have tried to blunt his anti-Western image. He often has tried to incorporate Western examples or ideas to buttress his essentially anti-Western points of view. For example, Zyuganov argued in 1994 that "Some pro-American people in this country demand that we should move towards private ownership and a limited government. But the U.S. itself rejects such an approach. Back in 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned 200 leading American industrialists and told them: ' You should share 50 percent of your income with the government or we will have an October Revolution on our hands in no time.'"<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's political campaign is based on inflaming political passions created by difficulties with the reform process. He is an alarmist who repeatedly predicts "disaster," "collapse," the "disintegration" of Russia, the extinction of the population, the humiliation of the nation, and total impoverishment.8  In his anti-Yeltsin rhetoric, he persistently condemns the government as "anti-people," carefully avoiding the fact that most of Russia's present difficulties emerged long before the reforms were started, under the communist regime of Mikhail Gorbachev. His favorite theme is that Russia is dying out, losing one million souls annually. He shuns statistics testifying to the contrary -- for example, that the mortality rate in 1995 dropped dramatically, while the birth rate grew for the first time since the 1970s.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>No Repentance.</b> Russian Communists like Zyuganov have never acknowledged or repented of the massive crimes committed against the nation by their predecessors. On the contrary, Zyuganov praises Vladimir Lenin, who personally ordered the shooting of thousands of innocent citizens, as "the most outstanding leader who unerringly felt Russia's deepest sorrows and needs."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov does not praise Stalin outright, but he also allows no official communist criticism of him.11  He claims that there was no Soviet repression in the post-World War II period<sup>12</sup> and that there are more victims of repression in prisons today than under Stalin.<sup>13</sup>  Zyuganov once told the German magazine <I>Der Spiegel</I> that only two persons were arrested in his native village in the post-World War II period, and that both were hardened criminals. In fact, however, many in this village perished during Stalin's purges.<sup>14</sup>  Zyuganov even denies that former Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov ever sent political dissidents to the Gulag and special psychiatric prisons.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Zyuganov's Electoral Platform.</b> Zyuganov's electorate is stable and will vote for him under any circumstances. Thus, his main objective is to draw in those who are still undecided. Thus far, he has failed to produce a comprehensive program that encompasses all the views of the "broad national patriotic coalition," but his electoral platform, published in March 1996, undoubtedly is not as clear-cut as the secret Program Maximum (set of ultimate political goals) designed for internal communist consumption. While publicly Zyuganov makes no mention of nationalizing privatized property, the party program calls for "nationalization or confiscation of the property acquired against the law, national interests and the rights of working people."<sup>15</sup>  Presumably, the Communist Party will assume the prerogative of determining exactly what those interests and rights are. The newly published communist economic plan, unveiled in Moscow on May 28, calls for reversal of privatization which was executed "through violation of law" and allows meager private ownership limited to apartments, small garden plots, and small service businesses. The program, if implemented, would reverse the achievements of four years of economic reform and severely injure both Russian and Western private-sector interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, Zyuganov does not offer Russia any sort of positive future. What he does pledge is a return to the communist past: economic regulation by the government, state monopoly of foreign trade, state ownership of land with no right to sell or buy property, government subsidies for bankrupt and uncompetitive industries, and restoration of the former Soviet Union.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov accuses the present government of destroying people's savings by devaluing the currency. To remedy this problem, he has promised to reimburse people for their losses. However, he overlooks the fact that most of the devaluation and confiscation of the currency occurred under the communist governments of former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov in 1990-1991, before the reforms were launched. Nor do Zyuganov and the authors of his economic plan explain where they will get the money to restore the people's savings.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's platform lacks clear and specific legislative proposals and policy guidelines. Instead, it contains numerous clichs: for example, "power should be returned to the people"; "children should get everything they are deprived of"; "women will rear children with confidence in their future"; and "talented people should be backed by the government."<sup>16</sup>  The communist election platform conceals rather than elucidates the policies Zyuganov would pursue if elected. Many in Moscow believe that Zyuganov himself does not know.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some of his comrades believe they know. A group of communist Duma members in the spring of 1996 drafted a law "On Emergency Measures to Extricate Russia from the Crisis and to Ensure Its Socio-Economic Development."  This is blatant anti-reform manifesto envisages:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Restoration</b> of the government central planning system under a reestablished committee (GosPlan);<p>

<li><b>  Review</b> all legislation on privatization (with a view to stopping or reversing all privatization);<p>

<li><b>  Restoration</b> of government ministries to manage industries;
<p>
<li><b>  Regulation</b> of wholesale and retail prices;<p>
<li><b>  High protectionist</b> tariffs on imports;<P>
<li><b>  Increased</b> taxation;
<p>
<li><b>  Modernization</b> of Russia's defense industries and increased manufacture of armaments;<P>
<li><b>  Massive government subsidies</b> for the agricultural sector; and
<p>
<li><b>  Censorship</b> of the mass media.<sup>17</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The new communist economic plan issued for public consumption before the elections is a watered-down version of this legislation. Deeply rooted in anti-Western and anti-market ideology, the plan promises retreat from market reforms, the imposition of protectionism, and greatly increased government spending for industrial and agricultural subsidies and a social safety net.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another communist idea is the restoration of the USSR, which under present circumstances would mean an attempt to rebuild a Russian empire hostile to its neighbors, both near and far. On March 15, 1996, communists in the Duma denounced the 1991 Belovezh agreement on the dismantling of the USSR. This move has caused great concern on the part of Russia's neighbors and other Western countries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Appearing to Conciliate the West.</b> Zyuganov realizes that if he becomes president, he will still be dependent on Western loans and investments to keep the Russian economy afloat. Thus, particularly when addressing a Western audience, he does his utmost to mask his real intentions. He and his deputies currently are campaigning to convince Western politicians and the Western public that communists are harmless and that their ascension to power would strengthen democracy in Russia and improve the climate for foreign investment. This was the central theme of Zyuganov's message at the February 1996 Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland,<sup>18</sup> at which he claimed that communists accept all forms of ownership of property and are simply trying to find the appropriate combination of private and state property for Russia. However, when U.S. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) asked what he proposed to do to protect private property, Zyuganov avoided a direct answer.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Zyuganov's messages to the West contrast sharply with his statements designed for domestic consumption. His party's internal program clearly stands for ultimate control of all property by the government. However, he does not make this point when talking to foreigners. During a recent meeting with International Monetary Fund leaders, Zyuganov neglected to mention his interview last year in the Russian nationalist paper Zavtra (Tomorrow), in which he likened the IMF emissaries to Nazi regional leaders (Gauleiters) in Russia during World War II.<sup>20</sup>  Anatoly Chubais, Russia's former First Deputy Premier and architect of Yeltsin's privatization program, while speaking at the Davos forum in February warned that if the West flirted with Zyuganov, it would be responsible for the bloodshed that could well occur if the communists moved to renationalize private property. The only way communists can implement their true plans is through violence, said Chubais; they will never confine themselves solely to declarations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Any comparison of Zyuganov to Central and East European leftist leaders is misleading. The former communists in Hungary and Poland show clear signs of having adjusted to the noncommunist political and economic system. The Russian communists do not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Intraparty Challenges.</b> Unlike Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the authoritarian leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal-Democratic Party, Gennady Zyuganov is being challenged for the leadership both of his own party and of its Duma faction. His main rival is Communist Party Chief of Staff Valentin Kuptsov, who was a contender for the chairmanship in 1993. Kuptsov, who is sophisticated and exercises strict control over the party staff, reportedly is supported by two-thirds of the party's members and by more than half of its Duma faction. Kuptsov is even more hard-line than Zyuganov and could be an even tougher adversary for Russian reformers and for the West if he ever seized power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Gennady Seleznyov, former chief editor of <I>Pravda</I> and Communist speaker of the State Duma, also has increased his influence significantly within the party. Even if Zyuganov should win the presidency, a possible shift of power to the parliament could leave him scrambling for support among Duma and party members controlled by Kuptsov and Seleznyov.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many of Zyuganov's allies in the Duma are more ideologically moderate and better integrated into the present Russian establishment than the rest of the party. In fact, many of Zyuganov's supporters are not dyed-in-the-wool communists, but bureaucrats who feel deprived of the opportunities for quick enrichment which privatization and corruption have brought so many other bureaucrats in Yeltsin's administration.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the long run, Russian policy under Zyuganov could be expected to recreate a major threat to America's interests and those of its European allies. Zyuganov's promise (made in December 1995 after the Duma elections) to invade Estonia if NATO is expanded to the Baltics, his declarations that only a reconstituted Soviet Union is capable of confronting the United States, and his deeply rooted hostility to the West all would tend to make his government assume an almost viscerally confrontational posture toward the Euro-Atlantic community should he become president of Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are policymakers around Zyuganov who advocate Russia's aggressive involvement in the Middle East, including supporting arms sales to existing and future radical and fundamentalist regimes in the region. The fate of the world's largest oil reserves would be at stake if Moscow again attempted to destabilize the Middle East.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If they put their campaign rhetoric into practice, Zyuganov and his team would move to reverse the outcome of the Cold War by attempting to build an anti-American coalition with Iran and China. Such a development undoubtedly would trigger a massive military buildup, both in the East and in the West, as arms control agreements with Russia unraveled.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Paradoxically, if Zyuganov came to power, the effect probably would be to accelerate NATO expansion to the East, as the West would interpret his election as an increased threat from Russia. The likely communist response to NATO expansion is predictable: confrontation with the West, intimidation of neighboring countries, and threats of a nuclear and conventional military buildup.

<h3>RUSSIAN HARDLINERS' MILITARY DOCTRINE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS</h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some Western leaders and policymakers are remarkably unconcerned about the prospects of a victory by Communist Party candidate Gennady Zyuganov in the Russian presidential elections on June 16. Thinking that a communist return to power in Russia will be no different than it was in Poland or Slovakia, these Westerners appear to believe that a communist victory in Russia will not disrupt the burgeoning "partnership" between Russia and the West.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, the report translated here paints a different picture. Written by hard-line members of a nationalist-communist coalition that supports Zyuganov for president but maintains close ties with such nationalists as Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the document contains advice for Russian military planners that is profoundly disturbing for the United States and the West. No amount of "mirror imaging" in the U.S. or Western democracies can obscure the meaning of Russian hardliners as rendered in their own words.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the report's main points:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Russia should be moving aggressively to adopt a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats. Strategic nuclear forces should be the highest priority.
<p>
<li>Russia should be able to fight at least one full-scale regional war, one smaller-scale conflict, and at least three "peacemaking" operations outside its borders.
<p>
<li>The U.S. and NATO remain Russia's enemies. Other foes include Turkey and countries of the former Soviet Union such as the Baltic States.
<p>
<li>Russia's armed forces should be drastically reorganized on the basis of smaller, highly mobile units.
<p>
<li>Russia should be prepared to undertake military operations to reconquer the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union. These operations would include seizing command-and-control sites, "eliminating" the political-military leadership, and deporting "some categories" of the hostile population, presumably to the Russian hinterland.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The authors of these positions are analysts who advise the president and the Russian General Staff on military and security matters. One author is Lieutenant General Valeriy Dementyev, who was once Deputy Chief of Armaments in the USSR Ministry of defense, and today is an analyst with the Institute for Defense Research (known by its Russian acronym INOBIS, <I>Institut oboronnykh issledovanii</I>) in the town of Kaliningrad near Moscow. The other author is Anton Surikov, a defense analyst formerly associated with the USA-Canada Institute and also an analyst at the Institute for Defense Research. The secretive INOBIS is financed by the Russian General Staff, military-industrial enterprises, and the Atomic Energy Ministry, and conducts classified research. It was founded by senior figures from the KGB and the Russian military-industrial complex. Also instrumental in its founding was Yuri Maslyukov, Zyuganov's chief economic policy maker and the former head of the USSR's Central Planning Authority (the all-powerful GosPlan). INOBIS reportedly enjoys an attentive audience at the Ministry of Defense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People like Surikov and Dementyev advise Communist Party leader Zyuganov, radical nationalist Zhirinovsky, and President Boris Yeltsin's Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov. Even if Zyuganov loses the presidential elections, the views expressed in this report will influence Russian military and security policy. Many in the Russian armed forces and security services support a more aggressive stance for Russia -- a viewpoint clearly expressed in this document.

<center><h3>ARMY REFORM AND SECURITY:<br>
Conceptual Theses of the Strategy of Reforming The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation</h3>

by Valeriy Dementyev, Lieutenant General (Ret.) and Doctor of Technical Sciences, and Anton Surikov, Doctor of Technical Sciences
</center><P>

<b>Deterrence and Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The defensive character of the policy of the Russian Federation (RF) in the military area and the absence in Russia of aggressive intentions was proclaimed in the <I>Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the RF</I>, unveiled in 1993.<sup>1</sup>  This thesis, however, is in need of clarification in terms of the precise tasks that the Armed Forces face. Among them, first of all, three basic tasks should be singled out:
<P><ul>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to deter effectively the threat of nuclear attack on Russia and on the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which have signed the agreement on collective security. In this, the talk is exclusively about deterrence, because national military thought acknowledges the impossibility of victory in a global nuclear conflict on the strategic level.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces should be aimed both at deterring a large-scale military attack on Russia and the CIS by foreign governments or a coalition thereof using conventional armaments, and deterring and repelling military aggression from the outside that has more limited goals. Deterrence of such threats can be nuclear.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to conduct local wars and carry out peacemaking operations, primarily within the bounds of the former USSR, taking into account that the former Soviet Union is a zone of Russian vital interests and home to 25 million ethnic Russians. Currently, the Russian Federation is conducting two local wars on the territory of the former USSR -- in Chechnya and Tajikistan. Besides that, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are fulfilling peacemaking functions that are in fact deterring Georgia and Moldova from commencing aggression towards Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Trans-Dniester.<sup>2</sup>  Taking into account the practices of 1990-1996, the demand must be put forward, in part, for the capability to wage local wars within the bounds of the former USSR. The Armed Forces should be able to take part simultaneously in at least one local war of high intensity, at least one "slow" local war, and at least three "frozen" local conflicts and peacemaking operations.
</ul><P>
<b>Russia's Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The thesis of the <I>Basic Provisions</I> is that Russia has no outside enemies. Experience has demonstrated the falseness of this thesis. Because of Russia's weak government and the progressive degradation of its military and economic potential, outside enemies are making themselves known in a bolder and more open fashion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Currently, Russia's basic probable enemies remain the United States and the NATO countries. The United States has a vast nuclear missile potential which, if used, can destroy Russia as a state. It was created with the goal of nuclear blackmail of the USSR and was oriented mainly at carrying out a first nuclear strike. At present, in spite of ongoing reductions within the framework of START 1, orientation toward a first strike not only has not disappeared, but actually has been increased. This is due primarily to the policy of the [American] authorities, particularly the U.S. Congress, toward revision of the ABM Treaty of 1972 and creates the prerequisites for development and subsequent deployment of a strategic ABM system by the year 2003.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In contrast to the Warsaw Pact Treaty Organization, not only has NATO, led by the USA, not been dissolved, but the decision already has been made to enlarge it. NATO's infrastructure, despite the reduction of personnel and armaments taking place under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, is still oriented toward actions in an eastern direction. The preservation of its basic military infrastructure gives it an opportunity to build up its troops quickly should such a decision be made. Although, as of today, the potential of NATO conventional forces is not sufficient to conduct a large-scale offensive operation against the Russian Federation similar to Hitler's invasion of 1941, over time these forces can be augmented and advanced to the borders of the Russian Federation. In this light, the plans for NATO eastern expansion look clearly aggressive. Moreover, in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary measures are now being taken to adapt the infrastructure, airport network, communications, etc., for NATO use. One Hungarian airport, without prior permission, has been turned into an American military base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be noted that the experience of the U.S. and NATO in the Persian Gulf in 1991, and in the former Yugoslavia in 1995-1996, demonstrates that the [Western] bloc today has sufficient potential to carry out military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory. In this scenario, the greatest danger is presented by aggression from three possible directions: first, because of Norway's recent decision to expand NATO military activity in the north of the country, from the north against the Russian Federation's Northern Fleet on the Kola peninsula; second, in connection with the discussion about creating a 60,000-strong Baltic Corps from German, Danish, and Polish detachments, from the northwest in the form of military intervention by NATO in case of a conflict between Russia and the Baltic countries; and third, in light of the calls being heard to grant the countries of the Caspian basin NATO security guarantees similar to those given to the countries of the Persian Gulf, from the south, where the key role is assigned to a member of NATO -- Turkey.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Turkey possesses an army of 600,000. Its navy is already bigger than the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Turkey has unilaterally altered the status of the Black Sea straits, threatening Russia's interests. It has voiced numerous military threats toward Russia's ally Armenia with regard to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is attempting to attract into its sphere of influence the Turkish-speaking and Muslim regions of the former USSR. It has been proven that Turkish officials supported [President] Dudaev's illegal military detachments in Chechnya. They also assisted the "Gray Wolves" organization in Azerbaijan and a number of other nationalistic military detachments throughout the CIS.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Japan, which is an ally of the United States and has territorial claims against the Russian Federation, might also be considered a potential enemy of Russia. Today, Japan does not have sufficient military power to start an aggressive military operation against Russia in order to take the islands of the Southern Kurils by force, but it does have the necessary potential to expand its Armed Forces quickly.
<p>
<b>China and Iran Are Not Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, the fact that Russia and China are neighbors must not be ignored when planning the development of the Armed Forces. At the same time, the military policy of the Russian Federation should be formed with extreme caution with respect to China. The U.S., seeing China as a potential enemy, is interested in creating a military confrontation between Russia and China.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similarly, the U.S. has a clear interest in the confrontation between the Russian Federation and Iran, another American enemy. The "Islamic threat" to the CIS is used as an argument to promote a similar confrontation. After a close examination of this problem, however, it becomes clear that the extremist movements in the CIS that operate under pseudo-Islamic slogans are relying as a rule not on Iran, but on pro-Western regimes in the Muslim world: Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In light of the above, it is not practical to view Iran and China as probable enemies of Russia, at least in the near future, because there are no objective causes for confrontation between the Russian Federation and those countries.
<p>
<b>Recreating the Empire</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Within the territory of post-Soviet Russia, the main enemies are the forces of aggressive nationalism that operate with support from outside and have armed forces of their own: armies, police, and other militarized detachments of the Baltic states; Dudayev's illegal armed forces; Tajik opposition illegal armed forces; and others. The main causes of conflict involving the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation within the territory of the former USSR are the following:
<ul><p>
<li>Ethnic discord and genocide of national minorities. Examples of such conflicts where Russian Federation (USSR) Armed Forces were used, directly or indirectly, would be Trans-Dniester in 1992, the Prigorodniy region in Northern Ossetia at the end of 1992, Southern Ossetia in 1991-1992, and Abkhazia in 1992-1993.
<p>
In the near future, ethnic conflicts probably will have two major causes. First, as a result of the events of 1991, Russians are a divided people. Therefore, their objective tendency to reunite will become stronger as time goes on. Second, in all former USSR countries, except for Belorussia and perhaps Ukraine, ethnic minorities are subjected to discrimination.<sup>3</sup>  This is most clearly evident in the Baltic countries where, with the encouragement of Western institutions, human rights violations based on ethnic origin are part of official policy. The Baltic countries seem to be the most potentially explosive in terms of the possibility of new areas of conflict that could involve the Russian Federation's Armed Forces.
<p>
<li>Attempts by nationalist forces to seize power by armed force or to hold power in some republic of the former USSR. Examples include Tajikistan in 1992-1996, Lithuania in January 1991, Georgia during the winter of 1991-1992 and at the end of 1993, and Azerbaijan in January 1990 and the summer of 1993.
<p>
<li>Territorial claims against the Russian Federation and illegal attempts to seize sea and inland water resources that belong to Russia. Up to now, direct Russian participation in such armed conflicts has been avoided. But it is not out of the question, particularly because of the Baku government's policy of annexing part of the Caspian Sea, an inland body of water the rights to which should be shared equally by all countries bordering the region. Another potential source of conflict is the part of the Baltic Sea area that belongs to Russia but is claimed by Lithuania. It also is known that the ethnocratic regimes of Tallin and Riga are claiming a part of the Russian Federation's Northwestern territory.
<p>
<li>The desire of certain forces in the former USSR, primarily in the Baltic countries, to become a part of the NATO alliance. In such cases, one cannot exclude preemptive use of force by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to stop decisively any practical steps that might be taken by armed nationalist detachments to implement their provocative plans.
</ul><p>
<b>Budget Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, in the near term, reform of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces will be conducted under conditions of deep economic crisis. Thus, the decisive factor in choosing among possible reforms will be that the budget for the Armed Forces and military-industrial complex is limited. One of the main requirements will be to minimize the country's budget for defense. This, in turn, means that the established practice of allocating funds equally among the existing branches of the Armed Forces will have to be abandoned.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is necessary to determine which programs are crucial to sustaining the Armed Forces' ability to accomplish their main objectives and guarantee their financing. At the same time, it is unavoidable that programs which do not have a high priority will have to be financed from the "leftovers" of the military budget. Despite the importance of the transition to a professional army in the near future, it will be impossible to avoid using the draft to raise manpower. The Armed Forces will have to be reduced to 1.2 million servicemen.
<p>
<b>The Main Deterrent: Strategic Nuclear Forces</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In resolving the task of nuclear deterrence on the strategic level, the basic role should be played by strategic nuclear forces and systems supporting their combat functioning. Without strategic nuclear forces, Russia cannot exist as an independent, unified state. The task of sustaining them should be given the highest priority and should be fully financed. As of today, [Russia's] strategic nuclear forces face three major problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Degradation of strategic nuclear forces.</b> This concerns primarily the naval component of the strategic nuclear forces, in which the scheduled maintenance of weapon systems is constantly being violated and the operational strength of strategic nuclear submarines has gone down drastically. Since 1990, not a single new strategic nuclear submarine has been launched; considering the life cycle of submarines in the naval strategic nuclear forces, this means they could disappear within 15 years. It is most important to finish the scientific research and test construction work needed to create strategic nuclear submarines of a new generation which will carry new ballistic missiles by the years 2000-2003, as well as to ensure that these strategic nuclear submarines are brought into service at the rate of 2-3 submarines every two years.
<p>
<li><b>Absence of clarity regarding the quantitative framework within which it is planned to develop strategic nuclear forces.</b> In 1994, START I was implemented. START II was signed but is not yet ratified. With regard to the naval and aviation components of the strategic nuclear forces, the existence of uncertainty concerning the fate of the treaty does not affect seriously their future development. According to START II, the naval strategic nuclear forces can be armed with 1,750 warheads after 2003. Roughly the same quantity was to be allowed under START I. Aviation strategic nuclear forces, which historically have played a very insignificant role in the national nuclear triad, will have 93 heavy bombers with approximately 500 cruise missiles, including 19 Tu-95 heavy bombers and several dozen heavy bombers acquired in Ukraine by agreement. The production of additional heavy bombers is very costly and thus is hardly advisable.
<p>
A more complex situation exists in units of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF). According to START II, which requires the liquidation of ICBMs with MIRV warheads, the SRF by the year 2003 can rely on approximately 1,000 single-warhead ICBMs. At present, there are 350 mobile SS-25s with single warheads, which are to be replaced in the next few years, as their useful life expires, by "Topol-M" ICBMs. According to the agreement, Russia will have 105 MIRVed ICBMs, which are to be "unloaded" until only one warhead each remains, and 90 single SS-18 ICBMs placed into refitted silos. To support the START II quota for the number of warheads, Russia will have to form more than 10 additional divisions of mobile ICBMs with approximately 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs by the year 2003 -- in other words, practically double the number of mobile, single-warhead ICBMs. Another possible option is to build new silos for new ICBMs. Even with priority financing, it is very difficult for the SRF to do this within such a limited time frame.
<p>
In general, the START II treaty is rather paradoxical. It calls for quick liquidation of more than 200 MIRVed Russian ICBMs, part of which could still be used for another 4-5 years. At the same time, in order to maintain quantitative parity with the U.S., several hundred single-warhead ICBMs should be deployed, and possibly placed into newly built silos, even as some of the old silos are to be destroyed under START II. Note that the United States plans to go from START I to START II in a different fashion. It will eliminate only 50 "MX" missiles, 4 "Ohio" strategic nuclear submarines, and 28 heavy bombers with cruise missiles. The main cuts are to be accomplished by "unloading" the missiles and storing the warheads in special storage facilities. At any moment, this stockpile, which the United States emphatically refuses to destroy, might be put back into operation on U.S. missiles. As a result, taking into account the potential for "quick loading" of these missiles, the U.S. will surpass Russia by 1,000-1,500 warheads.
<P>
Russia's refusal to follow START II will bring onto the agenda the issue of supporting MIRVed ICBMs. Analysis proves that this problem can be solved in principle. Different options are available. For instance, additional SS-18s can be purchased from Ukraine. Also, purely Russian MIRVed ICBMs can be designed; a 120-ton liquid fueled missile with 10 warheads could be created in 3-5 years after the appropriate decision. In the next 5-7 years, 300 such missiles can be placed into existing silos. Given these facts, in spite of widespread misconceptions, spending for this project could be quite moderate. At the stage of scientific research and test construction work, the amount would be several percent less per year than the amount allocated to "rebuild" Chechnya in 1996. At the development stage, given that the warheads would be available, production and installation of 300 of such missiles would be three times cheaper than the cost of constructing in the same period 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs in their mobile version or in new silos, as discussed above in relation to START II.
<p>
<li><b>Flaws in the command and control structure of the strategic nuclear forces.</b> It is proposed, within the framework of measures for development of the strategic nuclear forces, to design in an organized manner a single, self-contained operational command and control system for all groupings of strategic nuclear forces, including support systems, based on the administrative structure developed in the Strategic Rocket Forces. Practical implementation of this proposal could be achieved within a year after the appropriate decision is made. The main reasons such a step is necessary are the increased demands for combat readiness in the strategic nuclear forces, economy of means, and elimination of parallel structures. It would be advisable to transfer the Military Space Forces to the Strategic Rocket Forces to bring under their functional control the Missile Attack Warning System, the Space Control System, the Moscow ABM System, and corresponding testing sites. The naval and aviation strategic nuclear forces (functionally left in the Navy and Air Forces, respectively) also should be transferred to the single operational command and control of the strategic nuclear forces.
<p>
At the present time, several hundred thousand servicemen, a third of them officers, are performing their military service in groupings of the strategic nuclear forces. In the Strategic Rocket Forces, for all practical purposes, combat crews of officers carry out in practice 100 percent of the direct functional duties connected with exploitation of the weapons. As for the draftees, they primarily carry out functions as guards and perform auxiliary tasks in supporting combat readiness, technical support, etc. A similar situation, as a whole, characterizes the other components of the strategic nuclear forces and their support systems. It is proposed that the ratio between professionals and conscripts be maintained in the future as well.
<p>
Since the U.S. and NATO possess conventional forces and armaments potentially sufficient to conduct military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory, it is necessary to provide for deterrence of such actions by the probable enemy. Currently, functions for deterring aggression from the most probable directions are given:
<ul><p>
<li>In the north (the naval bases on the Kola peninsula), to forces of the Leningrad Military District (MD) and Northern Fleet (NF).
<p>
<li>In the northwest, (the Baltic region), to forces of the Leningrad MD, Kaliningrad special region, and forces of the Baltic Fleet.
<p>
<li>In the south (the Caucasus-Caspian region), to forces of the North Caucasus Military district; subunits of the Russian Armed Forces on bases in Gyumri and Yerevan (Armenia), Tbilisi and Ahalkalaki (Georgia), Batumi (Adjaria), and Gudauta (Abkhazia); forces of the Caspian Flotilla; and the Black Sea fleet.
</ul><p>
Analysis shows that the existing deterrence potential of the Russian Federation Armed Forces in these directions might be insufficient to deter aggressive action by the probable enemy. Strengthening these forces by carrying out a long-term buildup in the number of troops and armaments in regions of probable conflict could be hard to achieve economically. In light of this, as a priority task facing the Armed Forces, it is proposed to create, within a year after a decision is made, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces numbering about 10,000 servicemen. Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces could operate as a reserve of the Supreme High Command and, on a long-term basis, could assume the function of deterring the probable enemy from conducting military operations with local goals.
<p>
For this proposal to be implemented at the initial stage, it is suggested to supply the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces with 10-12 missile and aviation complexes equipped with conventional precision weapons from the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces. These missile and aviation complexes, while remaining functionally a part of the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces, and based deep within Russian territory during peacetime, would be subordinated operationally, through a Main Directorate of the General Staff specially created for these purposes, to the Supreme High Command of the Russian Armed Forces. During a threatening period, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces, by decision of the Supreme High Command, could be redeployed to the region of possible conflict and aimed on especially important targets deep in the probable enemy's territory.
<p>
In the event plans for the eastern expansion of NATO are realized or new directions of possible aggression appear (for instance, the Southern Kuril Island), it would be expedient to increase the number of the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces' missile and aviation complexes to 30-50 units. At the same time, units of missile artillery and aviation complexes could be armed with nuclear weapons. To demonstrate persuasively to a probable enemy the RF's determination to impede any NATO advancement into the territory of the former USSR, some Operational-Tactical Deterrent Force units also could be moved up to the borders, particularly the Russian-Norwegian border; to Russian military bases in Armenia, Georgia, Adzharia, and Abkhazia; to the Kaliningrad special region; and into Belorussia, to which President A. G. Lukashenko has agreed in principle.
</ul><P>
<b>The Mobile Forces: Mainstay of the Russian Army</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is advisable when waging local wars within the former USSR to give the main functions to special elite units: Mobile Forces of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, which also must have priority designation. Not intended for participation in extended military conflicts, these units could be used on a short-term basis in holding actions and to repel aggression from abroad against Russia and the CIS using conventional weapons. They also could be designated for peacekeeping operations under the aegis of CIS, as well as the UN and other international organizations. It is advisable to form Mobile Forces, up to 90,000 strong, based on Airborne troops and using some units of naval infantry, over a year after a corresponding decision is made. Functionally, naval infantry would stay under Navy command and would be transferred to operational Mobile Forces command only for the conduct of special operations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For five years after forming these Mobile Forces, it is suggested that recruitment be exclusively on a contract basis. After the process of turning them into a professional force is complete, Mobile Forces should be fully staffed and given all kinds of heavy armaments and equipment. Moreover, the number of naval infantry should be increased with the assistance of the Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, and Caspian Flotilla, which are located in potential conflict areas of the Caucasus and Baltic countries. Special attention should be paid to the creation of naval infantry in the Caspian region because of the extremely high probability of conflict arising from the unresolved problem of the status of the Caspian shelf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is important to equip Mobile Forces with military transport aviation (MTA), which will belong functionally to the Air Forces and be operationally subordinate to the Commander in Chief of the Air Forces but required to carry out orders of the Mobile Forces. The need for MTA aircraft designated to move personnel and military equipment, including heavy military equipment, is estimated at 100 aircraft. Most of the aircraft in MTA available today are not functioning. Therefore, about 30-40 additional aircraft should be brought into service because of the extreme importance of the tasks performed by the Mobile Forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A typical special operation involving Mobile Forces and aimed at liberating a large area of the former USSR from nationalists should be based on the following principles. The commander of the operation is appointed and should receive a legally valid order. The date and time of the operation then are set. A rigid system of unified command is established so that operational command over all utilized forces, regardless of departmental subordination and affiliation, is concentrated in the hands of a single person.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the first stage, aviation, special military intelligence (GRU) forces, and special Federal Security Services (FSB) and Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) groups carry out strikes for the purpose of destroying or seizing the most important enemy targets and eliminating the enemy's military and political leadership. Then Mobile Forces, with the support of army and frontline aviation and naval forces, crush and eliminate enemy forces and take over their territory. After that, subunits of Ground Forces and Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, RF, preferably with some combat experience, move in. They establish control of the most crucial locations and carry out "cleansing" of the territory. Then, with the help of militia formed out of the pro-Russian part of the local population, they establish control over the territory and ensure the elimination of nationalists and deportation of some categories of citizens from certain locations. It should be emphasized that until the end of the special operation, local authorities are needed only insofar as they are useful in supporting military control over the territory.
<P>
<b>Winners and Losers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Military intelligence plays a most important role in achieving the main goals of the Armed Forces. Making the GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate) and its subunits and structures more effective should be given the highest priority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To implement these proposals, half the personnel of the Armed Forces would have to go to the four most important components of the Armed Forces named above, which also should be given priority in financing. Because the economic situation in the country is difficult, the other half of the Armed Forces would have to exist under tight financial limitations.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The Navy is the most expensive of the Armed Forces.</b> A differentiated approach is needed here. Naval strategic nuclear forces cannot be underfinanced. The situation is more complex with respect to providing for the combat stability of naval strategic nuclear forces. The system exists and should be preserved, but this does not require building large ships. Aircraft carriers are an exception, since two carriers each are needed in the Pacific Fleet and Northern Fleet to meet military goals. There are only two at present, and the country's economic situation does not allow for two more.
<p>
To provide for anti-submarine warfare in oceanic theaters of military operations (TVD), there are in service submarines and ships equipped with special arms. This equipment should be maintained and ships and submarines currently under construction should be finished, but no new ones should be built for the time being.
<p>

With respect to combating enemy aircraft carriers, there are no battle groups now in place. Our recommendation is to maintain the status quo and concentrate on retaining existing levels.
<p>
With reference to landing support for naval infantry, the appropriate infrastructure was built by the USSR. It is important not only to stop its destruction, but also to continue its development, since costs will not be high but will allow it to perform tasks of the Mobile Forces with great effectiveness.
<p>
In protecting sea communications, special attention should be paid to protecting lines of communication with the Kaliningrad Special Region. At the same time, activities in the remote oceanic regions should be limited.
<p>
The existing system for the coastal defense of the Russian Federation should be supported and developed, since no big investments are needed here. Finally, it is necessary to abandon the tasks of combating transatlantic shipments of U.S. forces and combating the enemy's surface ships and submarines armed with cruise missiles.
<p>
<li><b>There are two large groups in the Ground Forces today. </b>One was deployed in the Far East Military District and Trans-Baikal Military District during the time of tense relations with China. In subsequent years, it was degraded less than other groups. Another large group was developed for obvious reasons in the North Caucasus Military District. It is reasonable to continue to support these groups. For the North Caucasus Military District, this means confirming the exception of District units from the treaty on Conventional Forces Reductions in Europe at the May conference of participants. It is unacceptable that the issue of the North Caucasus Military District be linked with the proposal made by a number of countries that the numbers of Russian forces in the Kaliningrad Special Region be cut; in light of Poland's and the Baltic countries' plans to join NATO, the very fact that the issue of the Kaliningrad Special Region has come up seems both ambiguous and a provocation. A limited number of Ground Forces are located in the strategically important Leningrad and Moscow Military Districts. From the west, Moscow is covered by only two army divisions. As there is no danger of a large-scale invasion of Russia similar to the invasion of 1941, the development of forces to the west of Moscow should not be hurried. But in the event the Eastern European countries join NATO and the infrastructure for an invasion force appears, Russia will be forced to respond accordingly. One possible response might be to recreate the Belorussian Military District and deploy Ground Forces and frontal aviation of the Air Forces there.
<p>
Also, since it currently is difficult for Russia to maintain parity with NATO in conventional weapons, the primary emphasis should be assigned to tactical nuclear deterrence of the threat of non-nuclear attack by NATO forces. This approach will require arming the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and frontal aviation of the Air Forces with nuclear weapons and will be much less expensive than providing a non-nuclear deterrent force for a non-nuclear invasion. In general, the present weakness of Russia dictates reliance on nuclear weapons, including tactical weapons. Today, the only possible way to deter NATO is through nuclear deterrence. At the same time, should the relationship between Russia and China change, the same approach can be used in Central Asia and the Far East.
<p>
An important problem in the Ground Forces is revision of the list of units in military districts and the discovery of units which can be cut. It is advisable to limit the number of divisions to 30-35, of which 15-20 could be manned with conscripts and work on combat readiness while the other 15, evenly spread around the country, would be cadre and would serve as a base in preparing the mobilization reserve. At the same time, preparation of the mobilization reserve should be conducted within the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Border Guards.
<p>
<li><b>In units of the Air Forces, special attention should be concentrated on maintaining military transport, frontal aviation, and aviation of the strategic nuclear forces, which could be used by the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces and Mobile Forces, at the required level.</b> A major task is preserving qualifications of flying personnel. The Air Defense of military districts should be given to the Air Forces from the Troops of Air Defense, disbanding the latter units but retaining their combat readiness requirements. The missile attack warning system, space control system, and Moscow ABM System, as well as their corresponding testing grounds, would be transferred to the Strategic Rocket Forces. The Air Defense system that is maintaining CIS perimeter defense also would be transferred to the Air Force. Another possible solution is to give it to the Federal Border Guard Service. This would be logical, because they are not now able to defend against a massive air attack from the probable enemy. The circle of tasks resolved by them, in fact, is limited to early warning of an unsanctioned intrusion of CIS airspace and interception of individual targets. This is more a function of the Border Guard, not the Armed Forces. Moreover, the Federal Border Guard Service looks after the ground and marine border. It would be logical to close the loop by giving them the air component as well.
<p></ul>
<b>Legislative Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is proposed that in the immediate future, it is necessary to prepare and confirm in the Federal Assembly (parliament) a national security doctrine and a military doctrine for the Russian Federation. Based on these doctrines, a five-year plan of reform for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation should be developed and adopted.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This current document can be used both to prepare the national security and military doctrines and to prepare the plan of reform for the Armed Forces.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The vast expanses of the former Soviet Union harbor oil and gas riches which will be crucial in fueling the global economy in the next century. The huge oil reserves, estimated at over 25 billion barrels, under the Caspian Sea and in the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are similar to those in Kuwait and larger than those in Alaska's Northern Slope and the North Sea combined.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Control over these energy resources and export routes out of the Eurasian hinterland is quickly becoming one of the central issues in post-Cold War politics. Like the "Great Game" of the early 20th century, in which the geopolitical interests of the British Empire and Russia clashed over the Caucasus region and Central Asia, today's struggle between Russia and the West may turn on who controls the oil reserves in Eurasia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The world now faces a choice between the cooperative exploitation by the East and West of natural resources or a wasteful struggle that could cost a fortune in blood and treasure. Regional conflicts in the Caucasus and Central Asia threaten to deny Western access to the vital oil and gas reserves the world will need in the 21st century. The wars in Chechnya, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and in Georgia were started or exacerbated by the Russian military, and the outcome of these wars may determine who controls future pipeline routes. Moscow hopes that Russia will. Powerful interests in Moscow are attempting to ensure that the only route for exporting the energy resources of Eurasia will pass through Russia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. needs to ensure free and fair access for all interested parties to the oil fields of the Caucasus and Central Asia. These resources are crucial to ensuring prosperity in the first half of the 21st century and beyond. Access to Eurasian energy reserves could reduce the West's dependence on Middle East oil and ensure lower oil and gas prices for decades to come. Moreover, oil revenues can boost the independence and prosperity of such Newly Independent States (NIS) as Azerbaijan and Georgia. For example, through production royalties, Azerbaijan could generate over $2 billion a year in revenue from its oil fields, while Georgia could get over $500 million annually from transit fees. With these new-found oil riches, non-Russian republics in the region would depend less on Russia, both economically and militarily. Independent and self-sufficient former Soviet states, bolstered by their oil revenues, would deny Russia the option of establishing a <i>de facto</i> sphere of influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two pipeline routes in Central Asia are under consideration. The first would allow oil to flow from the Azerbaijani Caspian Sea shelf to the Black Sea coast. The second would transport oil from the giant Tengiz oil field, developed by the U.S.-based Chevron corporation in Kazakhstan, in a westerly direction toward Europe and the Mediterranean. Western governments and oil companies participating in the Azerbaijani and Kazakhstani pipeline projects<sup>1</sup> face a choice: Will a neo-imperialist Russia (aided and abetted by Iran) dominate the development of Eurasian oil and its exports, or will Russia be an equal and fair player in the region with Turkey, the three Caucasian states (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan), and possibly Iran?  The U.S. should respect the right of Russian companies to bid for the exploration and transport of oil and gas in the region. However, the West has a paramount interest in assuring that the Caucasian and Central Asian states maintain their independence and remain open to the West. Otherwise, Moscow will capture almost monopolistic control over this vital energy resource, thus increasing Western dependence upon Russian-dominated oil reserves and export routes. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to ensure free and fair access to the oil reserves in Central Asia, the U.S. should:
<P><ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strive to preserve the independence and economic viability of the Newly Independent States in Central Asia.</b> The U.S. should try to prevent the reconstitution of Moscow's sphere of influence in the southern parts of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). To achieve that end, it should endeavor to ensure that Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and other Newly Independent States receive a fair portion of the oil revenues from the region. Moreover, the U.S. should strengthen bilateral and multilateral political and military cooperation with these states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Ensure that Russia is not a dominant, but rather an equal partner in developing the oil resources of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</b> Russian oil and gas companies should be allowed to participate in the development of Eurasian energy resources on an equitable basis with other countries in the region. That is their right. Forming partnerships with Western oil companies could turn the Russian business sector into an ally of the West. However, domination by military means should be rejected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Work through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and through bilateral channels, to defuse ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus.</b> Thus far, the West has focused mainly on settling the crisis in Bosnia, relegating the Caucasus region to the back burner. Now that a Bosnian settlement has been reached, the U.S. should endeavor to settle the conflicts in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The OSCE would be a useful vehicle for pursuing these goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strengthen secular Muslim societies, notably Turkey and Azerbaijan, against Islamic militant groups.</b> Both Russian geostrategic ambitions and Iranian-style religious militancy pose long-term threats to the Muslim societies of the region. These threats can be countered by helping to create free market economies, respect for the rule of law, and a civil society that respects democracy and political pluralism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Support the Western oil route through Turkey to reduce oil transportation hazards in the Bosphorus Straits.</b> Absent a new oil pipeline, more potentially hazardous oil shipments will pass through the already clogged Bosphorus Straits. Oil tanker fires like the one in 1994 can block international shipping through the Boshporus for days, causing tens of millions of dollars in damage and threatening the lives and health of local citizens. The U.S. should support a pipeline route through the territory of Georgia and Turkey that will bring oil from Eurasia to a Mediterranean port such as Ceyhan in Turkey.
</ul><p>

<b>WARS ENDANGERING OIL TRANSIT ROUTES IN THE CAUCASUS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The War in Chechnya.</b> One of the main goals of the Russian attack on Chechnya in December of 1994 was to ensure control of the oil pipeline which runs from Baku, via Grozny, the Chechen capital, to the Russian city of Tikhoretsk. The pipeline ends at the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, designed by Russia to be the terminal for the proposed Kazakh and Azerbaijani pipelines.<sup>2</sup> In addition, Grozny boasts a large refinery with a processing capacity of 12 million tons per year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During its brief self-proclaimed independence under President Jokhar Dudayev from 1991 to 1994, Chechnya illegally exported crude oil and refined products worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. The rebel government worked closely with corrupt politicians in Moscow to obtain export licenses. Partly to cut off this activity, Russia launched a massive but covert military action in the fall of 1994 to support opponents of Dudayev. In 1994, Dudayev turned to radical Islamic elements in the Middle East and Central Asia for support. This exacerbated the religious aspect of the conflict between the Muslim Chechens and Christian Orthodox Russians. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The overt military action began on December 12, 1994, when the Russian army marched on Grozny, destroying Chechnya's capital city by brutal aerial, tank, and artillery bombardment. Since the start of the campaign, over 30,000 people have been killed, and more than 300,000 have become refugees. Hostilities continue, with hostage-taking crises erupting in July 1995 and January 1996.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Drama in Georgia.</b> Another conflict affecting potential oil routes is occuring in the Caucasus republic of Georgia. Russia wants to prevent oil from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan from going the "Western" route through Georgia to Turkey. Moscow's support of civil strife in Georgia is directly connected to its goal of perpetuating conflict in the Caucasus.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From 1991 through the end of 1993, Georgia was in the midst of a bloody civil war which pitted the supporters of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia against each other. Political violence became chronic. Eventually, the defeated Gamsakhurdia either committed suicide or was murdered under mysterious circumstances in 1993. But even after his victory over Gamsakhurdia, Shevardnadze faced challenges from warlords and militias. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In exchange for crucial Russian support, Shevardnadze finally was forced to join the CIS in October 1993, a move he had bitterly opposed. When he attempted to read a press release announcing this step, Russian diplomats took it out of his hands and gave him a Moscow-authored text to read. Such was the degree of independence enjoyed by Shevardnadze at the hands of his Russian patrons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1995, Moscow brought pressure on Shevardnadze not to build a pipeline for Azeri oil through Georgian territory. The Georgians wanted to bring oil to the Georgian port of Supsa (between Poti and Tbilisi), from which it then would be exported by tanker to Turkey. However, the Russians demurred. Soon after Shevardnadze refused to cancel the pipeline plan, he was injured in an assassination attempt when a car bomb exploded next to his vehicle on August 29, 1995. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shevardnadze has insisted repeatedly that Russia was behind this attempt on his life. The suspected culprit -- Shevardnadze's security chief, Igor Georgadze -- has escaped to Russia and continues to threaten Shevardnadze's life.<sup>3</sup>  Shevardnadze demanded that the Russians extradite the suspect, and the Russian Prosecutor General's Office issued an order for his arrest. However, the Russian Interior Minister refused the extradition, and Georgadze is still at large. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Fighting in Abkhazia.</b> Another dangerous conflict is smoldering in Abkhazia, a breakaway region in Georgia. The bitter war in Abkhazia, which began in 1992, has claimed over 35,000 lives. It was precipitated by the Russian military backing the Abkhaz separatist minority against the Georgian government in Tbilisi.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One purpose of the Russian intervention was to weaken Georgia and curb Turkish and Western influence in the region. But more important was the Russian goal of controlling access to oil. By acting as it did, Russia gained <i>de facto</i> control over the long Black Sea coastline in Abkhazia. Moscow also was protecting the Russian Black Sea ports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse and moving closer to the Georgian oil exporting ports in Poti, Supsa, and Batumi. In August 1995, Georgia's beleaguered President Shevardnadze agreed to place four Russian military bases on Georgian soil, thus assuring Russia's control of the oil exporting routes via the Black Sea coast. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Russia became entangled in Chechnya in 1994-1995, and word of Chechen commando training camps operating from Abkhazia spread, Moscow began to show less support for the Abkhaz rebels, who are allies of the Chechens. But Russia also has refused either to close the border with Abkhazia or to deny the separatist government in the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi, financial and military support. Shevardnadze had hoped that this would be a Russian <i>quid pro quo</i> for his agreement to permit Russian military bases on Georgian territory.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict.</b> Yet another bloody war affecting potential oil pipeline routes is occurring in Nagorno-Karabakh, a small, largely Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan. The enclave of Karabakh sits astride a potential oil route from the Caspian Sea to Turkey. Populated mainly by Armenians, Karabakh was put under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction in 1921 after Stalin negotiated a treaty in the Transcaucasus between communist Russia and Turkey. Strife between the mainly Christian Armenians and Shi'a Muslim Azerbaijanis broke out in 1988. Full-scale war erupted in 1992, with the Armenians demanding complete independence for Karabakh or its absorption into Armenia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A cease-fire negotiated in May 1994 has been holding. The Armenians in Karabakh have proclaimed an independent republic, which Azerbaijan refuses to recognize. Thus far, Azerbaijan has suffered political and military defeat at the hands of the Armenians, losing one-fifth of its territory since the collapse of the Soviet Union. One million people, mostly Azerbaijanis, have become refugees as a result of the war. The Azeri capital of Baku has seen the government change three times since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russia has supported the Armenians and the Azeris intermittently. In 1992, Moscow proposed that Russia become a guarantor of peace in the region, promising to send in 3,000 peacekeepers, but was rebuffed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional security group in Europe.<sup>4</sup>.  The OSCE "Minsk group," which consists of Russia, the U.S., Turkey, France, Sweden, and Italy, has been charged with finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict but thus far has met with only limited success. Under Western pressure, Moscow has agreed to a multilateral OSCE peacekeeping force for Karabakh. However, this force has yet to materialize, and there is still no peace agreement between the warring parties. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Azerbaijan: Key Oil Region.</b> The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh is important because of the immense oil reserves controlled by Azerbaijan. Since the late 19th century, the oil in Azerbaijan has played a key role in the economies of the Russian empire and the Soviet Union, as well as in the global energy market. International business interests, such as the Nobel and Rothschild families, and even conquerors like Adolf Hitler have all vied at different times for control of Azerbaijan's oil. Even after 100 years of Russian imperial and Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan still has some of the largest reserves in the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At stake today is a $6 billion, 4 billion barrel Caspian Sea shelf petroleum deal between Azerbaijan and a consortium of large international oil companies.<sup>5</sup>  Put simply, Russia opposes the deal. The Russian oil company Lukoil is part of this international consortium, but other Russian oil interests felt excluded, and the Russian foreign and defense ministries have come out squarely against the arrangement. In addition to demanding that at least 25 percent of the deal go to Russian firms (Lukoil gets only 10 percent), Moscow wants full control of the oil exports. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Caspian Sea oil deal was facilitated first by President Abulfaz Elchibei, who was overthrown in June 1993 by former Azerbaijani KGB Chief and Brezhnev Politburo member General Heydar Aliev.<sup>6</sup>  While Elchibei was considered pro-Turkish, Aliev had a reputation for being pro-Russian. It was Aliev who signed the oil agreement in September 1994. On October 9, 1995, the Azerbaijani International Oil Consortium (AIOC) announced that "early" oil (approximately 80,000 barrels a month) would be split between two pipelines. The northern line would go to the Russian port of Novorossiysk (via unstable Chechnya) and the western line to the Georgian port of Supsa in two separate pipelines. This was a compromise decision supported by the Clinton Administration and aimed at placating Moscow, but it failed to do so. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite his attempts to accommodate Russia, Moscow apparently considers Aliev too independent. Therefore, the Kremlin is backing Suret Husseinov, a warlord who reportedly has good connections with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.<sup>7</sup>  Between 1993 and 1995, four unsuccessful coups were attempted against Aliev, reportedly with Moscow's support. Russia also is playing the ethnic separatism card against Aliev, bolstering the national movement of the Lezgin minority in the north of Azerbaijan and the movement of the Talysh minority in the south. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Aliev has proved himself to be a tough survivor. Although Azerbaijan has joined the CIS, he has managed to resist the pressure to deploy Russian military bases or troops on Azerbaijani soil. However, Moscow probably can outwait Aliev, in the meantime fostering instability in Azerbaijan. Russia will attempt to block any large-scale production or exports of oil from Azerbaijan until such time as a more compliant man can be put in charge.
<p>

<b>OIL POLITICS AND RUSSIAN IMPERIALISM IN THE "NEAR ABROAD"</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The main threat to the equitable development of Eurasian oil is the Russian attempt to dominate the region in a <i>de facto</i> alliance with the radical Islamic regime in Tehran.<sup>8</sup>  Russia benefits from instability in the Caucasus, where wars and conflicts undermine independence and economic development while hindering the export of oil from the region's states.<sup>9</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moscow has gone beyond words to establish its power in the Caucasus. The Russians are setting up military bases in the region in order to gain exclusive control over all future pipelines. Georgia now has four Russian bases and Armenia has three, while Azerbaijan is still holding out under severe pressure from Moscow. In addition, members of the Commonwealth of Independent States are required to police their borders jointly with Russian border guards, and thus are denied effective control over their own territory. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Attempts to Reintegrate the South.</b> The struggle to reestablish a Russian sphere of influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia started in early 1992. While not a full-scale war, this struggle employs a broad spectrum of military, covert, diplomatic, and economic measures. The southern tier of the former Soviet Union is a zone of feverish Russian activity aimed at tightening Moscow's grip in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse. The entire southern rim of Russia is a turbulent frontier, a highly unstable environment in which metropolitan civilian and military elites, local players, and mid-level officers and bureaucrats drive the process of reintegration.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With the collapse of the Soviet Union, President Boris Yeltsin called for a re-examination of Russia's borders to the detriment of her neighbors, especially Ukraine and Kazakhstan. For example, upon his return from a state visit to the U.S. in September 1994, Yeltsin reiterated Russia's "right" to conduct "peacemaking" in the "near abroad," to protect Russian speakers and to exercise freedom of action in its sphere of influence.<sup>11</sup>  These statements were echoed on numerous occasions by former Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other key policymakers in Moscow. In his September 1995 Decree "On Approval of the Strategic Policy of the Russian Federation Toward CIS Member States,"<sup>12</sup> Yeltsin outlined plans to create a CIS military and economic union. Some observers have termed this design an informal empire "on the cheap," a "sustainable empire" which is less centralized than the old Soviet Union.<sup>13</sup>  The aim of such an arrangement would be to ensure Russia's control of the oil and gas reserves in Eurasia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Competing political interests inside Russia's neighbors often prompt local elites to challenge the faction in power and to seek Moscow's support. For example, Russian oil chieftains in Kazakhstan and military commanders who are still in place in Moldova and Georgia naturally maintain close links with Moscow. Where it lacks troops on the ground, Moscow supports the most pro-Russian faction in the conflict, such as Trans-Dniestrian ethnic Russians in Moldova, the separatist Abkhazs in Georgia, warlords and former communist leaders in Azerbaijan, and pro-communist clans in Tajikistan. This is a classic scenario for imperial expansion. What is common to these conflicts is that without Russian support, the pro-Moscow factions (regardless of their ethnicity) could not have dominated their respective regions, and would be forced to seek negotiated and peaceful solutions. In each case, appeals by the legitimate governments of the Newly Independent States to restore their territorial integrity were ignored by Moscow.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russian political elites have not overcome the imperialist ideology that inspired both pre-1917 and Soviet expansionism. For today's Moscow bureaucrats and generals, as for their predecessors in St. Petersburg prior to 1917, the turbulent southern periphery is a potential source of political fortunes, promotions, and careers. For Russian politicians in search of a grand cause, re-establishing the empire and paying for it with Eurasian oil revenues is a winning proposition, especially in the murky environment in the aftermath of imperial collapse. 
<p>

<b>KEY RUSSIAN PLAYERS IN THE GREAT OIL GAME</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian military and security services are by far the most resolute driving force behind the restoration of a Russian-dominated CIS. They are playing a key role in ensuring Moscow's control over the pipeline routes. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Berlin Wall terminated, at least temporarily, confrontation with the West, leaving the Red Army's General Staff, the Russian military intelligence (GRU), and the former KGB desperately seeking new missions. The biggest of these new missions is to establish control over Caucasus and Central Asian oil, establishing a Russian sphere of influence in the process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian army and security services seek to deny foreign companies the right to export oil without their control. Russian military activities over the last four years indicate an attempt to consolidate strategic control of oil sources and export routes in Eurasia. For example, the war in Chechnya blocked an important pipeline from Azerbaijan through Grozny, and the victory of the Abkhaz separatists, supported by the Russian military, further secured the Russian oil terminals in the ports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse. In order to obtain an oil route in the region, Western exporters may be pressured to reach accomodations with the Russian generals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian intelligence services are also involved. The successor to the KGB's First Chief Directorate, now known as the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia (SVRR) and led until January 1996 by KGB general and now Foreign Minister Evgenii Primakov, published an important document in 1994 on Russia's policies in the "near abroad," called "Russia-CIS: Does the Western Position Require Correction?"<sup>14</sup>  General Primakov's staff argued that any attempt to integrate the CIS states into the global economy without Moscow's cooperation is doomed to fail. Russia already has effectively stopped Kazakhstani and Azerbaijani joint oil exporting ventures in their tracks. 

<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The states of the CIS's southern tier were coerced by Russia even before they declared their independence from the USSR. Moscow incited local pro-Russian factions, such as Abkhazians in Georgia, Armenians in Karabakh, and hard-line communist pro-Russian clans in Tajikistan, to challenge the independence and territorial integrity of these nascent states. The Russian military provided advisers, hardware, training, planning, and coordination for the military activities in these areas. As a result, hundreds of thousands have been left dead, wounded, or homeless. In addition, these violent conflicts blocked the transit routes to the West for Caspian and Central Asian oil. 
<p>

<b>THE U.S. ROLE IN THE GREAT GAME</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much is at stake in Eurasia for the U.S. and its allies. Attempts to restore its empire will doom Russia's transition to a democracy and free-market economy. The ongoing war in Chechnya alone has cost Russia $6 billion to date (equal to Russia's IMF and World Bank loans for 1995). Moreover, it has extracted a tremendous price from Russian society. The wars which would be required to restore the Russian empire would prove much more costly not just for Russia and the region, but for peace, world stability, and security. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As the former Soviet arsenals are spread throughout the NIS, these conflicts may escalate to include the use of weapons of mass destruction. Scenarios including unauthorized missile launches are especially threatening. Moreover, if successful, a reconstituted Russian empire would become a major destabilizing influence both in Eurasia and throughout the world. It would endanger not only Russia's neighbors, but also the U.S. and its allies in Europe and the Middle East. And, of course, a neo-imperialist Russia could imperil the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf.<sup>15</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Domination of the Caucasus would bring Russia closer to the Balkans, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Middle East. Russian imperialists, such as radical nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, have resurrected the old dream of obtaining a warm port on the Indian Ocean. If Russia succeeds in establishing its domination in the south, the threat to Ukraine, Turkey, Iran, and Afganistan will increase. The independence of pro-Western Georgia and Azerbaijan already has been undermined by pressures from the Russian armed forces and covert actions by the intelligence and security services, in addition to which Russian hegemony would make Western political and economic efforts to stave off Islamic militancy more difficult. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Eurasian oil resources are pivotal to economic development in the early 21st century. The supply of Middle Eastern oil would become precarious if Saudi Arabia became unstable, or if Iran or Iraq provoked another military conflict in the area. Eurasian oil is also key to the economic development of the southern NIS. Only with oil revenues can these countries sever their dependence on Moscow and develop modern market economies and free societies. Moreover, if these vast oil reserves were tapped and developed, tens of thousands of U.S. and Western jobs would be created. The U.S. should ensure free access to these reserves for the benefit of both Western and local economies. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to protect U.S. and Western interests in Eurasia and ensure free and fair access to the oil reserves of the region, the United States should:
<p><ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strive to preserve the independence and economic viability of the New Independent States in the region.</b> In cooperation with Britain, Germany, and France, the U.S. should prevent the reconstitution of Moscow's sphere of influence in the southern CIS. The West should not grant Moscow <i>carte blanche</i> in the "near abroad" in exchange for cooperation in Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. should lead other Western countries in implementing programs that support independent statehood, free-market development, and the rule of law in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and the Central Asian states. Training for the civil and security services of these countries should be stepped up, and economic reforms, including privatization of industries and agriculture, should be continued. Moreover, sanctions on technical and humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan, imposed at the height of the Karabakh conflict, should be lifted to increase Washington's leverage in settling the conflict there.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Ensure that Russia is not a dominant, but rather an equal partner in developing the oil resources of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</b> Russian oil companies should be assured of equitable access to the development of oil resources and pipeline projects. The strategic goal of the West should be the creation of a level playing field that allows Russian and Western corporations to participate in the development of Eurasian energy resources on an equal footing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If cooperation from Russia is not forthcoming, the U.S. should oppose attempts by the Russian security establishment to impose a single direction for the pipelines -- i.e., north, via Russian territory. This kind of geopolitical <i>diktat</i> would give Moscow an unacceptable level of control over the flow of oil to Western markets and would make the West vulnerable to Russia's political whims. The U.S. government should demand that Russia stop fostering conflicts in the area. At the same time, Washington should promise that the interests of Russian companies operating in the region will be taken into account in current and future oil consortia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Work through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and through bilateral channels, to defuse ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus.</b> The OSCE has been charged by its members with settling the conflicts in Chechnya, Abkhazia, and Karabakh. This authority is recognized by Russia. So far, the OSCE has not been successful. To become more so, the OSCE should step up efforts to bring together the leaders of the Newly Independent States and separatist ethnic groups so they can find acceptable political solutions to the conflicts in the region. The OSCE should assign senior politicians to mediate in order to prevent new conflicts, particularly between the Azerbaijanis and the Lezgin and Talysh minorities in Azerbaijan, or between the Georgians and the Adzhar minority. An OSCE-sponsored conference to promote minority rights in the Southern CIS would be in order. The U.S. and its allies should support the OSCE's efforts and initiate a bilateral dialog with leaders of the ethnic groups to assist them in finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> in their countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strengthen secular Muslim societies, notably Turkey and Azerbaijan, against Islamic militant groups.</b> Both Russian ambitions and Islamic radicalism threaten the pro-Western orientation of regimes in the region. Economic development, support for basic human rights, and cultural affinity with the West are important to prevent a radicalization of Islamic politics in the region. An important ally in this regard is Turkey. The U.S. should support Turkey's bid for membership in the European Union. Turkish efforts have been sidetracked by the Europeans because of Ankara's crackdown on the Kurds last year. Washington should urge the Europeans to refrain from rejecting Turkish Westernizers and pushing the Turks into the hands of militant Islamists.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Support the Western oil route through Turkey to reduce oil transportation hazards in the Bosphorus Straits.</b> As an important U.S. ally and founding NATO member, Turkey has raised serious concerns regarding tanker exports of Eurasian oil through the narrow and twisting Bosphorus Straits. Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, would be endangered by the nonstop tanker traffic the exports of vast new quantities of Eurasian oil would require. 
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Straits today are one of the busiest maritime passages in the world. The shipping of more oil from Eurasia would clog the already crowded waterway. Recent accidents involving burning tankers prove that Turkish concerns are justified. Free access to shipping via the Straits was envisaged in the 19th century, when the volume of traffic was twenty times lower than today. Therefore, the safest (and cheapest) route for Eurasian oil, which is preferred by Western oil companies, is a large pipeline from the Caucasus via Turkey to the Eastern Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The struggle for Eurasian oil is a multifaceted game. It involves security, geopolitical, and economic interests not only Russian and Eurasian, but American and Western as well. In Russia, nothing less than democracy is at stake. If Russia pursues a cooperative engagement with the West in the Caucasus, it will strengthen its economic and political integration with the West. However, if it chooses to challenge the West and reverts to its old imperial ways, Moscow likely will become increasingly hostile toward the West in other areas as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The oil and gas reserves of the Caucasus and Central Asia are vital to Western geostrategic and economic interests in the 21st century. They have the potential to secure prosperity and economic growth bolstered by low oil prices. In addition, these resources are key to ensuring revenues and, with them, the sovereignty of the Newly Independent States. In addition, the wealth brought by oil can fuel both economic and democratic development in the Caucasus and Central Asia, fostering the independence and freedom of countries which serve in turn as an obstacle to potential Russian imperial expansion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian military and political establishment is attempting to impose a sphere of influence on the CIS and secure control of the region's oil. If a hardliner wins the Russian presidential elections in June 1996, these efforts may redouble. A major campaign to assert influence in the Russian "near abroad" would be a setback for U.S. interests. In addition, control of the Caucasus and Central Asia would allow Russia geographical proximity to, and closer cooperation with, the anti-Western regimes in Tehran and Baghdad. Together, an anti-Western Russia, Iran, and Iraq, if they desired, could pursue a common interest in driving up the price of oil. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To counter this prospect, the U.S. and the West need to convince the Russians to approach the oil question in Eurasia as an economic, not geopolitical, opportunity. The U.S. should reassure Russia that its companies will be included in future economic ventures in the region. Russian companies alone do not have the technological and financial resources to develop the hydrocarbon reserves of Eurasia. They will need Western oil companies to do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To become richer, Russia needs American and Western help. To foster peace and stability in Eurasia, America needs Russian help. A <i>modus vivendi</i> can be reached only if Russia accepts that the principles of free markets, democracy, and state sovereignty take precedence over the outdated geopolitical practices of the past century.

<title>The Duma Elections: Russian Reformers Beware -- Heritage</title>

<h3>THE DUMA ELECTIONS: RUSSIAN REFORMERS BEWARE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br> 
Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies<sup>1 </sup><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 443<br>
December 29, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
The elections to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, on December 17 
demonstrated that democratic politics are beginning to take root in Russia. A healthy majority of 
eligible voters participated, and the political elites are learning that they must appeal to them. 
However, many voters clearly are frustrated with the hardships of economic transition, crime, and 
corruption. The impressive performance by Gennady Zyuganov's communists at the polls, and the 
high public opinion ratings of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky as a presidential candidate, 
indicate that the pro-market forces may lose control of the executive branch in the June 1996 
presidential elections. If this occurs, there is a danger that the 1995 elections will be the first and the 
last free and "clean" parliamentary elections in Russia for a long time.
<p>
<b>More Hardline Duma.</b> Half of the Duma (225 seats) is elected by party lists. To win 
seats in this half, parties had to gain more than five percent of the popular vote. Only four parties 
met this test. The Russian voters gave the communists 22 percent and Zhirinovsky's "Liberal 
Democratic" Party of Russia (LDPR) 11 percent. The centrist Our Home is Russia, headed by 
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, received 10 percent of the vote, and the reformist 
<i>Yabloko</i> Party led by economist Grigory Yavlinsky just over 7 percent. This means that the 
communists, together with their allies, now have about 30 percent of the votes, and the nationalists, 
over 17 percent.
<p>
The other half of the Duma is made up of single-seat constituencies, in which the candidate with the 
majority of votes in the district takes the parliamentary post. In these single-mandate districts, the 
voters elected 77 independent (unaffiliated) candidates, 58 communists, 20 deputies from the 
Agrarian Party (which is closely tied to the communists), 14 from <i>Yabloko</i>, and 10 from 
Our Home is Russia. Former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's reformist Democratic Choice 
of Russia and the communist-nationalist Power to the People party, led by former USSR Prime 
Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, won 9 seats each. Zhirinovsky's LDPR took only one seat. A few seats 
in the single-mandate districts were gained by members of smaller parties which did not clear the 
five percent barrier. 
<p>
Out of the total of 450 Duma seats, the communists lead with 150 seats, while LDPR, Our Home is 
Russia, and <i>Yabloko</i> all have approximately 50 each. Given these figures, the communists 
most probably will manage to appoint a chairman and take control of several key committees. The 
leadership of the Duma will consist of the chairman and leaders of the factions which will be 
formed. Given its composition, the Duma is likely to prove confrontational toward the executive 
branch.
<p>
<b>Achievement for Russian Democracy.</b> The 1995 democratic process was more 
transparent and fair than in 1993: this Duma was elected for a full four-year term; no parties were 
banned from running, and a total of 42 parties and movements participated in the race. The 1993 
Duma was elected for two years only, and several parties were banned from running after the 
Russian Supreme Soviet was disbanded by Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
The Russian public showed maturity by heeding the call to participate in the voting process. The 
voting rate was a respectable 65 percent, 15 percentage points higher than in 1993. The lowest 
voting rate was among the young, who tended to cast their ballots for democrats, Zhirinovsky, or 
centrists, but not for the communists. Older voters leaned more heavily toward the communists.
<p>
The elections were "clean" by Russian standards. This is the assessment of foreign and Russian 
observers and of the generally free mass media. There were very few reports of minor tampering 
with the process; three candidates, however, were killed or died in suspicious traffic accidents. 
<p>
There were quite a few surprises in the elections. A number of parties had been expected to do 
better. Among these were Gaidar's Democratic Choice of Russia (4.1 percent), Women of Russia 
(4.6 percent), and the Congress of Russian Communities led by the charismatic General Alexander 
Lebed (4.3 percent). 
<p>
The poor performance of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia suggests that the 
voters do not trust the government's execution of reforms, and they are tired of the ubiquitous crime 
and corruption. Our Home is Russia won the most votes in Moscow (20 percent), where the 
country's capital is most heavily concentrated, and where the reforms already have produced wealth 
and opportunity. (Almost all of Moscow's single-mandate districts returned democratic candidates.) 
Voters in the provinces, where the reforms have not yet generated jobs and have weakened the 
social safety net, gave the communists and nationalists their heaviest gains.
<p>
<b>The Presidency: Yeltsin Still in the Running.</b> Many Russians believe that the Duma 
elections were but a dress rehearsal for the real political fight that will take place in the presidential 
elections next summer. The Duma elections highlighted Communist Party chief Zyuganov and his 
ability to command the still-formidable Party machine. They also showcased Zhirinovsky's shrewd 
political instincts, setting him up as the other presidential front-runner in June. On the other hand, 
Alexander Lebed, whose ads featured the General shooting an arsenal of infantry weapons, has 
shown that he is a better soldier than a politician. 
<p>
According to public opinion polls, both Chernomyrdin and President Boris Yeltsin are not favored 
to do well if they run for president. Both men are in their sixties in a country where the average 
male life expectancy is only 57. Yeltsin's ill health remains a central theme in Russian politics. 
Nevertheless, well-informed sources in Moscow predict that he will still run in June, even though 
he trails Zyuganov, Zhirinovsky, Lebed, and Yavlinsky in the presidential election ratings.
<p>
Yegor Gaidar's poor showing eliminated him as the presidential hopeful of the Russian center-right. 
Grigory Yavlinsky, who consistently has distanced himself from the Yeltsin administration and 
won high personal approval rating among the voters, remains the only democratic presidential 
hopeful. However, he will need to work hard to win the first round of presidential elections by 
becoming a consensus candidate of the reformers -- not a very likely development. 
<p>
<b>Conclusion.</b> The fight for Russia's democratic future is far from over. The democrats and 
reformers are split and hardly capable of resisting the dual nationalist and communist threat. While 
the elections showed that Russians can behave like good democrats, they showed also that voters 
do not necessarily elect good democrats. The reformers have to increase their popular appeal, and 
do it very fast. If these had been presidential elections, Gennady Zyuganov would now be the leader 
of Russia and working to turn back the clock, with disastrous consequences for his own country and 
her neighbors near and far. Come June, this may be a very real scenario if democrats do not unite.

<center><h3><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h3></center>
	The Senate soon will vote on legislation authorizing $673 million in aid to Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS) in FY 1996 and another $619 million in FY 1997.<p>

	In making this vote, the Senate will face some difficult choices. Foreign aid is more unpopular than ever, and aid to Russia, Ukraine, and other post-Soviet states is coming under heavy scrutiny. Moreover, U.S.-Russian cooperation is ebbing. Moscow's refusal to stop the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran has made it difficult to justify aid to Russia. So, too, has Russia's heavy-handed intervention in Chechnya.<p>

	Given these circumstances, Russian aid should be re-examined and applied to areas that not only make a difference, but also fit into an overall strategic plan. Properly applied, the transfer of market and democratic "know-how" can promote U.S. interests in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, increasing Russia's chances for a smooth transition to democracy and a free market. Therefore, Congress should continue aid to support the growth of democratic capitalism in Russia. This aid should be used to help democratic reformers, who face growing challenges from extremists. The most important programs in achieving this goal are those that develop market institutions, foster economic reform and privatization, and enhance the rule of law and democratic politics. <p>

	In addition, U.S. assistance in dismantling the former Soviet nuclear arsenal (the Nunn-Lugar program) should continue. Americans see reducing the Russian strategic threat as a worthwhile investment in U.S. security. However, this program should not be a sacred cow. The U.S. General Accounting Office and independent writers have reported serious flaws in this program, such as the use of U.S. taxpayers' funds for Russia's nuclear modernization and defense conversion. These flaws must be remedied. Congress should refocus the Nunn-Lugar program on its original purpose -- dismantling the Russian nuclear, chemical, and biological arsenal.<p>

	While fostering democratic capitalism in Russia serves U.S. national interests, many of the aid programs administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) do not. They often are poorly conceived and executed. For the last thirty years, AID and its traditional contractors have not worked in Eastern and Central Europe. Instead, they have operated in the Third World. As a result, AID officials and contractors lack the area and linguistic expertise needed to support the great post-communist transformation in Europe and the NIS. AID needs to upgrade its regional skills in the NIS, focus more of its efforts on developing democratic capitalism, and ensure that more aid funds go to Russian reformers, and not to American bureaucrats and experts.<p>

	As the Senate considers aid to Russia and the NIS, it should add conditions to this aid and refocus the program to make it more effective and relevant to the particular needs of its recipients. Specifically, the Senate should:<p>
<ul>
<li>Demand that the Administration suspend negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is completed. The reactor sale is on hold pending negotiations between Vice President Al Gore and Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could block the Clinton Administration's agreement to reschedule Russia's debt if the sale to Iran goes through.<p>

<li>Condition U.S. support for IMF credits to the Russian government on a cease-fire in Chechnya. If Russia wants to be treated as a civilized member of the Western alliance, it must end the war in Chechnya. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could condition IMF or World Bank appropriations on the Russian government's compliance with a cease-fire and negotiations to settle the conflict in Chechnya.<p>

<li>Create an independent board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS. This board could set clear goals for U.S. aid to Russia and uphold democratic development as one of its top priorities. The Senate could help create this board by amending the foreign aid authorization bill.<p>

<li>Reprogram $225 million to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities Import Program (CIP) and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program. The $90 million CIP is a giveaway for U.S. businesses selling oil and gas technology to Russian industry. It should be eliminated and the funds used to further democracy in Russia, as should the $135 million earmarked for housing displaced Russian military officers. <p>

<li>Make democratic development a top priority. By amending the authorization bill, the Senate could demand that the Russian aid program focus exclusively on the development of democracy, the rule of law, and free markets. Many of AID's programs are unfocused, ineffective, and all too often intended to advance pet liberal causes, not democratic capitalism.<p>

<li>Target grants directly to democratic institutions in Russia and the NIS. Russians receive very little American help in fighting against human rights violations, media censorship, or racism, Most of the funds go to Americans purporting to help Russians, but Russian democrats can do far more with this money than American  "experts."<p>
</ul>


<a name="seige"><h3><center>RUSSIAN DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM UNDER SIEGE</h3></a></center>

	Russian democracy and free markets are in deep crisis. Ten years after the beginning of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, members of the former Communist Party elite still control the levers of power in Moscow as well as in the provinces. They are also in charge of Russia's vast properties and natural resources. Chaotic privatization has given many former Communist Party officials personal ownership of factories and other assets over which they used to exercise only administrative control. <p>

	The influence of old Soviet bureaucracy extends to foreign trade, the privatization process, and the issuing of business licenses. Russians often say that government bureaucrats, not entrepreneurs, are the richest people in the land. This elite may have given up its Marxist slogans, but it remains deeply committed to state intervention, government regulation, and the unbridled exercise of power. More often than not, Russian nationalism is touted in place of Marxist internationalism as a cover for the same old thing --   personal greed. <p>

	Ordinary Russians are deeply and understandably disenchanted with the direction reforms have taken. The majority of the population has lost interest in the political process, as evidenced by the low turnout of less than 25 percent in the most recent local and regional elections.<p>

	Support for political extremists on both the left and right is growing. Moreover, an increasing number of voters have cast their ballots for Russian Communist Party (RCP) candidates in recent elections. Running on an anti-government, anti-establishment, and anti-corruption platform, the communists are a favorite for the December 1995 elections to the Duma, the lower house of Parliament.<p>

	The Military Wild Card. The Russian armed forces also are disenchanted with the reform process. They oppose a Western-style democracy for Russia and yearn for a ruler with a "strong hand."  Military troops voted heavily for ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky in December 1993. The armed forces today are polarized between the majority of the officer corps, who believe that the military is grossly mismanaged, and a small group of generals around Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who use their positions for personal enrichment. The Russian Army feels defeated and nostalgic for the Soviet period, when it enjoyed high status and large budgets. <p>

	This situation has been made worse by the war in Chechnya, in which tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have participated in killing citizens of their own country. In the 1980s, veterans of the Afghan war contributed to the swelling ranks of Russian organized crime. They also flooded the extremist nationalist movements. This could well be repeated after Chechnya, further destabilizing Russia's feeble democracy.<p>

	Authoritarian Renaissance. Democracy is under siege as well. The Yeltsin administration has done little to promote the rule of law in Russia. It rammed through the 1993 Constitution, establishing an "imperial" presidency with little but an advisory role for Parliament. Such democratic reformers as former Acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, Vice Prime Minister Gennadii Burbulis, Human Rights Commissioner Sergei Kovalev, Ethnic Policy Advisor Galina Starovoitova, and many others have been pushed out of the government. The most influential group in the Kremlin today includes Yeltsin's Chief of Bodyguards, General Alexander Korzhakov, and First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who is in charge of the military-industrial complex. Even Yeltsin's Chief of Staff, Sergei Filatov, has complained that presidential aides are forced to communicate by writing notes to each other because their phones and rooms are wiretapped.<p>

	The political role and power of Russia's historically strong spy agencies are growing. In September 1994, the Foreign Intelligence Service, headed by KGB veteran General Evgenii Primakov, published its own policy statement advocating strengthened Russian domination of the whole area of the former Soviet Union, the so-called near abroad. According to Primakov's agency, Russia must re-consolidate all the Newly Independent States under its tutelage regardless of the West's opposition.<p>

	On April 6, 1995, President Yeltsin signed the State Duma law reorganizing the secret police, then called the Federal Counterintelligence Service and known by its Russian acronym, FSK (Federalnaya Sluzhba Kontrrazvedki). This agency, the successor to the Second Chief Directorate of the KGB, is now called the Federal Security Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, or FSB). It has been granted wide powers to conduct investigations and perform surveillance in total secrecy. The scope of its activities was broadened to cover a wide range of internal security threats ranging from organized crime to political extremism to corruption.<p>

	Threats to Free Media. The Yeltsin administration is tightening its control over the electronic media, especially the national television stations. The provincial media also are under heavy pressure from the local chiefs of administration, who have been pressured by Yeltsin to "toe the line."  In late 1993, former Pravda journalist Boris Mironov was appointed chairman of the State Committee on Press. Before he was fired in the fall of 1994, Mironov funneled huge subsidies to hard-line ultra-nationalist newspapers. "If to be a Russian nationalist means to be a fascist, then I am a fascist," he said.<p>

	Vlad Listyev, Director General of the largest Russian TV network and a popular talk show host, was gunned down in the entrance to his apartment building on March 1, 1995. On October 17, 1994, investigative reporter Dmitrii Kholodov of Moskovskii Komsomoletz was murdered by an exploding briefcase. Kholodov was investigating corruption in the military at the time. Others have been slain while investigating organized crime. Journalists in the regions have been tortured and killed. The print media are coming under increasing pressure, as the Moscow government owns printing presses and manipulates the prices of newsprint as well as subsidies to newspapers. <p>

	The Russian government continues to play a dubious role in the media scene. It refuses to privatize television stations and printing plants. The official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta publishes anonymous attacks on Yeltsin's opponents, such as media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, who has been accused of launching a "putsch" against Yeltsin. Formerly allied with democratic presidential candidate Grigory Yavlinsky and Moscow mayor Yurii Luzhkov, Gusinsky is a political foe of a powerful group in Yeltsin's entourage. The State Duma thus far has failed to eliminate the right of the government to establish media outlets, while it has expanded the list of circumstances under which the government is empowered to shut them down.<p>

	Criminalization of Politics. Rising crime also is endangering democracy in Russia. The recent gangland-style murder of three Duma deputies may have been the work of professional hired killers. So far, no arrests have been made. Moreover, a senior Russian Interior Ministry expert warns against the growing influence of Russian mafiosi "among law enforcement organs and other organs of power."Whole areas of Russia are becoming the domain of organized crime. But the Yeltsin administration is notoriously ineffective in fighting crime and corruption. Despite draconian decrees, known criminal figures remain unpunished and free to penetrate the Russian body politic. At the same time, the hard-liners are exploiting the public's fear of lawlessness to advance their own political goals.<p>

	Organized crime is reaching the highest echelons of power. In the summer of 1994, a Moscow mafia don, Otari Kvantrishvili, was killed by a sniper's bullet. Kvantrishvili headed a powerful political party, Sportsmen of Russia, which was better organized and financed than some legitimate parties represented in the Duma. A prominent criminal, Vladimir Podatev from Khabarovsk, nicknamed "the Poodle," is launching a national political career by becoming a member of the Presidential Public Chamber Human Rights Commission. Podatev is also the leader of a local political movement called Unity, a first step toward attaining office in a national election.<p>

	The Fascist Threat. Extremist Russian nationalism, often identified as neo-Nazism or fascism, is another threat to Russian democracy. The nationalists comprise a broad spectrum, from Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party, which is well-represented in the Duma, to the National Republican Party of Nicholas Lysenko, who was elected to the Duma by a St. Petersburg district. Zhirinovsky's delegates comprise 22 percent of the State Duma. Altogether, the nationalists are expected to get over 30 percent of the vote in the December 1995 elections.<p>

	Nationalists also find political support from Gennadii Ziuganov's communists and Vladimir Barkashov's Russian National Unity movement. The nationalists are united in their hatred of the United States and the West. Some are anti-Semitic, while others passionately hate dark-skinned "Caucasians" -- Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, and Central Asians.<p>

	Russian fascists are involved in extensive paramilitary training programs, conducted with the full knowledge and complacent inaction of the authorities. One of their most important leaders, judo black belt Vladimir Barkashov, claims to have 10,000 well-trained fighters under his command. The Russian security services put this number at 2,000. Other organizations, such as Zhirinovsky's Falcons, the Werewolf Legion, the National Republicans, and Pamyat, have from several dozen to several hundred stormtroopers each.<p>

	Unfortunately, some officials in Russia's law enforcement agencies, including KGB spin-offs, the police, and even the prosecutor's office, often sympathize with and support political extremists. Defectors from Barkashov's organization warn that a deliberate attempt by the neo-Nazis to penetrate the military and security services is under way.<p>

	Russian law enforcement and security services are incompetent in fighting ultra-nationalists as they are in combating organized crime. For example, the police failed to keep Alexei Vedenkin, a prominent Russian fascist, in pre-trial detention after he pledged on national television to kill Duma Defense Committee Chairman Sergei Yushenkov and Yeltsin Human Rights Commissioner Sergei A. Kovalev. After two weeks in jail, he was released by a Moscow judge on a technicality. Meanwhile, Vedenkin's Russian National Movement has bought up a large packet of shares in the Siren Three consortium, which will control plane ticket reservations all over Russia and the former Soviet Union.<p>


<a name="nis"><h3><center>WHY AID RUSSIA AND THE NIS?</h3>
</a></center>
	Despite the rocky road to reform, Russia has not reverted to its old-style totalitarian ways. Nor is it an ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Despite the chaos of its transition, there are reasons for hope. Privatization has allowed many Russians to acquire or start small businesses. Others have become owners of Soviet-era factories. More Russians are employed today in the private sector than at any time since 1917. The reforms in Ukraine are about to take hold. The nascent capital markets and commodity exchanges are breeding rough-and-tumble capitalists -- the kind that build personal fortunes. The entrepreneurial class is more involved in politics than ever. Pressure to formalize the legal infrastructure needed to conduct business is growing.<p>

	Political pluralism also is growing. There are at least ten large political parties or movements in Russia. In addition, dozens of political parties will compete in the December 1995 elections. The independent media are providing blunt and courageous coverage of Chechnya, despite government attempts to manipulate them. While some Russians yearn for a "strong hand," 70 percent want democratic elections and a free press. Moreover, support for reforms is highest where it matters most -- among urban educated citizens under the age of 35.<p>

	Nor has Russia embarked upon a Bolshevik-style retaking of the former Russian empire as it did under Lenin and Stalin. The Russian military is bogged down in Chechnya and Central Asia. Despite calls from nationalists to rebuild the USSR, ineptitude and corruption in the army and the lack of popular will to pay the price do not bode well for Russian revanchists. After Chechnya, the Russian leadership probably will think twice before ordering tanks into any other rebellious area. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's repeated attempts to distance himself from the fiasco in the Caucasus, and the Duma's     relentless attacks on President Yeltsin over Chechnya, indicate that Russia's elites are  seeking new ways to settle political crises.<p>

	Almost eighty years ago the West abandoned Russia to the Bolsheviks. Today, it is in America's interest to encourage Russia to follow a new direction and make its domestic and international behavior more benign. At the same time, the U.S. should support the independence and viability of the other post-Soviet states as a balance against a possible Russian resurgence. Reformers in Moscow, Kiev, and other parts of the NIS have asked repeatedly not only for technical assistance to build democratic and market institutions, but also for support of non-governmental alternatives to state services and functions. Properly implemented, U.S. assistance should be fulfilling these needs. <p>

	The crisis of Russian democracy is deep, but there is hope. U.S. assistance to democrats in Russia and parts of the NIS possibly could help end this crisis. Without U.S. aid, however, it will only get worse.<p>


<a name="bird"><h3><center>AID'S INEFFECTIVE PROGRAMS:<br> TOO MUCH BIG BIRD, TOO LITTLE DEMOCRACY</h3>
</a></center>
	Saying that aid can make a difference in Russia is one thing. Saying that current aid programs are doing the job is another. Many current U.S. aid programs to Russia and the NIS are not doing the job. They are often ineffective and should be reorganized. As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has noted: <p>

	[M]uch of AID's technical assistance effort in the New Independent States and Central and Eastern Europe has produced little positive result. Closed procurement practices and AID's own lack of experience in the region has too often led to the awarding of contracts to organizations who themselves have little regional or area competence. In many instances, AID has relied on its network of contractors which have experience in the poorest developing nations. The result has often been wasteful expenditures on contractor field office infrastructure, poor recruitment of participants and expensive, and misdirected short-term training in the United States which has had negative impact on NIS professionals participating in the program.<p>

	Certainly the problem has not been lack of money. Congress has appropriated almost $3.7 billion in aid to Russia since the assistance program began in 1992. Out of these funds, AID obligated $2.5 billion, but only $1.2 billion has been spent. In addition, only $126 million was obligated and $49 million spent on "democratic pluralism initiatives" in the whole of the NIS (see Appendix). Funds for building democracy in the NIS comprised only about 5 percent of AID's total budget; by contrast, management costs make up about 5 percent to 10 percent. Clearly, promoting democracy is AID's budgetary stepchild.<p>

	While some AID programs are successful, many are expensive, lack a coherent overall strategy, and are ill-conceived and poorly executed. For example, not a single U.S. law school or law office received AID funds to execute an AID-sponsored program in the NIS. Yet establishing the rule of law is one of the most important prerequisites of democracy. AID's rule of law program has been severely criticized by legal professionals both in Russia and the U.S. They argue that too few lawyers, lawmakers, judges, and prosecutors have been involved to make a significant impact. The program does not sponsor the long-term education of Russian lawyers in U.S. law schools. Nor has AID succeeded in placing a significant number of American legal advisors in Russian ministries, the Duma, or the Supreme and Constitutional Courts. American jurists have had precious little impact on Russian legislation and regulations.<p>

	Instead of providing adequate support for rule of law programs, what has AID been doing?  Funding Big Bird in Russia. Despite the fact that Russia already produces superb children's films and television programs, AID has granted $2 million to the Children's Television Workshop, a money-making venture affiliated with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, to produce a Russian version of the American TV program Sesame Street. Why does a group like CTW, which is worth millions, need taxpayer money to set up shop in Russia?  And what does giving exposure to the Russian-speaking equivalent of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch have to do with developing democracy and the rule of law? <p>


<a name="capitalism"><h3><center>SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA</h3></a></center>

	Properly focused and administered, aid to Russia and the NIS serves American interests. AID could help prevent Russia from becoming a crime-ridden "mafiacracy," a source of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons proliferation, and a destabilizing factor in the global financial and commodities markets. Many Russian democrats wish for the same things. <p>

	In order to assist the transformation to democratic capitalism in Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet republics, the Senate should:<p>
<ul>
<li>Demand that the Administration suspend negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is completed. The nuclear sale was the topic of discussions between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin at their May summit in Moscow. The two agreed to refer the matter to the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission for further negotiation. During those negotiations, Vice President Gore should make it clear that the U.S. and Russia cannot have a normal and friendly relationship if the sale goes through. <p>
</ul>
	In the meantime, Russia wants a sweeping rescheduling of half its $130 billion debt to the West by the end of this year. At the same time, Yeltsin asked the G-7 leaders at the Halifax summit in June to accept Russia into the Paris Club as a creditor to Third World countries for their Soviet-era debts. This is an opportunity for the U.S. Senate to demand Russia's cancellation of the Iranian nuclear deal. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could demand that Russia's debt not be rescheduled if the deal goes through. The U.S. could relax access to its nuclear and commercial satellite launch markets for Russian companies as compensation for canceling the Iranian transaction. <p>
<ul>
<li>Condition U.S. support for IMF credits to the Russian government on cease-fire in Chechnya. The U.S. cannot and should not challenge the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. Like any other state, Russia has the right to ensure its sovereignty. However, this right does not justify the extreme means employed against the people of Chechnya. Other measures short of war should have been taken. For example, a Federal Treaty model, which is working in the case of Moscow's relations with Tatarstan, was not seriously tried in Chechnya.<p>
</ul>
	Last spring, the U.S. supported $6.6 billion in International Monetary Fund credits to Russia. In view of Moscow's intransigence in Chechnya, the Congress should condition any future U.S. support for IMF financial assistance on a cease-fire and negotiations to settle the conflict. The U.S. should demand that all hostilities be stopped, especially those affecting innocent civilians, and that negotiations be successfully concluded, either bilaterally or through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until such time, the Senate should consider amending the foreign aid authorization bill to demand that the U.S. suspend its financial assistance to Russia through such multilateral organizations as the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. This position would strengthen the hand of Russians who are calling for an end to the hostilities in Chechnya and for a negotiated solution.<p>
<ul>
<li>Create an independent board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS. AID has poorly managed U.S. aid programs for the NIS. An independent board, nominated jointly by Congress and the President, should take over the management of these programs and refocus them on building democratic capitalism in the NIS. (A modified board for all assistance projects was suggested by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), but was voted down in committee.) This board could include representatives from the State and Commerce Departments as well as area experts and representatives of the U.S. corporations involved in the NIS.<p></ul>

	There is precedent for creating such a board. The presidentially appointed Board of International Broadcasting (BIB) for forty years successfully administered Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Members of this nonpartisan board included such prominent Americans as Malcolm Forbes, Jr., James Buckley, Frank Shakespeare, and Lane Kirkland.<p>
<ul>
<li>Reprogram $225 million to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities Import Program (CIP) and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program. Under the CIP, $90 million worth of U.S.-made oil and gas equipment is to be given to Russia's most profitable industry, the hydrocarbon energy sector. The program should be abolished. The CIP is supposed to improve the Russian balance of payments and to assist in repaying Russia's debt to Western creditors by allowing Russia, with U.S. support, to drill for and sell more oil in the world market. AID bureaucrats hope that more productive American equipment will boost the Russian state-run energy sector. However, all the CIP would do is prop up the inefficient state-owned Russian energy industry. Experience in Russia shows that Western equipment alone is not a panacea. Capital investment, such as CIP-funded equipment, will not alleviate the problems of systemic mismanagement that plague the Russian oil and gas industry. Only privatization and massive Western investment will resolve the problem once and for all. The funds saved from abolishing CIP should be reprogrammed into democracy-building programs.<p></ul>

	So, too, should funds from the program to build housing for Russian military officers. Under orders from President Yeltsin, the Russian army participated in the slaughter of civilians in Chechnya. The funding for Russian officer resettlement was cut by the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee this spring. The Senate restored this funding in conference, but reduced it from the $155 million requested by the Clinton Administration to $135 million. This money would be spent better on democracy-building programs. <p>
<ul>
<li>Make democratic development a top priority. Thus far, AID's Democratic Initiatives Program is unfocused and suffers from hidden agendas. For example, AID will spend $500,000 on a program administered by Winrock International to enhance the "development and operation of a united group of women's NGOs in Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. to facilitate interaction, cooperation and collaboration in the building of a democratic society in the former Soviet Union."  Russia needs to build democratic institutions and the rule of law. It does not need American liberals telling Russians how to organize feminist groups.<p></ul>

	Far more important would be programs that train Russians to run election campaigns and organize grass-roots groups and referenda. This aid should be given to such democratic parties as Russia's Choice, Yabloko, and the Economic Freedom Party. Public organizations involved in significant reform of legislative and judicial bodies or in public education, such as the Foundation for Parliamentary Development and the newly established Anti-Fascist Foundation, also deserve support.<p>

	U.S.-funded programs need to employ qualified Russian reformers, who understand their politics and culture far better than AID contractors with little experience in Russia. Most AID democracy development programs have been awarded to traditional contractors who know more about AID's lengthy and complex contracting process than they do about Russia, Ukraine, and other NIS countries. Russians and Americans living in Moscow complain that these contractors spend large amounts of AID money to "educate" themselves about the problems. Why hand out perks to friends of AID bureaucrats when Russian democrats could do the job for less money?<p>

	To focus aid programs on building democracy in the NIS, Congress should establish priorities for democratic assistance. Funds should go to Russian and American organizations that:<p>
<ul>
<li>Train Russians and other NIS citizens to run and manage elections and electoral campaigns;<p>

<li>Foster the use of public opinion research;<p>

<li>Help organize democratic grass-roots organizations;<p>

<li>Educate Russians in fundraising techniques;<p>

<li>Develop political parties;<p>

<li>Develop Western-style academic programs in law, business, and market economics;<p>

<li>Use the existing legal system to prosecute neo-Nazis for violations of laws;<p>

<li>Post Western legal advisors in the legislatures, government ministries, regional administrations, the court system, and the Attorney General's office;<p>

<li>Help develop administrative law that allows citizens to challenge central and local governments in the courts;<p>

<li>Work to develop constitutional law;<p>

<li>Draft democratic legislation;<p>

<li> Assist in law enforcement, such as setting up neighborhood watches, anti-crime hotlines, and witness relocation programs; and <p>

<li>Train legislators, judges, and lawyers in the rule of law.<p>

<li>Target grants directly to democratic institutions in Russia. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could direct more funds into democracy-building programs administered by the Eurasia Foundation and National Endowment for Democracy. The Eurasia Foundation and NED directly fund Russian grass-roots organizations, like the Memorial Society, which is fighting against human rights violations in Chechnya, and the Glasnost Foundation, which promotes the reform of Russia's secret services. These are examples of organizations that deserve Western support. Private American institutions such as The Heritage Foundation, the Krieble Institute, and the Soros Foundation have accumulated experience in working with Russian institutions and could help identify appropriate recipients and personnel for targeted U.S. assistance.<p></ul>


<h3><a name="conclusion"><center>CONCLUSION</a></h3></center>

	Russian democracy is in a danger zone. While U.S. aid alone cannot save democracy in Russia, it certainly can improve its chance of surviving. Clearly, America has an interest in a democratic Russia. Assisting Russia's transition to democracy is as important as were the de-Nazification of Germany and the reforming of Japan after World War II. But the Clinton Administration has failed to rise to the challenge. Time is running out. U.S. aid programs need to be refocused not on the traditional development goals of the foreign aid bureaucracy, but on building democracy and free markets.<p>

AID'S DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS IN THE NIS

	The AID-funded Democratic Pluralism Initiatives Project includes the following programs:  Political Development, Rule of Law, Public Administration/Local Government, and Civil Society and Media. <p>

	The strategic aim of these programs is to accelerate NIS transition to democracy and a market economy. Their task is to strengthen civil society and its institutions, train market specialists and civic leaders, and encourage the transition to a more benign political culture. <p>

	Following is a brief summary of the major AID initiatives in the NIS. <p>

	Political Development Program. A large part of the AID funding in this program goes to the two U.S. party institutes. Since 1992 the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute have received over $10 million each. These institutes fund seminars and education for political party activists, conferences, and exchanges. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) has received over $6 million. It is involved in training for and supervision of electoral processes. The AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute has received $3.5 million. Other organizations, from the New York-based Freedom House to Indiana University, have received grants that as a rule are less than $1 million.<p>

	The Rule of Law. These programs are executed by three contractors. The largest contract, worth over $18 million, is in the hands of ARD/Checchi and Company, a traditional AID contractor. Other awards amounting to $5.6 million have gone to the American Bar Association's Central and East European Law Initiative. The Central Asian component of the Rule of Law program, worth $5.5 million, was awarded to yet another traditional AID contractor, Chemonics. These contractors provide a variety of services, from commenting on legislative drafts to jury trial training and the education of judges and prosecutors.<p>

	Public Administration and Local Government. This program is administered by the Research Triangle Institute ($19.5 million), World Learning ($2.2 million), and several smaller contractors. The program focuses on bringing Russian and NIS local officials and professionals to the U.S. to learn the techniques of city management.<p>

	Civil Society and Media. This program funds such media projects as Internews, a Moscow-based independent TV news production operation.<p>

not as some superior body to which it must apply for  approval, but as an
institution which can be useful in cultivating  international support for U.S.
policy. Another tool is foreign aid.  Aid can be an effective adjunct to U.S.
foreign policy, but only if  it works and serves American interests, neither of
which it has  done very well. Two other tools, both of which are indispensable 
for national security, are intelligence gathering and covert  operations. Even
though the Cold War is over, the chaotic and  threatening condition of today's
world requires a robust and effective  intelligence capability. Finally, there
is the important work of  public diplomacy, as represented by the United States 
Information Agency (USIA), the Voice of America (VOA), and other  official
media. Telling the American story to people overseas helps  build international
support for democracy and freedom, as well as  for specific U.S. policies.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America must be engaged in world affairs. The U.S. cannot  protect its vital
interests unless it seeks to influence world opinion  and events in such
international bodies as the United Nations. But  this does not mean compromising
American principles, sovereignty,  or freedom of action. Whether in the U.N. or
any other  multilateral organization, the U.S. government should strive to
protect  American interests and represent American values. America must  pursue
its own agenda, not that of international bureaucrats often  hostile to U.S
interests. Only by doing so can the United States  remain strong enough to
contribute effectively to international peace  and stability.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>How to develop this American agenda in international  diplomacy is an issue
which separates conservatives from liberals.  Liberals tend to distrust American
power and seek to constrain it by tying  it to the U.N. Conservatives, knowing
that this power historically  has been used for good, want to liberate it from
these constraints.  Liberals want to put American forces under U.N. military 
command, and to have America adopt the U.N. bureaucracy's generally  socialist
agenda as its own; some have gone so far as to propose  that the U.N. be given
taxing powers over U.S. citizens. By  contrast, conservatives want America to
retain sovereign control over  its own military forces when they are involved in
U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Above all, conservatives want to prevent the U.S.
 from becoming a mere servant of the U.N.'s agenda, as the Clinton 
Administration has allowed to happen in Somalia and elsewhere;  they are willing
to work through the U.N. when it suits American  interests, but not when these
interests are not served.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether, and to what extent, to support  U.S. policy abroad
through public diplomacy. Most people believe  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  the U.S. needs some form of public
diplomacy to explain  American policy and values to people in foreign lands. It
is well  known that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Voice of  America
played important roles in bringing down the Iron Curtain.  What role should they
play in today's international diplomacy?   And once this role has been
established, what is the best way to  convey this message, through existing
official media structures and  outlets or through new ones?

<P>

<P>Even its strongest advocates recognize that the U.N. is  bloated, wasteful,
poorly managed, and disorganized. Only  fundamental reform can reinvigorate the
U.N. and restore its lost  credibility. The Clinton Administration itself
recognizes that unless the  U.N. is reformed, it will drift into irrelevance and
lose public support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.N. claims that the U.S. is some $1.3 billion behind in  its financial
contributions. Washington says the figure should  be somewhat less. With
approximately half of its 185 member  states delinquent in their dues, the U.N.
is in serious financial crisis.  The Clinton Administration wants to pay, but
Congress wants to  withhold payment until the U.N. gets its budget under control
and  ends corruption and poor management practices. The Clinton  Administration
may propose a deal with Congress to repay America's  back fees over several
years in return for promised U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past few years, the U.N. has proven that it cannot  manage 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  large, complex, and ambitious &quot;peace
operations&quot;  competently. This was seen most clearly in the debacles in
Somalia and  the former Yugoslavia. Not only have these operations been 
spectacular failures; they have been costly in terms of lives, material 
resources, and money. The U.S. spent almost $3 billion (in  direct and indirect
costs) in 1995 to support these failed U.N. operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious issue involves the specialized agencies.  Conservatives
believe that agencies such as the United Nations  Development Program (UNDP) and
United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO) do not merit
American financial  support or membership. Not only are they poorly managed and 
wasteful, but their mandates are counterproductive.

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     There is broad consensus that the U.N. needs
reforming.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a September 1995 address
to  the U.N. General Assembly, proposed a &quot;concrete agenda&quot; for  U.N.
reform. This agenda involves ending programs that have  achieved their purpose,
consolidating overlapping programs,  downsizing regional economic commissions,
and imposing a moratorium  on big conferences.<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Funding for the U.N. system falls into two categories:
assessed  and voluntary contributions. An assessed contribution is the price  of
membership in the U.N. and its specialized agencies.  Countries make voluntary
contributions to specialized agencies they  also wish to support. For 1996, the
Clinton Administration  requested some $1.07 billion for U.S. assessed and
voluntary contributions  to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and
commissions.  Actual 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  U.S. spending for these
organizations totaled $1 billion in  1994. By contrast, more than 90 other
countries together account for  less than 1 percent of the U.N. budget, paying
only .01 percent each.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Cases of fraud and abuse erupt with disturbing regularity. In 
1995, for example, $10 million was embezzled from the United  Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) in Kenya. Various agencies of  the U.N. spent approximately $1
million a day at the height of the  Somalia peacekeeping operation in 1993. This
included renting  hundreds of apartments equipped with air conditioning. In 
December 1995, the U.N. scrapped a never-used $1 million turnstile  security
system at its New York headquarters. The reason: The  turnstile clocks would
have tracked the arrival and departure times of  U.N. employees. In 1995, the
U.N. spent some $500,000 for a  two-week conference on the Sustainable
Development of Small Island  Developing States, including $15,000 to fly
representatives from  the Western Sahara to Barbados.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has grown into a massive bureaucracy of over 70 
agencies and programs, including the United Nations Research  Institute for
Social Development (UNRISD) and the International  Labor Organization (ILO),
with overlapping mandates. The U.N.  system has over 50,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The United States plays a key role in supporting U.N. 
peacekeeping. Until last year, the U.S. paid nearly one-third of the  annual
$3.5 billion peacekeeping bill (now unilaterally reduced to 25  percent). The
U.S. assigns thousands of American soldiers to  U.N. missions and provides
billions of dollars worth of  transportation, equipment, and other support
services to the U.N. at no charge.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Until recently, traditional U.N. peacekeeping operations 
entailed small observation or peacekeeping missions deployed to  monitor an
already existing peace settlement. These operations  were simple, inexpensive,
unambitious, and usually staffed by  countries like Canada, Sweden, Norway, or
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     With the end of Cold War tensions among members of the 
Security Council, there was an explosion in peacekeeping  operations from 1989
to 1993, with the Security Council authorizing  more missions than it had in the
previous 40 years. In 1990, the  U.N. controlled approximately 10,000 &quot;blue
helmets&quot; in eight  operations at a cost of less than $700 million per year.
By the end  of 1993, there were over 90,000 &quot;blue helmets&quot; in 18
different  operations costing over $3.5 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has conducted 21 observation missions and six 
traditional peacekeeping missions since 1948. These missions have  a mixed
record in limiting armed conflict and promoting  conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has expanded the definition of peacekeeping 
significantly since 1990. Now peacekeeping is called &quot;second  generation
peacekeeping&quot; or &quot;peace-enforcement.&quot;  In these  operations,
peacekeepers have been sent to volatile and dangerous areas  (such as Somalia
and Bosnia) before a conclusive peace was  achieved. These missions have been
large (employing up to 40,000  troops); complex (involving armored combat
formations with combat  air and naval support); dangerous (resulting in hundreds
of  U.N. troops killed in Somalia and Bosnia); ambitious (attempting  to impose
peace through force of arms); and expensive (costing  the U.N. almost $5 million
per day in Bosnia). All have been failures. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     As of August 1995, the U.S. had over 3,200 American troops 
deployed in support of U.N. peacekeeping operations. These  operations include
Macedonia, Western Sahara, Kuwait, and Haiti.  The U.S. also provided the great
bulk of NATO air forces to enforce  a U.N.-sponsored &quot;no-fly zone&quot;
over Bosnia-Herzegovina  from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Peacekeeping operations harm U.S. combat readiness. Time 
spent on peacekeeping missions is time not spent learning or  rehearsing
critical warfighting skills. A recent General Accounting  Office report noted
the deleterious effects of peacekeeping on  readiness,<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm">2</A> documenting how it can take 12 to 18
months for a unit to return  to the minimum proficiency standards required by
U.S. doctrine.  This means, for instance, that the U.S. Army in Europe, which
has  deployed most of its units to Bosnia for peace implementation  duty, will
be out of the warfighting business for two to three years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. cannot command and control most military operations. 
It does not have the legitimacy, authority, structure, or procedures  to
organize and direct military missions competently. U.N.  command and control is
characterized by confusion and unresponsiveness.  A prime example is the
incoherent command and control  structure used in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. withdrew from the Paris-based United Nations 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in  1984 because of
its hostility to free markets and record of waste  and abuse.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In January 1996, the U.S. Army court-martialed Specialist 
Michael 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  New. Specialist New had refused to
wear a U.N. beret and  insignia when his unit was deployed on U.N. duty in
Macedonia,  maintaining that he swore an oath of allegiance to the U.S.
Constitution  and not to the U.N. However, under U.S. law, up to 1,000 U.S. 
soldiers can be deployed at any one time in U.N. missions. Specialist  New swore
an oath to follow all legal orders and was treated fairly,  but his case raises
the broader issue of U.S. participation in U.N.  military missions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Secretary General Boutros-Ghali in January 1996 mentioned  the
possibility that the U.N. might impose a tax on such activities  as
international air travel and currency exchanges to gain &quot;a  minimum of
independence&quot; from member nations. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration began with a great deal of  enthusiasm for the
United Nations. President Clinton and his team  believed that with the end of
the Cold War, the U.N. could be  reinvigorated and begin to live up to the lofty
language of its Charter,  which assumes a central role for the organization in
preserving peace  and international security. The Clinton plan was for America
to  provide considerable support for U.N. peacekeeping and other  activities,
including foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration initially embraced an  interventionist U.N. Under
the doctrine of &quot;assertive multilateralism,&quot; the  U.S. would advance
its security goals by working &quot;assertively&quot; with  the U.N. rather than
unilaterally or with allies. Central to this  approach was heavy American
support of U.N. peacekeeping. U.N.  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali went
so far as to advocate  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  standing U.N. army under his
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton was forced to retreat from this doctrine after  the
failure of the U.N. operation in Somalia, where the U.N.  undertook an ambitious
nation-building mandate for which it was  unprepared. In support of this
mission, President Clinton deployed U.S.  Army Rangers who were assigned to
capture a Somali warlord for  the U.N. In October 1993, American soldiers were
drawn into a  street battle in Mogadishu during which 18 Americans were killed 
and 75 wounded. In May 1994, Clinton backtracked and issued  Presidential
Decision Directive 25 (PDD 25), placing restrictions  on U.S. participation in
U.N. peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The highlight of the Clinton Administration's U.N. reform  effort has been
to establish an Inspector General's office in New  York. For years, Congress has
been pushing this idea. Unfortunately,  this office has only limited scope and
has been characterized as a  &quot;disappointment&quot; by Representative Lee
Hamilton (D-IN) and  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), two Members of Congress who
 have long championed the U.N. Driven by budget constraints,  the Clinton
Administration in December 1995 announced the  long-overdue U.S. withdrawal from
the United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress tried to restrict some of the more  egregious Clinton
policies toward the U.N. The House and Senate  passed separate bills in 1995
that would cut U.S. financial contributions  to U.N. peacekeeping and limit U.S.
forces deployed in U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Both bills embody provisions
of the  Contract With America. During negotiations with the Clinton 
Administration, language in the defense authorization bill that placed  limits 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  on U.S. participation in U.N.
peacekeeping was dropped.  President Clinton claimed that these limits were a
challenge to his  authority as commander in chief and threatened to veto the
bill if it  contained any such language. Congress backed down and passed  a
defense bill without these restrictions in January 1996. The  President
subsequently signed the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On another front, Representative Joe Scarborough (R-FL) in  October 1995
introduced the United Nations Withdrawal Act. This  legislation would require
the U.S. to withdraw from the U.N. by  the year 2000, retaining its membership
only in the U.N.'s  independent and specialized agencies. Representative
Scarborough's  bill was referred to the International Relations Committee, where
 it remains under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration boasts frequently of its participation  in
U.N.-sponsored international conferences. Vice President Al  Gore went to the
Cairo Conference on Population and Development  in 1994 and accompanied Hillary
Clinton to the Copenhagen  Social Summit in 1995, and Mrs. Clinton and Health
and Human  Services Secretary Donna Shalala attended the 1995 Fourth Women's 
Conference in Beijing. These conferences have come under  heavy criticism, both
for their anti-Western agendas and for their  wastefulness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In early 1996, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali floated the idea  of imposing
a U.N. tax on member nations. Republican  Senators Robert Dole (KS) and Jesse
Helms (NC) responded in January  by introducing legislation to bar U.S. payments
to the U.N. if it  tries to implement such a tax. The Clinton Administration
opposes  a U.N. tax.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To promote U.S. interests in the U.N. without sacrificing 
American sovereignty or effectiveness, and to ensure that America  does not get
dragged into unworkable peacekeeping operations, the  U.S. should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Limit its total non-peacekeeping contribution to no more  than
$500 million per year.</B> In 1995, America's assessed and  voluntary
contributions to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and  commissions totaled
some $1 billion. Approximately $260 million of  this amount went to the U.N.
administrative budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Stop paying assessed contributions to U.N. specialized  agencies.</B>
The few specialized agencies worthy of support, such as the  Universal Postal
Union and the World Meteorological  Organization, should be funded on a
case-by-case and voluntary basis from  the $500 million given to the U.N. This
dramatically reduced level  of spending will allow the U.S. to establish a
fundamentally  different relationship with a considerably scaled-back U.N.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never place U.S. troops under U.N. command.</B> The U.S.  may
choose to support some traditional peacekeeping operations,  such as the one in
Cyprus. However, U.S. forces should not be  placed under U.N. command. The U.S.
can provide support for U.N.  missions without operating in the U.N. chain of
command. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never give the Security Council veto power over American  foreign
policy.</B> It may be diplomatically useful to gain U.N.  Security Council
support for U.S. military actions, as President Bush did  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  the Persian Gulf War when his
Administration won a  Security Council resolution supporting the expulsion of
Iraq from  Kuwait. However, this support should never be considered essential. 
The U.S. should never allow Security Council politics to keep it  from defending
vital American interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Eliminate funding for the United Nations Development  Program
(UNDP).</B> One of the bewildering array of specialized agencies  in the U.N.
system, UNDP is charged with &quot;contribut[ing] to a  sustainable expansion of
the world economy.&quot;  Essentially, it is a  foreign aid agency. Not only are
its programs unfocused and  duplicative, but foreign aid has proven
counterproductive in country  after country. Eliminating funding for this
specialized agency will  save the U.S. approximately $120 million a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     End funding for all U.N. international conferences.</B> These 
conferences, which cost millions of dollars, are long on rhetoric  and short on
achievement. The 1995 Social Summit, for example,  focused on &quot;Creating
Jobs&quot; and &quot;Building Solidarity,&quot; two  objectives well beyond the
capabilities of a one-time gathering of  national and international bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Reject any proposal to vest the U.N. with taxing authority.</B> 
Senators Dole and Helms have introduced legislation that would  have the U.S.
stop paying its dues if the U.N. tries to impose a tax.  The Clinton
Administration also has voiced its opposition to the idea  of such a tax. The
U.S. should continue to send a strong message  that this trial balloon, floated
by Secretary General Boutros-Ghali  in January 1996 and bound to resurface
within the U.N., is  unacceptable.

bureaucracy in New York is not support for isolationism.  Conservatives support
NATO and other alliances, as well as limited  participation in the U.N. This is
not isolationist; it is international  engagement in support of American, not
U.N., interests.
</P>

</P>
<P><B>A.</B> When deciding American foreign policy, the President  should
consult with his advisors and the Congress, not the U.N. We  don't need the
permission of the U.N. to protect American freedom  and interests. The U.N. is
plagued with corruption, and many of  its activities, including its foreign aid
programs, perpetuate  dependency throughout the developing world. Moreover, the
U.N.  is merely a collection of often opposing national interests. It is 
ridiculous to suggest that the 180-plus governments in the U.N.   many of which
are dictatorships  represent the democratic will  of the world community.

<P>

can the U.S. promote international peace and security if it  is not involved in
U.N. peacekeeping? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Despite its lofty objectives, the U.N. contributes only  margin
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  ally to international peace and
security. Since its creation in  1945, it has been a bit player on the world
stage. The U.S. remains  the world's principal force for international peace and
security  by maintaining forces in Europe and the Pacific region and by 
participating in alliance structures like NATO. It is highly misleading  to
measure a nation's contribution to the world's security by  gauging its
participation in marginal undertakings like U.N.  peacekeeping. America and its
Western allies ended the Cold War by being  militarily strong, not by
participating in &quot;peace&quot; missions  sponsored by the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. An American soldier, Specialist Michael New, was  court-martialed in
January 1996 for refusing to wear U.N. insignia  and serve under U.N. command.
He maintains this violates his oath  to support and defend the Constitution of
the United States. Do  you support him?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As a soldier, Specialist New is obligated by his oath to obey 
the lawful orders of his chain of command. However unwise as a  matter of
policy, New's orders were not illegal. Therefore, he  should face the
consequences of his disobedience. However,  Specialist New should not have been
placed in a position where he  was forced to choose between his duty and his
conscience.  American soldiers should not be placed in the U.N. chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has floated the idea of  establishing
a U.N. tax on international commercial airline flights,  currency exchanges, and
other international transactions. What do  you think about this?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is ridiculous. The power to tax is a sovereign power of  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  ernment, which is accountable to
the people in a free society.  The U.N. is accountable to no one but member
governments and  bureaucrats. The U.N. has no sovereignty over its member
states;  nor should it ever have such power. The U.N. is the creation and  the
servant of its member states. In any case, its problems stem  not from a lack of
money, but from having too much money. It is  very disturbing that Secretary
General Boutros-Ghali and others  within the U.N. are trying to make this power
grab.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. In the first session of the 104th Congress, legislation was

take the U.S. out of the U.N.?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Security Council can serve some useful purposes. At  times,
for example, it can be a forum for discussion of important  international
issues. However, the U.S. should never feel constrained  by Security Council
resolutions, and U.S. participation in the U.  N. should be scaled back. A major
cut in U.S. funding would go  a long way toward achieving this goal.

</P>
<P>Effective intelligence is as necessary today as during the  Cold War.
Despite the end of the Cold War, the world remains a  very dangerous and
increasingly unpredictable place. Threats  to America's interests are real and
growing. They can arise in  regions vital to the U.S. with little or no warning.
America needs a  robust 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  intelligence gathering capacity
both to enable its leaders to  understand these threats and to give them as much
warning of  approaching danger as possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the U.S. intelligence community today faces  serious problems and
challenges. The morale of the Central  Intelligence Agency has been severely
damaged by the Aldrich Ames spy  case. Moreover, the CIA has failed to predict
crucially important  developments, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The intelligence  community, like the
Defense Department, has been forced to  finance much of the so-called peace
dividend through drastic reductions  in budgets and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many issues must be resolved if the U.S. is to maintain robust  and highly

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The U.S. intelligence community consists of the
Central  Intelligence Agency; the Defense Intelligence Agency; the  intelligence
units of the armed services; the National Security Agency,  which monitors and
analyzes worldwide radio-telephone and other  electronic transmissions; and the
National Reconnaissance  Office, which gathers and processes satellite imagery.
The CIA is  forbidden by law to conduct intelligence activities inside the U.S.;
 domestic intelligence and internal security are the responsibility  of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Overall coordination and  direction of foreign
intelligence is provided by the Director of  Central Intelligence (DCI),
although military intelligence operates  with a high degree of autonomy within
this structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The DCI is appointed by the President and confirmed by the 
Senate, which means the CIA is subject to a certain degree of  political
pressure from the White House. Ideally, however, the DCI is  objective and &quot;non-political,&quot;
since intelligence findings tailored  to fit political objectives can be
useless, if not actually dangerous  and misleading.

<P>

<P><B>*</B>     Most U.S. intelligence on foreign activities is derived from

compliance with arms control treaties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Although America's intelligence collection from satellites 
and signals intercepts is highly effective, the U.S. intelligence  community
relies heavily on high technology and neglects  intelligence from human sources
(HUMINT). There is no substitute for  the information provided by trained or
knowledgeable human  observers. People can enter underground or covered
facilities which  satellite sensors cannot observe. Only people can penetrate 
terrorist cells or drug networks, and only human agents can provide  some
assessment of an adversary's intentions.

<P>The Clinton Administration has failed to resolve these  fundamental issues,
or even to undertake any serious reappraisal  of America's intelligence needs.
Nor has Clinton been able to  improve CIA morale in the wake of the Aldrich Ames
disaster.  Instead, the Administration has presided over a reduction of 
intelligence agency budgets and personnel without any clear rationale  or
understanding of the changing role of intelligence in the  post-Cold 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  War world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The intelligence community is being downsized at a rate of  3-5 percent per
year, with some vital components losing as much as  80 percent of their
personnel. Moreover, the Administration has  failed to recognize that the
national intelligence mission has not  diminished substantially with the end of
the Cold War; it has  become broader and more complex. While reducing its
resources, the  Administration continues to impose on the intelligence community
 a growing range of tasks, such as supporting arms control and  other
international agreements being pursued by the White House  and monitoring
developments in trouble spots like Somalia,  Rwanda, Haiti, and the Balkans
where the Administration has  committed U.S. forces to peacekeeping and
humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By demanding more of the intelligence community while  cutting its
resources, the Clinton Administration is in danger of  stretching America's
intelligence capabilities to the breaking point.  The President is jeopardizing
the intelligence community's ability  to provide strategic warning in the event
of conflict and to  furnish vital analysis to the national command authority in
time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another problem is that the Administration has politicized the  CIA by &quot;cooking&quot;
intelligence findings to support preconceived  positions. Perhaps the most
glaring example has been  the Administration's attempt to downplay the ballistic
missile threat  to the continental United States in order to justify its
opposition  to national missile defense<B>.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Shore up the human side of espionage. </B> Because
America's  high technology is superior, the intelligence community has 
developed a strong technocratic bias. It often neglects the human side of 
intelligence gathering. Technical intelligence is valuable, but it has  its
limits. Only people can get inside an underground weapons  storage facility or,
more important, get inside the thinking of a  potential aggressor or penetrate a
terrorist cell. Improving human  intelligence will require institutional change
that assures career  advancement for officers who are aggressive in recruiting
and  &quot;running&quot; informants and operatives and that allows agency
officers to  use commonsense criteria in recruiting foreign operatives and 
informants. Common sense suggests that foreign informants  sometimes will be
unsavory characters. As long as these informants do  not harm Americans, the
U.S. should not assume responsibility for  all their actions merely because they
are informants or working  on contract.

imagination and creativity in concluding what the data  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  saying, in discerning the
patterns and trends suggested by the  data. The CIA needs to reward agents in
the field for innovative  collection methods. It also needs to reward analysts
for foresight,  insight, and good judgment in drawing proper conclusions from
the  information collected. The DCI must not merely manage the  Agency but lead
it. That means ending the mindset of risk-averse,  bureaucratic caution that
dominates the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strengthen the CIA's counter-intelligence  capabilities</B>. There must
be no more Ames-like penetrations of the CIA. This will  require an internal or
institutional change in thinking which  accepts the possibility that U.S.
intelligence agencies are targets for  foreign penetration and that,
regrettably, some Americans like  Ames can be recruited to betray their country.
Better congressional  oversight which demands accountability by CIA managers,
and  support by the DCI and the Agency for a vigorous  counter-intelligence
effort inside the Agency, are also necessary for improving 
counter-intelligence.

<P><B>A.</B> America and its allies still face a variety of threats and  new
challenges to vital interests even though the Cold War is over.  The radical
downsizing of U.S. military forces makes it more  crucial than ever that America

the commander in chief and  to provide policy options for dealing with the
complex new  challenges of the post-Cold War world.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. government needs to stay out of corporate  espionage.
Some argue that the U.S., while no longer engaged in a  military confrontation
with the Soviet Union, should see itself as  engaged in an economic war with
rest of the world. Such claims are  alarmist at least, and deceptive at best. If
American corporations want  to engage in the normal and legal gathering of
business  information, that is their choice. But diverting U.S. government 
intelligence agencies to spy for U.S. business risks discrediting  the
government's legitimate function. Recent allegations that the  CIA spied for the
United State Trade Representative's office  during automotive negotiations with
Japan are a case in point. Instead  of spying for American corporations, which
are private entities  not deserving of official support, intelligence agencies
should  be monitoring the sales of Russian nuclear weapons and the  movements of
Iranian submarines operating in the Persian Gulf.

America and other Third World countries, even  including some allegedly guilty

</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->

<P><B>A.</B> Informants are not the same as field officers, or what  are
loosely termed &quot;agents.&quot;  No one would hold a New York  policeman
responsible for the actions of a drug dealer turned  informant, especially if
the offending actions have nothing to do with the  undercover operation. The
same is true regarding CIA  informants. However, under no circumstances should
the CIA protect an  informant or contract employee who harms a fellow American. 
When such cases come to light, the Agency should terminate the  relationship at
once and report the criminal to the proper authorities,  even if it means losing
a valuable source of information.

</P>
<P>America's foreign aid program is coming under increasing  scrutiny, not only
by the American public, but also in Congress.  Although the $12 billion a year
spent on foreign aid represents a  relatively small part of the federal budget,
more and more  skeptics argue that this program is a waste of taxpayers' money.
There  is little evidence to support the contentions of proponents that  foreign
aid is vital to America's national interest. There is even  less evidence that
this money actually helps alleviate poverty in  less-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Why, then, has foreign aid proved to be one of the hardest  programs to cut
or eliminate?  The main reason is the way the  program is structured. The
foreign aid program has three major  elements. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First</B> is military and security assistance to promote
America's  national security abroad. Consisting of such undertakings as 
anti-narcotics efforts, joint military training exercises between U.S.  and
foreign forces, and grants to foreign countries to purchase  U.S. military
equipment, this program accounts for about 25 percent  of the overall foreign
aid budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second</B> is humanitarian and disaster relief assistance to aid 
victims of natural disaster and prevent mass starvation. This program  accounts
for some 15 percent of the foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third</B> is economic and development assistance to promote  economic
growth in less developed countries. This program  consumes about 60 percent of
the foreign aid budget. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The debate over foreign aid often has centered on funding  levels for these
three major components. During the Cold War, the  U.S. funneled significant
amounts of military and security aid, as  well as economic and development
assistance, to its allies in the  fight against communism. Now that the Soviet
Union has  collapsed, however, critics of the program wonder why America needs 
to spend $12 billion a year around the globe. The Clinton  Administration argues
that the program is still needed to support  America's interests abroad.
Skeptics, many of whom questioned the merits  of the economic aid program even
during the Cold War, argue that  it makes even less sense today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many proposals have surfaced, from abolishing the Agency  for International
Development (AID), the agency in charge of  distributing America's foreign aid
dollars, to moving remaining  funding 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  and programs into existing
departments like State and  Defense. Another &quot;reform&quot; proposal would
increase the budget to face  the new challenges of the post-Cold War era and
re-focus the  program on what is called &quot;sustainable economic development&quot;
of  poorer countries. This is the argument made by the Clinton  Administration.

<P>There is bipartisan consensus that foreign aid needs to be  reformed. The
Clinton Administration's own study on  reinventing government argues that AID
does not have a single, clearly  defined and articulated strategic mission.
Shortly after this study  was issued, Secretary of State Warren Christopher
announced his  proposal for an enhanced Department of International Relations 
in which AID and other agencies would be abolished and their  functions assumed
by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The State Department authorization bill would have moved  USIA, the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), and  AID into the State Department. The
bill was derailed by  opposition from the Clinton Administration and Senate
Democrats, led  by Senator John Kerry (D-MA). The House of Representatives 
approved these consolidations in June 1995, and Senator Kerry  and Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms  (R-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  NC) agreed to a plan to cut the
operating expenses of these  agencies. Consolidation proponents believe that
these cuts will  force the Clinton Administration to move these three agencies
into  the State Department. A House-Senate conference report awaits  approval by
the Senate and the President, who has threatened to  veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 1996 appropriations bill for foreign aid has been passed  by both houses
of Congress and signed by the President. This  measure cuts foreign aid spending
from $14.3 billion in FY 1995 to  $12.1 billion in FY 1996. The 1996
appropriations bill also includes  language requiring AID to submit to Congress
a detailed report  outlining the relative levels of economic freedom of foreign
aid  recipients. This report will make it more difficult for AID to  continue to
give money to countries with economically unfree or  repressed economies.

<P><B>*     Abolish the Agency for International Development, along  with most

AID is the main reason America continues  to waste so much money on foreign aid.
If Congress cannot pass  authorizing legislation that eliminates AID, it should
refuse to  appropriate any money for the agency's operating expenses until  such
legislation is signed into law. Moreover, international  development assistance
does not work. Countries receiving economic aid  for over 35 years are no better
off today than they were before.  Thus, not only should AID be abolished, but so
should the entire  development assistance program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Require the President to certify to Congress that any security 
and military aid sent abroad is necessary to support U.S. national  security
interests.</B> The foreign aid account is more than just  development
assistance; it also includes funds for military and  security assistance. It is
widely claimed that this money directly  supports the national interest abroad
by enhancing U.S. influence in  international affairs. However, many of
America's foreign aid  recipients routinely vote against the U.S. in the United
Nations; the  voting records of the U.N. show that three out of every four
recipients  of U.S. foreign aid vote against America more than half the time. 
<B> </B>If Congress is asked to appropriate foreign aid for the purpose  of
promoting the national interest, it should get more than a  promise from the
White House that it will get the job done.  Congress should require the
President to certify that U.S. foreign aid  supports American interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Phase out funding for the World Bank, the International  Monetary 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  Fund, and the other multilateral
development banks.</B> These  multilateral development banks (MDBs) have been no
more  successful at promoting economic growth in less developed countries  than
has AID. In fact, a strong case can be made that they have had  less success
than AID. Since the 1950s, the World Bank and the  IMF have disbursed over $350
billion to less developed countries.  Most of these countries are no better off
today than they were  before receiving their money. In fact, many are worse off.
The  U.S. should phase out financial support to these institutions.

<P><A NAME="Q&AF"><B>Q &amp; A</B>
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you call for cutting aid to the poor at a time  when more
people are living in poverty around the globe than ever  before?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because most economic aid perpetuates poverty. The only  way poor
countries can break out of the poverty trap is to stop  depending on foreign
aid. In this day and age, poverty is not the  natural condition of mankind; it
is a condition imposed by corrupt  governments which repress their economies.
Foreign aid does not  help countries develop. Most long-term recipients are no
better off  today then they were 30 years ago. If poor countries do not  adopt
economically free policies, they will remain poor, no matter  how much money we
throw at them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. You say foreign aid does not work. How come the  Marshall Plan, the
largest foreign aid program, is considered successful?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Marshall Plan was not development aid. It was a plan  to
rebuild already developed countries. But underdeveloped  countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  are not rebuilding an established
infrastructure; they are trying  to acquire one. They also do not have the
established  free-market economic foundations that post-war Europe had. Thus, 
while money spent in post-war Europe helped rebuild roads and  bridges, foreign
aid in the less developed world has done little good  because no amount of
foreign aid could provide the degree of  modernization and industrialization
which existed in Europe  before World War II.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Agency for International Development has been  extremely
successful in improving child mortality rates, providing  vaccinations, and
helping to feed those in immediate need of food.  How can you support cutting
funding for programs which help to  keep people alive?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because Americans, as private citizens, are doing a better  job
than government in helping people. Americans spend some  $12 billion a year on
private overseas charities. AID spends less  than $100 million on disaster
relief and related programs. If  America has helped children and the poor in
less developed countries, it  is mainly because of the work of these private
charities.  Private charities are far more effective than AID, which is a 
bureaucracy that spends some 70 cents of every foreign aid dollar  within
America's borders. It is far better to give to private charities  than to waste
taxpayer dollars on American professors who, on  AID contracts, do nothing more
than write studies of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't foreign aid necessary at least for countries trying to  develop
free markets?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No, but it can be useful if properly conceived, managed,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  targeted. Private foreign
investors spend some $18 billion a  year investing abroad. Those private
investments are much larger  than the $12 billion government dispenses each year
in foreign aid.  Foreign investment, not foreign aid, is necessary for  economic
growth. To attract foreign investment, governments must cut  taxes, privatize
business, eliminate regulations, and institute other  similar reforms. In most
cases, foreign governments do not need aid  to implement these reforms (the
obvious exceptions being  former Eastern Bloc nations, which can use it
constructively for  education and training to encourage the creation of market
institutions). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> <B>Q.Won't cutting foreign aid result in more Somalias and Haitis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Both Haiti and Somalia are long-term recipients of  foreign
aid. Somalia has been hooked on U.S. foreign aid for 40  years, receiving over
$750 million since 1955. Yet Somalia is  poorer today than it was in 1965. Haiti
has received almost $1 billion  in foreign aid over 51 years, and it also is
poorer today than it was  in 1965. If economic aid is so necessary to create
economic  development in poor countries, why has it not worked in these two 
countries?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't the U.S. foreign aid program at least help  American
businesses?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, it helps some businesses, contractors, and consultants.  But
this should not be the purpose of foreign aid. Choosing  winners and losers in
the market is not the proper business of  government. Rewarding special
interests with federal dollars will not help  poor countries abroad.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. You may call it corporate welfare, but shouldn't Washington  be doing
all it can to help American businesses export?  After  all, exports mean jobs
for Americans. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. is the largest exporter in the world and would  remain
so without government subsidies, which help only a few  of America's businesses.
Many now-subsidized trade deals would  be made without this government
financing. Yes, some  businesses seem to &quot;win&quot; from government
subsidies, but the losers are  the American taxpayers who pay for these
programs. This  money should be left in the hands of the people who earned it
rather  than given to those who happen to have powerful friends in  Washington.

diplomacy enables the U.S.  government to present its perspective to people in
other countries  and to provide accurate information about the U.S. to those who
 otherwise would never receive it, preferably in a manner other  cultures will
find credible. These efforts take place outside of the  standard channels of
diplomacy  specifically, outside the State  Department, which conducts formal
diplomatic relations with other  nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In this age of information, mass communication is rapid,  virtually 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  global, and accessible with
unprecedented ease to a larger  number of people than ever before. Information
can affect mass  sentiment and public opinion in foreign nations, and therefore
the policy  decisions of foreign governments. In certain situations, ideas  and
imagery can have greater impact than bombs and bullets.  Thus, public diplomacy,
particularly the direct dissemination of  policy decisions and the rationale for
making them, remains an  important tool of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A prime example of the impact of public diplomacy is the fall  of the Soviet
Union. The Soviets could not compete in the  modern world without opening up
their captive empire to new forms  of information and communication technology.
Once that  happened, they no longer could isolate their people from Western
ideals  of democracy, free markets, and individual liberty. It was the 
communication and popularization of these ideals which eroded  the legitimacy of
Communism and, as much as Western  military strength, eventually brought the
Soviet structure crashing down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some liberals criticize public diplomacy as a form of  propaganda. They see
it as a camouflage for activities that are improper for  the U.S. government.
This position flows from the Left's  reflexive &quot;blame America&quot;
attitude. Those who hold this view  evidently believe that America's
institutions are deeply flawed, and  that America's founding principles are
irrelevant to nations  struggling to find their way in the chaotic post-Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some conservatives are critical of public diplomacy as well.  They believe
that America should concentrate on solving internal  domestic problems like
out-of-control deficits and excessive  federal spending. These skeptics believe
that reaching foreign publics  with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  American ideals should be
subordinated to other, more  pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While most Members of Congress support official U.S.  broadcasting, there is
no consensus in Congress or in the Administration  on how much the U.S. should
spend on public diplomacy. Nor is  there unanimity on how the official
components of public  diplomacy, such as the United States Information Agency,
should be  organized.

in areas once under Soviet domination; and 3)  Radio Mart&iacute;, which covers
communist Cuba. VOA broadcasts  world news as well as statements of official

</P>
<P>Public diplomacy agencies and media have undergone  significant
reorganization since the Cold War ended. The Board for  International
Broadcasting was abolished at the end of 1995 by  presidential decision, and
funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio  Liberty, formerly handled by the Board,
will be disseminated  directly through the United States Information Agency
(USIA), an  independent executive branch agency. This emphasizes USIA's role  as
America's primary arm of public diplomacy. However, even  while public diplomacy
is being consolidated under USIA, its budget  has been severely curtailed. The
USIA budget in FY 1993 was  $965 million. The budget for FY 1995 was $520
million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Neither Congress nor the Administration has provided  adequate support for
U.S. international broadcasting. For example,  the Voice of America (VOA), the
U.S. government's primary  broadcasting medium, has been severely slashed by
congressional  &quot;deficit hawks,&quot; resulting in the loss of 400 uniquely
skilled  professionals and the ability to broadcast in 20 foreign languages.
These  cuts in FY 1996 come on top of others mandated in the FY 1994 
International Broadcasting Act, which cut 900 staff employees at  Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty and 350 at the VOA.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Adjust methods of information
dissemination to the post-Cold  War era.</B> The USIA's audience is considerably
different in the  post-Cold War era; foreign audiences increasingly listen to 
AM/FM radio and watch television, while the number of short-wave  radio
listeners is falling sharply. Therefore, there must be a stronger  investment in
AM/FM radio and television broadcasting, but  short-wave investments may be
reduced to more appropriate levels.  At the same time, the U.S. government must
maintain a &quot;surge  capacity&quot; to reach foreign audiences directly. It
cannot rely on  commercial media outlets to articulate U.S. policy around the
world.  Information dissemination through the Internet also must be  encouraged.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Emphasize reaching the populations of emerging

democracies' commitment to freedom and both economic and political  reform. The
benefits would be greater security for the U.S., increased  trade opportunities,
and stronger international economies. Public  diplomacy can facilitate this by
providing ideas, information, and  practical experience in the form of
broadcasting, professional  exchanges, and training programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Provide adequate funds for international

nations, many of them unfriendly to America,  are speaking aggressively in this
marketplace. The revolutionary  regime in Iran is a notable example. America

the  kind of world we want.

<P><B>Q. America's values can reach the world through CNN,  other broadcast

America?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Much of the American popular entertainment that reaches  the
world  rock music and Hollywood films, for example     conveys a jaundiced view
of America, giving some countries one more  excuse to condemn the United States.
And CNN, while virtually  a global network, does not reach an audience nearly as
wide,  diverse, or strategically targeted as the audience for U.S.  government
broadcasting. Nor can CNN speak on behalf of the U.S.  government. We cannot
rely on Ted Turner to give our official  spokesmen the opportunity to tell
America's story, directly and  unfiltered, in a future world crisis. The United
States, as the  world's only remaining superpower, must retain this &quot;surge
capacity.&quot;   Pop culture and Hollywood shouldn't be the only broadcasters 
of American values abroad. America still needs an official voice  to explain its
policies.

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Some have argued that this would reduce bureaucratic  duplication
and save money, but any savings are offset by the fact  that USIA's basic role 
reaching foreign publics directly  often  conflicts with the State Department's
role in negotiating with  foreign government officials.

<title>AID Should Release Economic Freedom Report Now - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>AID SHOULD RELEASE ECONOMIC FREEDOM REPORT NOW</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 464<br>
October 16, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Concerned over the wastefulness of America's foreign aid program, Congress last year mandated that the Agency for International Development (AID) submit a report on the status of economic freedom in countries receiving U.S. aid. The report was due this summer. It is now October, however, and still no report. The Clinton Administration should fulfill its obligation under the law and submit AID's economic freedom report to Congress immediately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Economic Freedom Report.</b> The appropriations bill for foreign operations, passed in November 1995 and signed into law by President Clinton in February 1996, requires AID to "submit to the appropriate congressional committees an annual report providing a concise overview of the prospects for economic and social growth.... For each country, the report shall discuss the laws, policies and practices of that country that most contribute to or detract from the achievement of this kind of growth."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why this report has not been completed is a mystery. The reason certainly cannot be a lack of resources. With operating expenses of $465 million, 2,400 permanent employees, and some 6,000 long-term contractors and consultants, AID should have had no difficulty finding the resources to produce such a report and submit it to Congress on time.<sup>2</sup>  Nor can the reason be a lack of information on levels of economic freedom in the world. There now are three privately produced studies this subject: The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, Freedom House's <i>World Survey of Economic Freedom</i>, and the Fraser Institute's <i>Economic Freedom of the World</i>. While there are minor differences among these studies in the methodologies used to measure economic freedom, all three agree that economic freedom is essential to economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most likely reason for AID's failure to submit its report is the low priority the foreign aid bureaucracy gives to economic freedom. For example, of the $12 billion in foreign aid spending, AID earmarks only 13 percent for what it calls "achieving sustainable development."  Of this 13 percent, most of money is spent to protect the environment, educate the poor, control populations, and immunize infants. Some of these programs may be useful, but they hardly qualify as programs aimed at promoting economic growth in less developed countries. A well-educated person living in a clean environment and given good health care will not be able to enjoy those benefits if private property is outlawed, there is no rule of law, and people are not free to work. Economic freedom, not environmental or population controls, creates economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>AID's Neglect of Economic Freedom.</b> This failure to understand the central role of economic freedom in economic development is a principal reason for AID's failed approach to foreign aid. The Heritage Foundation's 1996 <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i> evaluates the level of economic freedom in 142 countries. Examining taxation, trade and investment, banking, regulation, monetary, and other policies, the <i>Index</i> demonstrates that of these 142 countries, those with the greatest economic freedom also are the richest. Conversely, those that are the most economically repressed are the poorest. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li> Of the 76 countries ranked as "mostly unfree" or "repressed," 35 have received U.S. foreign aid for at least 36 years, many for as long as 52 years;
<p>
<li> Of these 35 countries, 25 are no better off economically today than they were before receiving aid;
<p>
<li> Of these 25, 13 actually are poorer today than they were over three decades ago.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The evidence in the <i>Index</i> demonstrates what many economists have known for years: No matter how much foreign aid is pumped into less developed economies, they will not grow economically until they begin to free their economies from excessive government constraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was Congress's belief in this fact that prompted it last year to require that AID submit a report on economic freedom. Critics of AID will be watching to see how reliable and accurate it will be in evaluating the economic policies of U.S. aid recipients. They will be scrutinizing AID's assessment of barriers to U.S. exports, whether American companies are free to invest in other countries, and whether aid recipients still do not respect private property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With over 8,000 employees, consultants, and contractors, and $465 million in operating expenses, AID surely has enough resources to fulfill its legal obligations to Congress and the American people. By not submitting its report on economic freedom to Congress, AID is violating a specific congressional directive. Whether AID is finally giving economic freedom the attention it deserves cannot be known until it submits its report. However, one thing is already clear: The agency remains one of the most poorly run and ineffective in the U.S. government. AID should release its report on economic freedom immediately.

<title>OPIC-ing the Taxpayer's Pocket - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><font size="+2">OPIC</font>-ING THE TAXPAYER'S POCKET</h3>
By Brett D. Schaefer<br>
Research Assistant<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 458<br>
September 3, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When it returns from its August recess, the House of Representatives is expected to consider H.R. 3759, the Exports, Jobs, and Growth Act of 1996, which authorizes appropriations for the Trade and Development Agency (TDA) and export programs of the International Trade Administration (ITA) for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. But the heart of the Act extends the authority of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to engage in new commitments through 2001 and doubles the statutory limits on OPIC's insurance and financing activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

OPIC insures overseas investments by U.S. businesses against loss to expropriation, political instability, and unforeseen contingencies, such as currency inconvertibility. It also issues investment guarantees and direct loans to U.S. businesses for international investments. The agency was created by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to complement the federal government's trade policy and development activities. Specifically, OPIC is charged with increasing U.S. exports and assisting American private capital in the development of less developed countries (LDCs) and countries in transition from non-market to market economies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Strangely, no one seems to notice the irony of using a government-run program to encourage other countries to end government interference in their economies. Congress should not expand OPIC's funding and authority. OPIC is another form of corporate welfare and accomplishes nothing that cannot be performed better in the private sector, without risk to U.S. taxpayers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>OPIC could cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Proponents insist that OPIC makes a profit and actually decreases the deficit. But while OPIC did make $167 million in profits last year, largely from revenues of U.S. treasury bonds, this figure does not take into account the amount that U.S. taxpayers are obligated to pay as underwriters of OPIC-insured investments. In 1995 alone, OPIC issued policies covering $8.6 billion of investment. The accumulated value of insured investments is many times this amount. American taxpayers typically are liable for 90 percent of the insured investment in the event the policy must be paid.
<p>
Additionally, beginning in 1987, OPIC began dabbling in venture capital, one of the riskiest areas of the financial industry. Starting with the Africa Growth Fund, OPIC began creating numerous funds to encourage investment in less developed countries. These funds have several things in common: They are involved in the world's riskiest markets, are subject to little control or oversight by OPIC, and rarely turn a profit. These funds also have been growing precipitously, from $70 million at the beginning of the Clinton Administration to over $814 million last spring.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC "socializes" risk while privatizing profits. </b>Foreign investment is an important avenue for development in LDCs. U.S. foreign direct investment totaled $612 billion in 1994, with nearly one-third invested in the developing world, a total far exceeding the U.S. foreign aid budget. OPIC insured a very modest portion of this investment; the rest was insured by private businesses. Yet business and political advocates continue to argue that developing nations would not receive foreign direct investment without OPIC. The truth is that OPIC has become a corporate welfare program that subsidizes investment insurance and loans for private businesses. <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies realize large profits while the taxpayer buys the insurance to offset their investment risk in less developed countries.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC's development agenda has been ignored.</b> H.R. 3759 uses export promotion to justify increasing OPIC's insurance and lending authority, but discussion of OPIC's second mission -- its development agenda -- is curiously absent. This is because OPIC actually works against the best interests of LDCs. Representative Sonny Callahan (R-AL) claims that "as long as these countries, such as India, do not have a track record of adherence to free market principles, OPIC is needed."  In fact, however, OPIC is not needed. It encourages countries to maintain harmful economic policies, such as refusing to guarantee property rights, engaging in harmful regulatory policies, demanding oversight of investments, and insisting on government ownership of whole sectors of the economy. It simply is not wise to engage in business in such an environment. To attract foreign investment, countries need to enact free-market economic policies. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Chile, and the Czech Republic have done so with marvelous success. However, OPIC continues to encourage investment in less developed countries regardless of their economic climate.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC does not promote exports effectively.</b> Not one country receiving OPIC insurance policies or loans is among the top 10 destinations of U.S. exports, despite the fact that four of the top ten (Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) are developing nations. OPIC focuses on countries that cannot attract foreign investment on their own because of their poor economic policies and dangerous instability. Instead of letting these countries reap what they sow, OPIC rewards them with investments underwritten by American taxpayers.
<p>
Additionally, OPIC employs many restrictions on its lending and insuring practices that have nothing to do with the viability of the investment. For example, many countries that fit the normal criteria for OPIC political insurance and loans are ineligible because they do not meet U.S. standards in such areas as human rights, environmental concerns, and workers' rights. Countries that are excluded from OPIC lending for these reasons include South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Mexico. In other words, political correctness is more important than maximizing the return on taxpayers' money.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC competes with the private sector.</b> One of the justifications for OPIC is that there supposedly are no alternatives in the private sector. But numerous private-sector businesses specialize in political risk insurance, including American International Group (AIG), EXEL Ltd., and Mid Ocean Ltd. OPIC competes directly with these private-sector institutions and offers advantages beyond the resources of privately held companies. OPIC political risk insurance is backed by the U.S. government, whose resources far exceed those of a private insurer. OPIC offers subsidized insurance premiums at rates far below market rates. OPIC policies extend for 20 years, while the private sector in most instances cannot issue policies for longer than three or seven years for reasons of risk. OPIC continues to compete unfairly with the private sector, despite the fact that its authorizing language instructs it specifically to promote the development of private-sector political risk insurers.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the very least, OPIC should be required to limit its activities to those which complement rather than undermine the activities of private-sector political risk insurers. OPIC, for example, could supplement private political risk insurance by issuing policies for the time window beyond that typically offered by the private sector. Ideally, however, OPIC should be eliminated and its commitments privatized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents claim that OPIC cannot easily be privatized. To bolster this claim, they cite an independent study which estimated that privatization would cost American taxpayers between $500 million and $700 million. This is a large sum, but it pales in comparison to the potential cost to U.S. taxpayers if major economic or political upheavals occur in areas of the world with OPIC-insured projects. The potential liability to the U.S. is in the billions -- in effect, a global version of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, for which the American taxpayer is still paying.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. government should not intrude in areas where the private sector is willing and able to do the job, can do it more efficiently, and can do it without forcing American taxpayers to underwrite risky ventures. Encouraging foreign investment is an admirable goal, but it should not come in the form of government subsidies to private U.S. firms -- subsidies that discourage economic reform in the target countries and put the American taxpayer at risk.

<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress has taken dramatic first steps to reform  itself. But
although the new majority  particularly the newly  elected freshmen  has made
great strides in achieving the  meaningful reform that the voters demanded
through the 1994  congressional election, much remains to be done. Congress now
must  complete the task of reforming its own operations and extend the process 
of reform to the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among its reform accomplishments, the 104th Congress:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Amended</B> its rules to make them fairer and open;

</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

addressed in the 105th Congress:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Term limits;

<P>

<P>Congress and the President must work together to reform the  executive

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress and the President must work together to complete  these reforms
both to demonstrate their commitment to the  American people and to make
government more accountable to the  voters and less focused on protecting
special interests and the careers  of politicians.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress made great strides in the effort to clean  up Washington,
enacting substantial reforms in its own processes  that changed the &quot;business-as-usual&quot;
mentality which frustrated  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  sponsible government before the
1994 elections. But full  reform obviously takes time. The fact is that the new
Congress inherited  a federal government beset with fundamental problems in all 
three branches  executive, legislative, and judicial.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To complete the reforms begun in 1995, therefore, Congress  and the
President must confront a series of problems, some old and some new.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      The Supreme Court ruled state-imposed term limits 
unconstitutional.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In a 5-4 decision on May 22, 1995,<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#2">2</A>
the U.S. Supreme Court  held that states may not impose term limits on their own
Members  of Congress. At the same time, the Court indicated that Congress 
itself may not  by statute  impose term limits. The impact of  this decision was
to invalidate 23 existing term limits laws and  give greater force to the idea
of a constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to ensure that members of the House and Senate  stay in touch
with their constituents and truly represent their views is  to prevent
politicians from spending their entire careers in  Washington. If they knew that
Congress could not be a career,  legislators would be less interested in the
trappings of office and less  inclined to feather their own nests, mislead the
voters, legislate  irresponsibly, and abuse their offices as part of their
reelection efforts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are at least four key arguments for a constitutional  amendment to
limit congressional terms:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. Term limits are popular.</B> Support for limiting 
congressional 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  terms reaches as high as 80
percent in some polls. The Gallup  poll shows that a 49 percent plurality of
Americans favored term  limits for Congress in 1964, with support swelling to 64
percent in  1990 and 73 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Term limits receive substantial support at the polls.</B> In 
addition to the fact that term limits were one of the most popular  components
of the Contract With America, voters have supported  them overwhelmingly when
faced with ballot initiatives. In the 22  states with term limits by referendum,
the average level of support in  the voting booth on election day was 66
percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Term limits are a fundamentally democratic concept.</B> Since  as far
back as Aristotle, the concept of limiting the tenure of  politicians has been a
topic of public debate. One of America's  own Founding Fathers, James Madison,
argued 200 years ago that  term limits would reduce the influence of special
interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Term limits ensure healthy change.</B> Increasing the turnover  in
Congress gives more citizens the opportunity to serve their  government and
their fellow Americans. The introduction of fresh  insights into the political
process increases the chances that  dramatic improvements in the role of
government can be effected.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>23 STATES HAVE IMPOSED TERM LIMITS ON THEIR STATE LEGISLATORS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Arizona, Louisiana,  Nebraska, South Dakota,
Arkansas, Maine, Nevada, Utah, California,  Massachusetts, North Dakota,
Washington, Colorado, Michigan,  Ohio, Wyoming, Florida, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Audits have uncovered significant past abuses.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>On January 4, 1995, the House of Representatives voted 430-1 
for an internal audit by an outside accounting firm, Price  Waterhouse. It was a
matter of bipartisan conventional wisdom that the  management of the House had
been permeated with &quot;abuses and  management inefficiencies,&quot; in the
words of former House  Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-MO) in 1992.
Although a  few House accounts had been audited by the General Accounting 
Office, it is likely that many had never been reviewed by an  independent
examiner. Since one such audit uncovered the House  Bank scandal, a full
accounting was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The accounting practices of the 103rd Congress revealed by  the Price
Waterhouse audit demonstrate that the House's financial  and operational
controls were worse than even the harshest critics  had imagined. The 14
material weaknesses uncovered would be  troubling in a medium-sized business;
their presence in the  13,000-employee House of Representatives is a national
disgrace.  Most disturbing are the conclusions that the House was:
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Wasting</B> millions of dollars on inefficient
purchasing practices  and superfluous staff; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Failing</B> to prevent employee fraud through multiple 
reimbursements for the same purchase; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Allowing</B> the use of official resources for campaign purposes;
and 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Keeping</B> such careless records that the magnitude of the loss
to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  public probably will never be
known.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The good news is that the new Congress, under the leadership  of Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-GA), House Oversight  Committee Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA),
Representative Jim Nussle  (R-IA), its administrative officers, and the
management team they  brought in, has taken aggressive action to correct the
deficiencies  identified by the audit. Many of the 226 recommendations the
auditors  made already have been implemented, and the remainder are  being
implemented.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Members of Congress still benefit from a system of perks  and
privileges.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Excessive pay, perks, and expenses focused citizen anger on  Congress and
helped trigger the 1994 electoral revolution. The  new Republican majorities in
the House and Senate moved quickly  to cut staff and expenses and to eliminate
many of Congress's  exemptions from the law. Further steps are necessary,
however,  to reduce perks, reform pensions, and further trim staff. 
Congressional committees currently are considering some of these  reforms, while
others will likely be debated in the course of the  appropriations process. But
problems remain, such as automatic pay  raises, excessive pensions, and high
expense accounts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These perks continue to insulate Congress from American  citizens, to
frustrate political fairness, and to promote legislative  careerism and
bureaucracy. Reforms in these areas will mean a more  efficient, representative,
and politically competitive Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Automatic Pay Hikes.</B>  These pay hikes are
scheduled each  year 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  with no vote required, further
boosting lawmakers' salaries,  which already exceed $11,000 a month ($133,600
per year).  Because Members' salaries are funded by a permanent, indefinite 
appropriation rather than through the annual appropriations bill, they  are
nearly invulnerable to legislative change when the rest  of Congress's budget is
under discussion. Congress should  make Members' salaries a legislative
appropriations line item and  eliminate the automatic salary cost-of-living
adjustments (COLAs)  that, unless Congress acts, give each Member an automatic
pay  hike. Such an automatic pay raise violates the spirit of the 27th 
Amendment to the Constitution, which states that Members must stand  for
reelection before any pay raise they vote on takes effect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Excessive Pensions.</B> Congressional pensions far exceed most 
private-sector plans. Congress's pension system is up to twice as  generous as
those of most Fortune 500 corporations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Not only do these generous pensions burden the taxpayers,  but they also
promote political careerism by providing incentives  for lawmakers to extend
their tenure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over 250 Members of the 103rd Congress will become  &quot;pension
millionaires,&quot; receiving pension income after their retirement  in excess
of $1 million. For instance, former Speaker of the  House Tom Foley (D-WA) is
eligible for nearly $124,000 per year in  addition to the pay he will receive
from his job at a  lobbying/law firm. The former Speaker could take in over $3
million in  pension checks over the course of his expected lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>COLAs are applied to congressional pensions as well as  congressional
salaries. Only one in ten private-sector pensions is  adjusted 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  for inflation, and many of those
compensate for as little as a  third of the inflation rate. This feature makes
former Members of  Congress among the wealthiest of retired Americans.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members' office expense accounts are too high.</B> The 1996 
appropriation combined the three House Members' personal  allowance accounts
(staff salaries, office expenses, and official mail) into  one appropriation, a
positive step to increase flexibility and ease  administrative burdens. However,
the combined account was  increased by over 2 percent, to over $360 million, due
to increases  in staff salaries and mail funding. A House committee has 
approved an additional 2 percent increase for the coming year, to an  average of
$887,337 for each House member. Although increases in  postal rates and
population may justify some adjustment of mail  allowances, it is difficult to
make similar arguments for an increase  in the aggregate staff salary
appropriation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the debate at the beginning of the 104th Congress over  the proposed
elimination of House Legislative Service  Organizations, advocates of abolition
intimated that a substantial portion of the  $5 million spent each year on LSOs
would be saved. In fact,  these funds were not cut, and even steeper staff cuts
are justified. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Incumbents retain a significant electoral advantage.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Campaign finance law and congressional perquisites provide  huge electoral
advantages for incumbents, leading to House  reelection rates of well over 90
percent  even the dramatic 1994  elections produced a reelection rate of 90.2
percent. This remarkable  level of job security is the result of several
built-in advantages that  stack the election deck. There are several reasons why
incumbents  enjoy 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  such success.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Challengers have difficulty raising funds.</B> After
passage of  the 1974 law that first regulated contributions to congressional 
campaigns, incumbents' financial advantage over challengers  grew fivefold by
1992, approaching an advantage of four to one.  In 1994, this had fallen
somewhat, to just over two to one. Much  of this is due to political action
committee (PAC) donations   special-interest gifts five times larger than
individuals are allowed  to contribute   that flow to incumbents by a
disproportionate  margin of nine to one.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members use constituent services to build a voter base.</B> The 
greatest tax-funded advantage enjoyed by incumbents is the  routine operation of
congressional offices. Members of Congress  use about half their staffs for
constituent service or casework,  helping voters who have problems with the
government. The irony is  that these problems flow in large part from the very
laws and  government programs Congress makes possible. Says former  Minnesota
Representative Vin Weber, &quot;we create the government that  screws you, and
then you're supposed to thank us for protecting you  from it.&quot;  Studies
show that constituent service adds 5 percent to 10  percent to a typical
Member's vote total.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#3">3</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members have free mailing privileges  though now in  smaller
amounts.</B> In March 1994, the House Oversight Committee  approved a one-third
cut in Members' franking allowances from  their 1994 authorizations. This will
save over $20 million in  postage-related spending yearly, bringing down the
average annual  spending ceiling per congressional office from $163,000 to 
$108,000. This is a healthy step on the road to eliminating abuses that  per
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  petuate congressional careerism.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Many campaign finance &quot;reform&quot; schemes are overregulatory.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of the reform plans to diminish the influence of money  in politics
create a regulatory system that actually protects  incumbents and punishes
challengers. The key elements of many  regulatory campaign finance reform plans
include spending limits,  advertising subsidies, and public financing. These
provisions  are likely to make elections even less competitive and less 
issue-oriented.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are four key problems involved in limiting  congressional campaign
spending:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. Spending limits uniformly punish challengers.</B>
Studies  have demonstrated that challengers need to spend significant amounts 
of money to unseat sitting Members of Congress. In 1994, the  average challenger
who unseated an incumbent spent well  over $700,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Spending limits ignore the advantages of incumbency.</B> In  addition
to contending with incumbents' natural advantage in  name identification and
media access, challengers must compete  with the enormous array of
taxpayer-funded resources that  incumbents have at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Spending limits violate the First Amendment.</B> Mandatory  limits
are clearly unconstitutional. To get around this problem, most  proposals call
the limits voluntary, but they place those who do  not accept the caps at such a
great disadvantage that the limits  argu
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  ably are made compulsory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Spending limits encourage evasion, hiding, and cheating.</B> 
Citizens will always find ways to express their views. The  principal effect of
government regulation of political speech is to push  citizens away from
straightforward activities (such as direct  donations) into more circuitous
methods. Previous attempts at  regulating away political influence have led to
the development of  PACs, bundling, soft money, and independent expenditure 
campaigns.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#4">4</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Public Financing Is No Answer.</B> Another way to limit  the
influence of money on politics is through public subsidizing  of campaigns.
Already, presidential campaigns receive a limited  public subsidy that has
become increasingly unpopular with  the American taxpayers (as demonstrated by
the declining number  of taxpayers who elect to participate on their tax forms).
The  four most critical problems with public financing are:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. The money is already committed.</B> Public financing of 
congressional candidates would require additional funds from the  federal budget
 an effort which the commitment to a balanced budget  by 2002 makes all the more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Public financing is expensive.</B> Taxpayer grants for  congressional
candidates could well total in the hundreds of millions of  dollars. The
possibility of nearly 1,000 subsidized candidates every  two years vividly
demonstrates the tremendous cost of  government involvement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. The people oppose public financing.</B> Taxpayers have  abandoned the
presidential campaign fund checkoff, with participation  falling 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  from 29 percent in 1980 to 17
percent in 1991. To find  sufficient funds for the 1996 presidential elections,
Congress was forced  to raise the value of the individual checkoff from $1 to $3
per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Subsidizing political extremists is unattractive to most  Americans.</B>
Experience with the presidential fund shows that fringe  candidates are
attracted by government subsidies. Third-party  radical Lenora Fulani received
nearly $1 million in federal  matching funds in the 1988 presidential campaign
and over $2 million  in 1992.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#5">5</A> 
Because there cannot be an ideological litmus test for  public financing, tax
dollars inevitably would go to dozens of  extremist candidates ranging from
Fulani to Lyndon La Rouche to  David Duke.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Broadcast Subsidies Also Are No Answer.</B> Postal and  broadcast
subsidies are nothing more than public funding in disguise.  By compelling
broadcasters or the postal service to provide no-cost  or low-cost political
communication services to candidates, the  government essentially is taxing
these entities and transferring  those funds to the candidates. All of the
problems that exist with  public subsidies necessarily carry over to this
heavy-handed,  big-government &quot;reform&quot; scheme.

<P><B>*     Taxpayer-subsidized lobbying helps drive up the cost of 
government.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government currently subsidizes lobbying by  tax-exempt
organizations by supplying grants and contracts to  advocacy groups. Each year,
America's taxpayers provide these  organizations with billions of dollars which
they then use to advance  their own political agendas.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by  ideology.
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use  taxpayers'
funds to promote their ideas and positions. Almost  every interest in America 
from agriculture to zoology  has one  or more organizations tainted by
government funding. The  American Association of Retired Persons, for example,
received over  $73 million in a one-year period, while the American Bar 
Association received over $2 million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past 40 years, Congress has created a vast patronage  network of
organizations that enjoy preferred tax status, receive  federal funds, and
engage in legislative or political advocacy.  The days of big-city political
machines disbursing patronage may  be coming to an end, but the disbursement of
financial dividends  to political friends remains a prominent feature of the
federal budget.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      A large number of individuals with strong views can 
express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that  promotes that
issue. With tax-funded politics, however, a  small number of zealots with access
to the public purse can  obtain resources to advance its views even though few
individuals  in society share the group's philosophy. Whenever  government funds
any political advocacy group, it effectively  penalizes those groups that

<P>In 1995, Congress began to address the significant problem of  welfare for
lobbyists. In the House, Representatives Ernest Istook  (R-OK), David McIntosh

bill that would limit  the amount of money federal grantees could spend on
political  advocacy to not more than 5 percent of their non-grant  revenue.<A

<P><B>The Huge Growth in Committees and Staff
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Until action was taken in the 104th Congress, the explosion  in committees
and staff led to the growth of a powerful staff  bureaucracy and made it easier
for interest groups to influence  legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     House committee staff had grown almost twelvefold since 
World War II. In the last two decades alone, committee staffs in  the House of
Representatives had grown by 158 percent. Congress  was the most heavily staffed
legislature in the world by a factor of  five, with nearly 40,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The number of committees and subcommittees totaled under  200 in 1947,
exploded in the post-Watergate era, and did not fall  significantly under 300
until the early 1990s. The new Congress  cut this number to 198.

</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress acted swiftly to change its rules and  practices. The
1994 elections changed the partisan control of Congress  and delivered a clear
reform mandate. The Contract With  America promised numerous changes in House
rules, and the new  leadership of the House of Representatives took this mandate
and  ran with it. On January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 104th  Congress,
the House voted to end procedures that had become  increasingly arbitrary and
secretive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new House rules package largely achieved the goals of  the institution's
critics. The rules were designed to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Improve deliberation</B> by banning proxy (absentee) voting in 
committees, ensuring minority rights in the amendment process,  and requiring
fuller reporting on spending bills.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Streamline the legislative process</B> by cutting the number of 
committees and subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of  legislation, and
slashing committee staff.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Promote accountability</B> by requiring that committee meetings 
be open to the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll  call votes on
major legislation, prohibiting alterations in debate  transcripts, and
conducting a comprehensive audit of House finances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Increase responsiveness</B> by imposing term limits on the 
Speaker and committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a  measure to
apply federal laws to Congress as the first legislative  vote 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  in the 104th Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Republicans' Contract With America provided for eight  specific
first-day reforms that the House succeeded in passing:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms.</B> The new rules  package
eliminated three House committees  Post Office and Civil  Service, District of
Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries   and 25 subcommittees. The
committee reform provision also  will shrink House committee staff by one-third.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> 2)  Truth in Budgeting.</B> Appropriations committees are now  required
to compare new spending recommendations to the  current spending level. Under
the old system, tax-and-spend liberals  had the upper hand because spending
increases were judged not  against what was actually spent last year, but
against projected  spending for next year. With these rules, even a spending
increase could  be called a &quot;cut.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Term Limits for Committee Chairmen and the Speaker.</B>  House
committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more  than three consecutive
Congresses (six years). Limiting the tenure  of committee chairmen begins to
address some of the concerns  of advocates of full-scale legislative term
limits. A central problem  of previous Congresses had been that committee
chairmen, who  set the agenda, had spent decades in office. In the 103rd
Congress,  for example, the chairmen of two of the House's three most  powerful
committees (Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce)  had held these positions
for over a decade; the chairman of the  third (Appropriations) had just vacated
his position after holding it  since the 1970s.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, the Speaker will be prohibited from serving more  than four
Congresses (eight years), bringing the top constitutional  officer of the
legislative branch in line with the President, his  executive branch
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Elimination of Proxy Voting.</B> Elimination of the practice  of
allowing absent members of a committee to loan their votes  to other members was
critical to ensuring fairness and  improving committee deliberation. Although
House rules strictly  prohibited one Member from casting votes for another on
the House  floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by this rule's 
violation), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the  103rd Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, proxy voting allowed the majority party leadership  to extend
its control over committee outcomes by scheduling  multiple, contemporaneous
committee and subcommittee  meetings. Proxy voting also promoted committee
absenteeism by  ensuring that legislators who skipped meetings would retain
their ability  to cast votes in absentia, in addition to allowing legislators to
 abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or against 
legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its  merits.
Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee  chairmen and force
Members to show up and actually participate in  the work of their committees if
they want their votes to count.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>5)  Open Meetings.</B> The 1995 rules changes also ensure public  access
to committee meetings. In previous Congresses,  committees frequently closed
their doors to the press and public, a step  the panels could take for nearly
any reason. In fact, the two  House 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  committees that most often
operated in secret   Appropriations and Ways and Means  were the ones making 
controversial choices about federal taxation and spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Further, broadcast media are permitted to cover any open  hearing or meeting
(previously, media coverage was subject to a vote  of approval). The new rules
also require that committees publish  recorded committee votes in their reports
(most voting records  previously were available only at committee offices) and
that  hearing transcripts not be altered other than for minor  grammatical
changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>6)  Tax Hikes More Difficult.</B> The new rules require a  three-fifths
vote of the House to pass any income tax rate increase and  prohibit retroactive
taxation of income. The 60 percent rule has been  particularly controversial,
with some Washington  commentators claiming the new rule is anti-democratic or
even  unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric inside the Beltway is the
conviction  that new tax increases are needed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The supermajority requirement is similar to restrictions  voters have
imposed on numerous state legislatures. Among the  most beneficial aspects of
the 60 percent tax rule is that any future  Congress desiring to raise taxes
would have to alter or waive the  rule, thereby signaling a potential tax boost.
The provision also  balances the burden of a 1990 budget law which effectively
requires a  60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes (unless the reductions 
are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in entitlement spending).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>7)  Authorization of House Audit.</B> Another 1995 rules change 
authorized a comprehensive audit of House records, assets, and  fa
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  cilities by an independent
accounting firm. Some House  accounts previously had been audited sporadically
by the General  Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the
fact  that one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most  House accounts
were not examined regularly, and some may never  have been reviewed by an
independent examiner. This audit was  the first complete accounting of the
House's financial status  ever made available to the public.<A
HREF="ftnt12.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>8)  Applying Federal Laws to Congress.</B> The last of the  Contract
reforms was the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA).  This measure has both
substantive and symbolic importance. It  underscores the principle that no
American should be immune from  the law or receive special treatment in its
application. The bill  also should encourage legislators to review the burdens
that  federal laws place upon American citizens and ensure that the  benefits
they bring exceed their attendant costs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Term Limits </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress also held the first-ever votes on term  limits. Although
the House fell short of the necessary two-thirds  majority by 63 votes (227
ayes, 204 nays), the vote marked a  significant improvement over previous
Congresses that refused even to  debate the issue. Seven months after the House
vote, the Senate took up  a nonbinding resolution supporting term limits. The
resolution  failed to win majority support (45 ayes, 49 nays). Still, by putting
 members of the House and Senate on record as publicly supporting  or opposing
term limits, supporters now have a standard  against which they can measure
future Congresses. In addition, the  voters will know  unequivocally  where
their representatives stand  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  this important issue. A Senate
vote on a constitutional  amendment is planned for early 1996, though supporters
concede they are  certain to fail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Budget Cuts </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress voted to slash its own budget. The FY  1996 legislative
branch appropriations bill provided systemic  congressional reforms as important
as any yet enacted, including  spending cuts, staff cuts, privatization, and
abolition of unnecessary  offices and functions. The FY 1996 congressional
budget would  reduce spending in real dollars  not phony &quot;baseline&quot;
cuts  by  $242 million, or 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress succeeded in setting an example for the rest of the  government by
slashing its staff and eliminating unneeded  agencies, including the $21 million
Office of Technology  Assessment, which had provided redundant services to the
national  legislature. The reforms push the General Accounting Office to
privatize  its administrative functions, such as printing, mail handling, and 
library services. The GAO also will receive funds to contract  out some of its
auditing work so that it can benefit from the  lower costs available in the
private sector. The result is a real cut of  more than one-fourth in the GAO's
budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite Congress's effort to lead by example by cutting its  own budget
first, President Clinton vetoed the legislative branch  appropriations bill the
first time it reached his desk. He stated that  he liked the bill but did not
want to let Congress receive its  funding early in the budget process. In other
words, the President  decided that scoring political points was more important
than  achieving 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  real spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Lobbying Reform and Gift Ban</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the House and Senate both enacted rules restricting  the types and
amounts of gifts lawmakers may receive. The  Senate passed a complex rule that
allowed single gifts up to $50, with  a $100 annual limit. Any item less than
$10 fell outside the  Senate's rules. The House chose to adopt a more sweeping
proposal  offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich to prohibit all gifts. Both the 
Senate rule and the House ban include exceptions for  commemorative items and
expenses related to official activities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lobbying disclosure legislation was approved by both the  House and Senate
in late 1995. While this legislation would adopt  new reporting requirements and
close loopholes in the original  1946 Lobby Reform Act, it carefully avoids many
potential pitfalls.  It successfully protects legitimate grassroots organizing,
as well  as part-time and small lobbying operations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A glaring omission from the so-called reform bill was any  meaningful effort
to address taxpayer-subsidized lobbying.  Opponents of this reform argued for
months that welfare for lobbyists  should be addressed in the lobby reform
debate, then turned around  and argued against any House amendments to this
important  legislation. The result is a flawed lobby reform bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has a very poor record on  political reform
issues. The President has supported an overregulatory  cam
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  paign finance &quot;reform&quot;
scheme that would impose spending  limits and public financing. He promoted
lobbying reform but  adamantly opposed provisions that would have restricted the
abuse of  taxpayer grants through government-subsidized lobbying.  Moreover, he
has not supported the most important reform needed to shake  up the current
political process: term limits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has promoted the concept of  &quot;reinventing
government,&quot; but a close examination of the fine print  of the
Administration's plan shows that it makes federal  management even worse.
Clinton proposals weaken merit standards in  hiring, promotion, and pay and
strengthen the role of federal unions  in setting salary levels of work
assignments in federal agencies,  thus directly undermining management
authority. The result: a  federal bureaucracy even less accountable to the
public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress achieved dramatic reforms in the structure  and operation
of Congress, but many other reforms are needed.  Among them, the new Congress
should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Pass a constitutional amendment for term limits.</B> Although  the
104th Congress put all its members on record for or against  term limits, the
failure to enact the reform means that Members of  Congress still can remain in
office as long as they want. The  Supreme Court's ruling against state-based
term limits leaves Congress  no choice but to enact a constitutional amendment
to end  congressional careerism.
</P>
<P>

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  wasteful, inefficient spending
and perquisites that separate  lawmakers from their constituents. The reforms in
the Contract  With America were good first steps, but Congress should continue

</P>
<P>The Citizen Congress Act, introduced in the House by  Representatives Mark
Sanford (R-SC) and Wayne Allard (R-CO) and in  the Senate by Bill Frist (R-TN),
is a sensible effort to address  these perks and privileges, including the items
listed above. The  bill (H.R. 2610/S. 1405) also would eliminate mass mailings
paid  for by the taxpayers  a tremendous incumbent advantage. These  re

</P>
<P>Action on the political reform that the American public has  demanded is
beginning to materialize, as shown by the 23 states  that passed term limits
legislation and by the provisions of the  Contract With America providing for
congressional committee and  staff reductions. To make challengers more

<P>Eliminating these advantages, in addition to saving  taxpayers money, would

<P><B>*     Apply the Freedom of Information Act to Congress.</B> The  major
flaw in the Congressional Accountability Act was its exclusion  of the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA) from the list of  covered laws. The FOIA does not
apply to the private sector because it  is intended to give the public access to
government information.  Excluding the Act makes it appear that Congress thinks
it has  something to hide and runs counter to the openness in government 
principles embodied in most other House reforms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     End welfare for lobbyists.</B> Although Congress has begun to 
address the issue of taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy, much  remains to be
done. In the 105th Congress, investigative hearings  must continue to examine
existing abuses, and further remedies must  be considered. The information
gained from these hearings and  from further investigation into the activities
of federal grantees must  be used to develop a meaningful reform proposal that,
as nearly  as possible, eliminates this outrageous abuse of taxpayers' funds.
</P>
<P>

<P>At its root, the issue of welfare for lobbyists is one of fairness  and
fiscal responsibility. True reform can be achieved only if it  includes the
following principles:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Full Disclosure.</B> Strong reporting requirements
are necessary  to shed light on the extent of this problem. Widespread abuse is 
already apparent  even from the limited and often confusing  data currently
gathered by the government. Federal grantees must  be tracked carefully and
should be required to indicate how  much money they dedicate to advocacy.
Furthermore, whatever  informa
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  tion the government collects
should be readily available to  the public for inspection. To the greatest
extent feasible, this  should include availability via the Internet at no cost
to users. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Truth in Testimony.</B> Witnesses testifying before Congress 
should be required to divulge whether they receive federal funds and,  if so,
for what purposes and in what amounts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</B> No advocacy organization 
that receives federal funds should be permitted to engage in  anything but
incidental lobbying except on issues related directly to its  tax status.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</B> No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to provide financial assistance  to any
affiliated organization that engages in lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees
should be treated as if they received the funds  directly from the federal
government. Organizations should not  be able to create sham &quot;foundations&quot;
that launder taxpayer funding  to support lobbying.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Tough Penalties.</B> The consequences for violating the
prohibition  on federally subsidized lobbying must be firm enough to  discourage
organizations from violating the standards. Under no  circumstances should any
organization that willingly and knowingly  violates this prohibition receive
additional federal funding.

<P>While reforming federal hiring, pay, and benefit policies, both  the
President and Congress must be sure to enforce the merit  principles of the
civil service system and maintain a bright line  between career and non-career
jobs. The usurpation of policy  functions by career staff undermines the
accountability of political  appointees to the President and the taxpayer, while
political abuse  of career staff undermines the integrity and professionalism of
 the civil service. Under no circumstance should Congress  undermine the
President's authority to appoint his own people to positions  of responsibility
and thus carry out his agenda and fulfill his  promises to the taxpayers. Good
government is accountable government.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't the Republicans hypocritical to attack  congressional
careerism in 1994, then fail to pass term limits in 1995?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The 104th Congress made great progress on term limits just  by
bringing the measure up for a vote in the House and Senate.  Although both
houses failed to come up with the two-thirds  majority needed to move the
amendment forward, they have provided  term limit supporters with a solid
benchmark to use in pressing ahead  in the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It will likely take at least one more election before Congress  has enough
conservative members dedicated to the cause of term  limits to muster the
supermajority needed to press ahead with a  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  stitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't Congress really just trying to &quot;muzzle&quot; opponents
with  its effort to end welfare for lobbyists?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. The attempts to end taxpayer-subsidized lobbying all  seek to
end 40 years of corrupt political patronage. The proposals  considered by the
104th Congress applied to groups all across  the ideological spectrum. Despite
cries that the reform  efforts amounted to nothing more than &quot;defunding the
left,&quot; the  Simpson-Istook compromise language that reached the floor of
the  House and Senate would affect corporations that receive grants  (primarily
for research and development) just as much as nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Welfare for lobbyists is a fundamental question of fiscal  responsibility.
With the drive to achieve a balanced budget in 2002, it  is utterly
irresponsible for the government to be feeding hungry  lobbyists instead of
hungry children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are some of the most vocal supporters of term limits  career
politicians?  Why don't they apply term limits to themselves?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Some Members, particularly those elected since 1990,  have agreed
to self-imposed term limits. This marks significant  progress toward a true &quot;citizen
Congress.&quot;  However, many Members  are reluctant to agree voluntarily to
term limits. If reformers  unilaterally &quot;disarm themselves&quot; by leaving
Congress now, the  career politicians left behind will enjoy an even tighter
control of  Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can the influence of big money contributions be reduced?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The best way to reduce the impact of special interests on 
elections is to reduce the role of Washington. This can be  accomplished in
several ways. First, reducing the size of  government would reduce the number of
programs subject to  special-interest lobbying and would lower the taxes from
which corporations  routinely seek exceptions. Similarly, imposition of a flat
tax  would eliminate the bidding for tax code loopholes that currently  drives
much Washington lobbying.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second step is to reduce Washington's role in the  political process.
Ending taxpayer-subsidized lobbying and forcing  special interests to raise
their money directly from supporters will place  all groups on a level playing
field. At the same time, the federal  government should remain out of the
business of overregulating  elections. In fact, current regulatory schemes are
part of the problem.  It is important to recall that the 1970s campaign finance
reform  effort produced PACs, now the target of reform themselves.  Elections
should not be government-funded, the media should not  be forced to carry
no-cost or low-cost political advertising, and  the government should not impose
spending limits. Moreover,  individual and PAC contribution levels should be
equalized to  ensure that special interests do not enjoy an advantage over 
individual voters.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of course, the ultimate solution to the influence of money in  politics is
to adopt term limits. Limiting the tenure of Members  of Congress forces them to
focus more on policies than politics.  With the understanding that they will not
be part of a &quot;career  Congress,&quot; Members will not be as dependent on
special interests to remain  in office.

<title>The Senate Faces Term Limits - Heritage</title>

<h3>THE SENATE FACES TERM LIMITS</h3>

By Kenneth R. Weinstein<br>
Director, Government Reform Project<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<p>
Backgrounder Update No. 274<br>
April 19, 1996<br>
<p>
(Updating David M. Mason, "House Term Limit Options: Good, Better, Best," Heritage Foundation <I>Executive Memorandum</I> No. 406, March 22, 1995.)
<p><hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Next week, the U.S. Senate will make history as it begins consideration of  <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.j.res.00021:">S.J. Res. 21</a>, a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms members of the House and Senate may serve. The amendment provides a uniform term limit of 12 years for House members and Senators.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Term limits are needed because long-term congressional incumbency tends to distort the character of representation. By becoming overly oriented toward the federal government and insulated from the public, Members of Congress can develop a set of interests and sympathies at odds with those held by their constituents. Term limits therefore would work to keep elected officials more in touch with voters. In addition, frequent rotation in office would help assure a continuous flow of new energy and innovative thinking in Congress.
<p>
<b>THE PUBLIC JUDGMENT </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among major public policy issues, term limits enjoys virtually unrivaled public support. As far back as 1964, a Gallup poll recorded a 49 percent plurality of Americans favoring term limits; since then, support has swelled to 64 percent in 1990 and 73 percent in 1995. Moreover, even though a reform-minded Congress was elected in 1994, support for term limits continued to grow to 77 percent in 1996.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, unlike other "hot-button" issues whose support withers in the heat of public debate, support for term limits remains firm. Between 1990 and 1995, initiatives were approved in 23 states, with support averaging 66 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yet, despite this overwhelming public support, in May 1995, the Supreme Court declared in <I>U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton</I> that state-imposed term limits on federal lawmakers are unconstitutional. Thus, if federal term limits are to be enacted, the only remaining course appears to be adoption of a constitutional amendment such as S.J. Res. 21.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The electoral tsunami of 1994 was due in no small part to public support for term limits, so the new majority in Congress has a special obligation to deliver on this issue. Indeed, ten of the 12 freshman senators already have announced their support for term limits. As public support continues to grow, long-term incumbents opposed to term limitsespecially those from states that already place term limits on their state and local officialsmust explain why they continue to ignore the public will.
<p>
<b>TEN LEADING MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT TERM LIMITS</b>
<p><ol>
<b><li>Claim: Term limits are an untested innovation. 
<p>
Fact: Along with the President, 37 governors are subject to term limits.</b> Term limits were contained in America's first governing document, the Articles of Confederation of 1781, but were not written into the Constitution, primarily because its authors saw them as "entering into too much detail" for a short document.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: The election of scores of new Senators and Representatives in 1994 disproves the need for term limits.
<p>
Fact: 314 of the 348 incumbent House members who sought re-election won -- a re-election rate of 90 percent.</b> Fully 92 percent of incumbent Senators -- 24 of 26 candidates -- won re-election.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: Campaign finance reform will render term limits obsolete. 
<p>
Fact: Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN) has called term limits "the ultimate campaign finance reform vehicle."</b>  Term limits create open seats, which lead to contested races. These races are more competitive because they are less costly: Challengers do not have to compensate for the fundraising advantage held by incumbents, who nearly always win.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits will deprive the nation of talented legislators. 
<p>
Fact: Self-governance is the basic supposition of democracy. </b>It is sheer arrogance to maintain that only one person in a half-million is qualified to be in Congress. Furthermore, while term-limited Senators and Representatives could serve in different capacities, other talented individuals would be given opportunity for advancement.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits are undemocratic because they restrict voter choice. 
<p>
Fact: Incumbents enjoy electoral advantages franking, staff, and travel allowances that present huge barriers to entry by challengers.</b> Moreover, experience at the state level suggests that term limits actually increase voter choice. In California, for instance, the imposition of state-level term limits in 1990 led to an increase of over 25 percent in campaign filings for the Senate and a similar increase of over 50 percent in filings for the Assembly by 1992.<sup>5</sup>  During the past half-century, gubernatorial races have been more competitive in term-limited states -- even in years when governors can run for re-election.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: The limited-government agenda of the 104th Congress means that term limits are no longer needed to fight pork-barrel politics. 
<p>
Fact: The longer individuals serve in Congress, the greater their propensity to support new spending initiatives.</b><sup>7</sup>  The frequent rotation imposed by term limits, on the other hand, would help to institutionalize the 104th Congress's bias against big spending.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Conservatives should avoid amending the Constitution at all costs. 
<p>
Fact: As George Will, a former opponent of term limits, argues, term limits offer a necessary constitutional corrective to the profound extraconstitutional metamorphosis of the federal government.</b> The Founders envisioned a citizen legislature as the backbone of limited government; as the interventionist state arose, however, politicians began to view public office as a career.<sup>8</sup>  Term limits would work to restore the Founders' intent by diminishing the tendency of Members of Congress to exploit their legally acquired powers to remain in office.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: As Senators find their terms limited, the Senate's capacity for deliberation and independent judgment likewise will be restricted. 
<p>
Fact: Term limits enhance the capacity for independence</b> by discouraging excessive concentration on fund-raising, re-election, and catering to special interests.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: If term limits are such a good idea, they should be imposed retroactively. 
<p>
Fact: Rather than openly oppose term limits, opponents have pursued a shrewd strategy of calling for retroactive application.</b> This argument is a red herring. Term limits represent principle, not retribution, and the public has rejected retribution. Only one retroactive congressional term limits measure has been offered to the voters (in Washington State in 1991), and it was rejected. It is not surprising that opponents of term limits are the only ones pushing for retroactive application.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Under term limits, unelected individuals will run Congress. 
<p>
Fact: This argument assumes that the departure of senior incumbents will create a vacuum in which more and more decisions are made by lobbyists and staff.</b> Lobbyists thrive because they cultivate relationships with long-term incumbents; rapid turnover would greatly diminish the value of such contacts. As for staff, anyone who has seen a congressional office knows that Congressmen give assignments rather than take them. The specter of career staff manipulating freshman Members has little support in reality. In a non-term-limited Congress, staff employees work on average between five and six years.<sup>9</sup>  Under term limits, new Members would likely replace aides to former Congressmen with employees of their own choosing.
</ol><p>
<b>THE SENATE VOTE AND THE THREAT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One of the few reforms devised and implemented by people who live beyond the Beltway, term limits are a tribute to public involvement in politics. Yet, despite powerful grassroots support, term-limit laws in 23 states were overturned in May 1995 by the U.S. Supreme Court -- after the U.S. House of Representatives had failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to ratify a federal constitutional amendment.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Frustrated by the Court's ruling and skeptical of Congress's desire to pass a constitutional amendment, some activists are pursuing a radical approach: calling for two-thirds of America's 50 state legislatures to approve an unprecedented constitutional convention to impose term limits. State legislatures in North Dakota and Utah already have called for such a convention. This year, 11 states will offer ballot measures to instruct state legislators to vote for a constitutional convention on term limits. Activists hope to garner the support of 34 state legislatures by the year 1999.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Term limits will remain a potent issue in 1996. President Clinton has decided to ignore the continued groundswell by opposing term limits. By contrast, Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) deserves credit for assuring that they will be considered by the U.S. Senate. Whether members of the Senate will continue to ignore public opinion -- thereby fueling the drive for a term limits constitutional convention -- remains to be seen.

<title> Off With the Limits: What I Learned About Money and Politics When I Ran for President

<h3>OFF WITH THE LIMITS: WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT MONEY AND POLITICS WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT</h3>
<p>
<b>By Lamar Alexander</b>
<br>May 23, 1996.

<P>

On March 3, one day after the disastrous -- for me -- South Carolina primary and three days before I withdrew from the presidential race, I attended Sunday services at the Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta. The Rev. Frank Harrington preached about how Joshua, after a great victory at the Battle of Jericho, had been surprised and humiliated in the battle of A'i -- so humiliated that Joshua renamed A'i the "Valley of Calamity." He wanted his warriors always to remember the lessons of what had happened there.
<p>
Walking out after the service, I asked Rev. Harrington, "Was the point that I should rename South Carolina the `Valley of Calamity?'" 
<p>
"No," he said, "the point is, you must learn lessons from your defeat -- and then pick yourself up and go on." 
<p>
The voters, in their wisdom, have given me a defeat, and now several weeks to reflect upon its lessons. The Heritage Foundation has invited me today to talk about one of those lessons: the influence of money on the race for the presidency. While my wounds are fresh, here is my view: The so-called campaign reformers are selling the American people a real bill of goods on this one. They are saying that limits on what individuals can give to presidential campaigns and on what candidates can spend will reduce the influence of money and create a better democracy.
<p>
In fact, such limits do precisely the reverse. We now have 22 years of experience with them. Limits have increased the influence of money and are dangerous to democracy. It is the law of unintended consequences operating in all of its glory. Instead of adding more limits, we should take the limits off and rely on full disclosure to discourage corruption.
<p>
The limits on giving and spending for a presidential campaign were well-intentioned, placed into federal law after Watergate. Corporations can't give at all; political action committees may give up to $5,000; and individuals may give up to $1,000 during the primaries (the government pays for the general election). In addition, there are limits on what a candidate may spend in each state primary and a ceiling on spending for the entire primary. The Federal Election Commission enforces all of this.
<p>
The limits were designed to make things better for you, the average voter, so let's look at what they have done. As a result of these limits: 
<ul>
<p><li>You are more likely to see a comet than meet a presidential candidate, unless you have $1,000 -- or live in Iowa or New Hampshire; 

<p><li>You have fewer choices of candidates;

<p><li>The primary campaigns start before you care and end before you have a chance to vote;

<p><li>You are less likely to hear the candidates' messages; 

<p><li>Your nominee is more likely to be someone already holding office, rather than an insurgent;

<p><li>More of your choices are among candidates who are rich enough to spend their own money; and 

<p><li>Washington, D.C., has more to say about who the nominee is and you have less.
</ul><p>
In short, the federal limits on giving and spending during elections are turning presidential races into playgrounds for the rich, the already famous, and the Washington-based, and are helping to deprive most Americans of the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.
<p>
When we create a system for picking Presidents, I believe our objectives should be these:
<ul>
<p><li>We should want the largest number of good candidates.

<p><li>We should want a good opportunity to hear what they have to say.

<p><li>All of us, if possible, want the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.
</ul><p>
If this is also your set of objectives, then here is my remedy: Off with the limits. Off with the limits on individual contributions. Off with the spending limits. Require maximum disclosure. Open up the system. Let the candidates speak. Let us vote.
<p>


<b>Three Disclaimers</b>
<p>
Before you think it, let me say it:
<p>
First, I am not here to wallow in gloom. In fact, I come away from the campaign more optimistic, not less. I would do it again in a minute. I believe even more that there is very little wrong with our country that more jobs, better schools, and stronger families won't fix. 
<p>
Second, I believe I can make these remarks in the spirit of a gracious loser. That is made easier because our process produced a nominee whom I respect, who is my friend, and who I will be proud to call my President. Under any process, Bob Dole was our party's most likely nominee this year. (I will confess that my determination to be a gracious loser is tested about once a week when I remember what another defeated Tennessean, Davy Crockett, once said. Congressman Crockett strode to the courthouse steps, faced the voters who had just turned him out of office, and said what every defeated candidate has always wanted to say to such voters: "I'm going to Texas and you can go to hell!")
<p>
Finally, I am not here to complain because Steve Forbes spent $33 million of his own wealth on his presidential campaign. I believe the First Amendment to our Constitution gives Mr. Forbes the right to spend his money to advance his views. The Rockefellers and Perots and Forbeses and du Ponts all have made valuable contributions to our public life. I hope they continue to do so. What I object to, as I will discuss, is letting them spend all they want and then putting limits on the rest of us.
What I am arguing -- that it is wrong to put limits on giving and spending -- runs smack in the face of what we have been hearing ever since Watergate. So let me take my points one by one. What I have to contribute is a view from the inside. I will stick to my impressions and stories from the road and let scholars here at Heritage and elsewhere compile the statistics and perform the analysis.
<p>
<b>Because of the limits, you're more likely to see a comet than meet a presidential candidate, unless you have $1,000 -- or live in Iowa and New Hampshire.</b> 
<p>Of course, not everybody wants to meet a presidential candidate. Walking across New Hampshire, I met a woman taking a work break outside a shoe factory in Manchester. I stuck out my hand and said, "I'm Lamar Alexander. I'd like to be your next President." She looked at me, and at my red and black shirt, and said with disgust, "That's all we need. Another President!" Congressman Mo Udall used to tell about walking into a barber shop. "I'm Mo Udall, running for President," he said. "Yeah, I know," the barber replied. "We were just laughing about that yesterday."
<p>

But if you are one of those persons who would actually like to meet and size up someone who might be your President, get your wallet ready because the $1,000 limit on giving forces candidates to spend most of their time with people who can give $1,000. As with many federal laws, these limits have done just exactly the opposite of what they were intended to do. Limits have increased the influence of money on the candidates.
<p>

For example, to raise $10 million in 1995 for the Alexander for President campaign, I traveled to 250 fund-raising events. Now, think about this. This is about one event per campaign day. This took 70 percent of all my time. As a result, I became unusually well acquainted with a great many good Americans capable of giving $1,000 (who probably represent a cross section of about one percent of all the people in the country). Wouldn't I have been a better candidate, and the country better off had I been elected, if I had spent more time traveling around America and visiting allies abroad? (I actually did this during 1994, driving 8,800 miles across America and spending two months overseas. This was when I was not spending most of my time meeting nice people who could give me $1,000.)
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, you have fewer choices for President.</b><p>
This is because, in the real world, a $1,000 limit on gifts makes fund-raising so difficult that it discourages most candidates. I will now wave my own red flag: It is important not to get carried away with this argument. The difficulty of raising money is sometimes just an excuse. There are other more compelling reasons not to run for President. 
<p>
For example, I recall in November of 1995, when Colin Powell was on the cover of the news magazines and his approval rating in the polls was, literally, higher than the Pope's -- and I was struggling to secure a paragraph in the Keokuk, Iowa, daily -- I was driving to the airport after a New York fund-raiser with a former associate of General Powell's. The unavoidable question arose, "Will Colin run?" The former associate answered, "I don't know. But I can tell you two things about General Powell. One is, he makes rational decisions. Two is, he doesn't like uncertainty." I knew from that moment that, if that were true, there was no chance whatsoever Colin would be a candidate. Running for President is not a rational decision. It is instinctive. It is a passion with a purpose. And it is most surely a symphony in uncertainty. That is why I am so surprised that so many have such a hard time taking Colin Powell at his word, that he simply doesn't want to do it. Most people don't. They don't want the job, or they are afraid they can't win, or more and more they are unwilling to expose themselves and their families to the scrutiny that comes with the candidacy. 
<p>
Having said all of that, it is still true that the prospect of trying to raise $20 million from contributions of $1,000 or less makes the race much less attractive and often impossible for many good candidates. In 1995, Bill Bennett told me he didn't know how to raise that kind of money. Jack Kemp said he knew how but didn't want to. Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney discovered it would have been very hard even for a former Vice President and a former Defense Secretary; they both decided not to become candidates. 
<p>
You might have wondered this year, where have all the governors gone? I don't think I have ever met a governor who didn't think he or she would make an excellent President. Seventeen of our Presidents have been governors. There are today 32 Republican governors. One might argue (and I will confess that I tried out this argument a few hundred times during 1995) that the natural presidential partner for our strong Republican congressional leaders would have been the best of our Republican governors. 
<p>
But at the end of 1995, not one sitting Republican governor was in the race. Carroll Campbell, Tommy Thompson, and Bill Weld, perhaps others, had considered it and drawn back, privately saying, "I can't raise the money." Even the governor of California, Pete Wilson -- who by my calculation is governor of five percent of all the money in the world -- could not raise enough money. So, for Republicans, 1995 turned out to be the year of the "money primary." 
<p>
This is how it worked. There were, in the end, only four of us who could find a way to raise enough money to run for President. We all had certain advantages. For example, a contribution to Bob Dole was also a contribution to the respected Senate majority leader. Phil Gramm had worked relentlessly for six years as chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee to build a list of 83,000 names and a $5 million campaign kitty, which he then transferred to his presidential account -- a perfectly legal loophole, but one which was unavailable to the governors or others not holding office. Pat Buchanan was able to depend on direct mail for smaller contributions because it was his second race, he had been on network television for 15 years, and he took, shall we say, especially noisy positions. 
<p>
The Alexander campaign had some advantages, too: exceptional national leadership and strong support at home. Six of the last seven Republican national finance chairs chaired our fund-raising. We began with a $2 million dinner in Nashville on March 6, 1995, and raised $5.2 million in 21 events during the next six weeks. At the end of 1995, the three zip codes in America which had contributed the most to presidential campaigns were all in Nashville. By the time I withdrew, we had raised nearly $13 million from 26,000 contributors, 8,800 of whom had given $1,000. (We received another $4 million from federal matching funds.) 
<p>

But after the initial $5.2 million spurt, it became much harder for us. I was traveling to 20 events per month to raise $500,000. This created logistical adventures of Desert Storm proportions. On one day, I flew from Nashville to Colorado Springs to Denver for fund-raisers and then on to Phoenix to be ready for an early morning breakfast. To collect $20,000 during the crucial week before the Iowa caucus, I "dropped by" Knoxville, Tennessee, on the way from New Hampshire to Iowa. To raise another $30,000, I flew from Sioux City, Iowa, to San Juan, Puerto Rico, one Sunday in December. By the last four days of the New Hampshire primary, we were running on empty except for the money set aside for debts, audit, and winding down.
<p>

Then, when I placed a strong third in the Iowa caucus on February 12, the money dam broke. Beginning three days after Iowa, five days before the New Hampshire primary, contributions started rolling in to our Nashville headquarters at the rate of $100,000 a day without events. This continued for every day except Sunday, until I withdrew on March 6. Our once-a-week telephone conference calls sometimes included more than 200 volunteer fund-raisers. But it came too late, for New Hampshire ads had to be purchased the Friday before the primary on Tuesday. I failed (by 7,000 votes) to overtake Senator Dole. The Republican nomination was decided in the first primary. 
<p>

<b>Partly because of the limits, the campaign starts before you care and ends before you have a chance to vote.</b> 
<p>
Not only did the campaign end early; it started ridiculously early because, it seemed at the time, starting early was the only way to raise the necessary amount of money. In early 1995, Senator Gramm of Texas, flush with his 83,000 names and $5 million kitty, declared that it would take $20 million to run for President, that he could raise it and that he doubted many others could, and then sponsored a $4 million kick-off dinner in Dallas and announced, "Ready cash is a candidate's best friend." 
<p>

 None of the rest of us were about to be left behind. I held my $2 million dinner in Nashville. Senator Dole jumped in, as did others. Off we went, pounding the streets in 1995 trying to raise money for a race in 1996. It was like trying to stir up a conversation about football in the middle of the NBA playoffs. For me, by mid-summer 1995, it was going something like this interview: 
<blockquote><p>
	From Washington, D.C., "Inside Politics," Wolf Blitzer (already bored with the long "money primary"): "Governor Alexander, why do the polls show Senator Dole ahead of you 54 to 4 in Iowa?" 
<p>
	From Vermont, in my red and black shirt, Me (already tired of being asked the same question for the 50th time): "Wolf, that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. The reason Senator Dole is ahead of me is that everyone knows him and nobody knows me." 
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, add to the cost of creating such a long campaign the usual costs of fund-raising. A rule of thumb is that it costs 30 cents to raise a dollar. That meant that of the $10 million we raised in 1995, about $3.5 million went for fund-raising. Then there is the cost of complying with federal regulations. Another $1 million of the $10 million we raised during 1995 went for that. We set aside still another $500,000 for the campaign audit, which usually takes years. I think you can see where I am heading. 
<p>
 Add the costs of the long campaign to the usual costs of fund-raising and complying with federal rules and, by the time the 1995 money primary was over and the real primary in 1996 was here, the handful of us still standing (except for Mr. Forbes) were running out of money. The Alexander campaign spent $10 million during 1995, everything we raised, which left us about $3 million in the bank (counting federal matching funds) at the beginning of 1996. And, by comparison, we were running a bare-bones effort. Senator Gramm had spent $28 million when he dropped out just before the first primary in mid-February. Senator Dole had spent more than $30 million by March 1 and, with 39 primaries yet to go, was coming uncomfortably close to the federally imposed primary spending ceiling. Steve Forbes spent $33 million before he dropped out. I'm not sure whether my friend Pat has dropped out yet or not! 
<p>
 The reason why the Republican nomination was decided in the first primary is not only because limits on giving and spending forced the campaigns to start early. It is also because so many states moved their primaries to an earlier date in an attempt to give their citizens the same privilege Iowa and New Hampshire citizens have: the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote to pick the first President of the new century. This bunching of primaries created a wild roller coaster ride through 38 states in the 25 days after New Hampshire. Ironically, this made New Hampshire even more important. Here was the law of unintended consequences mischievously at work once again. The money primary became so long and expensive that we all arrived financially exhausted at the real starting line: New Hampshire, which turned out to be the finish line as well. About the time the voters had returned from the refrigerator to settle in and watch the presidential campaign unfold and perhaps even to vote in it the campaign had ended. 
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, you are less likely to hear the candidates' message.</b>
<p>

This is because limits on giving and spending prevent most candidates from raising enough money to get across their messages, especially if the candidate is relatively unknown at the beginning. Let me offer an example. Yesterday's <I>Newsweek</I> contains a column by Meg Greenfield which says this: "The doomed Presidential campaign of Lamar Alexander should tell the Republicans something. It was the quintessential anti-government pitch -- complete with an implicit -- and often explicit -- denial and disavowal of Alexander's career as a government guy. He bombed." 
<p>

 Well, now, this is the stuff of a pretty good debate. Of course, I disagree with Ms. Greenfield. I think my campaign nearly succeeded because I understand that the next President must lead us to expect less from Washington and ask more of ourselves, including our local governmental institutions. Ms. Greenfield's and President Clinton's solution is more from Washington. So let the debate begin. 
<p>

 Ms. Greenfield has her page in <I>Newsweek</I>. She is also editorial director for the <I>Washington Post.</I> President Clinton has the best forum of all. Their "more from Washington" side of the argument will get plenty of exposure. But what about my "more from us" argument? I made my case in Iowa during 80 visits and walked 100 miles across New Hampshire. I found that in those small meetings I could be persuasive. I also found that nothing much happened in the public opinion polls until I was on television. "Free TV" -- the network news -- was not of much help (although some local stations were very aggressive). To begin with, the national networks didn't arrive until mid-January when the campaign was nearly over. 
<p>

 The Center for Media and Public Affairs watched all the network newscasts in January and February, ten-and-one-half hours of campaign coverage. The Center found that we nine Republican candidates were allotted 79 minutes total. We were allowed to present our views in seven-second sound bites. The journalists covering us received five times as many minutes of coverage on those same newscasts. What the journalists said about us and our campaigns was more negative than what we candidates said about each other. And more than half the journalists' comments were about the horse race, not the issues. The Freedom Forum, in a remarkable survey of the journalists covering the presidential campaign, found that in 1992, 89 percent had voted for Bill Clinton. A candidate cannot rely on "Free TV" to get his message across. That is why, in our media-drenched society, where things are not important unless they are on TV, a candidate must have money for television to get a message across, and the limits on giving and spending make it difficult for candidates to do that.
<p>

This is not just one candidate's lament. Limits on giving and spending are an affront to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The whole idea of the framers of the Bill of Rights was to keep the government from attempting to limit political debate and criticism: "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech." In <I>Buckley v. Valeo</I>, the Supreme Court acknowledged this and struck down most congressional limits of this sort, but left standing the current provisions because of its worry about "corruption." I believe the better antidote to corruption is disclosure. To correct something bad, we have created something worse. 
<p>
<b>
Because of limits, your nominee is more likely to be an incumbent than an insurgent.
</b><p>
In the real world, insurgents not only need more money than incumbents; they need it early. The <I>New York Times</I> reported that two-thirds of voters in New Hampshire made their minds up during the last week before the primary, after the Iowa caucuses. Among those voters, I won with 31 percent. Among the one-third who voted before Iowa, I received six percent. More money, earlier, might have helped get my message across to those early deciders. 
<p>

Candidates for President who already hold public office have government-paid staffs of policy advisers, PR people, and political administrators. They have name recognition and franking privileges. They have a fund-raising advantage because of their positions of power. If they are in Washington, they have a huge media advantage because that is where the media are. So putting a limit on what all candidates can raise and spend turns out to be a protection policy for some candidates: the ones who already enjoy the perquisites of public office. 
<p>

This is not just true in federal races. My home state, Tennessee, has just limited contributions to governors' races to $500. This is an enormous advantage for our incumbent Republican governor, Don Sundquist. And it virtually guarantees that the only effective candidate against Governor Sundquist when he runs for re-election will be someone who is so rich that he can spend his or her own money -- which brings us to the most important point. 
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, more of your choices are likely to be rich candidates willing to spend their own money.</b><p>

This brings us to the major problem with limits on campaign giving and spending: The limits apply to some candidates but not to others. This is because the U.S. Supreme Court has said that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from preventing anyone from spending his or her own money on our own campaigns. So the limits apply only to people who aren't rich enough to spend money on their own campaign. 
<p>

This creates an absurd advantage for wealthy candidates and a distorted contest for the voter. The first advantage is the obvious: The wealthy candidate has more money to spend. For example, Mr. Forbes spent $33 million of (mostly) his own money; I spent, with matching funds, about $16 million of other peoples' money. 
<p>

There are two other less obvious advantages. The candidate with his own money spends no time raising it. On the other hand, the candidate raising it is careening from event to event, repeating speeches, meeting nice people who can give $1,000, wearing himself ragged, and using up 70 percent of his time. By the time you reach the finals the week between Iowa and New Hampshire, you are a candidate for a fitness center, not the presidency. 
<p>

Finally, there are the state-by-state spending limits, which also help the rich. The federal government has decreed, for example, that a campaign may not spend more than $1 million in Iowa and $618,000 in New Hampshire during the presidential primaries. Mr. Forbes, unaffected by these limits, spent $5 million in Iowa on television. The Alexander campaign spent $930,000. The AP reported that on the third week before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Forbes bought 700 ads on one Boston television station (which covers southern New Hampshire). That week, Senator Dole bought 200 ads on that station. The Alexander campaign: none. Mr. Forbes must have spent $5 million in Arizona, by my estimates. Local newspapers said it was more than any advertiser had ever spent on local television to introduce a new product. (It must be pointed out that having your own money doesn't automatically mean you win. Mr. Perot is not President. Mr. Forbes came in fourth in both Iowa and New Hampshire. I recall my race for governor in 1978 against a candidate who must have spent $8 million. I spent $2 million, enough to win, although I could never have raised $2 million if there had been limits of $500 or $1,000 per contribution.)
<p>

What kind of contest is this, having different rules for different contestants? This is like watching the Magic play the Bulls with one team wearing handcuffs. It is certainly not the game the voters paid to see. Think of it this way: Say the fifth grade teacher organizes a contest for class president with water pistols as the weapon of choice; then some kid arrives with a garden hose. Either take away the new kid's garden hose (Bill Bradley suggests a constitutional amendment to limit what individuals can spend on their own campaigns) or give the rest of the fifth graders the freedom to raise and spend enough money to buy their own garden hoses. And if the New Hampshire primary is most of the ball game in presidential primaries, why should state-by-state spending limits keep candidates from defending themselves, even if they use up all their money?
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, Washington has more to say about who the nominee is and you have less.</b> 
<p>
Talking about Washington these days has gotten to be a sticky business. The rest of the country is tired of Washington, and Washington is tired of hearing about Washington. The rest of the country is becoming more offensive about its feelings, and Washington is becoming more defensive. "Cut their pay and send them home" still makes sense in Sioux City, but they call it nonsense here. One of Washington's most senior journalists told me sadly last year that "This town has grown too big for its britches." I have been coming and going from Washington off and on for 30 years and I believe that is true as well; but to come from outside Washington and say it, and to really believe it, is asking for trouble.
<p>

I believe our President must lead us to expect less from Washington and to ask more of ourselves. That is a message less frequently heard in Washington and more difficult to launch from outside Washington. For one thing, this is a media-drenched society, and the message-launchers -- the media -- are increasingly concentrated here. That will be more true in 2000 and 2004 than it was in 1996. The party fund-raising apparatus is here. The party leadership is here. The think tanks, if you will excuse me, are here. To receive maximum attention to my speech today, I am here. There are all sorts of good people here in Washington, but we of necessity, when we are here, talk mostly with each other.
<p>

<b>Reforming the Process</b><p>

Limits on giving and spending make it less likely that a candidate based outside Washington can succeed. Such candidates, by their experience and skills, may be able to help make Washington more like the rest of America, rather than the rest of America more like Washington. I believe Washington will always be a better place if it is constantly refreshed by the strength of the country outside Washington. The way we pick Presidents today makes that more difficult. Limits are not all that is wrong.

<p><b>The process should be deregulated.</b> We should sunset the existing regulations and start over. Fewer rules and full disclosure should be the byword.

<p><b>Spread out the primaries.</b> Let Iowa and New Hampshire go first, in February or March, and then arrange all the other primaries on the second Tuesday of the next three months. This would give winners a chance to capitalize on success, voters a chance to digest new faces, and candidates a chance to actually meet voters. 

<p><b>The candidates should be given the opportunity to speak on television more often for themselves.</b> My even mentioning this runs the same risks Dennis Rodman would take if he suggested some rule changes to a convention of NBA officials. So let me begin with some praise. Some print reporters sat through New Hampshire Lincoln Day dinners in the early stages of the money primary, in 1994 and 1995. C-SPAN and CNN labored valiantly and early. In January and February of 1996, the <I>New York Times</I> began printing some long excerpts of the candidates' speeches, and the networks began showing unedited stump speeches. But most of the coverage came late, or was about the horse race, or about candidates who were never going to run. Seventy-nine minutes of network exposure in seven-second sound bites for nine Republican candidates is pathetically little. 
<p><b>
There are dangers to early voting.</b> In a growing number of states, voters may vote a month or two before the election day. According to the Edison exit poll of 1996 New Hampshire primary voters, 40 percent of the voters made their minds up during the last three days before the primary. Those who cast their votes a month earlier were voting in quite a different race. 

<p>
 <b>Other Options For Reform</b>
<p>
The first option is suggested by Senator Bill Bradley, whose sporting background must make him especially allergic to contests with one rule for some participants and another rule for others. Senator Bradley would try to create a level playing field by putting limits on everyone, in effect making Mr. Forbes live by the same rules I do. 
<p>
This takes care of Mr. Forbes and me. But the AFL-CIO will still be able to run $35 million worth of TV ads attacking particular Republican candidates. The National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors will still be able to run ads slamming President Clinton's product liability veto. The National Restaurant Association will advertise that President Clinton is wrong about the minimum wage. The National Education Association will say I am wrong about school choice.The national political parties will raise tens of millions in "soft money." The President is the one person in America who is able to advocate the best interests of the country as a whole. Why should we limit the speech only of those who seek to speak for the country as a whole?
<p>
Senator Bradley should leave the First Amendment alone. The First Amendment is correct. It stands in the way of preventing ill-advised efforts by the government to limit a candidate's right to speak. And if there cannot be limits on most of us, why should there be limits on any of us? 
<p>
A second option is public financing which we now have with the presidential general elections. But such taxpayer-funded campaigns still leave Mr. Perot and the AFL-CIO and other committees free to spend millions creating an unlevel playing field. Also, public financing leaves the media with more horsepower than the candidates themselves have. And I cannot fathom how public financing would work in a primary situation. Would the government have funded everyone who showed up at the Republican debates this season? If so, such funding would have produced countless more candidates. I am opposed to public financing. It is incestuous. It is an unnecessary use of taxpayers' money. It invites government regulations. It creates an unlevel playing field by favoring incumbents. 
<p>
Finally, there are various proposals to require the media to give away TV time. (Such proposals would never work in a primary for the same reasons public financing could not work: How would you choose to whom to give it?) The lack of an opportunity for voters to consider the messages of candidates -- especially insurgent candidates -- is at the heart of the problem with our presidential process. But I am afraid these well-meaning proposals will drown in their own complexity and the law of unintended consequences will somehow rear its head again. Isn't the best solution for the media simply to cover the races and present the serious candidates on network news and in the newspapers more often on appropriate occasions, speaking for themselves?
<p>

<b>Find the Good and Praise It</b><p> 
I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that I came away from the campaign with a good feeling, not a bad feeling. My friend Alex Haley used to say, "Find the good and praise it," and I can easily do that about this process, even with its flaws. During the last year, I walked across New Hampshire, meeting several hundred people a day, spent 80 days in Iowa in maybe 200 meetings that ranged from 20 to 300 people, and had at least 50 meetings in Florida with the delegates to the Presidency III straw poll. During most of these meetings I was little known and unencumbered by the news media, so there was no disruption to the flow of the session. 
<p>
I remember wishing time after time that anybody who had any sense of cynicism about our presidential selection process could be with me, like a fly on the wall, because they could not be cynical after hearing and seeing and feeling what I saw. The groups with whom I met always listened carefully. Most often, they wanted to talk about our jobs, our schools and our neighborhoods, and our families. In meeting after meeting, I came away certain that this is a nation hungry for a vision contest, not one willing to tolerate a trivial presidential election. I believe there is a great market in the American electorate for a full-fledged discussion about what kind of country we can have in the year 2000 and beyond. 
<p>
As the song says, it is a long, long time from May 'til September when the presidential race really begins. One way to help fill this time usefully would be to review the way we pick Presidents and make certain that next time, in the new century, we have a process that attracts the largest number of good candidates, that gives them an opportunity to say and us to hear their messages, and gives as many of us as possible a chance to cast a meaningful vote. 
<p>
One lesson I learned when I ran for President is that step one toward those objectives would be these four words: Off with the limits.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To increase its political muscle, the AFL-CIO has announced plans for two new union "taxes," including a more than one-third increase in per-member levies on constituent unions, to fund organized labor's 1996 partisan election activity. The new fees -- levied by the AFL-CIO on its members --  will finance the federation's previously announced $35 million campaign against the current Congress. This year alone, the additional income from these new charges will exceed $75 million for an organization whose annual budget was only $65 million last year. And despite the fact that 40 percent of union members voted Republican in the 1994 elections, the federation apparently intends to spend 100 percent of the new funds opposing GOP candidates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To put its 1996 political expenditures in perspective, the AFL-CIO expects to spend seven times its usual campaign budget and three times more than it has ever spent in any previous election year.<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, when the $35 million budget is allocated among the 75 targeted districts -- predominantly Republican freshmen, according to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney -- the average per-district expenditure is $467,000. In the 1994 election cycle, by contrast, the average challenger spent $239,000. Moreover, the $35 million figure represents only the AFL-CIO's planned political activities. Individual unions within the federation, as well as unaffiliated unions, will likely conduct additional election efforts.
<p>

<b>36 Percent Increase to be Ratified at March 25 Convention</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While meeting during the last week of February at a posh resort in Bal Harbour, Florida, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and his Executive Council decided to increase by more than one-third the fees it imposes on union members. Member unions currently are assessed 42 cents per member per month. The new assessment will increase this by 15 cents to 57 cents per member per month. It is expected that this will raise $25 million of the $35 million needed for the federation's 1996 political efforts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 25, 1996, the AFL-CIO will hold a special convention in Washington to ratify this extraordinary increase. (The Executive Council decided this new fee exceeded the amount they could approve on their own.) The intent of the new fundraising effort is clear:  AFL-CIO leaders plan to endorse President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore at the same meeting.

<p>
<b>AFL-CIO Cuts $375 Million Credit Card Deal</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As if a 36 percent increase in members' fees was not enough to finance the AFL-CIO's expensive 1996 political agenda, it also was announced in Bal Harbour that the federation had cut a new credit card deal. The AFL-CIO has an "affinity card" with the federation's logo that is marketed to union members by a bank. In return, a portion of the fees paid by union members for credit card use is paid to the federation. Under the terms of the new agreement with Household International, the AFL-CIO will receive at least $375 million in profits over the first five years, with a special $50 million signing bonus payable in the next few months.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the AFL-CIO has attempted to portray this new agreement as good for workers, the bank presumably could offer better terms to union members if the federation were not receiving such large payments. If a bank acting alone diverted credit card profits to other ventures, Sweeney and his allies no doubt would complain of "corporate greed."  When the AFL-CIO does the same thing to advance its own political ambitions, it apparently is virtuous.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the leadership of the AFL-CIO basked in the sun in Bal Harbour, Florida, they decided to impose two costly fee increases on its hardworking rank-and-file members. It is unfortunate that the federation's new leadership has placed such a strong and costly emphasis on partisan political gamesmanship. Just this year, over $75 million will be taken from rank-and-file union workers -- of varying political views -- to support the federation's endorsement of Bill Clinton and its campaign against congressional Republicans. These new union "taxes" will be used, in effect, to oppose real tax relief for all American workers.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used
to subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest
groups. The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward
bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation. Every
American is forced to finance this system that allows well-connected
Washington-based groups to use taxpayer funds to advance political
causes to which many Americans object. Congress can put a stop
to subsidized politicking by refusing to fund the most egregiously
abused programs.
<P>

<P><hr>
<b>Total&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $1.8 billion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, Congress attempted to address this problem by ending
grants to groups that engage in lobbying. Unfortunately, the restriction
Congress approved applies only to one category of lobbying organizations.
Efforts to erect broader restrictions on taxpayer subsidies for
lobbyists, principally the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment,
were stymied. They should continue in 1996.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While broad efforts to end &quot;welfare for lobbyists&quot; continue,
Congress also should identify and eliminate those programs that
serve most often to prop up special interests. The best way to
do this is to shut off the largest spigots of funding for big-government
activist groups. Ten programs stand out. Some have been slated
for reform by one or both houses of Congress, but no changes have
been enacted into law. All deserve to be eliminated outright.
<BR>

<P>
<b>1. AmeriCorps&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $427 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993-1994, <a href="http://www.cns.gov/">AmeriCorps</a> employed about 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot;described as &quot;working all over America, helping people &#173;&#173; person to person.&quot;<sup>2</sup> In reality, a significant number of these
paid volunteers work in federal or state bureaucracies, government-funded
programs, or political action organizations<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, ignoring
the Corporation's mission statement to address the nation's problems
through direct community service, several AmeriCorps programs
have engaged in advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense
of the taxpayers.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Section 132(a)(3) of the National and Community Service Trust
Act of 1993 clearly states that &quot;any approved national service
position provided to an applicant will not be used to perform
service that provides a direct benefit to any... partisan political
organization.... &quot; But in San Francisco, the AmeriCorps &quot;Summer
of Safety&quot; program organized 40 groups to rally against a
&quot;three strikes and you're out&quot; crime bill provision.<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Elsewhere, one of the biggest abusers of AmeriCorps' mission was
a nonprofit group located in Cole, Colorado, which was supposed
to use its volunteers to help people in northeast Denver neighborhoods.
Instead, according to state records, leaders of the Cole Coalition
sent program participants to hand out political fliers directly
attacking a local City Councilman, Hiawatha Davis. &quot;The 'volunteers'
had to draft campaign fliers and distribute them door-to-door
in April and May [1995] when Davis and [Mayor Wellington] Webb
were fighting for re-election.&quot;<sup>5</sup> According to 21-year-old
volunteer Joseph Taylor, &quot;We realized there was something
politically partisan. The more we began to pose a threat to blowing
the whistle, the more they tried to pacify us. They kept saying...
this was a great position we were in, making public officials
accountable for their jobs.&quot;<sup>6</sup> Although the Cole Coalition
was stripped of its funding, the AmeriCorps program lives on &#173;&#173;
as does the potential for abuse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In proposing the AmeriCorps program, President Clinton declared
that &quot;National service will be America at its best &#173;&#173;
building community, offering opportunity, and rewarding responsibility.
National service is a challenge for Americans from every background
and way of life, and it values something far more than money.&quot;<sup>7</sup>
Like many other government programs, however, AmeriCorps has not
lived up to its promise. Subsidizing political activism does not
qualify as responsible behavior. <BR>

<P>
<b>2. Senior Community Service Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) is operated
by the Department of Labor. It provides more than $400 million
in annual funding for senior citizen employment.<sup>8</sup> The stated purpose
of this program, authorized by Title V of the Older Americans
Act of 1965, is &quot;To provide, foster, and promote part-time
work opportunities (usually 20 hours per week) in community service
activities for low income persons who are 55 years of age and
older. To the extent feasible, the program assists and promotes
the transition of program enrollees into unsubsidized employment.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	States, national nonprofits, and territories are eligible to receive
grants. In reality, however, 78 percent (more than $320 million)
of SCSEP grant money is segregated from state funding to subsidize
nine national nonprofit organizations. The <I>Catalog of Federal
Domestic Assistance</I> states explicitly that &quot;The Department
[of Labor] annually renews grant agreements. There are no plans
to add additional organizations.&quot; Moreover, &quot;Awards
are not on a competitive basis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, the FY 1996 House Appropriations Committee report
begins to address this problem. Although the program's funding
was reduced by only $50 million in the House proposal, the report
states that &quot;The Committee has funded the program under the
basic law rather than continuing the past practice of earmarking
78% of the funds for national contractors and 22% for the states.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even under this reform, however, the nine recipient organizations
are not prohibited from receiving funds. They simply are thrown
into the same pot as the states, and federal bureaucrats might
be able to award the grants in a similar fashion. To stop the
potential for abuse, these organizations should be cut off entirely.
<BR>

<P>
<b>3. Legal Services Corporation&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal
Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance
to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie
in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began
making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.<sup>10</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Corporation uses its budget (currently $400 million) to funnel
federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country.
These taxpayer-funded legal groups then engage in political and
lobbying activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal
services needed by poor people. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias.
Its attorneys regularly promote racial preferences and illegal
immigration. Its grantees are sufficiently politicized to become
involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning
on ballot referendum questions. Over the past 30 years, the LSC
has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation,
advocacy, and lobbying, it has helped to generate hundreds of
billions of dollars in increased local, state, and federal welfare
spending and the addition of millions of people to the welfare
rolls<sup>11</sup>. It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in
other states. It even has engaged in actions &#173;&#173; litigating
to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for
example &#173;&#173; that harm the poor. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The LSC clearly has abandoned its mission to such a degree that
no meaningful reform can be enacted. There is only one way to
end this glaring abuse of the taxpayers' funds and trust: abolish
the LSC.<BR>

<P>
<b>4. Title X Family Planning&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $189 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps a more accurate name for these multiple slush funds would
be &quot;Planned Parenthood Planned Giving Programs.&quot; Despite
the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive
to large numbers of Americans, this high-profile political organization
receives a substantial portion of its revenue each year through
government &quot;contributions.&quot; Planned Parenthood and its
affiliates join with a handful of other active organizations in
taking advantage of these costly grant programs. <BR>

<P>
The key components of Title X include:
<P>
<b>Family Planning Services/Umbrella Councils ($183 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Among the organizations funded under this heading are Planned
Parenthood of Wisconsin ($2.6 million), Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota ($2.3 million), the New Jersey Family Planning League
($4.2 million), and the California Family Planning Council ($11.7
million).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These nonprofit groups receive $62.6 million &#173;&#173; one-third
of the total annual allocation. However, much of the remaining
$120.4 million is likely to benefit similar nonprofits. According
to the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>, &quot;Projects
include: (1) A State Health Department which subcontracts to service
providers throughout an entire State; and (2) a service provider
to serve several counties or a smaller geographical area.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Accordingly, many states will subgrant or subcontract with nonprofits
that engage in lobbying all levels of government.<BR>

<P>
<b>Personnel Training ($5 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To provide training
to Title X project staffs; to improve utilization and career development
of paraprofessional and paramedical manpower in family planning
services, particularly in rural areas. &quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The notice in the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>
states that &quot;funds may not be used in programs where abortion
is a method of family planning.&quot; This prohibition notwithstanding,
at least 20 percent of these funds was allocated to Planned Parenthood
chapters and family planning councils that typically deal with
abortion and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<BR>

<P>
<b>Service Delivery Improvement ($500,000)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To promote service
delivery improvement through research studies, and application
of knowledge.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Examples of previous funding include studies of factors influencing
women to discontinue attending family planning clinics and studies
of particular family planning needs of underserved subgroups of
low-income women. In other words, the principal purpose of this
half-million dollar program is to discover why people are not
demanding even more government-subsidized services.<BR>

<P>
<b>5. National Endowment for the Humanities&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $180 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> actively promotes a
liberal political and ideological agenda. In recent years, it
consistently has funded politically correct projects, including
the highly controversial National History Standards that were
denounced by former NEH Chair Lynne Cheney and other serious scholars.
These so-called standards took political correctness to a new
level by ignoring major events in American history that fail to
bolster the liberal academic's world view. Simply put, the recent
work of the NEH has served to undermine support for Western civilization.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant
in the NEH's most prominent current project, the so-called <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/documents/natcon.html">National Conversation</a>. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council
on Aging, American Bar Association, and American Library Association,
none of which is any stranger to government grants. Once again,
the &quot;Beltway Bandits&quot; have managed to manipulate the
bureaucracy to tap the public purse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In creating the National Conversation, NEH Chairman Sheldon Hackney
stated that he sought &quot;a national conversation open to all
Americans, a conversation in which all voices are heard in which
we grapple seriously with the meaning of American pluralism.&quot;
Apparently, Hackney believes that meaningful public dialogue is
possible only if the government intervenes and pays for it to
happen, and that the increasing number of Americans participating
in talk radio &#173;&#173; a largely conservative phenomenon &#173;&#173;
are not &quot;serious.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact of the matter is that these so-called conversations are
simply a high-profile tool to promote a politically correct agenda.
The NEH describes the National Council on the Aging's grant, for
example, as directed partly toward financing &quot;short film
clips [that] will serve as a catalyst for discussion on topics
such as... crossing ethnic boundaries, and practicing politics.&quot;<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Scattered throughout NEH documents are references to ethnic diversity
and &quot;equality and commonality.&quot; For example, the description
of the grant to the American Bar Association states that its purpose
is to foster<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
more than one hundred nationwide conversations using legal cases
to explore the meaning of &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; (out of
many, one) through five topics: race, gender, affirmative action,
and socioeconomic equality; the place of religion and religious
expression in the &quot;public square&quot;; pluralism in public
schools and curriculums; immigration and American identity; and
controversial ideas and speech in a diverse society.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The effect of establishing &quot;discourse&quot; based on such
an agenda inevitably is to encourage the perpetuation of a liberal
hegemony over American political life.<BR>

<P>
<b>6. Market Promotion Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $75 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of the Market Promotion Program (MPP) is &quot;to
encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial
export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities through cost-share
assistance to eligible trade organizations that implement a foreign
market development program.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The funds from the MPP go to support some of the largest and most
vocal special interests in the country. In 1995, for example,
MPP grantees opposed bipartisan efforts to reform farm subsidies.
They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate this
program outright, and they also fought reforms designed to decrease
taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large corporate farms.
Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were subsidized
unwittingly by the American taxpayer.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The few grantees under the Market Promotion Program that are not
special-interest associations are large, profitable corporations
benefiting from a slush fund that moonlights as corporate welfare.
<BR>

<P>
<b>7. Senior Environmental Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $45 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Environmental Employment Program (SEE) purports to
&quot;use the talents of Americans 55 years of age or older [to]
provide technical assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental
agencies for projects of pollution prevention, abatement and control.&quot;
Only private, nonprofit organizations designated by the Secretary
of Labor and on the &quot;approved list&quot; pursuant to Title
V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 may receive funding. The
approvals read like a laundry list of special-interest groups.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The annual appropriation for SEE is $45 million, spread out over
approximately 250 grants per year. No matching funds are required.
Funded projects often have provided senior citizens to EPA for
&quot;research and general administrative and clerical tasks,&quot;
as well as for surveys and monitoring projects.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides a dual benefit to the promoters of big government
and increased regulation: Numerous senior citizen groups receive
subsidies for their lobbying and political activity, and the EPA
benefits from additional troops to enforce its regulatory agenda.
According to the Federal Assistance Awards Database System, virtually
every regional EPA office and every division within the agency's
headquarters receives support from these grants. This permits
the agency to evade existing employment caps &#173;&#173; without
anyone knowing.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For example, internal EPA documents obtained by the Heritage Foundation
indicate that in March 1995, the agency's Region 10 offices in
Seattle had more than 50 employees from special-interest groups
on staff, including seven from the National Council of Senior
Citizens and six from the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP). There is every reason to believe similar situations exist
in every other regional office, as well as at EPA headquarters
in Washington.<BR>

<P>
<b>8. Superfund Worker Training Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $32 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides nothing short of direct payoffs to unions
which, in turn, work with their allies in the environmental movement.
Authorized by the Superfund law, these grants purport to provide
&quot;practical health and safety training programs [for those]
who are engaged in activities related to hazardous materials.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much like its namesake, however, the Superfund Worker Training
program is a failure. Despite the billions of dollars spent on
Superfund itself, less than one-quarter of the most dangerous
toxic waste sites have been cleaned up. Why, then, train people
in failure? Millions of dollars are wasted preparing people to
clean up waste sites that never get cleaned up.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nature of this program is demonstrated by its blatantly political
selection of grantees, which include many of the nation's most
powerful labor unions. (A selection of recent beneficiaries can
be found in the <a href="#appen">appendix</a> to this paper.) The Department is conducting
a program evaluation that should be ready sometime this spring.
It is hoped that this evaluation finally will note the potential
pitfalls of providing more than $25 million of $32 million in
total annual funding to organized labor.<BR>

<b>9. HHS Discretionary Aging Projects&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $26 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program, administered by the Administration on Aging, is
one of three programs authorized under the Older Americans Act
that serve to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest
groups, such as the 96 percent federally funded National Council
of Senior Citizens. The stated purpose of the Discretionary Aging
Projects program is &quot;to provide adequately trained personnel
in the field of aging, improve knowledge of the problems and needs
of the elderly, and to demonstrate better ways of improving the
quality of life for the elderly.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	However benign its stated purpose, most of this program's funds
flow to organizations that promote government interventionism.
Grantees in 1994 included some of the major groups that opposed
efforts to reform Medicare, including the American Association
of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Other grantees (like the
Child Welfare League of America) stand out not simply for their
political advocacy activities, but also because there is no clear
relationship between their missions and the field of aging.<BR>

<P>
<b>10. Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$25 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance
Program (TIIAP) is operated by the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a> (NTIA) in the U.S. Department of
Commerce and is a key element of Vice President Al Gore's attempt
to impose central planning on the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;
The program gave out $24.4 million in FY 1994 and was slated to
dole out $36 million in 1995. In 1994, 92 grants were made. Last
year, 120 subsidies were given out to help numerous liberal groups
post propaganda on the information superhighway.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to NTIA documents, in 1994, Planned Parenthood Federation
of America received $300,000 to set up a &quot;nationwide on-line
information system&quot; for itself and all 164 of its affiliates.
Likewise, in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet
received funding to &quot;establish a network of regional field
representatives&quot; and &quot;demonstrate a model for building
a national grassroots information system,&quot; among other things.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding
in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, lead lobbyists for
Hillary Clinton's failed attempt at a government takeover of the
U.S. health care system; ACORN, which led noisy demonstrations
in Congress last year; the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation;
and Citizens Fund, an affiliate of Citizen Action, an aggressive
grassroots lobbying organization. While these groups did not receive
funding last year, they clearly are interested in the program
and no doubt will seek subsidies in the future.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most egregious abuse of the TIIAP program was discovered last
fall. A $200,000 grant was provided to an online bulletin board
called <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet</a> to establish a training center and recruit additional
advocacy organizations to its ranks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; An examination of postings on the <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet Internet site</a>, makes
it clear that the group's principal purpose is political advocacy.
The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform
and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment to end taxpayer-subsidized
political corruption, among other issues. HandsNet offers three
key information services: Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest that
summarizes the Alerts, and daily updates on key issues. Members
of HandsNet include such liberal special interests as the Children's
Defense Fund, the Alliance for Justice, OMB Watch, and Families
USA.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Government funding of political activism is indefensible. Yet
hundreds of groups now receive government grants which are used,
and used effectively, to subsidize their political activities.
Americans deserve better treatment of their hard-earned tax dollars.
Funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests
to subsidize political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse
of the public's money and the public trust.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress should continue to consider ending all government grants.
But in the meantime, it can reduce government-subsidized politicking
significantly by eliminating funding for those programs most abused
by political activists.<BR>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The following tables list some of the recent grantees under some
of the programs noted in this paper. The dollar amounts represent
funding between July 1993 and June 1994 and should not be considered
complete. Identification numbers shown correspond with those in

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the data shown are correct, actual amounts may well be larger

or political advocacy, but are shown to illustrate the types of

<h3>OREGON ELECTION PREVIEWS AFL-CIO'S 1996 POLITICAL PLANS</h3>

"Union leaders this week said  the election push was a way the new leadership could quickly 
demonstrate results for both the public and the AFL-CIO's member unions."
<P>
-- <i>The Washington Post</i>, January 25, 1996<sup> 1</sup>
<p>
"The Oregon race provides a vital first chapter in a new textbook on politics we're going to write 
this year, as we  build the core of a powerful new grassroots movement."
<P>
  -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, January 31, 1996<sup>2 </sup>
<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; After decades of declining political influence, labor 
unions have pledged to multiply their election efforts this year with a $35 million war chest. The 
first real test of organized labor's new activism -- Oregon's special election for a United States 
Senate seat -- resulted in a narrow victory for the candidate heavily backed by big labor. Similar 
efforts can be expected in numerous House and Senate races this fall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When AFL-CIO President John Sweeney swept into 
leadership of the nation's largest labor federation last fall, he did so on an agenda of action, 
pledging more active organization drives to help increase the union rolls in America and promising 
vocal political campaigns to promote the union's movement's liberal agenda. Every indication was 
that the AFL-CIO would be a major force in 1996.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Shortly after Sweeney's election, voters went to the polls 
in a few political contests around the country. These November 1995 contests did yet not have the 
full Sweeney imprint (he had been in office only for a few weeks), but organized labor nonetheless 
managed to demonstrate a significant presence in several states. In fact, after the elections, Sweeney 
attempted to take credit for the supposed public turn to the left he claimed had occurred.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earlier this year, the AFL-CIO had its first test for 1996. 
In the special election to fill the seat of former Oregon Republican Senator Bob Packwood, big 
labor lined its horses up behind Democratic Congressman Ron Wyden. With substantial backing 
from organized labor, Wyden managed to beat Republican Gordon Smith narrowly in a mail-in 
election.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As this pivotal election year proceeds, the AFL-CIO and 
other labor organizations will continue to invest heavily in campaign activity. Unfortunately, much 
of this politicking will be funded through mandatory worker dues, and much is unreported and 
unregulated by federal election laws. Direct PAC donations and independent expenditure 
campaigns on behalf of specific candidates represent only a portion of organized labor's political 
activities. It behooves Members of Congress to pay careful attention to these activities. Hard-
working union members should not be compelled to surrender their own pay, earned by their own 
sweat and toil, to finance political activity to which they may well object.
<p>
<b>THE PRELUDE:  KENTUCKY AND MISSISSIPPI '95</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO's claim to victory in 1995 lies in the 
Kentucky governor's race between Paul Patton (D) and Larry Forgy (R). The national federation's 
propaganda organ, the <i>AFL-CIO News</i>, bragged that "even Forgy, in a call to the Louisville 
Courier-Journal, conceded that labor had made the difference, not only in heavily unionized 
counties but in helping turn out the African-American vote through the A. Phillip Randolph 
Institute."<sup>3 </sup>  (The A. Phillip Randolph Institute is an arm of the AFL-CIO dedicated to 
reaching out to African-American unionists.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; According to the <i>News</i>, 83,000 phone calls and 
158,000 pieces of mail led labor's efforts. The same report went on to disclose that 7 federation 
employees joined 9 activists from other labor unions to put a significant political operation in place 
on the ground in Kentucky, and that "two members of the Electrical Workers and CWA 
[Communication Workers of America] also were working with the [A. Phillip Randolph Institute]."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In the end, Patton defeated Forgy by a slim 51-49 margin.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The story in Mississippi was similar, except for the 
outcome. Incumbent Republican Governor Kirk Fordice was pitted against Democrat Dick Molpus. 
The AFL-CIO and other labor groups committed 3 full-time staff and 10 part-time workers to the 
race. The <i>AFL-CIO News</i> reports that the unions dropped 44,000 pieces of mail and placed 
20,000 phone calls in an effort to promote Molpus. While organized labor's contribution may have 
helped narrow what appeared to be a blowout, the end result was that Fordice won with 55 percent 
of the vote.
<p>
<b>THE OPENING SALVO:  OREGON '96</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The first meaningful test of organized labor's muscle in 
the new year has occurred over the past few weeks in Oregon, where voters were inundated with 
aggressive tactics by big labor to help influence the outcome of the special election. According to 
AFL-CIO documents and press reports, 37 union activists (12 from the AFL-CIO alone) worked 
full-time to elect a Democratic Senator<sup>4 </sup>  --"an unusually large number of political 
operatives" from unions, according to <i>The Washington Post</i>.<sup> 5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Steve Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director, 
bragged that "We're mailing endorsement pieces to 75,000 union members and persuasion pieces to 
an estimated 40,000."  The AFL-CIO newsletter noted that "another 100,000 fliers comparing the 
candidates' records are being produced, and phone banks have been set up across the state."   
Shortly after the election was complete, AFL-CIO President Sweeney announced that the union had 
made more than 230,000 phone calls and sent over 350,000 pieces of mail.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining 
forces with at least 11 individual unions, it was able to mount a considerable presence in this one 
targeted race. Among the other participants were the American Federation of Teachers, American 
Federation of Government Employees, National Association of Letter Carriers, and International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters. The considerable firepower mustered by these organizations resulted in 
more than $183,000 in political action committee donations to the Democratic candidate. Not one 
penny of union money went to Republican Gordon Smith.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of course, impact is not measured in direct PAC spending 
alone. Phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and grassroots organizing are all significant 
activities that labor used in Oregon and can be expected to use throughout this year to promote 
favored political candidates. Many of these activities can be funded out of forced dues. In Oregon, 
these efforts were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than direct, reported expenditures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union tactics played a significant role in the Oregon 
election. In fact, organized labor's activities themselves came under scrutiny by the media and the 
voters. The Teamsters were heavily criticized for an ad blaming the death of a teenage worker on 
the Republican candidate's business. Even the beneficiary of the Teamsters efforts, Ron Wyden, 
was forced to issue a public statement disavowing the ad and encouraging the union to pull it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union politics are nothing new. There is no question that 
organized labor has a right to participate in the electoral process. Unfortunately, in many states like 
Oregon, unions rely on coerced funding -- in the form of mandatory union dues -- to finance many 
of their political activities. Therefore, every hard-working union member in Oregon supported the 
candidacy of Ron Wyden with his sweat and toil -- even if he cast his vote against Wyden.
<p>
<b>THE ROAD AHEAD:  ELECTION '96</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney decided that his new 
leadership team must make its mark quickly. They have decided that their goal of organizing more 
than a million workers is too ambitious to be completed in the near term, and that they therefore 
should devote much of their resources to political action for a quick score.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Plan. In keeping with that decision, the labor 
federation recently announced its intent to spend $35 million on election activities this year --as 
much as 7 times the normal budget and nearly two-thirds of the cost of a presidential general 
election campaign. This allocation will support:
<p><ul>
<li>Targeting 75 House districts, with 1-4 full-time staff in each;
<p>
<li>Creating a base of at least 100 activists (volunteers and paid) in every congressional district;
<p>
<li>Hiring state field directors in 36-40 states;
<p>
<li>Placing 2,500 workers in the field for the final October/November get-out-the-vote efforts;
<p>
<li>Reassigning 12-15 organizers and adding them to the 16-member political field staff, for a total 
of 31 traveling political operatives; and
<p>
<li>Financing a "massive media fund" to deliver the union's political messages.<sup> 6</sup>
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Rosenthal, even before the election results were known, 
indicated what labor's post-election response would be. He told the <i>Washington Post</i> that 
"The election in Oregon stands by itself" but that "At the same time, it's a national election, and we 
hope it will be similar to Harris Wofford's victory in 1991, and could well set the tone for 
1996."<sup>7 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Warming up for November. The 1996 campaign is 
already underway in places other than Oregon. Some 400 unionists, under the banner of the AFL-
CIO's Stand Up campaign, protested outside a recent gathering of freshman Republicans in 
Baltimore, Maryland. While the protesters condemned all of the freshmen, a special target was 
Representative Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), who represents a nearby congressional district. Their signs 
carried messages urging voters to make Ehrlich a one-term Congressman. Similar treatment can be 
expected by 74 other House members who have been placed on the AFL-CIO's national hit list.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO's renewed focus on politics is clearly 
demonstrated by the fact that the organization's "Union Summer" campaign, which will use 1,000 
or more college students and entry-level workers to help organize unions in non-union workplaces, 
will be diverted to politics in the fall. Originally, it appeared that this organizing campaign would 
be the crown jewel for the new leadership, but they have been forced to shift their attention to a 
playing field on which they believe they can win:  the 1996 elections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; AFL-CIO Leadership "Impressed" with Union-Led 
Turmoil in France. Unfortunately, it appears that Sweeney and his new team at the AFL-CIO 
envision a much more aggressive and confrontational plan than previous union leaders have 
pursued. In a speech late last year before the Association for a Better New York, Sweeney provided 
the following insight into his thinking:
<p><blockquote>
	I was in Europe last week, traveling with President Clinton, and I couldn't help but 
be impressed with what is going on in France. In this country, when we're faced 
with cuts in vital services that benefit workers and the poor, we shut down a few 
parts of the government. In France, the workers shut down the country -- even 
though only 8 percent of the work force is organized!<sup> 8</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; While Sweeney expressed his hope that such a situation 
would not be necessary in the United States, even suggesting the idea is shameful. The chaos and 
violence of the national shutdown caused by French unions would not likely be admired by many 
Americans but appears to be a possible harbinger of the AFL-CIO's intentions.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Compelling Union Workers to Pay for Politics. The new 
AFL-CIO leadership has implicitly acknowledged their reliance on forced union membership and 
compulsory dues to promote their agenda. One of the resolutions proposed by the Sweeney slate at 
last year's convention lamented:
<p><blockquote>
	The November 1994 elections capped a decades-long decline in labor's political 
influence, a trend closely connected to the decline in union density. This erosion 
also reflects labor's regional weaknesses, the seeds of which were planted decades 
ago by our failure to make adequate in-roads in right-to-work states.<sup>9 </sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By admitting a link between political weakness and 
voluntary fundraising, Sweeney's leadership is conceding that organized labor's strength lies where 
workers are compelled to pay union dues as a condition of employment.
<p>
<b>COERCED AND HIDDEN FUNDING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Many of the AFL-CIO's political activities, like those of 
the federation's member unions, are financed not through voluntary PAC contributions by 
members, but by forced dues. Those activities that are issue-oriented (like television ads against 
Medicare reform, for example) often are paid for with these coerced dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As Members of Congress consider campaign finance 
reform legislation, they should ask whether it is fair to force every union member to pay for the 
ideological warfare of union officials. Corporations may not provide this sort of direct candidate 
support, and neither should their labor counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Campaign finance reform should not be entered into 
lightly. Meaningful reform must level the playing field and ensure that only voluntary contributions 
are used for politics. As the election season heats up, Members of Congress should note the 
activities of labor unions and remember where the money comes from.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO has indicated clearly that aggressive 
political activities by labor unions --paid for on the backs of the union rank and file -- will continue 
throughout this high-stakes election year. Organized labor's renewed political activism promises to 
be a major factor in the 1996 elections. While unions should be as free as other organizations to 
pursue their political goals, the coercive nature of union funding, and the regulatory advantages 
unions enjoy, are unjust and unfair.

<a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The federal government subsidizes lobbying by tax-exempt and other 
organizations through grants and contracts to advocacy groups.  Each year, the 
American taxpayers provide more than $39 billion in grants to organizations 
which may use the money to advance their political agendas.
<p>
Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by ideological scope.  
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use taxpayers funds to 
promote their ideas and positions.  Almost every interest in America - from 
agriculture to zoology - has one or more organizations receiving government 
funding.  Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar 
Association, which received $2.2 million.   Over the past forty years, Congress 
has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-
preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political 
advocacy.  The days of big city political machines disbursing patronage may be 
coming to an end, but the disbursement of financial dividends to political friends 
is a prominent feature of the federal budget.  As Heritage Foundation Senior 
Fellow <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/breger.htm">Marshall Breger</a> has written:
<p>
<blockquote><Font Size="-1">Lacking the imprimatur of democratic consent, government subsidy of private advocacy can be seen for what it is - the public patronage of selected political beliefs.  That these advocacy subsidies are rarely made openly but are often disguised through grants and contracts for legitimate public functions merely underscores the dangers inherent in a system of expansive government subsidy.(1) </font></blockquote>
<p>
Clearly, the right to petition government to redress grievances should not 
be infringed.  Individuals and organizations using funds from the private sector 
should be encouraged to engage in the legislative and political process. It is an 
entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of the federal 
government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or 
other government entities.  It is every bit as unjust to force liberal taxpayers to 
fund organizations on the right as it is to force conservative taxpayers to finance 
organizations on the left.  The fundamental principle is that it should be 
anathema to force taxpayers to underwrite advocacy with which they disagree.           
<p>	
Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong - fiscally, morally, 
and logically.  It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities 
that provide no meaningful return to the American people.  It is morally wrong 
for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the 
advocacy activities of an elite few.  And it is logically wrong for the government 
to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. 
The reasons are summarized aptly by George Mason University professor James 
T. Bennett and Loyola College professor Thomas J. DiLorenzo in their 
comprehensive study, <i>Destroying Democracy</i>:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>A large number of  individuals with strong views can express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that promotes that issue.  With tax-funded politics, however, a small number of zealots with access to the public purse can obtain resources from government to advance its views even though few 
individuals in society share the groups philosophy.  Whenever government funds any political advocacy group, it effectively penalizes those groups that advocate opposing public policies and provides a distinct advantage to the group or groups that it favors in the clash of ideas.(2) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="fund"><h4>THE FUNDING OF FACTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of factions in a republic.  
James Madison wrote in <i>Federalist</i> Number 10 that "Among the numerous 
advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more 
accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of 
faction."  Madison defined faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting 
to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some 
common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, 
or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community."
<p>
What the Founding Fathers referred to as factions we now call special 
interests.   Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal government today 
subsidizes them.  This distorts the political process by favoring one faction over 
another and by nourishing a network of special interests - a welfare-industrial 
complex - with a direct self-interest in the growth of the welfare state.  The 
financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount funneled to these 
organizations.  Each one not only lobbies for its contract or grant, but also 
advocates for bigger, more expensive social welfare programs, further 
complicating efforts to put the nations fiscal house in order.  Moreover, while 
these organizations often claim that the money they receive helps the less 
fortunate, the reality is that it bolsters their own political power, perks, and 
prestige. 
<p>
The advocacy network and its leaders contribute to what author James Payne 
has referred to as a "culture of spending" in Washington which makes it 
extremely difficult to trim government programs: "Leaders of such federally 
dependent interest groups  should not be seen as representing independent 
citizen opinion.  They are quasi-governmental officials with a vested interest in 
the spending programs that benefit their organizations."(3)
<p>
Not every dollar given to an advocacy group goes directly to political 
advocacy activities.  However, federal dollars are fungible.  Every federal dollar 
frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy 
activities.  Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger 
force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private 
contributions.  For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 
percent of its funding from the federal government.

The NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds.  
Here are just a few other examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The AFL-CIO benefited from more than $2,000,000 between July 1993 and 
June 1994.  According to the <i>AFL-CIO News Online</i>, the AFL-CIO used the 
Memorial Day recess to increase pressure on Members of Congress with its 
"Stand UP" campaign: 
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>In those [5 targeted] districts, the AFL-CIO provided radio ads and coordinators to work with local union officials and legislative action committees.  Other activity included direct mail, jobsite leafleting, phone call drives using the AFL-CIOs toll-free hotline, petition drives, town meeting attendance, and letters and columns submitted to local newspapers.(4) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Recently, the Service Employees International Union produced a newspaper 
advertisement opposing tax cuts and efforts in Congress to slow the growth 
of welfare and Medicare.  SEIU claims Congress is attempting to "loot" 
welfare programs and "steal" from low-income home-energy assistance to 
help finance "corporate special interests." The ad lamented the impact on 
Fannie Johnson and her family in Ohio.(5)  This labor special interest benefited 
from $137,000 in taxpayer funding in 1993 (for an "anti-discrimination public 
education campaign").  Terminating it would eliminate the tax burden of 
nearly 30 families just like Ms. Johnsons in Ohio.
<p>
<li>Families USA - a driving force behind the Clinton big-government health 
care plan, including the failed last-ditch attempt to revive it last summer 
through a nationwide bus tour(6) - received $250,000 from the taxpayers 
between July 1993 and June 1994.
<p>
<li>The Child Welfare League of America received more than $250,000 in federal 
funding, then turned around and launched an ad campaign to increase 
welfare spending.  The League ran an advertisement opposing the Contract 
With Americas welfare reform bill which charged that "More children will be 
killed.  More children will be raped."(7)
<p>
<li>The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 
million from the federal government in FY 1994 - 22 percent of its budget.  
In the same year, the Trust "launched a lobbying campaign against the 
Disney project" in Northern Virginia.(8)   In 1993, it "lobbi[ed] Congress to 
expand the historic rehabilitation tax credit."(9)  The groups president, Walter 
Mondale's former chief of staff Richard Moe, said the full credit would cost 
"$1.4 billion over five years."(10)
<p>
<li>The American Nurses Association received nearly $1 million between July 
1993 and June 1994 from the U.S. taxpayers.  In 1994, the ANA endorsed the 
Gephardt health care plan and actively lobbied for it.  According to the 
unions own press release announcing this endorsement, "The American 
Nurses Association is the only full-service professional organization 
representing the nations 2.2 million Registered Nurses through its 53 
constituent associations.  ANA advances the nursing profession by ... 
lobbying Congress and regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting 
nurses and the public."(11)  The <i>Political Finance and Lobby Reporter</i> revealed on 
May 12, 1995, that two new ANA lobbyists had registered.
<p>
<li>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which 
received nearly $150,000 in the most recent grant reporting period, 
denounced the House welfare plan, saying it "will drive more families into 
poverty and turns its back on hardworking Americans who fall on bad times.  
This is the small print in their evil Contract on America."  AFSCME President 
Gerald McEntee went on to say that "AFSCME will continue to fight for real 
welfare reform that includes jobs at decent wages, child care, health care and 
education and training."(12)
</ul>
<p>
Actually, however, government funding of advocacy organizations can hurt 
their cause.  Well-grounded public policy institutions prosper from strong 
grassroots support backed by individual financial contributions.  Much like a 
profitable company, they can measure support by looking at how many people 
were willing to open their checkbooks for the cause:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>The plain fact is that political advocacy groups will not flourish on the basis of government subsidy.  Rather they will prosper only insofar as they develop financial roots in the polity.  Reliance on the government trough is no sign of the commitment of your adherents to your cause.(13) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="prob"><h4>NOT A NEW PROBLEM</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federally funded advocacy is not a new problem.  Congress recognized 
the potential for abuse more than 75 years ago when it passed a law prohibiting 
the use of federal funds for political advocacy.  Unfortunately, the prohibition 
was too vague, too lenient, and too weakly enforced.  Put simply, auditing of 
federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed 
to root out abuse.
<p>
The scope of the problem can be seen by examining the <i>Catalog of Federal 
Domestic Assistance</i>, published every six months by the federal government.  It 
details nearly every federal program from which eligible individuals, 
organizations, and governments can receive tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer 
funding.
<p>
For years, congressional offices have worked with constituents to help 
them find federal grants, in the process becoming very familiar with the <i>Catalog </i>
as a guide to sources.  But very few congressional staff employees have been 
aware of abuses in the grants process.  These abuses are long-standing. In 
testimony before the House Committee on Government Operations in 1983, 
Joseph Wright of the Office of Management and Budget noted that the General 
Accounting Office had found problems as far back as 1948.(14)
<p>
In the early years of the Reagan Administration, the OMB attempted to 
revise OMB Circular A-122 (originally issued in the final year of the Carter 
Administration) to redefine limits on "allowable costs" by federal grantees.  The 
revision, first released in January 1983, was widely criticized as overly broad, 
excessively burdensome, and unenforceable.
<p>
One of the focal points of the initial debates was the fact that the original 
OMB proposal apparently would have disallowed the use of any equipment, 
personnel, or office space for both federal grant and political advocacy purposes 
if at least 5 percent of the organizations resources was used for lobbying.  For 
example, a copy machine could not be used to produce flyers for a rally on 
Capitol Hill if it was paid for - in whole or in part - by taxpayer funds.  Many 
nonprofits objected to such clear separation between federal funding and 
political advocacy.
<p>
Months later, OMB Director David Stockman and General Counsel 
Michael Horowitz withdrew the original proposal and released a new draft with 
a more narrow definition of prohibited activities.  This watered-down version no 
longer drew a clear line between allowable and unallowable costs.  Instead, it 
specified a few examples of prohibited behavior, including a prohibition on 
reimbursement for conferences used in "substantial" part to promote lobbying 
activities.
<p>
Unfortunately, this effort to appease federally funded nonprofits and quell 
opposition in Congress was futile.  Because Congress signaled its clear 
opposition to working with the Reagan Administration to curb federally funded 
lobbying activities, despite the fact that all parties acknowledged such behavior 
was inappropriate, A-122 failed to improve substantially the restrictions on 
lobbyists billing Uncle Sam for their activities.
<p>
<a name="proh"><h4>EXISTING PROHIBITIONS ARENT WORKING</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federal law prohibits the use of federal funds for lobbying (18 U.S.C. 
Section 1913).  However, there is no clear set of guidelines as to specific 
prohibited practices.  In addition, numerous appropriations riders have been 
offered and approved in the past in an effort to curb federally subsidized 
lobbying.  The purpose of the Reagan Administrations attempt to create a more 
stringent version of OMB Circular A-122 was to tighten the gaping loopholes in 
existing law and to implement Congresss intent in passing lobbying prohibitions.
<p>
Circular A-122 drew on several distinct concepts to frame the new guidelines.  
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Taxpayers are not obliged to fund advocacy they oppose.</b>  The 
Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that taxpayers are not required, directly 
or indirectly, "to contribute to the support of an ideological cause 
[they] may oppose."  (<i>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</i>)
<p>
<li><b>Freedom of speech does not depend on federal funding.</b>  In 1983, the 
Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the federal government "is not 
required by the First Amendment to subsidize lobbying .... We again 
reject the notion that First Amendment rights are somehow not fully 
realized unless they are subsidized by the State."  (<i>Regan v. Taxation 
with Representation</i>)
<p>
<li><b>The Internal Revenue Code does not alleviate the problem.</b>  The 
notice of the request for public comment on the second revision of A-
122 notes that current IRS rules threaten tax-preferred organizations 
only if they exceed defined limits on lobbying.  However, the limits are 
not tied in any way to the receipt of federal funds, leading to many of 
the same problems from which the 1919 law prohibiting federally 
funded lobbying suffers.
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, the firestorm created by the first proposed revision of A-
122 led to a second draft that watered down the tough initial provisions and 
failed to solve the problems outlined by the Administration in presenting its 
proposals.  The notice for public comment on the second proposal stated that its 
"purpose [was] assuring compliance with a myriad of statuory provisions 
mandating that no federal funds be used for lobbying purposes, and to comply, 
in balanced fashion, with fundamental First Amendment imperatives."  Despite 
the best of intentions, the revised A-122 did not meet these goals.
<p>
A particularly serious provision of the second revision was its 
enforcement mechanism.  A popular maxim in the 1980s was "trust but verify."  
OMB Circular A-122 relied on trust alone:  
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[T]he federal government will rely upon [the nonprofit employees] good faith certification of lobbying time below 25% .... Under the proposal, the absence of time logs or similar records not kept pursuant to grantee or contractor discretion will no longer serve as a basis of contesting or disallowing claims for indirect cost employees.</Font></blockquote>
<p>
In essence, this lack of verification of time spent on lobbying activities 
permits the individual to state that he is complying with the law even if that is 
not the case.  This is worse than the fox guarding the henhouse.  If a nonprofit is 
willing to violate the restrictions on advocacy, surely it will have no qualms 
about certifying it is in compliance with the law.
<p>
<a name="rest"><h4>TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS NEEDED</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Tougher laws are needed to prevent the abuse of taxpayers funds by 
federal grantees.  There is no excuse for compelling John Q. Public to support 
political advocacy that he opposes.  It is fiscally irresponsible and morally 
indefensible. 
<p>
The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to 
curb current abuses:
<ul>
<li><b>Truth in Testimony.</b>  Witnesses testifying before Congress should be 
required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they 
receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount.  
This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate 
light.
<p>
<li><b>No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</b>  No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental 
lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status.
<p>
<li><b>No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</b>  No recipient of federal funds should be 
permitted to maintain organizational ties to any entity that engages in 
lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees should be treated as if they 
received the funds directly from the federal government.  Independent 
Sector, an organization representing hundreds of nonprofit advocacy 
groups, unwittingly indicated the need for this in a recent report: 
"Although the non-profit organization received a check from the local 
government, the local government may have received some or all of its 
funding for this project from a Federal Community Development 
Block Grant (CDBG)."(15)
<p>
<li><b>Meaningful Auditing.</b>  The Inspectors General of the various federal 
departments and agencies must investigate more thoroughly any 
abuses of current law, as well as new laws passed by the Congress.  
<p>
<li><b>Tough Penalties.</b>  The consequences for violating the prohibition on 
federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage 
organizations from violating the standards.  Under no circumstances 
should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the 
prohibitions receive further federal funding.
</ul>
<p>
Representative Robert K. Dornan (R-CA) has introduced H. R. 1130, the 
Integrity in Government Act, which would prohibit a recipient or paid 
representative of any federal award, grant, or contract from lobbying in the 
following circumstances:
</wl>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In favor of continuing the award, grant, or contract;
<li>In favor of the actual program under which the funds were disbursed;
<li>In favor of any other program within the broad department or agency; 
and
<li>In favor of continued department or agency funding.
</ul>
<p>
The Dornan legislation also prohibits tax-exempt lobbying organizations from 
receiving federal funds.  Representatives Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), Ernest Istook (R-
OK), and David McIntosh (R-IN) also are working on legislation to remedy this 
problem.
<p>
It is difficult to craft legislation that satisfactorily defines prohibited 
activities.  Moreover, any bill designed to redress these abuses must prevent 
organizations from simply establishing separate bank accounts and separate 
names.  To be effective, there must be a definite and complete physical 
separation between all federally and privately funded resources.
<p>
<a name="concl"><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy represents pure fiscal folly and 
moral injustice.  No hard-working American should be compelled to finance 
lobbying activities with which he disagrees.  The Founding Fathers would be 
appalled at current federal grantmaking.  Thirteen years ago, <i>The Washington Post</i> 
editorialized:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[W]e agree that there is something disturbing about organizations that strongly advocate positions many sensible people find politically or morally repugnant, acting at the same time as administrators of government programs.  It is easy to believe that the advocacy groups employees will sometimes proselytize the 
programs beneficiaries in ways we would consider inappropriate (though not unheard of) for a civil servant.  Advocacy organizations might also want to ask themselves whether they risk compromising their own purposes by accepting government money, and whether they want to assume the inevitable risk that it might be withdrawn suddenly for legitimate political reasons.(16)</Font></blockquote>
<p>
Abuse of federal grant funds must be stopped.  Tougher restrictions are 
needed to prevent lobbying organizations from obtaining some or most of their 
revenue from the American taxpayers.  Auditing and investigation of federal 
grantees by the Executive Branch must be strengthened.  However, a danger 
always exists that as long as government funds go to advocacy organizations, the 
"wall of separation" will be porous.  Moreover, the less fortunate would be 
assisted more directly by eliminating the middleman who "does well by doing 
good."
<p>
Without restoring integrity to government by ending federally funded 
lobbying, Congress and the President will continue to squander millions of 
taxpayer dollars each year.  Political patronage should have no place in the 
federal budget.

<title>The Chemical Weapons Convention: Unverifiable, Unenforceable, and a Burden to Business - Heritage</title>

<h3>THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION:
UNVERIFIABLE, UNENFORCEABLE, AND A BURDEN TO BUSINESS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>

<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 460<br>
September 12, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Later this week, the United States Senate will vote on ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC is a multilateral treaty that would bar the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons by the countries that ratify it.  Given its sweeping provisions, the ratification of the CWC carries important implications for U.S. policies on  arms control, non-proliferation, defense, regulation, and above all, national security.  As a result, Senators need to consider the CWC carefully and not assume that it deserves support merely because it professes to outlaw chemical weapons.  In fact, the CWC will fail to achieve its stated goal of a global ban on chemical weapons.  Moreover, the CWC will make America more vulnerable to chemical weapon attack in the future while imposing an unwarranted and costly burden on American business. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	If ratified, the Chemical Weapons Convention would:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Increase the risk of chemical weapons being used.</b>  By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the CWC may increase the likelihood that chemical weapons would be used.  The experience of World War II shows that an aggressor possessing chemical weapons will hesitate to use them to attack a country that also possesses such weapons. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, as required by the CWC, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage over the U.S. and other countries that have banned them. This military advantage increases the likelihood that chemical weapons could be used against the U.S.
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unverifiable.</b> Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the CWC cannot be adequately verified.  At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey warned that "the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unenforceable.</b>  Violations of the CWC are likely to go unpunished. If a violation were to occur, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.  But the five permanent members of the Security Council can veto any enforcement resolution lodged against them or their friends.  China and Russia, for example, can simply veto resolutions imposing sanctions on them if they disagree with other Security Council members.
 <p>
 <li><b> Impose a heavy regulatory burden on U.S. businesses.</b>  There are over 7,700 production facilities in the U.S. that may be subject to CWC-related reporting and inspection requirements.  The direct cost to business could be as high as $200 million annually, while indirect costs could run into billions of dollars a year.
 <p>
<li><b> Increase the risk of proliferation of chemical weapons.</b>  Article XI of the CWC requires cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of chemicals.  In many respects, this provision resembles the 1950s Atoms for Peace arrangement to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear power.  This is the approach to arms control and trade that has been used to justify Russia's sale of nuclear reactors to Iran. The last thing the world needs is a "Poison for Peace" program that helps spread chemical weapons around the world, as the Atoms for Peace did for nuclear reactors to Iran and North Korea.
<p>
 The chief lobbying group for the chemical industry, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), supports ratification of the CWC, and the prospect for increased sales of dangerous chemicals to countries like Iran may be the reason why. CMA member companies that produce and export chemicals would be subject to stricter limits on exports if the U.S. does not ratify the CWC. It would be sad indeed if the CMA were putting its own economic interest ahead of the nation's security in supporting ratification.
 <p>
<li><b> Not enhance U.S. security.</b>  By making arms control an end in itself, the CWC will not protect U.S. national security.  Arms control is only one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. America needs the additional tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if other nations still possess them.
<p>
<li><b> Be inconsistent with America's global responsibilities.</b> The CWC, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regarding the possession of nuclear weapons.  The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Advising and consenting to the ratification of treaties is one of the Senate's most solemn constitutional responsibilities.  This is particularly so when the treaty under consideration has profound implications for the security of the nation.  Given all that is stake with the CWC, Senators should scrutinize carefully all the provisions and implications of the treaty before they vote.  This will lead to an inescapable conclusion: Ratifying the CWC would leave America less secure and would pose unreasonable costs on American businesses.

<h3>RATIFYING THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION: AMERICAN BUSINESS WILL PAY THE PRICE</h3>

<p>
<a href="fyi111t1.gif">Table</a>: CWC's Impact on Business Widespread
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


By September 14, 1996, the Senate will be voting on ratification of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1732:">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC), a treaty that would ban the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The CWC contains serious shortcomings. It is neither reliably verifiable nor enforceable. As a result, it will not serve the security interests of the United States. But the potential damage from the CWC is not limited merely to national security. It also will impose a costly regulatory burden on American businesses and thus harm America's economy. This burden will result from the CWC's requirement that businesses prove to the U.S. government and international inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical weapons. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in companies' being fined as much as $50,000 per incident.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

What follows is a state-by-state breakdown of the industrial facilities that are likely to be subject to the requirements of the CWC. These data are provided by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and are based on aggregate data maintained by the federal Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). Following the data on production facilities is a flow chart provided by the Department of Commerce describing the regulatory process governing the data collection effort.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Estimates of the direct cost that implementing the CWC will impose on U.S. businesses range as high as $200 million annually. The potential indirect costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the loss of confidential information, are difficult to estimate. However, billions of dollars in losses are not out of the question.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is true that the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) supports ratification and implementation of the CWC. Because the CMA is a prominent trade representative in Washington for the chemical industry, its support for the treaty would appear to suggest that the potential regulatory burden is not excessive. But the CMA does not speak for all chemical manufacturers. In fact, more than 60 percent of the facilities most likely to be affected by the CWC are owned by companies not represented by the Association. Further, small businesses, which are less likely to be represented by the CMA, are the ones most likely to be hurt by the increased regulatory burden, because they do not have the money to cover the added costs that will be imposed by the new regulations. Finally, something which the CMA does not emphasize is that chemical companies are not the only ones subject to this treaty. So, too, are food processors, brewers, distillers, pharmaceutical companies, paint companies, petroleum companies, and rubber companies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the Chemical Weapons Convention served the national security interests of the U.S., it would be reasonable to ask American businesses to assume some portion of the burden imposed by the inspection regime. But to ask American businesses to assume the excessive cost burden imposed by implementing a treaty that actually harms U.S. national security makes neither economic nor security sense.

<h3> THE CBO ESTIMATE ON MISSILE DEFENSE: A CASE OF FLAWS AND DISTORTIONS </h3>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Bill Clinton and other opponents of national missile defenses charge it will cost too much to defend Americans against missile attack.<sup>1</sup>  As evidence Clinton points to a May 15 estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that a missile defense system required by the Defend America Act of 1996 would cost as much as $60 billion.<sup>2</sup>  Both the President and the CBO are wrong. Defending America from nuclear attack will not cost as much as the CBO thinks. The U.S. could deploy a missile defense system for as little as $8 billion.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The CBO estimate is wrong because it is based on a flawed assumption that a ground-based system is the best option for ballistic missile defense (BMD). It is not. A sea-based option would not only be more effective, it would cost much less. Besides, the CBO report has been mischaracterized by critics of missile defense. All the critics say is that such a defense will cost $60 billion. What these critics ignore is that in the CBO estimate the initial defense system would cost only a fraction of the $60 billion claimed. The larger total applies to the deployment of several defensive systems, not just one, over a fourteen-year period. Critics pretend that the total cost figure would have to be paid in order to defend America from attack. This is not true. Using CBO's approach, an initial missile defense system costing as little $14 billion could provide coverage for the territory of the United States against very limited attacks with unsophisticated missiles.
<p>
<b>The CBO Report</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Congressional Budget Office is charged by Congress to estimate the budgetary impact of legislation. In performing this function, the CBO issued an estimate on May 15 of the cost of enacting the Defend America Act, which would commit the nation to the deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. However, the act is essentially a statement of strategic policy goals or priorities. It includes no budgetary authorization and mandates no particular BMD system or "architecture" which can be costed with any precision or certainty. This allowed the CBO to estimate the cost on the basis of its own assumptions. These assumptions led to a general cost estimate of $31 billion to $60 billion to deploy a combination of several national missile defense systems, extending over a fourteen-year period. This wildly varying estimate has been used by critics of missile defense to distort the real cost of missile defenses.
<p>

<b>CBO's flawed assumption.</b> The CBO estimate of the cost of the Defend America Act is based on a flawed assumption: that the ground-based approach pursued by the Clinton Administration is the only option for fielding an initial defense. The CBO began its analysis by examining hypothetical approaches proposed by the Clinton Administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). However, the Clinton Administration is opposed to national missile defenses and has no incentive to discuss the most cost-effective approach to deployment, even hypothetically. The Administration's hypothetical approach would deploy a single site of 100 fixed, ground-based interceptors, as allowed by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. This system, according to the CBO, would cost $14 billion if an array of sensor satellites were included in the deployment plan. The CBO then added two additional interceptor sites. This ran the cost of the system up, according to the CBO, to $18 billion. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
But the ground-based-only approach is not the only option. In fact, it is the worst option, not only costing too much, but not doing the job of effectively providing a wide-area of coverage against attack. The CBO failed to consider the option of modifying existing Navy AEGIS cruisers to serve as BMD platforms. The Heritage Foundation's Missile Defense Study Team ("Team B") estimates the cost of this alternative at $2-3 billion over six years, with an additional $5 billion for the sensor satellites.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, the cost of an initial defense could be between $7 billion and $8 billion, as opposed to CBO's estimate of between $14 billion and $18 billion.<p><b>Distortions of the CBO estimate.</b> The failure to consider other more viable options was not the only problem with the CBO estimate. Another is the wide range in the estimate of $31 billion to $60 billion over 14 years. The 100 percent variance in this estimate is so broad as to make it meaningless. No one can seriously base a judgment on it. Estimating the cost of missile defenses over a 14-year period would have been akin to devising a similar cost estimate in 1958 for the cost of five generations of intercontinental ballistic missiles (the <i>Titan I,</i> the <i>Titan II,</i> the <i>Minuteman I,</i> the <i>Minuteman II,</I> and the <i>Minuteman III</i>) through 1972. If the procurement cost of these systems -- likely more than $200 billion -- had been debated prior to the decision to develop ballistic missiles, perhaps Congress would have been equally shocked by the "sticker price" of deploying a nuclear deterrent for the next 14 years. The country should be very glad indeed that the Congress did not engage in such a spurious debate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Further, the assertion that deploying a missile defense system will cost $60 billion distorts the CBO's analysis. First, the $60 billion estimate is an upper limit. Even by its own analysis, CBO's cost of a multiple-system deployment could be as low as $31 billion. Second, this range of estimates covers the period from fiscal 1997 through 2010, or 14 years. That amounts to between $2.2 billion and $4.2 billion per year, or less than 2 percent of annual defense budgets. Third, the five-year estimate (fiscal 1997 through 2001) is less than $10 billion. Finally, and most important, the CBO assessment includes additions to the initial deployment that consist of space-based interceptors and space-based lasers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While any long-term deployment plan may cost any amount of money, the fact remains that CBO's initial deployment of ground-based interceptors, along with sensor satellites, would cost as little as $14 billion. Thus, despite the fact that CBO adopts an expensive approach to missile defense, even its own plan is still clearly affordable under defense budgets that will range between $250 billion and $350 billion per year (as measured in current dollars) for the 14-year period in question.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The presumed high cost of a national missile defense system serves merely as an excuse, not a reason, to oppose a decision to deploy national missile defenses. The CBO cost estimate is based on the flawed assumption that the Clinton Administration's approach to deployment is the most cost-effective. It is not. For this reason, Congress can safely ignore CBO's estimate and it certainly should ignore the misrepresentations of CBO's analysis provided by President Clinton. The fact is that a decision to deploy a national missile defense system is compatible with the defense budgets proposed by both the Clinton Administration and Congress.

<title>Flawed Intelligence Report No Guide To Missile Threat - Heritage</title>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 103<br>
May 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Very soon, both the House of Representatives and the Senate will debate identical versions of the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03144:">Defend America Act of 1996</a>. The Defend America Act commits the nation to deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. It is similar to the provision in the FY 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by President Bill Clinton on December 28, 1995. How Members of Congress vote on this bill will rest primarily on their understanding of the immediacy of the missile threat. Members who see the threat as present and growing will likely vote in favor of the bill; those who see the threat as remote are likely to vote against it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November 1995, the U.S. intelligence community issued an intelligence assessment describing the ballistic missile threat to the United States.<sup>1</sup>  Among other things, it concluded that there is little threat of a missile attack on the U.S. during the next 15 years. President Clinton and congressional opponents of the Defend America Act use this assessment to justify their opposition to deploying a national missile defense as soon as possible. Since this assessment is crucial to the coming debate on missile defense, and since the vote on this legislation may well determine the future of U.S. security against missile threats, the assessment deserves thorough analysis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Normally, it is impossible for the public to pass judgment on the content of intelligence assessments because they are classified. In the case of the intelligence assessment on the missile threat, however, the same summary version that was provided to President Clinton has been published.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, the public has an opportunity to decide whether the assessment is credible.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An evaluation of this intelligence assessment reveals that it is not credible. In fact, it contains a number of flaws. The authors of the assessment:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Inexplicably discount the threat posed today by long-range missiles in China and  Russia.</b> The intelligence community concluded that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for the next 15 years. But this inexplicably discounts the already existing threat posed by Russia and China. The assumption is that because these countries already have long-range missiles, nothing new will happen in the next 15 years to change the level of the threat. But things can change, and very quickly. This is particularly true regarding the emergence of hostile intent toward the U.S.
<p>
The immediacy of Chinese hostility was revealed earlier this year when Chinese officials were quoted as saying that China could take military action against Taiwan without the U.S. intervening because U.S. leaders "care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan."<sup>3</sup>  This was nothing less than a thinly veiled threat to attack the U.S. with long-range nuclear missiles if it intervened on behalf of Taiwan.
<p>
Another potential nuclear threat is posed by Russia -- as Clinton's Pentagon already has admitted. In fact, the intelligence report's findings on Russia blatantly contradict a fundamental conclusion of the Clinton Administration's own 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, its official statement of nuclear arms policy. This statement recognizes the volatility of the U.S. relationship with Russia.<sup>4</sup>  It even includes an option for "hedging" against a reversal in U.S.-Russian relations by arguing that America may have to exceed limits imposed by arms control agreements with the Russians if Moscow again becomes hostile. Russia is a strategic wild card -- a fact which the authors of this intelligence report blithely ignore. In short, the report's "findings" are fundamentally at odds with the Clinton Administration's own nuclear policy.
<p>
<li><b>Write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack.</b> The finding that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for 15 years is based on examining the missile threat to "the contiguous 48 states and Canada."  Alaska and Hawaii are not considered. Why this is done becomes clear when it is revealed that North Korea is developing a missile, the <I>Taepo Dong</I> 2, that could reach Alaska and Hawaii. North Korea could deploy this missile in three to five years. It is truly remarkable that the Clinton Administration appears to believe that the people of Alaska and Hawaii are strategic second-class citizens who deserve less protection than New Yorkers or Californians. It is even more remarkable that the President appears to believe that Canadians deserve more protection than Alaskans and Hawaiians.
<p>
<li><b>Are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles.</b> The intelligence estimate states: "We [of the intelligence community] are likely to detect any indigenous long-range missile program many years before deployment."  But the intelligence community has a poor track record in detecting illicit weapons programs. It failed, for example, to detect major portions of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. International inspections of Iraq's nuclear program following the Persian Gulf War revealed that it was far larger and far more advanced than the U.S. intelligence community had predicted before the inspections.<sup>5</sup>  Saddam Hussein was only months away from deploying an explosive nuclear bomb, not years away as the intelligence community had predicted.
<p>
<li><b>Unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America.</b> They conclude that foreign assistance is a "wild card" that could be used by developing countries to accelerate their missile programs. Chinese assistance, for example, reportedly helped Iraq extend the range of their Soviet Scud-B missiles.<sup>6</sup>  The post-Gulf War inspections in Iraq revealed that the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission relied on a wide variety of foreign sources to accelerate its nuclear weapons program. The foreign sources include corporations in the U.S. and Germany. This is one reason why the U.S. was surprised by the scope and advanced state of the Iraqi program. United Nations inspector David Kay commented on October 17, 1991, that "there is no region of the world that you will find that did not contribute to [the Iraqi nuclear weapons] program."<sup>7</sup>
<P>
<li><b>Underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation.</b> The intelligence estimate states that "if a country were to purchase an SLV [space launch vehicle], converting it to an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] would involve technological obstacles roughly as challenging as those involved in an indigenous ICBM program."  This statement is surprising since space launch vehicle and missile components are very similar. Of the eight essential components of a ballistic missile, all but one -- the warhead -- are found in somewhat modified forms in space launch vehicles.<sup>8</sup>  Thus, the transfer of space launch vehicle components is virtually certain to assist countries in developing missiles.
<p>
Downplaying the potential impact of widely available space launch vehicle technology on missile development programs reflects the intelligence community's historic tendency to underestimate the pace of technological advancement in foreign weapons programs. Fifty years ago, U.S. intelligence failed to predict Soviet acquisition of atomic bomb technology. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon in August 1949, years earlier than was predicted. America was shocked for a second time in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched its <I>Sputnik</I> satellite. Predicting that a missile threat to America is 15 years away indicates the same sort of complacency that resulted in surprise at the Soviet atomic test in 1949 and <I>Sputnik</I> launch in 1957.
<p>
<lI><b>Are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles.</b> The intelligence assessment concludes: "We expect countries that currently have ICBMs will not sell them."  This finding is contradicted by historical experience. China sold intermediate-range missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 and Pakistan in 1993. Why the intelligence community is so certain that China would not sell long-range missiles is a complete mystery. Moreover, even the Clinton Administration recognizes that Russia will be marketing its ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. On September 28, 1995, the Clinton Administration agreed to modify the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) to lift restrictions on converting missiles to space launch vehicles.<sup>9</sup>  It did this to satisfy the Russians, who want to sell modified SS-25 <I>Sickle</I> long-range ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. In short, the Administration agreed to modify an existing arms control treaty precisely to permit the kind of proliferation which is dismissed so easily in the intelligence estimate, and which it supposedly opposes so vehemently in its declared anti-proliferation policy. Apparently the Russians are beginning to implement this policy. Press reports on a classified Pentagon study reveal that Russia is selling SS-18 <I>Satan</I> ICBM components to the Chinese as space launch vehicle technology.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches against the U.S.</b> The intelligence assessment states: "We conclude that the current threat to North America from unauthorized or accidental launch of Russian or Chinese strategic missiles remains remote and has not changed significantly from that of the past decade."  Yet Russia and China are undergoing great political turmoil. Any fracturing of either country's political leadership cannot help but cause a break in the chain of command governing nuclear weapons. This is precisely what happened when an attempted <I>coup d'etat</I> against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev took place in 1991. Nobody knew who had control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal during that time. Such political crises occur frequently, with little or no warning. It is all but impossible to understand why the intelligence community is so confident that the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches is so remote.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The intelligence assessment of the missile threat to the United States contains so many flaws, contradictions, and ambiguities that critics naturally wonder about its objectivity. There are deep suspicions in Congress and the expert community that political leaders in the Clinton Administration intervened in the intelligence process to get the answer they wanted. Indeed, the Clinton Administration made a decision in 1993 to cut the national missile defense budget by some 80 percent. The Administration may have felt pressured to justify this decision by encouraging an intelligence assessment that minimized the threat of a missile attack on the U.S. The U.S. General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, is trying to determine whether the Clinton Administration did in fact intervene. If it is found that the Administration "cooked" this assessment, then President Clinton's veto of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill will appear to be not merely an act of willful ignorance, but the <I>coup de grace</I> in a shameless plan of deception.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether the intelligence assessment is objective or not is now a matter for Congress to decide. However, for purposes of the debate on the Defend America Act, it is enough to know that the possibility exists that this assessment was "cooked," that it is fatally flawed, and that it is therefore a poor guide to policy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should not rely on this assessment as an excuse for deferring the decision to deploy a national missile defense system. Further delay in deployment could result in a surprise missile attack against which the U.S. would have no defense, and which could cost many American lives. If this were to occur, Members of Congress would not be able to hide their responsibility. The time for Congress to live up to this responsibility is now, before it is too late.

<b>THE DECADES-LONG EFFORT TO BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The history behind the Chemical Weapons Convention is a long and tortuous one. It has long been the aim of diplomats to curtail both the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Among the earliest attempts in modern times to ban the use of chemical weapons was the 1907 Hague Convention. Approved by the European powers, the convention prohibited the use of weapons containing poison, but the widespread use of chemical weapons in World War I proved that this prohibition had little effect. After the war, a League of Nations conference convened in Switzerland to approve the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of both biological and chemical weapons in war, but not their development, production, and stockpiling. Among the countries signing the Geneva Protocol were the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Japan. Unlike the 1907 Hague Convention, the Geneva Protocol was successful once war broke out. Chemical weapons were not used widely during World War II, but this success was due to implicit threats by allied leaders, particularly President Franklin Roosevelt, to respond in kind to any chemical attack. It is one of history's clearest examples of a successful deterrence policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Geneva Protocol is still in force, and the U.S. honors its terms, although it did not ratify the protocol until 1975. It is, however, a weak agreement. If countries violate it, they remain unpunished, and there are no established procedures for determining the veracity of reported claims of biological or chemical weapons use. It is sometimes referred to as the "no first use" agreement because participating states agreed to comply with its terms so long as biological or chemical weapons were not used against them first. Some states, including the U.S., ratified the agreement with the reservation that it would cease to be binding if they were attacked first.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Violations of the Geneva Protocol have occurred on several occasions since the end of World War II. The Soviet Union and its clients, for example, used mycotoxins, commonly referred to as "yellow rain," against civilians in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia in the 1970s and 1980s, and Iraq used chemical weapons during its eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Negotiations leading to the Chemical Weapons Convention began in 1971 when the U.N. Conference on Disarmament's predecessor organization, the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, voted to conduct separate talks on banning biological and chemical weapons. This allowed for the conclusion in 1992 of the Biological Weapons Convention, which banned the production and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons, but put negotiations to ban chemical weapons on the back burner for well over a decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the mid-1980s, the Reagan Administration, expressing concern over the large-scale Soviet chemical weapons program, began producing a new generation of chemical munitions for the U.S. military. The subsequent U.S. program was legal because the 1925 Geneva Protocol outlawed only the use, not the development, production, and stockpiling, of chemical munitions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Diplomatic efforts in the 1980s focused on stopping the spread of chemical weapons to Third World countries. In 1984, Australia proposed to establish controls on the export of ingredients that could be used to manufacture chemical weapons. This proposal was made to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an organization of the industrialized states to coordinate economic development policies for the Third World. The Australians wanted participating countries to coordinate export control policies to stem the transfer of chemical weapons-related technologies to the Third World. Specific restrictions and enforcement mechanisms were left to individual governments. The "Australia Group" now has 29 members, including such prominent nations as the U.S., France, Britain, and Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The informal and voluntary nature of the Australian proposal has limited its effectiveness. For example, the enforcement of the export restrictions falls to individual member governments, but industrialized nations have a spotty record on how vigorously they enforce export restrictions. In the 1980s, a Phillips Petroleum Company subsidiary in Belgium delivered the chemical thiodiglycol (used in manufacturing mustard gas) to Iraq, and Britain is reported to have sold thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride to Iraq in 1988 and 1989. Both transfers were contrary to the commitments made by Belgium and Britain in the Australia Group. Export control policies, while useful to pursue, by themselves cannot stop the spread of chemical weapons.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President George Bush came to office determined to ban chemical weapons. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev signed an agreement on June 1, 1990, in Washington to reduce the chemical stockpiles of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to 5,000 metric tons each. No accord, however, was reached outlining inspection procedures for confirming the destruction of these weapons. That was left to subsequent negotiations, which were supposed to be completed by December 31, 1990. This deadline passed without agreement between Moscow and Washington, and the "bilateral destruction agreement" has yet to be brought into force. This failure, to some extent, was due to the turmoil in the Soviet Union, which was collapsing politically. Further, both sides were aware that progress was being made on the Chemical Weapons Convention at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, and that this convention would have extensive inspection procedures and would ban the weapons entirely. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the setbacks at the bilateral level with Russia, President Bush announced on May 13, 1991, that the U.S. would agree to a complete ban of chemical weapons even if some other nations did not eliminate their arsenals. Bush also pledged that the U.S. would forswear the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, including situations in which U.S. forces are attacked with such weapons first.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Until that time, Washington had reserved the right to use chemical weapons if attacked with them first and to maintain a chemical weapons stockpile for the purpose of deterrence and possible retaliation. This unilateral concession by the U.S., along with another to drop the demand for stringent "any time, anywhere" inspections of possible chemical weapons facilities, put the Chemical Weapons Convention negotiations on the fast track. The final draft of the convention was completed on September 3, 1991, in Geneva. It was signed in Paris by more than the 65 countries required for ratification to bring the convention into force, including by the United States. Now the Senate, in fulfilling its role to advise and consent to all treaties, must decide whether the United States will ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.  
<p>
<b>PROVISIONS OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think it would be useful to review the content of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The purpose of the convention is to ban chemical weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use by participating states. It would do so by establishing elaborate procedures for eliminating all chemical weapons no later than ten years after the convention enters into force and by requiring the elimination of chemical weapons production facilities within the same ten-year period. The convention, however, does not require the destruction of toxic chemicals, their precursors (chemicals that can be combined to form toxic chemicals), or facilities that are used for peaceful purposes. Likewise, small stockpiles of lethal chemicals may be retained for the development of defenses against chemical weapons. These chemicals, precursors, and production facilities are subject to verification measures to detect any attempt to convert them into weapons. The convention is of unlimited duration, which is designed to make the destruction of chemical weapons permanent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Overseeing the implementation of the agreement will be a large international bureaucracy that in many ways resembles the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a U.N. agency that fosters cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of nuclear power. In a similar vein, a new chemical weapons bureaucracy will be created, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Headquartered at The Hague, this organization will have three parts. The first will be the Conference of State Parties, consisting of the representatives of all states participating in the convention. It will establish general policies for implementing the convention and will oversee the functions of the organization. The second will be the Executive Council, the executive arm of the organization, consisting of the representatives of 41 participating states picked to achieve geographic balance. The third will be the Technical Secretariat, led by a Director General, which will be responsible for carrying out the inspections to verify compliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first meeting of a commission preparing the groundwork for the chemical weapons organization took place on February 8, 1993, at The Hague. Since that meeting, the Preparatory Commission has focused on building the Provisional Technical Secretariat, the forerunner of the monitoring agency that will be created after the convention comes into force. Activities of the Preparatory Commission thus far have included finding a building to house the agency, establishing inspection procedures, drafting inspection manuals, procuring and testing inspection equipment, and hiring and training inspectors. According to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the 1995 budget for the Preparatory Commission was roughly $17 million, of which the U.S. paid 25 percent. Once up and running, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will operate at a cost of about $200 million annually. On the basis of a 25 percent contribution, U.S. taxpayers could be expected to pay $50 million annually to support this international organization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The verification responsibilities of the Technical Secretariat are vast. The convention's Annex on Implementation and Verification (Verification Annex), over 100 pages long, establishes a long list of inspections to verify that chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities are destroyed. The Technical Secretariat also is tasked with ensuring that commercial chemical production facilities are not used to develop and produce weapons. The Verification Annex outlines a number of inspection procedures, including the timing of inspections, the appointment of inspectors, the privileges and immunities that governments must extend to inspectors, and the equipment inspectors may bring with them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Verification Annex establishes eight different kinds of inspection regimes, all of which must be carried out by the Technical Secretariat. The first kind of inspection verifies whether chemical weapons are destroyed. The second is to verify the destruction or conversion of chemical weapons production facilities. The third, fourth, and fifth kinds of inspections are to detect whether certain types of chemicals have been used in building chemical weapons, based on how easily each of three categories (schedules) of chemicals can be turned into weapons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The sixth kind of inspection pertains to production facilities that produce chemicals not found in any of the first three schedules. The seventh is the most sensitive insofar as it involves short-notice inspections of states suspected of violating the terms of the convention. The final kind of inspection requires investigating sites where chemical weapons may have been used.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At first, the U.S. demanded that so-called challenge inspections be allowed anywhere and at any time a violation was suspected. It ultimately abandoned this approach in favor of a British proposal for so-called managed access to suspect sites. Under this provision, the inspected state may take steps to guard its national security, as long as they do not involve evading the convention's terms. In order to protect its security, an inspected state may remove sensitive papers; shroud displays and equipment; log off computers; restrict the types of analyses that may be carried out on air, soil, and effluent samples; and even limit which inspectors may gain access to particular areas at a suspect site.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The inspection process is long and involved. It starts with OPCW officials inspecting the locations declared by a member state as weapons sites. The declaration must be filed with the Technical Secretariat no later than 30 days after the convention enters into force. Work on destroying the chemical weapons at the sites must begin within two years and must be completed within ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once on a weapons site, inspectors will place seals and monitoring devices to guard against a violation. Similar procedures, such as for placing cameras, exist for monitoring whether chemical weapons, production facilities, and non-weapons chemical production facilities have been destroyed. As many as 1,000 inspections a year may be required.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Operating this complex arrangement of inspection regimes will prove costly to U.S. industry and the government. According to expert David Evans of Analytic Services, Inc., of Arlington, Virginia, U.S. industry can be expected to incur costs of between $20 million and $200 million annually to support the inspection process. The higher costs are more likely in the early stages of implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. But this general cost to industry assumes that everything goes as planned. If the mechanism in the convention to protect proprietary and other sensitive business information fails, Mr. Evans estimates that the cost to business could exceed $1 billion annually. The U.S. government will have its responsibilities for implementing the convention as the national authority serving as an intermediary between industry and the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The cost of these activities to the U.S. government is estimated to be $25 million annually. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention also contains a provision on compliance. The Executive Council bears the responsibility for demanding that a participating state redress a violation. If corrective action is not taken, the Conference of State Parties may suspend the offending state's privileges under the convention. This could include terminating cooperative programs to assist states in developing chemicals for peaceful purposes or denying the offender the right to vote in the Conference of State Parties. In more serious cases of violation, stricter countermeasures would be taken. For example, trade in all chemicals with the offending state could be shut off. In cases where violations pose a threat to the security of other states, the Conference of State Parties may refer the matter to the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council. Ultimately, the Security Council serves as the court of final appeal in the enforcement process.
<p><b>
A FIVE-PART TEST OF ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To deserve the support of the Senate, any arms control agreement should pass a five-part test. This test should serve to determine whether a particular arms control agreement meets the minimum standards necessary to serve the national interest. The test consists of five questions, all of which must be answered affirmatively when applied to a particular agreement to insure that it does not contain a fatal flaw. These five questions are: 1) Does the agreement reduce the risk of war?  2) Are the agreement's requirements consistent with U.S. global security responsibilities?  3) Is the agreement adequately verifiable?  4) Is the agreement enforceable?  and 5) Does the agreement enhance national security?  The Chemical Weapons Convention fails to pass this test in all five particulars.
<P>
<b>QUESTION #1: Will the Chemical Weapons Convention reduce the risk of war?
<p>
ANSWER #1: By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the Chemical Weapons Convention may increase the likelihood of war or result in the escalation of an existing conflict.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reducing the level of armaments is not the most important goal of arms control. Reducing the risk of war is far more important. Arms control agreements should not be destabilizing. It is counterproductive to achieve an arms control agreement that, by reducing arms, only invites attack.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yet this is precisely what the Chemical Weapons Convention will do. The Chemical Weapons Convention is the product of a policy that equates reduced levels of armaments, in this case reduced to zero, with greater security. But the experience of World War II shows that having chemical weapons can deter a chemical attack. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Almost as important as reducing the risk of war is the goal of preventing the escalation of an existing conflict to a higher level of violence. The Chemical Weapons Convention, although unintentionally, will encourage escalation in two ways. First, chemically armed enemies, knowing that the U.S. and its allies do not possess chemical weapons, will have little incentive to refrain from using such weapons. They will enjoy a unilateral advantage over the U.S., and in time of war they are likely to use it. Second, the convention may increase the likelihood that nuclear weapons will be used. Lacking chemical weapons, the U.S. will be forced to rely on nuclear weapons to deter a chemical attack on U.S. forces. While it is prudent to reserve the right to use nuclear weapons, it is certainly unwise to take steps that lower the threshold for the employment of nuclear weapons.
<P>
<b>QUESTION #2: Are the Chemical Weapons Convention's requirements consistent with America's global responsibilities?
<p>
ANSWER #2: The Chemical Weapons Convention, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the Cold War over, the U.S. is the world's sole superpower. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal. In Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere, the U.S. has proved on numerous occasions that it exercises its unmatched power in a manner that is both responsible and respectful of the legitimate interests of other states. But America's global responsibilities also mean that its forces are the most likely to be engaged in major conflicts. The more dangers America faces, the greater the likelihood that chemical weapons will be used against U.S. forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention ignores the special responsibilities of the U.S., treating all countries in the same manner. It assumes that U.S. troops face the same likelihood of chemical attack as the tiny constabulary force fielded by Costa Rica, which has the same rights and obligations under the treaty. In this way it contrasts sharply with one of the more successful arms control agreements of the post-World War II era, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which the U.S. and four other nations (Britain, China, France, and Russia) are treated in a manner fundamentally different from all other nations. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty accounts for the special responsibilities and broad political roles played by these five acknowledged nuclear weapons states in world affairs. The Chemical Weapons Convention also could have done so, simply by adopting the same discriminatory approach established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
<b>QUESTION #3: Is the Chemical Weapons Convention adequately verifiable?
<p>
ANSWER #3: Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention cannot be adequately verified.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not adequately verifiable. Many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses, and trying to keep track of all these chemicals throughout the world is an impossible task. In a devastating report prepared for the Defense Nuclear Agency in 1991, contractors stated: "Detecting most types of cheating [possible under the Chemical Weapons Convention] will be highly unlikely, if not impossible."  This committee itself was notified of the problems with verification during a June 23, 1994, hearing. At that hearing, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey stated: "But, still, the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<p>
<b>QUESTION #4: Are the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention enforceable?
<p>
ANSWER #4: Violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention are likely to go unpunished.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Verification of compliance with an arms control agreement is not enough. The U.S. also must be able to do something if other countries are caught violating the agreement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention makes only a feeble attempt to address the question of enforcement. It states that unspecified sanctions can be imposed on a state that is violating the convention, either by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or by the United Nations. Ultimately, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The history of the Biological Weapons Convention provides an object lesson in what can go wrong with this agreement. Starting in the early 1980s, the U.S. acknowledged that it suspected the Soviet Union of violating the Biological Weapons Convention. Yet the U.S. never lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council, which is charged with resolving the Biological Weapons Convention's enforcement problems just as it would under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The reason for this inaction is clear: If the U.S. had lodged a complaint against the Soviet Union, Moscow simply would have vetoed any enforcement resolution brought before the U.N. Security Council. China and Russia will have an equivalent veto authority against enforcing the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention as they pertain to their programs.
<p>
<b>QUESTION #5: Does the Chemical Weapons Convention enhance U.S. national security?
<p>
ANSWER #5: By making arms control an end in itself, the Chemical Weapons Convention will not serve to protect U.S. national security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This question establishes the most important test of arms control. Arms control is one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. It should never be thought of as an end in itself. Reduced arsenals are not always better. A comprehensive security strategy will make room for the tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations, as well as arms control. In short, any arms control agreement must serve the supreme purpose of foreign policy, which is protecting the nation's security.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention does not meet this most basic test. The convention requires that the U.S. completely abandon its chemical deterrent. But this requirement will not enhance U.S. security. Since no country is compelled to join the convention, it will be perfectly legal for those that do not join to retain chemical weapons. And since it is unrealistic to expect countries which want to retain chemical weapons to join, the result cannot possibly be global chemical disarmament. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if, as a practical matter, other nations still possess them. By way of analogy, would it be in the U.S. interest to conclude a similar agreement relative to nuclear weapons?  Such an agreement would require the U.S. to dispense with its nuclear arsenal even though some other countries may retain nuclear weapons. This is no longer an academic question. India, among other nations, is demanding that the U.S. commit to such an agreement in principle at the negotiations over banning nuclear tests at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The precedent set by U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention would indicate that the U.S. is willing to accept a similar agreement attempting to ban nuclear weapons.
<p>
<b>TOWARD AN EFFECTIVE COUNTER-PROLIFERATION POLICY: THREE PRINCIPLES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not just an arms control agreement; it is also a non-proliferation agreement. As such, it carries important implications for U.S. non-proliferation policy. While the U.S. has a clear interest in stopping the proliferation of chemical weapons around the world, an effective counter-proliferation policy cannot depend on arms control alone. A truly effective policy will balance arms control with deterrence, effective chemical defenses, and, if necessary, military options for destroying chemical weapons and weapons facilities. As the Senate considers the merits of the Chemical Weapons Convention, it should ask whether it is part of an overall counter-proliferation policy that rests on the following three principles. 
<p>
<b>PRINCIPLE #1: The need to deter a chemical attack.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Deterrence requires maintaining a credible threat to retaliate for chemical attacks against the U.S. or its allies. This retaliatory threat must be able to convince any potential aggressor that he has nothing to gain by attacking the U.S. with chemical weapons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By requiring the destruction of chemical weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention would deny the U.S. the capability to retaliate in kind for a chemical attack. America therefore would be left with only two options in case of a chemical attack: 1) to escalate the conflict by launching large-scale counter-attacks with conventional (non-chemical and non-nuclear) arms, or 2) to retaliate with nuclear weapons. But the Clinton Administration has not made the adjustments necessary to deal with these options. Not only is it cutting the conventional forces needed to deter chemical attacks; it also has not declared that nuclear weapons have a role in deterring chemical weapons attacks.
<p>
<b>PRINCIPLE #2: The need for defenses against chemical weapons.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are no guarantees, however, that deterrence will always work. Such dictators as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qadhafi may not act rationally in a crisis or exhibit restraint. Therefore, the U.S. needs some insurance against chemical attack if deterrence fails; it needs defenses against chemical weapons and their delivery systems. U.S. forces need to be outfitted with garments, masks, and decontamination kits, and they need to be defended as well from aircraft and missiles which may carry chemical munitions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There certainly is room for improvement in chemical defenses. The General Accounting Office's Director of Army Issues, Richard Davis, testified before Congress on April 16, 1991, that America's soldiers were neither adequately trained nor equipped to conduct operations in an environment contaminated by chemical weapons. Although some progress has been made in improving the chemical defense posture of U.S. forces during the intervening years, it is unlikely that all the vulnerabilities cited by Mr. Davis in 1991 have been eliminated. As for defenses against the delivery systems used to launch chemical attacks, the Clinton Administration has cut funding for the nation's missile defense program by more than 50 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, if history is any guide, the Chemical Weapons Convention will make it politically difficult to field better defenses. In 1969, President Nixon announced that the U.S. would forswear the use or development of biological weapons in preparation for the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972. After the Nixon decision, the U.S. biological defense program withered. This outcome was not the result of a provision in the Biological Weapons Convention outlawing defenses; it was the result of constant criticism of these programs by arms control advocates who viewed them as contrary to the spirit, although not the letter, of the Biological Weapons Convention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The unintended consequences of the Biological Weapons Convention surfaced during the Persian Gulf War. An interim report to Congress on the results of the Gulf War stated that America's biological defense capabilities were so weak that if the Iraqis had used biological weapons, which later evidence shows they possessed, the casualty levels would have overwhelmed the military medical care system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This same sort of vulnerability to chemical attack is likely to be the unintended consequence of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The convention does not outlaw defensive programs, yet arms control advocates are sure to lobby against defenses. The argument will go that they are not needed because chemical weapons have been banned.
<p><b>
PRINCIPLE #3: The need for offensive capabilities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Defensive systems are not the sole means for countering a chemical attack. U.S. armed forces can destroy preemptively an enemy's chemical weapons and weapons facilities with air strikes and other forms of offensive combat operations. Targets for such strikes should include chemical production facilities and storage depots, as well as forces armed with chemical munitions. Destruction of the production facilities and storage depots would limit the enemy's supply of weapons, and targeting enemy forces armed with chemical munitions would lessen the chances chemical munitions will be used against U.S. and allied forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration should be required to devise a comprehensive strategy for destroying enemy weapons and facilities in time of war. It can do so by continuing and improving Pentagon programs already underway. The Air Force has conducted "sensor to shooter" experiments with the aim of devising a system for directing attacks against enemy forces within minutes of detection. The Navy has an equivalent concept called the "cooperative engagement capability."  These programs need to be coordinated and focused on destroying the weapons and forces capable of delivering chemical munitions.
<p>
<b>REDRAFTING THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is a flawed agreement. Likewise, the existing U.S. policy to counter chemical attacks also is flawed. Neither is solely the fault of the Clinton Administration. The decisions to conclude and sign the convention and to change U.S. policy toward countering chemical attacks were made by the Bush Administration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration has chosen not to alter the policies begun by the Bush Administration. As the Clinton Administration proceeds down the same path, it will be up to the Senate, as it considers the Chemical Weapons Convention, to adopt a different approach. It can do so through the advice and consent process established by the United States Constitution for approving the ratification of treaties. As it does so, it should consider that:
<p>
<b>1. A chemical weapons treaty should be modeled on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two treaties serve as models for agreements on controlling weapons of mass destruction throughout the world: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 and the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Biological Weapons Convention is a discredited treaty. It seeks to ban biological weapons in their entirety by requiring all participating states, including the U.S., not to develop and deploy biological weapons. But it is now known that the Biological Weapons Convention was violated by the Soviet Union from the beginning. Further, a report issued by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency on May 30, 1995, states that China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Russia, and Taiwan either definitely have or may have violated the terms of the convention. In most of the listed cases, it is impossible to determine with absolute precision because compliance with the convention cannot be verified. Further, the report states that Egypt and Syria may have biological weapons programs. These two countries have signed but not ratified the Biological Weapons Convention. Thus, despite the evidence that other countries retained biological weapons, the U.S. has destroyed its biological deterrent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, by contrast, has been relatively successful. While it has not prevented the spread of nuclear weapons, it has limited proliferation significantly. Today only a handful of countries outside the five declared nuclear states have nuclear weapons. More important, the Non-Proliferation Treaty did not require the elimination of the U.S. nuclear deterrent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration could have resolved many of the problems with the Chemical Weapons Convention by sending the treaty back to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to be redrafted. The Administration, unfortunately, chose not to take this step. The Senate has the option of concluding that the treaty is flawed. If this conclusion were reached, the Senate could request that the Clinton Administration renegotiate the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention so that it is modeled on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the Clinton Administration resists, there is a second alternative available to the Senate. The advice and is not limited to approving or disapproving ratification. The Senate can amend the text of a treaty. Through this amendment process, the Senate itself can redraft the Chemical Weapons Convention so that it resembles the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Doing so would require amending the convention in several articles. After adopting these amendments, the Senate then could approve its ratification. The practical effect would be that the Clinton Administration would have to ask other treaty signatories to accept the changes made by the Senate. Thus, the net effect would be a demand to renegotiate the treaty.
<p>
<b>2. A new policy is needed to deter chemical weapons strikes.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Changing the Chemical Weapons Convention itself, however, will not address the threat to U.S. security posed by chemical weapons. This would require changing the overall chemical weapons policy adopted by the Bush Administration. The policy established by President Bush on May 13, 1991, essentially committed the U.S. to the unconditional elimination of its chemical arsenal. This policy should be dropped, and the U.S. should state it will preserve the broadest possible array of responses to a chemical attack, including retaliation with conventional military means, an in-kind response, and, in the most extreme circumstances, a nuclear response. Further, it should not describe the specific circumstances under which it will resort to any particular response, in order to retain the greatest deterrent effect possible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While it would be preferable that the Clinton Administration make these changes in U.S. chemical deterrence policy, the Senate also can take actions that result in the same changes. First, the Chemical Weapons Convention would have to be amended to permit a U.S. chemical deterrent. Second, the Senate could adopt a reservation -- a means by which the Senate can qualify its approval of ratification -- that declares that the U.S. reserves the option of retaliating against a chemical attack with nuclear weapons. It must be acknowledged, however, that in order to adopt such a reservation the Senate may first be required to strike Article XXII of the convention. Article XXII bars reservations. Striking Article XXII is something that should be of general interest to the Senate in any event. Barring reservations narrows the freedom of action of the Senate in terms of its advice and consent role. The Senate should not accept any provisions in this convention or any future treaty that so limits its freedom of action.
<p>  
<b>3. U.S. defenses against chemical weapons need to be improved. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pursuing an effective defense program is not prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, even as currently drafted. In fact, the convention explicitly allows for the continuation of defense programs. The danger is that the implementation process will be hijacked by arms control advocates who oppose such programs and who will undermine them with calls for budget cuts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate can counter these pressures on U.S. chemical defense programs in three ways. First, it can provide adequate funding levels for chemical defense programs in the annual authorization and funding bills for the Department of Defense. But since the funding question is under the jurisdiction of other Senate committees, the Foreign Relations Committee may prefer to focus on establishing clearly defined standards for the military in terms chemical defense preparedness. A condition could be attached to the resolution of ratification that requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that the Department of Defense has met the requirements for improving chemical defense preparedness made by Richard Davis of the General Accounting Office in testimony before Congress. These include meeting minimum chemical training standards set forth in service regulations and properly integrating chemical defense training into the overall training program for U.S. troops. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate should also set requirements for improving U.S. defenses against delivery vehicles used to launch chemical attacks, particularly ballistic missiles. This must include a requirement for the development and deployment of missile defenses capable of effectively destroying chemically armed ballistic missiles in the boost phase. The Senate could force this outcome by adopting a condition requiring the Administration to propose such a boost-phase defense for deployment by a specific date.
<p>
<b>4. The U.S. capability to destroy chemical weapons production and storage facilities, as well as deployed forces with chemical weapons, should be improved.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Defensive systems cannot meet all the requirements for defending U.S. and allied forces and civilians against chemical attack. These can be met only by maintaining offensive capabilities for striking at enemy positions. For example, countering enemy artillery firing chemical munitions requires an offensive response with opposing artillery or air strikes, as does interrupting enemy command and control networks and destroying chemical production and supply facilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. proved during the Persian Gulf War that it has an effective deep strike capability. Many command and control centers, for example, were destroyed by U.S. air power in and around Baghdad. But this is not to say that improvements cannot be made. For example, the U.S. had trouble countering Iraqi mobile <I>Scud</I> missiles with air power. To deal with this problem, the military services, and the Air Force and Navy in particular, have launched programs which are focused on enhancing the U.S. ability to strike quickly and accurately at enemy forces and facilities. The Senate should direct the Department of Defense to coordinate these programs and focus them on countering weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, including chemical weapons. The Senate again has the option of adopting a condition during its advice and consent process that forces the Clinton Administration to continue these programs and gear them to meeting the weapons of mass destruction threat.
<p>
<b>5. The Chemical Weapons Convention's arms control enforcement mechanisms need to be strengthened. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are three problems with U.S. policy for enforcing compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention. First, the Chemical Weapons Convention has a built-in conflict of interest in terms of enforcement. By establishing the U.N. Security Council as the court of last appeal in its enforcement process, the convention will allow the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members to veto any pending resolution ordering sanctions against it for an alleged violation. Any attempt to impose sanctions -- on China, for example -- for violating the convention are doomed to failure at the outset. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This problem can be resolved by redrafting the Chemical Weapons Convention along the lines of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Since the redrafted convention would establish declared chemical weapons states, it would be logical that these states be the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, thereby eliminating the conflict of interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second enforcement problem is that the U.S. historically has been reluctant to take action to remedy a violation by an arms control treaty partner. Despite clear evidence of Soviet violations of the Biological Weapons Convention and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the U.S. did not take the proportionate steps allowed to it under international law. Thus, the violations went unpunished. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Solving this problem will require a change in the government process for handling these issues. Currently, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency reports annually on arms control treaty violations, but there is no requirement for follow-up. Ultimately, the law could be changed to require that the President propose a proportionate response to a reported treaty violation no later than 60 days after the report is issued. This would guarantee a substantive response once a violation is discovered. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third problem is addressing the actions of states that refuse to ratify or accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention. This can be dealt with only by retaining a strong military posture that can deter and, if necessary, retaliate against a chemical attack. This is the ultimate insurance policy, but it can be maintained over the long term only by the actions of a Congress determined to fund and supervise America's defense programs.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meeting the chemical weapons threat requires redrafting the Chemical Weapons Convention to declare that a few countries, including the U.S., are weapons states. It also requires a policy under which the U.S. reserves the right and capability to respond to chemical attack either in kind or with nuclear weapons, in addition to conventional means.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps the best example in history of a successful deterrence policy came during World War II. Despite the existence of chemical arsenals, chemical weapons were not used widely during that conflict. The reason: The Allied powers, including the United States, convinced the Axis that the use of such weapons would result in swift retaliation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. may now be throwing away this successful policy. By adopting the Chemical Weapons Convention and declaring a unilateral policy of neither maintaining nor using chemical weapons, even in retaliation, the U.S. would eliminate its chemical deterrent even though it could never be sure that potential enemies have taken equivalent steps. U.S. national security interests demand that this process be reversed. The U.S. must not abandon its ability to deter attacks with chemical weapons.

<a href="bg1074t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Recommended Funding for Missile Defense Systems
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1995, The Heritage Foundation convened a Missile Defense Study Team to examine the growing threat of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The Missile Defense Study Team, known as "Team B," released its report <I>Defending America: A Near- and Long-Term Plan to Deploy Missile Defenses</I>, in June 1995, recommending timely, affordable, and technically sound responses to the missile threat, in keeping with the congressional leadership's high priority on ballistic missile defense.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Subsequent events have only reinforced the importance of Team B's recommendations that an effective ballistic missile defense system be deployed at the earliest possible date. In fact, the need for a vigorous missile defense program is more acute than ever. Ballistic missiles carrying mass destructive warheads remain the only weapons that can seriously threaten the territory of the United States. Shorter range or theater ballistic missiles (TBMs) also threaten U.S. forces and bases abroad, and allies in key regions of the world, as potentially hostile states continue to develop weapons of mass destruction and seek to acquire missiles to deliver them.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In February 1991, an Iraqi Scud missile killed 29 American soldiers in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, the largest single loss of American life in the Persian Gulf War. Yet five years later, the U.S. still has no better defense against theater ballistic missiles than the <I>Patriot</I>. To be sure, the <I>Patriot</I> did good service in the Gulf War, helping to neutralize the potential impact of Iraq's Scud arsenal. But it was designed originally as an air defense, not an anti-missile system, and its ability to defend a wide area or population center from ballistic missile attack was deliberately limited.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. still has no defense whatsoever against intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), contrary to what most Americans believe. If an ICBM were launched at the United States today -- by accident or design -- there is not a single thing the U.S. military could do to stop the warhead or multiple warheads from reaching their targets and killing hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Americans. In 1983, President Reagan began the Strategic Defense Initiative to end this utter vulnerability to the world's most terrible weapons. Yet the nation is no better protected from missile attack in 1996 than it was in 1983. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B considered this needless vulnerability in the context of the missile threat to the American people and to their forces, bases, and allies overseas. Team B concluded, unlike the Clinton Administration, that the threat is clear, present, and growing; and that it demands an urgent response.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As the least expensive and most effective solution to this global problem, <I>Defending America</I> recommended accelerated deployment of global wide-area defenses -- at sea within the next three to four years and in space by early in the next decade. These initiatives would restore key ballistic missile defense programs that the Clinton Administration sharply curtailed or canceled in 1993. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A year after the release of the Team B study, the United States remains undefended despite the best efforts of some Members of the 104th Congress -- and will likely remain undefended if the Administration's current policies prevail. Because missile defense remains a vital but unfulfilled national security requirement, The Heritage Foundation asked Team B to reconvene and take a look at what the Clinton Administration and Congress have done -- or failed to do -- to defend America. Team B has revalidated its basic approach of 1995, but also has concluded that the lack of progress in protecting Americans from ballistic missiles warrants this updated report in conjunction with the reissue of <I>Defending America</I>. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consequently, The Heritage Foundation is reissuing the Team B report along with this update, which reviews events of the past year that affect the missile defense effort, analyzes the negative impact of recent Clinton Administration missile defense program decisions, and discusses in more detail the Clinton Administration's negotiations with Russia on re-interpreting the ABM Treaty and extending the Treaty's limits to key theater defense systems.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this update, Team B offers a number of new recommendations to adjust to delays and negative developments in the missile defense program in the past year. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: 
<p><ul>
<li> Congress, and the U.S. Senate in particular, should seek ways to remove the obstacles to effective missile defenses posed by the ABM Treaty, including possible withdrawal from the treaty as the U.S. is entitled to do under Article XV.
<P>
<li> Congress should forego development of ground-based systems for national missile defense and accelerate deployment of sea-based, wide-area defenses. Without artificial performance constraints or limits imposed by the ABM Treaty, this system could counter threats against the U.S. homeland as well as regional threats from theater missiles, beginning by the year 2000. 
<p>

<li> Congress should accelerate the deployment of space-based sensors to enhance the effectiveness of both theater and national missile defense.
<p>
<li> Congress should direct the Air Force to develop follow-on space-based defenses, both kinetic energy interceptors and space-based lasers, to begin deployment early in the next decade. 
<p>
<li> Congress should ensure the Ballistic Missile Defense Office develops an integrated but open architecture for battle management, command, control, and communications to support missile defense systems.
</ul><p>
<b>WHAT TEAM B PROPOSED IN 1995</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1995, The Heritage Foundation Missile Defense Study Team proposed improvements or renewed emphasis in several missile defense program areas, in particular:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Sea-Based Wide-Area Defense.</b> Because the Navy already has invested almost $50 billion in its AEGIS cruisers and their infrastructure, modifications or modernization of the software, battle management system, and interceptors for the missile defense mission would cost only about $1 billion. The U.S. could then begin deploying defenses on AEGIS-equipped naval vessels by the end of this decade. For an investment of $2-3 billion, 650 defensive interceptors on 22 AEGIS cruisers could be at sea by 2001, achieving a limited global missile defense capability for the U.S. and for American forces and allies overseas. Team B pointed out that these highly mobile platforms could defend Americans in all 50 states from a limited long-range missile strike, as well as defend American troops and allies overseas, provided the full technological capability of the Navy missile defense system was not arbitrarily constrained or artificially compromised.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Brilliant Eyes Sensor System.</b> Team B recommended accelerating the <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space-based sensor to begin deployment by as early as 1999. This system would enhance the capability of all wide-area defense interceptor systems, wherever based.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Space-Based Defenses.</b> Team B recommended reviving space-based defense programs canceled by the Clinton Administration to provide deployment options beginning early in the next decade. This approach would be the most effective long-term defense to protect the American homeland and to counter advanced theater ballistic missiles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>ABM Treaty Limits.</b> Team B also recommended that defenses for America and American troops, bases, and allies overseas be built without arbitrarily restraining systems to comply with the outdated ABM Treaty. Codifying the Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) strategy of the Cold War, the ABM Treaty no longer makes sense in a multipolar world of proliferating nuclear powers.
<P>
<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON MISSILE DEFENSE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Team B members are dismayed at the extent to which the Administration has undermined the ability of the United States to defend itself against the growing threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. It is a widely acknowledged characteristic of President Clinton and officials in his Administration that they say one thing and do another. Nowhere is this disingenuousness more evident than the Administration's position on weapons of mass destruction and their principal delivery systems -- ballistic missiles. 
<p>
<b>The Administration's Declaratory Policy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On November 14, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12938, declaring in part that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering such weapons constitutes "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States," and that he therefore had decided to "declare a national emergency to deal with that threat."  A year later, on November 15, 1995, he issued a notice of the continuation of this "Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction."  This is a clear and indisputable evaluation of the immediate danger to the U.S. and its interests posed by "the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the means of delivering such systems."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite this clear and unequivocal statement of U.S. policy, President Clinton vetoed the FY 1996 Defense Authorization Act on December 28, 1995. This legislation contained missile defense provisions intended specifically to meet the threat from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems. President Clinton based his veto primarily on his objection to the missile defense language in the Act, which called for defending all 50 American states by early in the next decade. According to the President, this would be a "costly defense system" against a threat that the "intelligence community does not foresee in the coming decade."  His veto message asserted that the missile defense provisions would "also jeopardize our efforts to agree on an ABM/TMD demarcation with the Russian Federation." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defense Secretary William Perry said on September 20, 1994, when announcing the results of the Clinton Administration's nuclear posture review, that his "number one priority is to put MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction) behind us for good, to replace it with Mutual Assured Safety."  But on May 10, 1995, President Clinton joined Russian President Boris Yeltsin in declaring the ABM Treaty -- which is based on MAD -- a "cornerstone of strategic stability."  Indeed, the Clinton Administration's theological commitment to the ABM Treaty is so strong that it refuses to exploit U.S. technological advantages to build the most effective defenses -- which are also the least costly defenses -- to protect the American people and their overseas troops, friends, and allies.
<p>
<b>More Administration Inconsistency</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Secretary Perry is as inconsistent as his commander in chief. On January 31, 1996, he told the Hoover Institution Board of Overseers that "we are pursuing, in my judgment, robustly, vigorously, a so-called theater missile defense program [which] will give us the capability of defending U.S. forces and U.S. allies against medium-range ballistic missiles. We are moving toward deployment -- the production and deployment of this system on a high-priority schedule where the first of the new generation of such defenses will begin their deployment in a few years."  In a press conference on February 16, the Secretary announced the results of a six-month Pentagon review of plans to defend the American people and their troops, friends, and allies overseas, stating: "I have no higher obligation as Secretary of Defense than to protect our forces and our territory. This program responds to threats as they develop, combines current and evolving technology to face today's threat and will enable us to develop new technologies to face tomorrow's threat from longer range missiles."<sup>2 </sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nevertheless, the content if not the rhetoric of the February 16 announcement was contrary to the clear intent of Congress, which last year increased the Administration's budget request for missile defense and directed that key programs be accelerated.<sup>3</sup>  Instead, the Clinton Administration has decided to slow these programs while cutting 15 percent from its previously planned budget -- a budget that already had been cut by about 60 percent below the missile defense plan of the Bush Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defense experts who were not misled by the responsible-sounding statements in Mr. Perry's February 16 press briefing realize that even the Administration's vaunted commitment to theater missile defense is highly questionable. Secretary Perry announced cuts in funding for both the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Navy's AEGIS-based wide-area defense and proposed to delay deployment for both indefinitely -- in spite of congressional direction to deploy these two systems by 1999. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Furthermore, the Administration has decided to delay for at least three years a decision to deploy any defense of the American people, a delay that will most likely prove to be indefinite if the Clinton Administration continues in office beyond January 1997. The Administration has canceled or sharply curtailed development of the most effective, least expensive defenses. It is even stretching out development of the programs it is supporting, thereby increasing total system costs. It has reoriented the theater defense programs to the least capable systems, providing only limited protection to overseas troops, friends, and allies and denying the American people the inherent capability that would be afforded by fully exploiting modern technology.<sup>4</sup>  Similarly, deployment of <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space sensors was delayed at least six months while the Administration reviewed how to proceed. In short, the net effect of the Clinton Administration's policies and statements is to undermine deployment of effective theater and national missile defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These developments, apparent from the headlines of press reports from the briefing given on the Friday afternoon before a long holiday weekend,<sup>5</sup> are at sharp variance with last year's Team B report, which concluded that the threat is clear, present and growing. The factual evidence presented in <I>Defending America</I> demonstrated in particular that worldwide defenses against longer range missiles are urgently needed to counter blackmail threats that could limit U.S. involvement in future regional crises involving U.S. national interests. This kind of blackmail was illustrated recently when a Chinese official threatened to destroy Los Angeles if the U.S. interfered with China's feud with Taiwan.<sup>6</sup>  And on March 8, 1996, China conducted missile firing tests offshore near Taiwan's two largest cities as part of an ongoing campaign to intimidate Taiwan. These missile "tests" amounted to a <I>de facto</I> blockade, and further dramatized the use of ballistic missiles as weapons of coercive diplomacy as well as weapons of war.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The incoherence of the Administration's position on missile defense is further revealed by its handling of theater defenses, which it continues to claim are "first priority."  Seeking funds in a shrinking defense budget to offset shortfalls in other procurement accounts, the Administration is slowing its own theater defense program on the grounds that there is no imminent threat.<sup>7</sup>  Yet America's top commander in South Korea, General Gary Luck, asked that the THAAD (Theater High Altitude Area Defense) system be expedited to replace the Patriot system in light of growing tensions with North Korea. But General John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, justified turning down General Luck and delaying THAAD because, in his view, there is no new threat from North Korean missiles.<sup>8</sup>  Also, U.N. inspectors fear that an Iraqi missile program exposed last year is more extensive than previously thought and could enable Saddam Hussein to fire chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons at targets up to 2,000 miles away -- which would include all of the capitals of Europe.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The need for wide-area defenses -- surpassing the capability of THAAD -- could not be clearer. Short-range interceptors like <I>Patriot</I> and the Navy Lower Tier emphasized by the Clinton Administration will be ineffective against 2,000-mile-range ballistic missiles. They will have difficulty defeating even the Gulf War Scud, which broke up on reentry and became very hard to hit as its warhead "cork-screwed" its way toward the Earth. Neither of these theater systems currently being pursued by the Clinton Administration will be at all effective against missiles that release their warheads shortly after their boost phase, while they are rising in rocket-powered flight from their launchers. Yet there are reports that such missiles might be developed and "on the world market within the next five years."<sup>10</sup>  Thus, the missile threat demonstrably continues to grow and the Clinton Administration continues to resist committing the needed resources to protect the American people, their forward-deployed forces, and their allies. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's relaxed view of the threat and its inconsistent actions on missile defense are neither prudent nor responsible. It has become regrettably clear that the Clinton Administration cannot be relied upon to carry out its own stated policy. The President has created a political environment in which words mean nothing, in which the Administration's policy declarations merely conceal the failure to protect Americans against ballistic missiles. The Administration's actions over the past year demonstrate that the American people cannot depend upon the executive branch to fulfill its chief constitutional duty -- to provide for the common defense -- even though the missile threat continues to grow.
<p>
<b>ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE 1995 TEAM B REPORT</b>
<p>
<b>The President's Veto of the Defense Authorization Bill</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In crafting the missile defense provisions of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill, the congressional defense committees focused on limited, ABM Treaty-compliant, ground-based systems for the homeland defense mission. Team B recognizes that staunch supporters of missile defense in Congress chose to focus on ground-based defenses in order to garner the majority needed to pass the defense authorization bill. It was a tactical judgment call designed to "move the ball forward" toward actual deployment of National Missile Defense (NMD), even if only a few yards, and the bill as passed did direct the Clinton Administration to deploy, early in the next decade, a defense for the American homeland.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But on December 28, 1995, President Clinton vetoed the bill precisely because it mandated defending the American people by early in the next decade. The majority that had coalesced around a less than optimum NMD program was not sufficient to override the President's veto, and Congress was forced to strip out the offending section so that the defense authorization bill could be signed into law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While this was a severe setback for the defense of the United States, at least it clarified the missile defense debate. It is now clear that the Clinton Administration and the majority of the Democrats in Congress, who would not vote to override the veto, are willing to risk leaving the American people vulnerable to attack by even a single ballistic missile.
<p>
<b>"Explaining Away" the Need for Missile Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration argues that there is no ballistic missile threat to the American homeland and that there will be sufficient warning to build needed defenses before such a threat develops. In line with these assumptions, the Administration has structured a National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program. Over the next three years, it would develop components of an ABM Treaty-compliant ground-based defense which, in turn, could be deployed in another three years if, in the President's view, developments warrant it. It therefore intends to provide no defense for the American people before 2003 at the earliest. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet American cities can be destroyed today by Russian and Chinese missiles. One wonders whether the Clinton Administration believes it is "politically incorrect" to call attention to such possibilities. Furthermore, authoritative Administration officials testified to Congress last year that rogue states could threaten U.S. cities with long-range missile attack in three to five years -- or sooner if they chose to accelerate their development plans.<sup>12</sup>  Several Senators and Congressmen have expressed concern that the Clinton Administration politicized a recent National Intelligence Estimate so as to suggest a lesser threat to the United States than indicated in this previous testimony.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>The ABM Treaty -- or an ABM/TMD Treaty?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year Team B recommended an honest appraisal of the impediments to effective missile defense, including theater defense, posed by the 1972 ABM Treaty. To its great credit, the congressional leadership has sought throughout the past year to prevent Clinton negotiators from negotiating arbitrary constraints on theater missile defense systems that were never supposed to be limited by the ABM Treaty.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the Clinton Administration appears committed to "strengthening" this treaty. In talks to determine the demarcation between permitted theater defenses and ABM Treaty-limited strategic defenses, the Administration reportedly has accepted the Russian demand to limit the performance of the most promising theater defenses, including the Navy wide-area system. Only Russian recalcitrance and over-reaching in seeking greater restraints on theater missile defense have prevented consummation of the agreement and converting the ABM Treaty into an ABM-TMD treaty. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In demonstrating such a slavish adherence to a narrow interpretation of the ABM Treaty, the Administration in effect is binding the U.S. unilaterally to perceived rather than real treaty constraints. This theological devotion to the treaty has resulted in deliberate "dumbing down" of theater defense designs rather than making the systems as capable as available technology will permit. For example, the Navy wide-area defense is not being designed to exploit high velocity interceptors or external sensor data to maximize its reach, because that capability also would enable the system to defend the United States.<sup>15</sup>  The THAAD system is not being allowed to use any external sensor data to extend its reach and effectiveness.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the President's promise to "work closely with the Congress," he has largely ignored the concerns of Congress in favor of accommodating Russian demands to limit U.S. missile defenses through a renegotiated ABM Treaty. But Members of Congress are becoming increasingly disturbed at the Administration's position. Late last year, Representative Martin Hoke (R-OH) introduced a bill directing the Administration to exercise its rights to withdraw from the ABM Treaty,<sup>16</sup> though it has not yet been debated. More recently, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), introduced a similar bill in the Senate.<sup>17</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 With these bills pending, the stage is set for hearings and a serious debate in both the Senate and the House on these issues vital to the nation's security. If the Administration expands the ABM Treaty to cover advanced theater systems and also agrees to "multi-lateralize" the treaty by including the states of the former Soviet Union, it will be making substantive changes in the treaty. These changes must come before the Senate for its consent. Otherwise, the Senate's constitutional prerogatives in treaty-making will be undermined, as will national security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It has become manifestly clear that no effective defense of the American people can be built consistent with ABM Treaty limits. And if the Administration has its way, no highly effective theater defense will be built either. The Administration has shown clearly that it prefers defending the Treaty to defending Americans.
<p>
<b>TEAM B RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B believes the congressional leadership, having made clear its fundamental differences with the Administration, should press for deployment of the least expensive, most effective near-term defenses technically achievable. Moreover, Team B concludes that the ABM Treaty must be dealt with in a manner consistent with these primary objectives. Recommendations to meet the latest developments are to:
<p><ul>
<li> Review the Clinton Administration's ballistic missile threat assessment and direct a more prudent approach to accelerate the development of appropriate responses;
<p>
<li> Review the role of the ABM Treaty in artificially limiting the development of the most effective defenses now technologically feasible and direct that the most effective, affordable near-term defenses be developed unconstrained by the ABM Treaty and then deployed at an accelerated pace;
<p>
<li> Use all available congressional powers and prerogatives to move the U.S. toward withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after giving six months' notice, which it has the right to do under Article XV;
<p>
<li> Redirect last year's consensus objective of deploying ground-based U.S. homeland defenses by 2003 and focus it instead on beginning deployment of sea-based wide-area defenses by the year 2000, unconstrained by the ABM Treaty;
<p>
<li> Direct the Air Force to accelerate deployment of <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space-based sensors beginning as early as 1999, to enhance the effectiveness of both theater and U.S. homeland defenses;
<p>
<li> Direct the Air Force to develop follow-on space-based defenses -- both kinetic-energy interceptors and space-based lasers -- for deployment early in the next decade;
<p>
<li> Direct the Army to focus its efforts on developing and deploying ground-based theater missile defenses to support overseas U.S. troops and allies; restore the $2 billion recently removed by the Administration from the multi-year THAAD budget; and re-establish 2000 as the initial deployment date;
<p>
<li> Direct the Ballistic Missile Defense Office to assure development of an integrated but open architecture for the battle management, command, control, and communications to support these defense systems.
</ul><p>
<b>Revised Spending Plan</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress's failure to override the President's veto of the FY 1996 defense bill demonstrates the futility of pursuing relatively expensive yet less effective ground-based national missile defenses in the hope of getting at least some anti-missile protection deployed. Team B believes Congress instead should direct the accelerated development and deployment of the most effective sea-based and space-based wide-area defenses. Developing a boost-phase intercept capability with these and other systems also should be a high priority. These systems also will defend American forces and allies abroad, reducing the requirements for ground-based theater missile defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This approach will require that missile defense funds, including those already appropriated and those currently being applied to the Clinton Administration's so-called 3+3 Deployment Readiness Program, be spent instead on sea- and space-based defense programs. The highest priority should be assigned to deploying the Navy wide-area defense beginning in the year 2000. This would provide the earliest U.S. homeland defense. Evolutionary improvements to increase its effectiveness should occur as the relevant technologies mature. This is needed to maximize the system's ability to protect the U.S. homeland. Second, the development of space-based sensors and space-based defenses, both kinetic-energy interceptors and lasers, should be revived and accelerated. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a href="bg1074t1.gif">Table 1</a> provides recommended funding levels, including additional funds in 1996 which can be accommodated by reprogramming funds already appropriated under the National Missile Defense program element from ground-based defenses to sea- and space-based defenses. (The recommended funding is consistent with last year's Team B report, given that six months of FY 1996 already have been lost.)
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As discussed in last year's Team B report, the out-year funding needed for space-based systems will depend on development activities during the next three years. However, Team B continues to believe that the two space-based defense systems are complementary. In fact, for a given effectiveness against advanced threats, it can be shown that the least expensive space-based defense involves both. With the necessary funding, deployment can begin shortly after the year 2000. For planning purposes consistent with this objective, Team B recommends that $1.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $3 billion, respectively, be budgeted for 1999, 2000, and 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This recommendation to forego continued commitment to a ground-based defense for protection of the U.S. homeland is intended to address the inherent shortcomings of ground-based systems discussed in the 1995 Team B report. In short, they can be overcome by likely countermeasures, they are expensive, and they are difficult to deploy in peacetime -- even more so in crisis or war. The Clinton Administration suggests that a very limited "ABM Treaty compliant" single site defense might cost less than $5 billion.<sup>18</sup>  Team regards this as a waste of scarce missile defense dollars. Such a significant expenditure of funds on relatively ineffective ground-based defenses will only delay building urgently needed, more effective, and less expensive sea-based and space-based defenses. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Team B recommends that FY 1996 funds for National Missile Defense (NMD) be redirected from the ground-based NMD program now planned toward accelerating more effective and less expensive sea-based and space-based wide area defense programs. Future NMD funds should be directed toward providing evolutionary technical improvements to the initial Navy wide-area defense system in order to give it the most capable performance against the full spectrum of future threats to the United States. The NMD budget line should also include about $150 million per year to continue programs to defeat countermeasures and support critical sensor programs that will enhance the midcourse intercept capability of all defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The recommended funding for the technology line would restore key efforts against likely countermeasures. The most important countermeasure anticipated in the relatively near future is a "clustered submunition" that disperses numerous warheads shortly after a missile's boost phase is completed. This countermeasure would overcome the limited theater missile defenses currently being developed by the Clinton Administration. To defeat it would require a boost-phase defense -- that is, destroying the entire missile/warhead package before the submunitions can be released. But all boost-phase defenses that could be deployed in the near term were canceled by the Clinton Administration in 1993. Restoring them therefore should receive high priority. The funding recommended above should be sufficient for a technology demonstration within three years of a high-acceleration boost-phase interceptor like the <I>Raptor Talon</I> concept.
<p>
<b>The Final Hurdle: The ABM Treaty</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B again recommends that Congress do all within its power to restrain the Clinton Administration's penchant for negotiating additional treaty limits on U.S. defenses. Instead, the U.S. should indicate clearly to the Russians that the U.S. intends to provide effective wide area defenses for the American people and their overseas troops, friends, and allies -- and that it would prefer to do so with Russia's agreement. However, the U.S. should be explicitly clear that unless Russia begins to cooperate immediately, it will exercise its right to withdraw from the ABM Treaty and proceed to build defenses unilaterally.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be obvious to any competent U.S. negotiator that the Russians will agree only if they believe that the U.S. is prepared to proceed unilaterally. The best way to move in this direction is to announce that the strategic situation has changed significantly since the ABM Treaty was negotiated in 1972 and that, because the new world disorder presents a number of potential threats to America's supreme interests, the U.S. intends to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. If the treaty no longer serves America's national security interests, the U.S. has every right to withdraw, and this right is made clear in Article XV. Once this step is taken the U.S. should proceed to build the effective defenses recommended above as quickly as possible.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration refuses to give serious consideration to building an effective missile defense program, whether to protect the U.S. homeland or U.S. troops abroad. Team B continues to recommend that global defenses be deployed urgently -- initially from the sea and then from space. These are the least expensive and most effective defenses possible, and the U.S. can begin their deployment by the end of the decade if it has the political will to do so. As Team B concluded in 1995, the ultimate issue in the missile defense debate is not technology, nor even cost, but political will.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The test of the nation's political will to defend itself -- and a test of the U.S. Senate's determination to defend its constitutional prerogatives -- will be in dealing with the 1972 ABM Treaty. Some in Congress and the defense community believe the ABM Treaty is not a near-term problem; they think dealing with the treaty can be deferred to some distant future. But they are wrong. The ABM Treaty is stifling the development of today's most capable and effective defense systems and perpetuating the vulnerability of the American people and their troops, bases, and allies overseas. Continuing to appease the Russians in ABM Treaty negotiations delays U.S. efforts to build needed defenses, and may permanently impair American interests. Team B believes that U.S. supreme interests are threatened by realities that are fundamentally different from those of the Cold War. The time has come for the U.S. to exercise its Article XV right and, as a matter of supreme national interest, withdraw from the ABM Treaty and build the needed defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution confers on the U.S. Congress the power and the duty to "provide for the common Defence."  This entails the raising, support, and regulation of the nation's armed forces. In other words, Congress shares the responsibility for national security with the President, the commander in chief. This shared but direct responsibility for the security of the nation is an important element of the constitutional system of checks and balances.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration continues to keep Americans vulnerable while hiding behind a smokescreen of positive sounding but meaningless policy declarations. It is now clear that the Clinton Administration will remain derelict in the duties required of the office of the commander in chief by failing to provide for the common defense. Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to check the excesses of the executive branch. It must stop the improper attempts to broaden the ABM Treaty and counterbalance the executive's dereliction of duty by pressing for the most capable and effective missile defense technology permits. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Someday soon, it is a near certainty that U.S. forces abroad, and possibly even the U.S. homeland, will come under ballistic missile attack. Such an attack may occur with missiles carrying chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. If that day comes, the American people will hold responsible all those in positions of public trust who failed to carry out their constitutional and moral duty.

<li>    It is commonly though incorrectly assumed that the technology is most mature for ground-based defenses because such defenses have been under development longest, and that such defenses are the least expensive. In fact, effective wide-area defenses can be deployed sooner at sea and in space. Contrary to conventional wisdom, advances in technology have been flowing from research on space-based systems to ground-based systems, not the other way around. Finally, as discussed in the 1995 Team B report, sea-based and space-based defenses would be far less expensive and more effective in providing the needed wide-area defensive coverage.<p>

<li>    Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) discussed his misgivings with the "new" NIE in a January 18, 1996, speech at an AIAA conference in Monterey, California (mimeograph).

 <li>   Over the past year, at least seven letters from the congressional leadership have directed the Clinton Administration to cease its efforts to limit theater and U.S. homeland defenses and to "multilateralize" the ABM Treaty -- even to halt the negotiations that seem determined to proceed in this direction despite repeated statements of congressional concern. See, for example, Bill Gertz, "Deal With Russia Could Hamper Missile Defenses," <I>The Washington Times</I>, December 4, 1995. In one of the most recent letters, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and 12 chairmen of defense and foreign affairs committees and subcommittees wrote President Clinton on February 12, 1996, expressing their strong objections to continuing negotiations with Russia that "will impede our ability to defend America and its interests" and indicating their intent to hold related hearings in the near future.<p>
<li>    Then Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch explained to the Navy League on April 13, 1995, that the Clinton Administration's version of the Navy Upper Tier -- or wide area -- defense was treaty-compliant because it was constrained to use only data from the SPY-1 radar co-located with its interceptors. See Bill Gertz, "Navy Missile Defense Shouldn't Be Issue In Talks," <I>The Washington Times</I>, April 14, 1995, p. A3. What he did not reveal was that this constraint, especially in conjunction with the interceptor velocity limits being discussed with the Russians, limits the Navy system's effectiveness as a theater defense system and precludes it from having a capability to defend the U.S.<p>
 <li>  Kerry Gildee, "Bill Introduced in House Calls for U.S. to Abandon ABM Treaty," <I>Defense Daily</I>, October 18, 1995, p. 77.<p>
<li>   Bill Gertz, "Helms Wants U.S. Out of ABM Treaty," <I>The Washington Times</I>, February 7, 1996, p. A3.<p>
 <li>   The least expensive (perhaps $2-3 billion) and nearest term (perhaps within four years) ground-based defense would involve modifying Minuteman missiles and command and control software to exploit the current Minuteman infrastructure. However, this system would have limited capability against only a few missiles (in his April 27, 1995, testimony before the House Budget Committee, Defense Secretary Perry acknowledged that a defense would be needed against several times this number -- i.e. 10-20 warheads; on September 28, 1995, he told the Regional Commerce and Growth Association of St. Louis, Missouri, that a reasonable attack to design against would include "several dozen missiles"). There are likely to be substantial operational constraints (how would the U.S. persuade Russia that Minuteman defensive missiles launched at North Korean missiles were not Minuteman offensive missiles launched at Russia?), and these missiles would be less effective than sea-based wide-area defenses that could be deployed as soon for the same price -- and defend American overseas troops, friends, and allies as well.<p>
<li>    During the past year, bills that support this policy have been introduced in the Senate by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) and in the House by Representative Martin Hoke (R-OH). Hearings and floor debate could be very useful in firming up a clear U.S. policy regarding the need to move beyond the ABM Treaty and build effective defenses that increase the security of the U.S. and its friends and allies in the post-Cold War world.

<title>Clinton Is Bypassing the Senate on the ABM Treaty -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>CLINTON IS BYPASSING THE SENATE ON THE ABM TREATY</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 266<br>
December 15, 1995<br>
<p>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 867, "Removing the ABM Treaty Obstacle to U.S. and 
Soviet Defenses Against Missiles," November 15, 1991.)
<p>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
The Clinton Administration has reached a "framework agreement" with Russia to resolve two long-
standing disputes over the future and scope of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) 
Treaty.<sup>1 </sup>  The ABM Treaty all but bars the United States from deploying defenses 
against long-range ballistic missiles. The agreement with Russia would do two things: 
<p><ol>
<li>Name which republics of the now-defunct Soviet Union are subject to the treaty; and 

<li>Define a new dividing line between defenses against long-range missiles, which are subject to 
the ABM Treaty's restrictions, and defenses against shorter-range missiles, which are not. 
</ol><p>
The U.S. Constitution requires that the executive branch submit these new agreements to the Senate 
for its advice and consent. Failing to do so would be illegal.
<p>
Yet this is exactly what President Bill Clinton intends to do. The President wants the new 
agreement with Russia to be implemented as an "agreed statement" in the Standing Consultative 
Commission (SCC), a joint U.S.-Soviet committee established in 1972 to consult on the details of 
implementing the ABM Treaty. "Agreed statements" in the SCC do not require the consent of the 
Senate. In effect, the Clinton Administration is attempting to bypass the Senate, thereby 
circumventing its constitutional role in the ratification of international treaties. This is not only 
illegal; it is strategically unwise. The Senate needs to ensure that its constitutional prerogatives are 
preserved. It needs to take action to force the Clinton Administration to submit the U.S.-Russian 
agreement to the Senate for its advice and consent.
<p>

<b>The Framework Agreement with Russia</b>
<p>
While the official text of the framework agreement between the U.S. and Russia has not been made 
public officially, the press has published a classified version of it.<sup>2 </sup>  From public 
reports, it is clear that the agreement framework attempts to resolve two problems regarding the 
ABM Treaty. These problems have remained ever since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in December 
1991, which effectively nullified America's previous partner in the ABM Treaty -- the Soviet 
Union.
<p>
<b>Problem #1</b>: The first is designating which republics of the former Soviet Union would 
replace the U.S.S.R. as the new legally bound partners of the treaty. Press reports reveal that the 
Clinton Administration plans to "multilateralize" the treaty by designating several of the 15 former 
Soviet republics as the new treaty partners.<sup>3 </sup>  These republics would include Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, among others.
<p>
<b>Problem #2</b>: The second unresolved problem is to define a new line between defenses 
against long-range (strategic ballistic) missiles, which are subject to ABM Treaty restrictions, and 
defenses against shorter-range missiles, which are not. The original language in the text of the 
ABM Treaty is ambiguous. Article II both fails to define "strategic ballistic missiles" and Article VI 
fails to explain exactly when non-ABM systems are given an ABM capability or are tested in "an 
ABM mode."
<p>
The framework agreement would establish entirely new definitions for these systems. Any anti-
missile interceptor tested against a target missile with a velocity of 3.1 miles per second or higher 
and a range of 2,175 miles would be considered a defense against strategic (long-range) ballistic 
missiles. Therefore, such an interceptor would be subject to the treaty. Second, the agreement 
would impose a limit on the speed of interceptors. If the interceptor speed is 1.9 miles per second or 
less, it would not be regarded as a treaty-limited, strategic defense system. An interceptor with a 
speed in excess of 1.9 miles per second would be presumed to be a strategic defense interceptor and 
thus subject to the ABM Treaty. 
<p>
In addition, the framework agreement includes a number of "confidence-building measures."  One 
would be to impose restrictions on the number and location of defenses against shorter-range 
missiles deployed by the U.S. The purpose would be to ensure that short-range missile defenses 
cannot be used as interceptors against the long-range missiles deployed by Russia.
<p>
The new definitions and restrictions established in the framework agreement apparently are 
designed to kill the Navy Upper Tier system, a missile defense system the Navy is developing for 
use on cruisers. The Navy Upper Tier's interceptor, called the <i>Standard</i> missile, has a 
velocity of greater than 1.9 miles per second; therefore, it would be subject to ABM Treaty 
restrictions under the framework agreement. Since Article V of the ABM Treaty prohibits the 
development, testing, and deployment of interceptors on mobile platforms such as ships, the 
velocity for the <i>Standard</i> missile would have to be reduced to comply with the Treaty. This 
would weaken the capability of the missile, effectively making it less useful as a defense against 
ballistic missiles. 
<p>
Moreover, the confidence-building measures contained in the agreement would give the Russians 
and other countries a veto over where and in what numbers the Upper Tier ships may be deployed. 
The reason: The agreement requires the U.S. to provide assurances to its ABM Treaty partners that 
deployed defenses against short-range missiles will not pose a realistic threat to long-range 
missiles. But this means that Russia and other countries, not the U.S., will judge whether these 
deployments are a threat. If they feel threatened by U.S. defenses, they simply will veto America's 
deployment of the Upper Tier ships.
<p>
<b>Clinton Bypasses the Senate</b>
<p>
Anticipating that the Clinton Administration was likely to bypass the Senate with a new resolution 
on the ABM Treaty, Congress last year sought to ensure that an agreement with Russia and perhaps 
several other republics of the former Soviet Union would be subject to review by the Senate. 
Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337) 
states: "The United States shall not be bound by any international agreement entered into by the 
President that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is entered 
pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution."
<p>
In the past, the Clinton Administration has argued that it could not pledge in advance to submit 
ABM Treaty agreements to the Senate because it could not know whether their content would 
warrant Senate review. Of course, the content of the agreement is now known, but the Clinton 
Administration still refuses to submit the agreement to the Senate. Instead, it rushed to a meeting of 
the Standing Consultative Commission, on December 4, in order to formalize the agreement with 
the Russians. All outward appearances indicate that the Administration intends to treat the 
agreement as an SCC "agreed statement" not subject to Senate review.
<p>
In short, the Clinton Administration apparently plans to present the Senate with a <i>fait 
accompli</i>. The President's advisors may try to argue that the Russian agreement does not 
substantively modify the ABM Treaty. But this would make a mockery of the law and the facts. 
The very first clause of the ABM Treaty begins by saying that "The United States of America and 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, hereinafter referred to as the Parties" will be subject to the 
treaty. Surely, striking the reference to the Soviet Union and replacing it with the names of as many 
as 12 countries substantively modifies the ABM Treaty.
<p>
Changing the names of the parties amounts to more than a formality. It could result in a 
fundamental change in the deployment restrictions of the treaty. A 1974 protocol to the treaty limits 
each side to one ABM site of 100 interceptors.<sup>4 </sup>  If 12 states are designated to replace 
the Soviet Union, each as a legal party to the treaty, then the ABM Treaty now would allow 12 
ABM sites on the territory where it previously allowed only one. Surely, adding 11 new ABM sites 
is a substantive change in the treaty.
<p>
Further, the SCC was designed to work as an implementation forum between two parties. 
Substantive arrangements for the functioning of the SCC must change if more than two states are 
participating. Under the new arrangement, the U.S. would face as many as 12 representatives on the 
other side of the table instead of one. One of those representatives is certain to be Russia. Most of 
the other countries in the SCC would likely be under the influence of Russia and might even form a 
voting bloc with Russia, thereby easily outvoting the U.S. in settling disputes. It would be absurd to 
argue that changing the SCC in this way is not substantive.
<p>

<b>What the Senate Should Do</b>
<p>
The impending actions by the Clinton Administration present the Senate with a challenge to its 
treaty-making authority. The Senate has political and legal tools at its disposal to confront the 
Clinton Administration's attempts to bypass it.
<p>
The political tool is to withhold Senate action on matters deemed important by the President until 
the agreement is submitted to the Senate. The logical targets of delay by the Senate would be other 
treaties, including the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II 
(START II), and, if the dispute carries on beyond next year, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban 
Treaty as well.<sup>5 </sup>  The Senate leadership should make it clear that it will not complete 
action on any of these treaties if the Administration tries to circumvent the Senate with its changes 
in the ABM Treaty.<sup>6 </sup>
<p>
The legal tool is for the Senate to pass a resolution calling on President Clinton to submit the 
framework agreement for the advice and consent of the Senate. Assuming Clinton refused, the 
Senate could instruct its Office of Legal Counsel to file suit against the Clinton Administration with 
the intent of barring implementation of an ABM Treaty agreement that does not have Senate 
approval. While the statute governing the operation of the Senate's Office of Legal Counsel does 
not expressly authorize initiating lawsuits on behalf of the Senate as an institution, it would be 
possible for the Senate leadership to authorize this action by adopting a Senate resolution. Further, 
an individual member of the Senate could file a similar suit on his or her own. It would be 
preferable, however, for the Office of Legal Counsel to file the suit and speak for the Senate as an 
institution.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The framework agreement which the Clinton Administration has reached with Russia, assuming it 
is formalized in the coming days, will have a profound impact on the nation's security. It will 
determine which countries become ABM Treaty partners, change the way the ABM Treaty 
functions, and impose new restrictions on U.S. programs for fielding defenses against both shorter-
range and long-range missiles. The voice of the Senate deserves to be heard on such important 
matters.
<p>
However, hearing the Senate's voice appears to be too inconvenient for the President. He is trying 
to bypass the Senate by changing the ABM Treaty on his own, without submitting his changes to 
the Senate for its advice and consent. This is patently illegal. The treaty-making powers vested in 
the Senate by the Constitution exist to protect the nation's security, not to suit the convenience of 
the Clinton Administration. The Senate should be prepared to fight to uphold both its 
responsibilities and the nation's security. The Administration's framework agreement on the ABM 
Treaty should be brought before the Senate for its advice and consent.

<title>The Challenge of Revolutionary Iran - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>THE CHALLENGE OF REVOLUTIONARY IRAN</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Committee Brief No. 24<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Middle Eastern travels of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan have sparked considerable controversy. Several Congressmen have called for a government investigation of the trip, including Representative Peter King, who gave a persuasive speech on this subject at The Heritage Foundation on March 6.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, I would like to focus on the foreign activities of Iran, which I believe poses the greatest threat to America and to American interests of all the countries that Minister Farrakhan visited. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. and Iran have clashed repeatedly over a wide variety of issues since Iran's 1979 revolution, which brought to power radical Islamic fundamentalists led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Bilateral tensions initially flared due to the November 4, 1979, seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants and the subsequent holding of American hostages for 444 days. Iran-U.S. tensions continue to simmer due to Iran's persistent efforts to export its revolution, Iranian support for international terrorism, Iran's ideological hostility to the U.S., and Iran's military buildup, which includes clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran today looms as the chief threat to American interests in the Middle East. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the military defeat and diplomatic isolation of Iraq, Iran's traditional archrival, has given Iran the opportunity to expand its influence. Although Tehran has toned down its revolutionary rhetoric since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, Iran remains a volatile revolutionary state. Tehran continues to denounce the U.S. as "the Global Arrogance," calls for the expulsion of American influence from the Middle East, seeks to discredit and overthrow moderate Arab governments friendly to the U.S., advocates the destruction of Israel, and adamantly opposes the U.S.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has increased its financial, political, and military support for radical Islamic fundamentalist movements throughout the Middle East and Southwest Asia. It has developed close ties with Sudan, which it uses as a training ground for Islamic militants from throughout the region. In the short run, Iran poses more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat than a military threat to America and its Middle Eastern allies. In the long run, however, Iran's military buildup, particularly its development programs for nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weaponry, will pose an increasingly grave challenge to the security of American forces and U.S. allies in the region.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S HOSTILE FOREIGN POLICY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, Tehran has seen itself as the leader of the Muslim world. It has sought to export its revolutionary brand of Islam and to radicalize Muslims everywhere. The U.S., which Khomeini referred to as the "Great Satan," is hated for its support of the Iranian regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi; for its support of Israel, which Iranian radicals seek to destroy; and for its support of moderate Arab regimes such as those in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But regardless of its policies, the U.S. is hated for its values and the powerful influence of its culture, which Iranian revolutionaries believe seduces Muslims and undermines Islam. This ideological motivation explains why Iranian-supported terrorists in Lebanon in the 1980s attacked targets affiliated with the American University of Beirut and Christian churches, in addition to the U.S. Marines serving in the multinational peacekeeping force.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1979, Iran has been more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to its neighbors than a military threat. Tehran has enjoyed only limited success in fomenting revolution, in part because Iran's Shiite brand of Islam is shared by only about 15 percent of all Muslims. The Sunni (orthodox) Muslims who make up more than 80 percent of the Islamic world tend to be more respectful of state authority and distrustful of Shiite radicals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's greatest success has come in war-torn Lebanon, where it helped to create, finance, arm, and train the radical Shiite Hezbollah (Party of God) movement. Several hundred Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the militant shock troops of the Iranian revolution, work closely in support of Hezbollah in Lebanon's Bekaa valley. Tehran also supports less powerful Shiite fundamentalist groups in Iraq, Bahrain, and Afghanistan. But Shiite revolutionaries have seized power nowhere outside Iran. In fact, Shiite rebellions have been crushed in Iraq (1991) and Saudi Arabia (1979), and an Iranian-backed coup attempt was quashed in Bahrain in 1981.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported Islamic revolutions, however, now have better prospects for success. The dissolution of the Soviet Union not only has opened up Central Asia to Iranian influence, but also has deprived secular Arab nationalist regimes in Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Syria of a source of political, military, and economic support. The failure of Arab socialism in such countries as Algeria and Egypt has left them with feeble economies unable to absorb the huge number of youths who are entering the labor market. Faced with a bleak economic future, young Arabs are turning to radical fundamentalist movements to find hope and meaning in their lives. Some Arab fundamentalists, radicalized by the Islamic holy war (jihad) against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, have returned home to spearhead anti-government violence in their own countries. Iranian-supported Muslim fundamentalists are well-positioned to exploit the collapse of Soviet communism and Arab socialism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has established good working relations with several Sunni fundamentalist groups since 1990, including Hamas (the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement); Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine; the Islamic Group of Egypt; and similar groups in Algeria, Jordan, and Tunisia. The opening of Arab-Israeli peace talks at the Madrid Conference in October 1991 gave Iran and Palestinian fundamentalists a common interest in disrupting the U.S.-sponsored negotiations by escalating terrorist attacks against Israel. Iran invited a Hamas delegation to attend an October 1992 international conference held in Tehran to coordinate opposition to the peace process. Tehran subsequently agreed to help train Hamas terrorists, give Hamas $30 million over two years, and permit Hamas to open an "embassy" in Tehran. Israeli intelligence officials estimate that Iran now provides 10 to 20 percent of the roughly $70 million in donations that Hamas receives annually from its supporters around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tehran has welcomed the terrorist offensive which Hamas launched against Israel in the last month, killing 62 people in four suicide bombings. The state-run Iranian news service called the bombings "God's retribution."  Despite the worldwide revulsion triggered by the bombings, Iran remains one of Hamas' foremost foreign backers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's efforts to reach out to Sunni fundamentalists have been facilitated by Iran's closest ally, Sudan, which is ruled by the only radical fundamentalist regime in the Arab world. Arab officials maintain that Sudan has helped Iran establish ties with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jordan, the Renaissance fundamentalist movement in Tunisia, and the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S LINKS TO SUDAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has become the chief supporter and ally of Sudan's National Islamic Front, a Sunni fundamentalist movement that came to power following Lt. General Omar Hassan Bashir's 1989 coup. Sudan, Africa's largest state, offers Iran a strategic foothold to outflank Saudi Arabia and extend its revolutionary influence throughout North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Iranian-Sudanese cooperation escalated following President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's December 1991 visit to Sudan. Hundreds of Iranian military advisers and Revolutionary Guards were dispatched to Sudan to help train the Sudanese Army and internal security forces. Iranians also are believed to be assisting Sudan's radical regime in its long-running war against Christian and animist rebels in southern Sudan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although Iran claims that most of these personnel in Sudan are engaged in construction projects, persistent reports indicate that the Revolutionary Guards are training Islamic fundamentalist revolutionaries and terrorists, primarily from Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia. U.S. officials maintain that Iranians train terrorists in five camps around Khartoum that are equipped and financed by Iran. The Egyptian government contends that several thousand Egyptian fundamentalists have received training from Iranians in Sudanese camps. Egyptian intelligence officials claim to have evidence that Iran was responsible for training and organizing terrorists who have attacked foreign tourists in Egypt. Algeria expelled Iranian diplomats in November 1992 and broke diplomatic relations with Iran in March 1993 after accusing Tehran of supporting Islamic radicals who have waged a bloody guerrilla war against Algeria's military regime that has resulted in the deaths of over 30,000 Algerians since 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan has become in effect a "new Lebanon" where Iranian revolutionaries arm, train, and equip Arab fundamentalists for political violence while denying responsibility for their actions. Significantly, Iran's former ambassador to Sudan, Majid Kamal, helped create Hezbollah when he was the Iranian charg d'affaires in Beirut in the early 1980s. But unlike Lebanon, where Iran's freedom of action is constrained by Syria's military domination, the fundamentalist Sudanese government fully shares Iran's revolutionary goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan also is a valuable ally for Iran because of its key role in helping Iran to expand its contacts with Sunni fundamentalists, especially Egyptian and Palestinian groups opposed to peace negotiations with Israel. Iranian-supported Egyptian fundamentalists easily can infiltrate the porous Sudanese-Egyptian border, seeking to overthrow the Egyptian government. The Islamic Group, which considers Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman to be its spiritual leader, has launched terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of Egyptians since early 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Egypt is one of Iran's most important targets for subversion because of its historic role as the preeminent Arab power. An Islamic revolution in Egypt would send shock waves throughout the Arab world and incite Islamic revolution elsewhere. Moreover, a radical fundamentalist Egypt would break its peace treaty with Israel and render moot the U.S.-backed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which Iran has denounced as "treason."  As the leading Muslim power unequivocally opposed to Israel's existence, Iran stands to gain much from prolonging the Arab-Israeli conflict.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S SUPPORT OF TERRORISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran is the world's "most active state sponsor of international terrorism and continues to be directly involved in planning and executing terrorist acts," according to the State Department's most recent report on terrorism, <I>Patterns of Global Terrorism, 1994</i>, which was published in April 1995. Iranian intelligence agencies support terrorism, either directly or through extremist groups, primarily aimed against Iranian opposition movements, Israel, or moderate Arab regimes. Tehran has established over 20 ideological and military training camps in Iran, Lebanon, and Sudan staffed by Arabic-speaking Revolutionary Guards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hezbollah, Iran's most important surrogate, has become the "world's principal international terrorist organization," according to former CIA Director James Woolsey, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 28, 1993. The Lebanon-based organization has established groups of supporters as far away as Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, and South America. Hezbollah's long list of terrorist atrocities includes the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks at Beirut Airport, and the kidnapping of most of the 15 American hostages held in Lebanon between 1984 and 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The last American hostages held in Lebanon were released by Hezbollah at Iran's direction in late 1991 after Tehran concluded that it could gain nothing from holding the hostages any longer. Iran's use of terrorism as an instrument of policy remains undiminished, however. In recent years, Tehran has stepped up its terrorist attacks against Iranian exile leaders and Israel. More than a dozen Iranian dissidents have been assassinated in European cities since 1987, including the August 1991 murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris and the September 1992 murders of four Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's terrorist campaign against exiled opposition activists appears to be growing in intensity in recent months. On February 20, 1996, two Iranian exiles were assassinated in Turkey. On March 2, two Sunni Iranian clerics were assassinated in Pakistan. And on March 7, another Iranian opposition activist was assassinated in Baghdad, the sixth killed inside Iraq since May 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's assassins also have struck inside the United States. Iranian political activist Ali A. Tabatabai, the founder of the Iran Freedom Foundation, was murdered at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, on July 22, 1980.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Although Iranians recently have not been caught launching terrorist attacks on American targets, Iran furnishes substantial financial, logistical, and training support to terrorist groups that continue to target Americans. Tehran provided financial support, at a minimum, for some of the Islamic militants arrested for the February 1993 bombing that killed six people at the World Trade Center in New York. Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and guided the bombers, long has been funded by Iran's intelligence service, according to Vincent Cannistraro, former head of CIA counterterrorism operations. Sheik Omar reportedly was regularly given large sums of money by Iran's delegation to the United Nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although no direct Iranian participation has been established in the World Trade Center bombing, senior U.S. officials warned in March 1993 that Iranian-backed terrorist groups appeared to be becoming more aggressive. Iran also reportedly has begun cooperating with non-fundamentalist terrorist groups such as the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian terrorist group that has launched some of the bloodiest and most indiscriminate terrorist attacks, such as the December 1985 massacres at the Rome and Vienna airports. Iran also financially supports the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), a pro-Syrian group which it reportedly asked in 1988 to bomb a U.S. airliner in retaliation for the July 1988 accidental downing of an Iranian airliner by the <I>U.S.S. Vincennes</I>. The plot was disrupted by the arrest of a terrorist cell in Germany in October 1988. Libyan agents reportedly then bombed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported terrorists have been particularly active against targets in Turkey. The Turkish Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility in 1992 for the murder of an Israeli diplomat and the bombing of an Istanbul synagogue. It also is believed to be responsible for a series of murders of Turkish journalists. Iran also supports the Marxist Kurdish Workers' Party, which has waged a long-running terrorist war against the government in eastern Turkey. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But in recent years it has been Israel that has been the prime foreign target of Iran's terror campaign. Iran was involved in the March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which killed 29 people. In March 1994, three Iranian agents were arrested in Thailand after an abortive attempt to detonate a truck bomb at the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. Iranian involvement is also suspected in the July 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 96 people. Iran continues to support Hezbollah's terrorist offensive against Israeli forces along the Lebanese-Israeli border, as well as the terrorist operations of Hamas inside Israel. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Under Iranian tutelage, Sudan has emerged as a leading sponsor of international terrorism. Sudan has given sanctuary to a wide spectrum of terrorist groups, including many Arab militants who participated in the fundamentalist jihad in Afghanistan. Sudan gave Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman sanctuary before he moved to New York. Two Sudanese diplomats were implicated in the aborted plot by eight of the Sheik's followers to bomb the United Nations headquarters in New York. Moreover, five of the eight suspected terrorists arrested for the plot in June 1993 were Sudanese. Sudan's escalating involvement in international terrorism led Washington in August 1993 to add Sudan to the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism, which also has included Iran since 1984. This prohibits the transfer of U.S. military equipment, militarily useful civilian technology, and foreign aid to the terrorist state, strips it of favorable trade privileges, and requires the U.S. to block loans by international financial institutions.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S MILITARY BUILDUP</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran currently poses only a limited conventional military threat to its neighbors. Since the 1979 revolution, its armed forces have been weakened by political purges, huge losses of up to 60 percent of their major weapons systems in the eight-year war with Iraq, and shortages of spare parts for U.S. and Western arms supplied before 1979. But President Rafsanjani has accorded a high priority to building Iran's military strength. Shortly after coming to power in July 1989, Rafsanjani traveled to Moscow to sign a $1.9 billion arms deal that included 48 modern MiG-29 <I>Fulcrum</I> fighters and 100 T-72 tanks. His government, in January 1990, allocated $2 billion per year for five years to buy advanced arms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's ambitious military plans have sparked considerable concern that Tehran seeks to establish regional hegemony by building its military capabilities far beyond its legitimate defense needs. Iran's long-term objective reportedly is to acquire a modern air force of roughly 300 advanced combat aircraft; a modern army with 5,000 to 6,000 tanks, 2,000 self-propelled artillery pieces, and thousands of armored personnel carriers; and a navy upgraded with three advanced Russian <I>Kilo</I>-class submarines and scores of fast patrol boats armed with missiles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has purchased hundreds of ballistic missiles and the technology to produce them from North Korea and China. Tehran has acquired at least 300 SCUD-B surface-to-surface missiles with a range of approximately 185 miles, and an unknown number of improved SCUD-Cs, which have a range of approximately 370 miles. These missiles enable Iran to attack states across the Persian Gulf. Iran also reportedly has agreed to buy 150 North Korean Nodong 1 missiles with an estimated range of over 600 miles. These surface-to-surface missiles are capable of delivering conventional, chemical, or nuclear warheads on targets as far away as Israel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's missile buildup is especially worrisome given Tehran's determined efforts to build weapons of mass destruction. Iran has "the most active chemical warfare program" in the Third World, according to an anonymous U.S. government official quoted in the <I>Washington Post</I> on March 8, 1996. The CIA estimates that Iran has produced and stockpiled up to 2,000 tons of chemical warfare agents, which it used at least once during the Iran-Iraq war. Iran also has an active biological warfare program and is trying to buy biological agents from Europe that could be useful in developing such weapons, according to U.S. intelligence sources. Some U.S. experts believe that Iran already may have produced biological weapons in the form of toxins or anthrax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the West's chief worry is Iran's effort to develop nuclear weapons, which has been making steady progress under the cover of Iran's civilian nuclear power program. CIA Director John Deutch stated in November 1995 that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in as little as four years if it received extensive foreign assistance. American intelligence analysts have reported that Iranian acquisition teams have shopped for weapons-related nuclear equipment and nuclear scientists in the former Soviet Union, concentrating on Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In conclusion, although Iran now poses primarily an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to American interests in the Middle East and the Muslim world, in the long run Iran will pose an increasingly grave military threat to the security of the U.S., American military forces in the Middle East, and American allies in the region.

<h3>NATO EXPANSION: MYTHS AND REALITIES</h3>

By  W. Bruce Weinrod<sup>1</sup>
<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
<br>
Committee Brief No. 23
<br>
March 1, 1996<BR>
<hr width=50%></center>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Momentum for the admission of new members into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) is increasing. NATO may well invite
new members to join the alliance before the turn of the century.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The case for admitting new members to NATO is persuasive. An expanded
NATO will reinforce peace and freedom In Europe and thus will
support important U.S. interests and objectives. However, crucial
decisions related to NATO expansion have yet to be made. Little
information is available about the specifics of NATO expansion,
and U.S. public and congressional debate on whether NATO should
expand has just begun. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Examining the details of the NATO expansion process and its implications
for U.S. interests is both inevitable and necessary. Some critics
of NATO expansion have raised objections which are spurious, misleading,
or inaccurate; others have raised legitimate concerns which deserve
consideration. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the process of NATO expansion to be successful, the American
public and Congress will have to sort through the myths and realities
of the issue. NATO enlargement raises two broad and interrelated
sets of issues: whether NATO expansion as such is a good idea
and (assuming NATO expansion occurs) how the expansion process
can best proceed.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>SHOULD NATO EXPAND?</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics suggest that there exist no real security threats justifying
an increased NATO membership. Therefore, the argument goes, there
is no reason to expand. But NATO expansion is important, not primarily
to defend against an imminent attack, but rather as a deterrent
against potential future security threats and an insurance policy
against uncertainties.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Bringing in new members would send a signal to any potential aggressor
that it would pay a substantial price for any expansionist ambitions
against nations which have become a part of the larger Western
community of nations. An expanded NATO also would reinforce the
post-World War II effort to envelop Germany in a broader European
framework and would make it highly unlikely that the region to
NATO's immediate east would emerge as an unstable geopolitical
vacuum between Germany and Russia.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As it did for many Western European nations in the early post-World
War II years, NATO can reinforce the consolidation of free political
and economic institutions in the emerging but fragile democracies
of Central Europe. The alliance can do this by providing an overarching
security umbrella and a clear symbol that such nations are being
welcomed as part of the West.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In any event, while Western Europe is indeed safer and more secure
after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the rest of Europe contains
instabilities of concern. Most important, if a resurgent extreme
nationalist leadership in Russia were to appear, it would be easier
to deter if NATO already had formalized membership for nations
between Russia and Western Europe.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>&quot;New Lines&quot; and European Stability</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A major contention of critics of NATO expansion is that adding
members to NATO inevitably will create &quot;new lines&quot; of
instability in Europe between members and non-members. The argument
is that nations not invited to join NATO (it is generally assumed
that nations such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary would
be admitted first) would be discouraged and alienated from NATO
and the West. As a result, these uninvited nations might join
rival alliances or take other actions which would increase geopolitical
instability.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This will not necessarily happen. But in any event, the most important
new lines in Europe already have been created as a result of the
dissolution of the Soviet empire. Adding new members to NATO would
only reflect the new geopolitical realities demonstrated in the
preferences of many nations to NATO's east for close political,
economic, cultural, and security ties to the West<sup>3</sup>. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ultimate NATO objective should be the ending of lines and
the extension of the free society throughout Europe. However,
from a Western security perspective, if dividing lines are to
exist in the near term, it is preferable that these lines be as
far to the east as practicable. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Russia and NATO Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Concern has been expressed that admitting new members into NATO
will have a negative impact on Russia and its relationship to
the West. These critics note comments such as President Boris
Yeltsin's September 6, 1995, statement that NATO expansion &quot;would
plunge Europe into the flames of war&quot; and a remark by General
Alexander Lebed (a potential 1996 candidate for Russian President)
that it &quot;would mark the beginning of World War III.&quot;<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Overheated Russian rhetoric, however, should be kept in perspective.
Moscow has changed its position on important NATO-related issues:
After initial opposition, Russia acquiesced in NATO bombing in
Bosnia; and Russia joined the NATO Partnership for Peace (PFP)
after a lengthy period of hesitation. Further, there are forces
in Russia which view NATO expansion as a positive development
for Russia itself; and even among those opposed to NATO expansion,
there are many realists who understand, as the influential Council
for Foreign and Defense Policy puts it, that &quot;even in the
case of enlargement, the military threat is not likely to increase.&quot;<sup>5</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another argument is that NATO enlargement would undercut reform
forces in Russia and provide a catalyst for the advancement of
extreme authoritarian nationalist factions and their anti-Western
agenda. However, if authoritarian nationalists come to power again
in Russia, it will be due not to increased NATO membership, but
to more fundamental systemic factors inside Russia. For example,
the issue of NATO expansion was not even a marginal reason for
the strong showing of Communist and other anti-Western factions
in the December 1995 Russian Parliamentary elections. The reality
is that the issue of NATO expansion can have only a marginal effect
on whether democracy prevails in post-Communist Russia and on
Moscow's international role.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If authoritarian nationalists take power, their attitude towards
the West will not be shaped primarily by whether NATO expands.
For such ideologues, the West is the adversary not because of
what it does, but because of what it is and what it stands for.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some critics oppose NATO's enlargement now but suggest that expansion
could be appropriate if and when Russia posed a renewed threat
to the West. However, expanding NATO when no threat exists would
be a much smoother and more positive action because enlargement
in the context of a reassertive Russia inevitably would be criticized
as &quot;destabilizing&quot; or &quot;provocative.&quot;  Further,
it would prove more difficult for NATO members to agree on enlargement
should Russia be seen as a renewed threat.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A democratic Russia should accept NATO enlargement for two principal
reasons: first, it will encourage the consolidation of democracy
in neighboring nations, which in turn will reinforce democracy
in Russia; and second, it will make unlikely the kind of regional
instability to Russia's west which would divert attention away
from domestic reform.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The West, sensibly, is treating Russia constructively as it did
Germany after World War II, rather than vindictively as it did
after World War I. It is up to Russia to respond positively to
that wise policy. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Security Obligations and Cohesiveness</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics of NATO expansion suggest that by taking on new security
commitments, NATO may be drawn into numerous ethnic or other sub-regional
disputes. NATO need not make this a primary mission. NATO can
avoid such an outcome by constraining the ability of newly admitted
members to draw NATO into localized disputes, and by developing
clear criteria for the use of military force.<sup>6</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It has been argued that should NATO grow, its cohesion and sense
of common purpose inevitably will dissipate; that a larger NATO,
exacerbated by significant cultural and geopolitical differences,
will become unmanageable; and that reaching agreement between
new and old members on important issues will prove difficult<sup>7</sup>.
 But while increasing an organization's size may present challenges
to cohesiveness, NATO's experience with past enlargement is instructive.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, when NATO's membership was being decided in the late
1940s, the original European members initially rebuffed U.S. efforts
to include Norway, Iceland, and Portugal out of concern that these
nations were geographically too distant, and that Iceland and
Portugal's &quot;Europeanness&quot; was questionable. Later, some
European NATO members initially opposed admitting Greece and Turkey
because they were &quot;distant geographically and culturally
from the West.&quot;<sup>8</sup> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These and similar concerns have proved groundless. Despite sharp
policy differences which have arisen occasionally over the years,
NATO in fact developed a real sense of cohesiveness which has
enabled it to develop a consensus on actions ranging from the
deployment of nuclear-armed missiles in Europe during the 1980s
to active cooperation with the international response to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait to the deployment of a multinational force
in the former Yugoslavia. This cohesiveness reflects the emergence
of a common democratic security culture among NATO nations which
has enabled even traditional rivals Turkey and Greece to work
together, albeit uncomfortably at times, for common NATO objectives.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO's new structure allows for some difference of perspective
among members, since the alliance already is developing mechanisms
which would allow a sub-group of NATO members to take military
action. Nonetheless, NATO may need to consider procedural mechanisms,
at least for a transitional period, to provide assurance that
new members cannot block important NATO decisions<sup>9</sup>. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Enlargement inevitably will bring new perspectives into NATO.
But the significant benefits of expansion, including the expansion
of the common democratic security culture eastward, easily can
outweigh the inevitable disagreements which will occur.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Implications for Military Effectiveness</b> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It also has been suggested that adding members could dilute NATO's
military effectiveness. Enlarging NATO obviously would raise challenges
for NATO's military structure and capabilities. Even at NATO's
current size, assuring effective military coordination among different
military forces requires considerable effort. Issues which the
alliance will need to address include coordination of multinational
force formations, interoperability of military equipment, maintenance
of effective communications among different military forces, and
overall quality of military forces.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These challenges cannot be resolved fully in the very short term,
and there will not always be smooth interaction between current
NATO forces and those of newer members whose quality varies greatly
at this point. After all, NATO's Cold War defense structure was
developed over many years. However, such concerns can be assuaged
if NATO works with potential new members to address military requirements,
although no nation should be admitted until it satisfies specified
NATO military standards<sup>10</sup>.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A separate but related concern is that in taking on new commitments,
NATO will be overextended militarily. Again, a review of NATO's
past is helpful. For example, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff were
uncomfortable with bringing Italy into NATO because it might overextend
NATO's abilities in the Mediterranean region<sup>11</sup>.  In fact, Italy's
membership has proved to be a significant military plus for NATO.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another concern is that the presence of former or current Communists
in senior government positions in new member nations could serve
as a Trojan Horse and present security problems for NATO and its
members. Security leaks to Moscow are of particular concern. 
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Former Communists indeed are making a comeback throughout the
former Warsaw Pact nations. This is legitimate cause for worry,
although this trend may reverse itself over time. The solution
is simple: NATO should monitor this matter very carefully, and
refuse to admit a new member if there is a genuine security problem.
Of course, it also should take appropriate measures to ensure
the security of vital military information and intelligence.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Domestic Political Institutions and Practices</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some have suggested that former Warsaw Pact nations should not
be admitted to NATO because their domestic institutions are still
not fully democratic. However, in the past, NATO has not made
democracy an absolute criterion for membership. Rather, it balanced
strategic necessity with political concerns. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Portugal, Turkey, and Greece, for example, were admitted to NATO
at a time when they were not democracies. They were admitted because
of their perceived military benefit against a clear Soviet threat.
Spain, on the other hand, was not admitted for many years because
perceived military advantages were considered not sufficient to
override its non-democratic political system.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are hopeful signs of political progress in many former Communist
nations, and a return of pre-1989 communism among potential Central
European applicants for NATO membership is most unlikely. Nonetheless,
the possibility of reversion to authoritarian rule cannot be ruled
out, and it is not fully clear at what point some of the nations
interested in being considered for NATO membership will consolidate
their democratic political experiments. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Further, with no immediate direct security threat to NATO, political
standards can be made a higher priority. Indeed, as a practical
matter, it would likely prove difficult to obtain endorsement
of NATO member legislatures for new members whose governments
are not clearly democratic.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, NATO will need to balance the geopolitical benefits of expansion
with respect to a specific country against any domestic political
flaws. For example, Slovakia's location separating Poland and
Hungary argues for its admission to NATO on practical military
grounds along with those other two nations. However, its domestic
practices at present clearly do not meet democratic standards.<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The alliance should apply political criteria with some flexibility.
This is because the prospect of NATO membership, as well as the
fact of membership, may well have a positive impact on the domestic
politics of potential new entrants. NATO membership played a positive
role in stabilizing fragile European democracies after World War
II, and also helped Spain through a shaky transition period to
democracy. Admission of emerging democracies such as Poland and
Hungary could well have a similar impact.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, while NATO need not and should not admit new nations solely
in order to reinforce democracy, admission to the alliance nonetheless
has the potential to produce this important side benefit. <BR>
<BR>

<b>
<P>
Costs of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO's growth would likely have significant financial costs not
only for NATO itself, but also for member nations and any new
admittees. Most of these costs would be associated with enhancing
military capabilities.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At this early point, calculations of financial costs must be provisional
and depend greatly upon assumptions about such matters as the
threat perceptions, military strategy, and force structure of
potential new members and NATO itself. Nevertheless, approximate
costs, assuming differing levels of military forces, have been
estimated.<sup>13</sup>  These totals assume an implementation period of 10
to 15 years, although there will be continuing costs after this
period.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A least expensive option of around $20 billion would focus on
enhancing self-defense for new members by upgrading relevant military
capabilities, combined with NATO logistics and communications
support. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second approach costing around $20 billion to $30 billion would
include a buildup by new members combined with giving NATO a meaningful
capability to project air power. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An even more capable option costing around $50 billion would include
the same new member buildup, combined with in-region infrastructure
and a NATO air and ground force designed for power projection
into the region (to include a 10-ground-division, 10-air-wing
NATO regional capability); for around $35 billion, a more modest
version of this option with a less ambitious version of this military
package could be assembled.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Establishing a classic conventional military capability with NATO
air and ground forces actually deployed in the new members' region
could cost considerably more than $50 billion.<sup>14</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These costs are significant. Current NATO members, including the
U.S., would have to contribute equitable financial shares. But
the new members themselves would have to balance requirements
for economic development with the need for military-related expenditures,
and thus make real sacrifices during a difficult period of economic
development.<sup>15</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, financial requirements should be viewed in context.

Over a multi-year period, and broken into shares from NATO nations
and new members, the costs to all parties should be manageable.
A plausible estimate for a U.S. contribution would be an expenditure
of around $1 billion to $2 billion per year for 10 to 15 years.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If expansion is in America's and the West's interests, the costs
should be manageable and acceptable as a modest supplement to
what the U.S. already spends for its own security and that of
its allies.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Expansion and U.S. Interests</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A secure, stable Europe whose nation-states have free political
and economic systems is very much in America's national interest;
and bringing qualified and appropriate new members into NATO makes
this more likely.<sup>16</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. influence and leadership in Europe also can advance American
interests. Indeed, it is likely that admission of new members
would enhance U.S. influence in NATO. This is because the views
of those nations most likely to be offered membership parallel
those of the U.S. on most important security issues.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>THE PROCESS OF NATO EXPANSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if NATO expansion is a good idea in principle, there are
a number of important practical issues which will have to be addressed
and resolved for the process of expansion to succeed.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Initial Invitation List</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A number of nations have indicated an interest in joining NATO.
In the short term at least, only a few will be considered seriously
for membership. These nations include the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland. Slovakia is also mentioned (these four nations together
are referred to at times as the &quot;Visegrad Group&quot;). If
Austria, Sweden or Finland &#173;&#173; all new members of the
European Union (EU) &#173;&#173; were to seek membership, they
would likely go to the top of the list.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the moment, the Czech Republic is closest to meeting likely
NATO standards for membership, while Poland and Hungary are making
progress. Slovakia is less likely to be invited at first because
of questionable domestic political practices. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Any other admissions to membership probably would be some years
away. Plausible future candidates might include Slovenia, Bulgaria,
and Romania. Baltic nations may meet eligibility criteria as well,
but concern about Russian reaction could inhibit NATO's approach.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Pace of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some who accept the principle of NATO enlargement nonetheless
would prefer a very slow pace. One rationale is that expansion
might have a negative impact on Russian policy and give anti-Western
candidates in the June 1996 Russian presidential elections a campaign
issue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, it makes no sense for Russia to be a determining factor
in the timing of NATO enlargement. Under such logic, expansion
could be delayed indefinitely because for the foreseeable future,
the possibility of a negative Russian reaction will always exist.
Indeed, it seems more likely that the longer the enlargement process
is dragged out, the more potential there is for problems with
Russia.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. leadership is important in catalyzing NATO enlargement, and
the pace of expansion should not be constrained artificially.
In addition, NATO itself can expedite the process by, for example,
appointing an Assistant Secretary General to deal with expansion-related
issues, as well as with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council
(NACC) and Partnership for Peace (PFP).<sup>17</sup> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Domestic Criteria for Membership</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is likely that, either implicitly or explicitly, NATO will
apply political and economic membership standards. Plausible domestic
political requirements for prospective members include democratic
institutions and practices; a market economy; the rule of law
along with institutional and legal protection for minority rights;
and civilian democratic control of the military, intelligence
agencies, police, and internal security forces. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Legitimate concern exists that NATO might lose its leverage for
domestic reform once a nation is admitted to membership. Thus,
pressure for continued reform must be maintained after the admission
of new members. Indeed, entry into NATO (along with pressure from
the European Union) can be a positive force for political change.
Spain's admission to NATO in 1982 very likely helped reinforce
and consolidate its nascent democratic institutions; and NATO
membership undoubtedly was a factor in the consolidation of democracy
in Portugal, Greece, and Turkey.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO in any event has the option of developing procedures for
the suspension or even expulsion of a member whose domestic or
international policies fall fundamentally short of NATO expectations.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>International Aspects of Membership</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO can ask new members to meet certain foreign policy standards.
For example, new members could be required to renounce all territorial
claims on other nations. NATO could also insist that new invitees
(for example, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary) implement
trans-regional cooperative endeavors, such as common security
planning at a sub-regional level.<sup>18</sup>  For its own part, NATO could
formalize its already implicit policy of not becoming involved
militarily in a dispute among NATO member nations. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO also might require agreement from new members to submit any
disputes with other NATO nations to international arbitration,
and new entrants could be asked to shape their militaries for
defensive missions only.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO certainly should expect commitments from prospective members
to assist anti-terrorism efforts, to participate in countering
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their delivery
systems, and to prohibit the export of arms or militarily applicable
technology to rogue nations.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Military Criteria for New Members</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO should expect that new members will contribute to its overall
military capabilities and, conversely, will not undermine its
military effectiveness. How each new member should comply with
these standards remains to be decided. NATO could require, for
example, that new members agree to join its integrated military
structure (this is important because this structure fosters smoother
and more efficient military operations). New members also could
be required to strengthen very quickly &#173;&#173; in line with
NATO standards &#173;&#173; the military capabilities of selected
military units, and to work for operational military compatibility
with NATO forces over the longer term.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;New members could be required to make their territory and military
facilities available for NATO use, and otherwise support NATO
military requirements, without any unilateral constraints on NATO
activities. Moreover, new members could be required to keep their
military forces and planning open to view by NATO allies, and
to assure the protection of intelligence information.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The structure of the military forces of new members will be a
crucial factor in determining the effectiveness and costs of military
cooperation between new members and NATO. Also important will
be the need to determine exactly how NATO's forces would be structured
and deployed in peacetime, as well as at a time of crisis or conflict,
to fulfill NATO security commitments to new members.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Military force structure options for new members range from Swiss-type
civilian-based forces to a large standing army. Possibilities
must be weighed in the context of such factors as perceived national
interests and potential military threats, the relationship of
national armed forces to NATO's military structure, costs, and
other factors. It also would be advantageous for NATO if new members'
forces can contribute in a militarily significant way to any future
Persian Gulf-type conflicts.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At a minimum, force structure decisions by prospective members
should be taken within the context of maximizing regional (Central
or Eastern European) military cooperation and strengths, and also
within the context of extensive consultations with NATO. For example,
shared arms production and military purchases and assistance should
be pursued in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of military
capabilities and achieve military economies of scale. Defense
cooperation and co-production arrangements (arrangements by two
or more nations to join in researching, developing, or producing
a technology, system, or weapon), either among prospective new
members themselves or with other NATO members (including the U.S.),
can reinforce this approach.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, the military forces of likely new members will not
come close to meeting NATO's standards and requirements for many
years. Since full operational integration will not be feasible,
a realistic shorter-term objective would be to assure that the
troops of the old and new members work together as smoothly as
possible. Ways in which this might be accomplished include developing
an integrated air defense network, conducting NATO military exercises
on new members' territory, prepositioning military supplies; and
deploying aircraft to bases on new members' territory at regular
intervals (called &quot;dual basing&quot;).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, NATO's own evolving strategies and military
capabilities need to undergo further changes in order to accommodate
a larger NATO. These changes include: <BR>

<P><ul>
<li>Continuing revisions in NATO's forces and command structures and
planning processes, both to streamline NATO's military structure
and to establish command units specifically responsible for the
territory of new members; <BR>

<P>
<li>Adapting NATO's forces so that sub-groups of NATO nations, such
as the Western European Union (WEU) or ad hoc coalitions, can
utilize NATO's military resources when appropriate;<sup>19</sup> <BR>

<P>
<li>Further developing multinational formations (military units composed
of personnel from more than one nation), which will be even more
challenging when new members are involved; <BR>

<P>
<li>Reviewing the role of nuclear deterrence in post-Cold War Europe,
a continuing requirement even with NATO's current membership,
because nuclear strategy inevitably will be affected by the addition
of new members; and<BR>

<P>
<li>Assessing and implementing air and theater missile defenses which
take new members into account.<BR>
<BR>
</ul>

<P>
<b>Reassuring Uninvited Nations</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO expansion may cause at least some short-term sense of exclusion
or resentment among those not invited in the first round of admissions.
The reaction of uninvited nations could range from bruised feelings
to an interest in making alternative security arrangements, and
momentum for internal reform in such nations could be slowed.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO should seek to defuse such possibilities. For example, it
can make clear that expansion is a process and that NATO remains
open to new members even after the first new admissions. The alliance
also should increase the involvement of such nations in enhanced
Partnership for Peace and North Atlantic Cooperation Council political
programs and meetings while encouraging their interaction with
other European organizations, such as the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU),
as well as bilateral programs.<sup>20</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO can point out that the PFP framework already provides a <I>de
facto</I> equivalent of NATO's Article Four security relationship
to PFP participants. While Article Five addresses the defense
of members' territory against armed attack, Article Four calls
for consultations against more general security threats against
a member.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the alliance can also reinforce efforts to link relevant
NATO members more closely with nations that are not invited to
join initially. For example, Scandinavian members can work more
closely with Baltic nations, and southern region members can develop
closer links with Balkan and Mediterranean countries. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Sequence of Admission</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The sequencing of new admissions could have an impact on the reactions
of those nations not invited to join. NATO will still have to
decide, for example, how eligible nations should be admitted &#173;&#173;
whether individually or in groups &#173;&#173; and in what order.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Inviting nations in groups rather than individually could avoid
the tensions caused by admitting some nations before others which
also are eligible. At the same time, some suggest it would be
best not to invite all eligible members at the same time in order
to establish that admitting new members is a process rather than
a one-time event.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is too early in the expansion process to suggest which approach
is most appropriate. All that can be said at this time is that
if NATO chooses not to invite all eligible nations together, it
will need to explain clearly its rationale for implementing the
first wave of admissions in phases. NATO also needs to provide
a realistic assessment to those nations whose prospects for entry
are minimal or nil.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Expansion and Non-NATO Institutions</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The growth of NATO will occur within a context of multiple European
institutions. Most important is the Western European Union, which
is linked to the European Union. All WEU members also participate
in NATO, while the EU has several members who are not NATO members.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The WEU has defense obligations to its members and is considering
admitting new members. Further, the WEU might assume defense obligations
for all EU members. If the WEU admits new members before NATO
does, or if it assumes an obligation to defend all EU members,
then current WEU (and NATO) members will be taking on new defense
obligations to nations which are not NATO members. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This has important implications for NATO. WEU nations could become
embroiled in a conflict in order to defend a non-NATO member of
the WEU &#173;&#173; Austria, Sweden, and Finland recently have
been admitted, and other nations such as Poland, the Czech Republic,
and Hungary have applied for membership &#173;&#173; or a non-NATO
member of the EU. These WEU nations, if counterattacked, might
then seek to invoke NATO commitments for their own defense. This
would mean, in particular, that the U.S. could be called upon
to help defend NATO members in a conflict originally involving
an attack on a non-NATO WEU member even though NATO had no obligation
to defend the WEU or EU nations which were attacked. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to avoid such situations, NATO would have to coordinate
its expansion process with that of the WEU and the EU. Ideally,
nations should become members of both groups at around the same
time.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Russia and NATO</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO expansion should proceed on its own merits and terms. However,
as part of the enlargement process, NATO should hold out to Moscow
the possibility of a positive or even formal relationship if Russia
pursues responsible policies. For example, the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council, whose members include all NATO nations and
all former Warsaw Pact nations and ex-Soviet republics, could
be given an enhanced role and responsibility for considering European
political and security issues (including Russian involvement in
neighboring nations) and developing responses to security problems.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the short term, NATO should pursue a dual approach. Russian
participation in the PFP should be developed through such means
as security consultations and humanitarian relief training exercises
in order to demonstrate the positive aspects of a new relationship
with the West. At the same time, NATO should advise Moscow that
any renewed expansionism will end such activities and result in
contingency planning against such a Russian approach.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO remains, as always, a defensive and transparent alliance.
Any reasonable Russian concerns can be addressed; and a NATO-Russia
relationship can be institutionalized, up to and including a NATO-Russia
agreement defining the terms of the relationship, if Moscow accepts
the reality that NATO can expand. Of course, should Russia come
under the control of extreme nationalist and expansionist forces,
NATO will need to adopt appropriate measures in response.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Ukraine and NATO Enlargement</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ukraine is an especially important part of the European geopolitical
equation. Without control of Ukraine, it would be much more difficult
for an expansionist Russia to threaten the West directly. Although
independent, Kiev still remains sensitive to Russian concerns
and thus far has been ambivalent about NATO membership.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A fundamental Western objective should be to assure that Ukraine
is not reincorporated into a revived Russian empire. NATO, as
well as NATO nations acting bilaterally, will need to make Ukraine
a top priority for economic assistance, strengthened political
relationships, and security assistance. All this should be implemented
with a sensitivity to the challenges posed by Ukraine's balancing
act between the West and Moscow. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Financial Costs of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most costs incurred by NATO expansion will be to meet military
requirements. Current NATO members will have to contribute to
the costs of expansion, with the U.S. providing a reasonable financial
share. In addition, there should be significant economic assistance
from the European Union for economic development so that new members
can allocate sufficient resources to improving military capabilities.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, new members will have to demonstrate a significant
financial commitment, which will be a challenge in view of their
still early stages of economic development. Creative arrangements,
including loans, grants, and even barter arrangements, need to
be explored. NATO nations also should consider the sale or lease
of excess military items to new members.<sup>21</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, NATO funding for common infrastructure facilities,
such as military bases and storage facilities, can be allocated
to new members. Costs for military items may be lowered by developing
co-production arrangements and taking advantage of economies of
scale.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The American debate over NATO enlargement, in a fundamental sense,
will be over the proper U.S. international role in the post-Cold
War world and the continuing relevance of NATO to U.S. interests.
If America wishes to protect its security interests beyond the
Western Hemisphere and help shape the international environment,
and if it is to continue as an international leader, NATO enlargement
will further those objectives. The enlargement of NATO also will
advance the consolidation of peace and freedom throughout Europe,
the expansion of NATO's common democratic security culture, and
the protection of U.S. interests in that region and elsewhere.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many of the arguments raised against NATO expansion are specious
or based on inaccurate or exaggerated concerns. At the same time,
there are reasonable questions and concerns about how NATO expansion
would work. These concerns must be addressed satisfactorily by
NATO and by candidates for membership. In particular, prospective
members, as well as NATO member nations, will have to contribute
their fair share, financially and otherwise.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The continuing importance of NATO is clear. Not only are nations
clamoring for admission, but long-standing member France has decided
to reinvigorate its participation in the alliance.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO has brought in several new members since its inception.<sup>22</sup> Admission of new members at this point would not be a radical
change, but rather a natural progression in NATO's steady growth
over the years. Opening the alliance to new members would ratify
the expansion of freedom's borders and the reality that new entrants
already are a part of the West.<BR>

is composed of 53 nations and addresses a variety of areas, including
the development of international norms of behavior, institutional
support for democracy and human rights, and efforts at confidence&#173;building
and conflict resolution. The EU is composed of 15 European nations
and is the instrument for efforts to integrate Europe politically
and economically.

for example, is considering the leasing of F&#173;16s to Poland.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	With passage of the historic Telecommunications Act of 1996 earlier this year, many in Congress, the media, and the public have been led to believe that the long-awaited task of communications deregulation has been completed. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	While the new Telecommunications Act takes some important steps toward market liberalization, they are in many cases tiny steps. Furthermore, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is charged with the task of implementing the Act, already has shown itself eager to exploit the vague rhetoric and loopholes found in many sections of the Act by expanding rather than rolling back regulations. Worse still, some of the recent FCC proceedings and rule-makings undertaken supposedly to comply with this legislation are so complex, notes investment analyst Susan A. Lynner of Prudential Securities, that, "If the devil is in the details, then we must be in hell."<sup>1</sup>  In many ways, these problems can be traced to poorly worded or open-ended sections and clauses found in the original legislative language of the Telecommunications Act. <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 But the more serious problem with the Telecommunications Act is not what it includes, but what it does not include. The statute almost completely ignores the segment of the communications marketplace that is experiencing the most innovation and entrepreneurship -- the wireless sector. The legislation focuses primarily on wireline issues (local telephony and cable in particular). Wireless industries that currently use the electromagnetic wireless spectrum<sup>2</sup> (such as cellular or broadcasting), as well as other businesses that hope to enter the wireless market, do not receive comparable attention.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Realizing this, Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) has circulated a staff discussion draft, "The Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Policy Reform and Privatization Act," as the prelude to possible legislation. Senator Pressler is Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The proposal is sweeping in its scope and, if implemented, would force a complete overhaul of wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Among its beneficial steps, Senator Pressler's proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b> The proposal would end seven decades of spectrum mismanagement and industrial policy by allowing spectrum holders to use their spectrum for whatever purpose they wish. No longer would the FCC be allowed to "zone" the spectrum in discrete parcels and place restrictions on its use.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b> The FCC's extremely successful experiment with spectrum auctions would be expanded and made permanent for new uses of spectrum.
<p>
<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b> Although the Pressler proposal backs away from the contentious issue of auctioning off licenses already set to be given away to the broadcast television industry, it does create a favorable alternative. Broadcasters would be forced to pay a deposit for receipt of new digital licenses, and this deposit would be fully refundable when they turn in their old analog license after a 15-year transition period. Alternatively, if broadcasters did not wish to pay the deposit, they could opt to keep their current analog license forever and forgo the opportunity to obtain a new digital license. If they chose this second option, the leftover spectrum would be auctioned to other users.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b> The Pressler plan wisely mandates that the FCC could not engage in technical standard-setting because the staggering pace of technological change in this industry will likely make any standard irrelevant in the near future. Furthermore, the bill would prohibit the FCC from micromanaging construction specifications and timetables of new spectrum networks.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum:</b> In an important step, the Pressler plan demands that federal agencies reallocate large portions of inefficiently used government spectrum to private use. Furthermore, the spectrum that remains in government hands would have to be used more efficiently.
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b> The proposal also would eliminate needless spectrum management duplication by transferring all spectrum authority currently held by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the FCC. In addition, the bill would block grant public safety spectrum back to the states so they can control locally all spectrum needed for police, fire, and other safety uses.
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report.</b> Finally, the plan would mandate a review of the effects of the bill two years after implementation and require the FCC to suggest further deregulatory initiatives that can be undertaken.</ul>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Pressler plan, if enacted into law, would represent the most important privatization effort undertaken by the federal government in recent years. This would spur job and export creation in this highly innovative American industry. Failure to implement these reforms, on the other hand, would mean that Congress's efforts to revolutionize the communications industry would remain limited and incomplete. 
<p>

<b>WHY REFORM IS NEEDED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Senator Pressler's spectrum reform and privatization plan is vital for several reasons. The current system of spectrum management is roundly criticized because:<ul>
<li><b>It is resistant to change and innovation.</b> Currently, federal spectrum regulators are allowed to decide who may use spectrum, where they may use it, how long they may use it, and most important, to what use they may put their spectrum. This is often referred to as "spectrum zoning," to borrow a real estate land management metaphor. Not surprisingly, this zoning leads to massive misallocations and misuses of spectrum. Once a certain technology is locked into place, it can take years before another use of that spectrum is allowed; thus, both innovation and entrepreneurial activity are discouraged by this technological industrial policy. 
<p>
<li><b>It imposes large costs of delay.</b> Not surprisingly, this resistance to change and innovation results in enormous costs. These costs can be measured either in terms of the number of new products offered to consumers or in terms of the overall loss of economic activity to the economy. The costs are high. For example, even though spectrum was reallocated in 1970 to make room for cellular services, the first experimental license was not granted by the FCC until 1977, and other commercial licenses were not granted until the early 1980s. Economists Jeffrey H. Rohlfs, Charles L. Jackson, and Tracey E. Kelly have argued that "had the FCC proceeded directly to licensing from its 1970 allocation decision, cellular licenses could have been granted as early as 1972 and systems could have become operational in 1973, a decade earlier than they were in reality."<sup>3</sup>  As a result, they estimate, this regulatory delay cost the U.S. economy $86 billion, or 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1983, when cellular licensing finally began.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<li><b>It is open to special interest influence and discourages competition.</b> With such a tight hold on the spectrum reins, regulators can steer the industry in almost any direction they desire. Worse yet, because communications regulation often has resembled a "good old boy" network -- with favored industry groups working hand-in-hand with regulators to craft policy -- competition has been discouraged. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, for many years the broadcast industry worked with the FCC to restrict the rise of cable television, since it posed an obvious threat to the unchallenged hegemony of the broadcast industry. As telecommunications scholars Michael K. Kellogg, John Thorne, and Peter W. Huber note, "For many years the FCC's principal objective was to suppress the cable industry by preventing direct competition between cable and over-the-air broadcasting. It did so quite successfully.... "<sup>5</sup> This regulatory setback delayed the onset of video competition for over a decade.<sup>6</sup>  Despite no clear explanation of how this served the public, the FCC continued to implement these anti-competitive policies, even though it had received no explicit grant of congressional authority to do so.<sup>7</sup><p><li><b>There is a lack of respect for First Amendment rights.</b> Finally, the current system of spectrum management provides regulators with the ability to influence directly the content and composition of specific types of programming, and to threaten firms with discontinuation of the right to operate if they fail to comply with regulatory edicts. For example, the FCC currently uses the Children's Television Act of 1990 as a tool for blatant regulatory extortion. The FCC has gone beyond the admittedly vague statutory language of the Act to demand specific quantitative minimum numbers of hours of children's programming in exchange for allowing business other freedoms.<sup>8</sup>  For example, after CBS and Westinghouse recently announced their intention to merge, FCC regulators (who have the power to block such alliances) forced the companies to promise that certain quantitative programming requirements would be honored as a condition of merger approval. Several other firms have faced similar threats from the FCC as a condition of normal business operation. 	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Even though such regulatory blackmail would represent a clear First Amendment violation if applied in the print realm (fo
r example to newspapers or magazines), it is considered normal operating procedure in the realm of electronic communication (radio or television broadcasters).
</ul><p>


<b>WHAT THE PRESSLER PLAN WOULD DO</b>

	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the Pressler plan would correct most of these flaws within the current system. Specifically, the proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would end seven decades of misguided and inefficient spectrum management, allowing spectrum users to use their licenses to provide any service in any way they desire as long as it does not interfere with another spectrum user or violate any U.S. treaty obligations with other nations regarding international spectrum use. It also would allow spectrum users to transfer their flexible spectrum freely to others on the open market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This would mean the death of federal spectrum industrial policies because it would prohibit any further "zoning" of spectrum. This could encourage a "spectrum renaissance," as many entrepreneurial ideas that could not be acted upon in the past due to spectrum operating restrictions could now be implemented. Countless innovations and new job opportunities would spring from a wireless marketplace freed from its regulatory shackles.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would expand and make permanent the extraordinarily successful system of spectrum auctioning that Congress originally authorized in 1993. Tens of billions of dollars have been generated for the U.S. Treasury and an enormous amount of innovation already has taken place, thanks to the auctioning process. In fact, an entirely new industry, the personal communications service sector (PCS), a more advanced system of wireless cellular communication, has been created as a result of the auction process. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, Congress limited the applicability and time of auctions in 1993. The Pressler proposal would mandate that only auctions be used in the future and any potential "mutually exclusive use" of the spectrum (when two or more parties vie for the same spectrum allocation) must be thrown open to competitive bidding at an auction. There would be four notable exemptions, however, to this general rule. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>First</b>, any spectrum request that is "non-mutually exclusive" (only one party requests the spectrum), obviously would not be open to an auction. This spectrum would simply be given to the party requesting it. The FCC could demand, however, that these users pay user fees to the government to ensure that the spectrum is not hoarded or used inefficiently.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		<b>Second</b>, public safety users of spectrum would be exempted. These spectrum uses would include such things as police and fire stations that need to communicate over the radio spectrum, as well as Department of Defense military applications. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Third</b>, spectrum required for global satellite orbital assignments would not be auctioned since this would create international difficulties with other countries that possess different spectrum assignment mechanisms. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Fourth</b>, while it is reasonable to exempt the previous three uses and users from spectrum auctions, the following exemption reflects the raw political power of an industry rather than good policy. 
<p>

<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would exempt from auction the licenses set to be given away to broadcasters for the provision of digital television. This is unfortunate, because $10 billion to $70 billion worth of spectrum would be lost if such a giveaway to the broadcast industry were allowed to go forward. Worse yet, it would single out one segment of the industry for special treatment in a time when everyone else in the industry is being forced to spend billions bidding at competitive auctions to obtain the additional spectrum they need or desire to conduct business.<sup>9</sup>  Political pressure from the broadcast lobby has led many in Congress to abandon any hope of auctioning this spectrum.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Yet the Pressler plan would create a second-best solution, referred to as the "deposit, return and overlay approach."  Basically, every television broadcast licensee in America would be able to choose between one of the following two plans: 
<p>
	 <b>Option #1:</b> A broadcaster could obtain an additional license directly from the government instead of through a competitive auction, but pay periodic fees or deposits into an escrow account. The fees collected from broadcasters would be based on the value of similar licenses sold in "overlay" auctions. Overlay refers to the technological capability to use certain portions of the spectrum simultaneously for multiple uses. Spectrum adjoining that which would be given to broadcasters therefore could be auctioned off, and its auction price would then be used to determine the amount of the fee or deposit broadcasters would be forced to pay for exclusive use of the additional spectrum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 15-year transition period when broadcasters each would possess two licenses (one analog, one digital), accrued interest on the spectrum deposit account would be placed in the U.S. Treasury to pay for tax cuts or deficit reduction. After the 15-year transition period ended, broadcasters could relinquish their older analog license and receive their deposit back from the government (less the accrued interest that went into the Treasury). For every year the broadcasters held their old license in excess of the 15-year cutoff date, they would lose 20 percent of their overall deposit; after five years, in other words, they would lose the full value of their deposit if they did not return the old license.

<p><b>Option #2:</b> Broadcasters could bypass the opportunity to obtain a second license directly from the government and instead opt to keep their older analog license perpetually. No spectrum fees or deposits would be owed by those who chose this option. The spectrum relinquished in this manner would then be auctioned by the FCC. Overall auctions would still take place, however. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This "deposit, return and overlay" approach is a good second-best alternative to straightforward auctions because it would provide a method of compensation for the use of spectrum and, would not allow broadcasters to keep two licenses without incurring serious costs.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would explicitly prohibit the FCC from imposing a digital television standard on the American marketplace. It simultaneously would avoid any compatibility or construction requirements that could lead to the adoption of yet another misguided industrial policy. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, the FCC in May did adopt a standard for digital television, largely to appease electronics manufacturers that wanted to lock in the technological system they favor. Although the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Digital Standard that was adopted allows television broadcasters flexible use of their spectrum, many other potential spectrum users, especially innovative computer companies such as Microsoft Corporation and Apple Computer, objected to the standard for various technological reasons. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Surprisingly, the ATSC standard was adopted despite the warnings of FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who questioned whether the agency was in the best position to set such a standard during a period of rapid innovation. In a statement, Hundt asked, "Why is it in the public interest to adopt rules freezing the current state of technology?  Given the rapid pace of technological change, isn't it inevitable that there will be innovations that even the flexible ATSC Standard cannot accommodate?"<sup>10</sup>  Even more important, "Shouldn't we be concerned that erecting a regulatory barrier to the use of new technologies may discourage the research and development necessary for innovation?"  Hundt went on to ask, "How is it consistent with the deregulatory spirit of the new Telecommunications Act to codify (directly or indirectly) the 200-plus pages of technical details that constitute the ATSC Standard?"<sup>11</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	There are no easy or good answers to Chairman Hundt's questions because there is no legitimate reason for the FCC to be in the business of technological standard-setting in the first place. The FCC has a long and checkered history of experience with television standards. As a Progress and Freedom Foundation telecommunications working group report notes, "The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but the FCC took years to adopt initial standards. The FCC then froze all applications for TV licenses until 1952. In the year after the freeze was ended, the number of stations tripled. However, a 1952 FCC decision deliberately limited the number of viable stations per market, and impeded the creation of additional TV networks, at enormous costs to the American viewing public."<sup>12</sup>  With this history and a healthy respect for the pace of technological change in mind, the Pressler plan would prohibit standard-setting at the FCC.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would mandate that, beginning next year, 25 percent of the spectrum the federal government currently owns exclusively or shares with the private sector below a certain frequency (5 GHz) shall be re-allocated for private sector auctions. Beyond this 25 percent of publicly held spectrum found under 5 GHz, the Pressler plan would require that the President appoint a seven-member "Advisory Committee on Withdrawal" to determine the amount of additional public spectrum that could be transferred to the private sector over a ten-year period.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	More important, the Pressler plan would initiate a financial incentive program to encourage government spectrum users to surrender portions of their spectrum voluntarily for private auctions. For example, if the Department of Transportation or Department of Defense realized they were stockpiling large portions of spectrum that were not being utilized, under the Pressler proposal they could turn in the spectrum for private auction and then receive a cut of the auction proceeds (which could be used for employee bonuses). This would be an important incentive for federal agencies that are hoarding spectrum inefficiently to transfer that spectrum to more efficient and profitable uses and users.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would require that, to the maximum extent possible, federal spectrum users rely on the private sector to supply them with radio communications equipment. Competitive bidding also would be required for all new federal government procurement of radio communications systems. Finally, the proposal would mandate that federal agencies work together with private sector firms to utilize more advanced and efficient digital services that would then open up more spectrum for use. Once a government agency and a private sector firm had installed the new digital technologies and created new spectrum capacity, the agency and the firm could divide the spectrum for other uses. The President would have the ability, however, to veto any FCC action related to public spectrum use that was deemed harmful to national security or public safety.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan also would place public spectrum users on equal footing with private users in terms of spectrum flexibility. Government spectrum users would be able to transfer their spectrum to any other public or private entity and receive compensation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 In addition, the plan would likely raise significant revenues for deficit reduction or taxpayer relief. 	 
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would end needless duplication of spectrum management responsibilities by consolidating all authority within the FCC. Currently, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) manages the publicly held spectrum, while the FCC manages all private spectrum. Upon implementation of the plan, all NTIA functions would be transferred to the FCC, and the NTIA, now part of the Department of Commerce, could be closed down.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would "block grant" authority over public safety spectrum back to the states. In essence, those portions of the spectrum required by state and local public safety users (police and fire stations) would be managed by the states. Any interference issues that arose would be adjudicated by the FCC. 
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report to monitor progress.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would require that the FCC prepare a spectrum report summarizing the progress and results of this deregulatory effort. This would include both a cost-benefit analysis of the measure and additional legislative recommendations from the FCC to further the process of spectrum reform. </ul>
<p>


<b>HOW THE PRESSLER PLAN COULD BE IMPROVED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Even though the Pressler discussion draft marks a significant and beneficial step in the right direction, it could be improved. Additional reforms that should be undertaken and policy clarifications that are needed include:<ul>

<li><b>Hold outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Although the Pressler proposal would create a sensible second-best solution to the broadcast spectrum dilemma, it is still preferable to apply auctions equally to all spectrum uses and users. It simply makes no sense to carve out special exemptions for certain industries while Congress is attempting to craft more pro-competitive, anti-monopolistic telecommunications policies. Many policymakers argue that the special "social compact" the public has with the broadcast industry justifies giving broadcasters special non-auction status, with government furnishing private broadcasters with free licenses in exchange for universal, high-quality informational and entertainment service.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		But by almost any measure, broadcasters have not lived up to their end of the bargain. Broadcasters, in fact have served the public poorly, primarily because they have not faced stiff competition for viewer allegiance until recent years. Hence, they have felt little pressure to improve the quality of their programming.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Congress should end this failed social compact with broadcasters and demand that they enter the competitive age of communications on the same basis as all others in the industry. The Pressler plan could be improved markedly by making sure that such uncompetitive favoritism is ended once and for all.
<p>
<li><b>De-license the entire spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	While providing complete flexibility in use is an important and long-needed step toward a free market in spectrum, the Pressler plan fails to take the final step needed to ensure that spectrum socialism is ended forever. Congress needs to eliminate all spectrum licensing requirements and provide current license holders full property rights to their spectrum allocation. This would ensure that all bureaucratic spectrum meddling ends and that a truly free market reigns in the wireless realm, as it does in real estate markets where private property rights have worked so well for centuries. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This does not mean anarchy would be or should be allowed to exist in wireless spectrum markets. Government would still have an important role in enforcing property rights in spectrum. For example, interference and trespass issues would still need to be adjudicated and resolved by independent third parties. This does not mean, however, that only the FCC is suited to carry out this task. In fact, enforcing property rights in spectrum should be easier than enforcing them in land since fewer "externality" concerns exist. For example, while river and air pollution present special problems in the enforcement of land property rights, no comparable externalities exist in the wireless spectrum. Private spectrum coordination organizations (which already exist), the courts, or a federal administrative body much smaller than the FCC could carry out any straightforward dispute resolution concerns that remain.
<p>
<li><b>End "public interest standard" regulation and guarantee equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	At the heart of everything that is wrong with modern communications law lies the "public interest standard."  This standard, which has governed communications policy at the FCC for almost seven decades, has never been defined. In effect, therefore, is a non-standard; it has no fixed meaning. Its vagueness has been used by federal regulators to destroy competition, to threaten the livelihood of existing businesses, and, most important, evade First Amendment restrictions -- all in the name of protecting the public.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal, like the Telecommunications Act which preceded it, would do nothing to define this open-ended regulatory standard or minimize its uncompetitive effect on the wireless marketplace. Bureaucrats would continue to be able to diminish competitive opportunities and run roughshod over the First Amendment rights of spectrum users. This makes increasingly less sense as wireless electronic technologies (which are accorded only secondary First Amendment protections) subsume the more traditional print media (which are accorded strict First Amendment rights). If Congress does not define this standard clearly, the FCC conceivably could decide to regulate the content of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal merely because these and other newspapers and magazines are delivered over an electronic medium the agency is able to regulate under the public interest standard. Congress would find it difficult to explain to the public (not to mention the editors of these private and traditionally unregulated newspapers) just why regulation is needed merely because the public receives these dailies over computer screens instead of on paper.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In short, the public interest standard may serve the interests of regulators and the special interests that benefit from its uncompetitive edicts, but it does not serve the consuming public. It should be clear that policymakers can choose regulation under the public interest standard or they can choose free competition -- but they cannot choose both. Cutting the spectrum loose from its 70-year-old regulatory shackles is the best way to serve the public interest.
<p>
<li><b>End protectionist policies that restrict beneficial foreign investment in spectrum technologies and companies, and combine this with privatization of international satellite organizations.</b> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, foreign companies may not own a radio communications license and may not own more than 20 percent of the shares of a company that holds a radio communications license. This protectionist restriction has outlived its usefulness. While national security concerns may have served as a valid justification for prohibiting foreign investment in the past, this policy no longer makes sense. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 Restricting foreign investment in spectrum technologies and firms cuts off the flow of beneficial capital and expertise. Just as free trade in other sectors has benefited the American economy and improved the nation's competitiveness, openness to free trade in communications goods and services will best serve the interests of American firms and consumers.<sup>13</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 While an effort was made during committee debate over the Telecommunications Act to include language eliminating or at least curtailing the effect of Section 310(b), such language was not included in the final conference bill. The Pressler proposal could correct this mistake by repealing Section 310(b) and all other telecommunications spectrum protectionism once and for all.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Also, to promote international trade in telecommunications, the Pressler plan could take steps to begin breaking down the global monopolies held by international satellite organizations such as Inmarsat and Intelsat. These organizations are international consortia of various signatory countries that have long held a strong grip over access to international satellite service. Comsat is the U.S. representative to Inmarsat (which provides mobile and maritime satellite services) and Intelsat (which provides global television and telephone services). Now that viable private satellite carriers exist that can provide international communications services more efficiently, these organizations should be privatized and all special privileges they receive should be revoked to encourage a more competitive marketplace.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	While the Pressler spectrum privatization proposal is not perfect, it represents the boldest and most principled deregulatory initiative in the field of communications to date. In comparison to the initial drafts of the Telecommunications Act, which pre-emptively compromised on key policy issues, Senator Pressler's initial spectrum effort represents near flawless deregulatory legislation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 If Congress fails to pursue this unique spectrum liberalization effort, it will be forgoing the most important privatization opportunity in years -- perhaps in this century. Countless new innovations would flow from the creation of a free market in spectrum. This innovation and entrepreneurship would create untold numbers of new job and export opportunities. In short, the Pressler spectrum privatization plan would revolutionize the communications industry and provide a much-needed boost to the American economy.

Hazlett notes that when cable television (or "CATV" as it was known then) was developing between 1959 and 1972, "Cable television was then officially judged a menace to society, and the [FCC] had launched a regulatory jihad against it. Like all holy wars, this offensive was undertaken in the 'public interest'."  Hazlett dramatically illustrates the FCC's protectionist policies in action by quoting from a 1966 Commission report on cable: "We must thoroughly examine the question of CATV entry into the major markets, and authorize such entry only upon a hearing record giving reasonable assurance that the consequences of such entry will not thwart the achievement of Congressional goals. We cannot sit back and let CATV move signals about as it wishes.... " Quoted in, <i>ibid</i>., p. 42.
