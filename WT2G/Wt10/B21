Under the leadership of President Ronald Reagan, the 1980s were "the most prosperous decade in American history. That means the vast majority of Americans lived at a higher standard of living than they, or anyone else, ever had before, anywhere on the globe."<sup>1</sup>  Yet critics in the media and elsewhere persist in spreading such myths as the notion that the 1980s were a "decade of greed" in which the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Imagine what they would have said if the economic policy of the Reagan Administration had been a failure.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ronald Reagan did more than engineer sweeping economic policy changes that produced the longest peacetime economic boom in American history. He inherited an economic crisis of disastrous proportions that had been developing for over a decade and, in just a few years, reversed it to produce an economic triumph:<blockquote>

	Lest we forget, in 1979 the world stood on an economic precipice. Inflation ran 13.5 percent in 1980, real production dipped and the prime rate reached 21.5 percent. And economics as conventionally understood provided no intellectual tools for understanding this crisis, let alone curbing it. Worse, the affliction had struck the whole world, and threatened more damage to come.<sup>2</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the late 1970s, few believed the persistent inflation that had been building for more than ten years could be stopped, or at least stopped without creating another depression. Interest rates were at a crisis level, unemployment was rising, real incomes were falling, poverty was rising, productivity was stagnant, real economic growth had ceased, and both the dollar and the stock market were on the verge of collapse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reagan reversed each and every one of these trends. How did he do it?  The Reagan economic policy consisted of four basic components:
<ul>
<p><li>Deep across-the-board tax cuts.

<p><li>Across-the-board domestic spending cuts.

<p><li>Deregulation.

<p><li>Sound monetary policies to restrain inflation.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reagan implemented these policies quickly, and the results were the largest peacetime economic boom in American history and nearly 20 million new jobs. To listen to many in the press today, however, it was a time of misery. The liberal establishment could not abide Reagan's policies of allowing people to keep more of their own money through real tax cuts and generally shifting power from the government to the people, so they have set out to tell us why the boom was a bust and the greatest of successes the greatest of failures.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is hardly surprising. Liberals must attack Reagan's success if they are to build popular support for higher taxes, more regulation, and higher government spending. But their attack can be countered. The following pages provide the evidence, point by point, with which conservative candidates can refute this attempt to rewrite history.
<p>

<b>What Happened to Federal Revenues?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There has been a great deal of rhetoric about Reagan tax cuts draining the federal Treasury. The reality is that revenues increased significantly.
<ul>
<p><li>Total federal revenues doubled, rising from $517.1 billion in 1980 to $1,031.3 billion, or just over $1 trillion, in 1990. In constant inflation-adjusted dollars, this was an increase of 26 percent.

<p><li>As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), federal revenues declined only slightly, from 19.6 percent in 1980 to 18.8 percent in 1990 (see <a href="1980st1.gif">Table 1</a>).

<p><li>Revenues from individual income taxes climbed from $244.1 billion in 1980 to $466.9 billion in 1990 (see <a href="1980st1.gif">Table 1</a>). In inflation-adjusted dollars, this amounted to an increase of about 25 percent.
</ul>

<p>
<b>What Happened to Federal Spending?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much also is made of the Reagan budget cuts, but the truth is that federal spending also rose significantly during the 1980s.
<ul>
<p><li>Federal spending more than doubled, growing from $590.9 billion in 1980 to $1,252.7 billion, or $1.25 trillion, in 1990 (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>). In constant inflation-adjusted dollars, this was an increase of 33.4 percent.

<p><li>As a percentage of GDP, federal expenditures grew slightly, climbing from 22.3 percent in 1980 to 22.9 percent in 1990 (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As discussed in detail in Chapter 7, government spending to aid the poor also climbed steeply throughout the 1980s and is now at record levels by every measure. The same is true of education, discussed in detail in Chapter 9.

<p>
<b>What Happened to Federal Deficits?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With federal revenues doubling in the 1980s, the cause of the deficit during that period is clear: runaway federal spending, which more than doubled (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>). Federal taxes in 1990 amounted to about 19 percent of GDP, which is approximately where they had been for 40 years, since the early 1950s. Federal spending in 1990 was about 23 percent of GDP, having fluctuated around 19 percent to 20 percent of GDP during most of the postwar era until the late 1970s. During the 1980s, taxes were maintained at historic levels as spending surpassed well-established historic levels, creating the deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In Reagan's last budget year, however, the federal deficit actually had been <i>reduced</i> to $152.5 billion (see <a href="1980st3.gif">Table 3</a>). As a percentage of GDP, this was about the same as the deficit for 1980.<ul>

<p><li>The deficit in fiscal 1989 was 2.9 percent of GDP, compared to 2.8 percent in 1980. Reagan had cut the deficit as a percentage of GDP by more than half from 1983, when it was 6.3 percent.

<p><li>This was accomplished by reducing federal spending from over 24 percent of GDP to about 22 percent of GDP. The problem is that federal spending started to escalate again after Reagan left office. By 1992, the deficit had leaped to a record $290.4 billion, about one-third higher than its highest level under Reagan.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Total federal debt held by the public was 44 percent of GDP in 1990 (see <a href="1980st5.gif">Table 5</a>). This was the same level as in 1940 during the liberal-supported New Deal. It was also less than publicly held federal debt as a percentage of GDP during the Kennedy Administration in the early 1960s. Publicly held debt totaled 113.8 percent of GDP in 1946, as a result of World War II, and remained higher than the peak achieved during the Reagan years until 1964; but it did not prevent an American economic boom during the postwar period.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics have argued that the 1980s deficits were financed by a massive influx of foreign investment which bought up federal debt and left America vulnerable to economic calamity if foreign investors decided to withdraw. In fact, foreign interests held 16.7 percent of public federal debt at the end of fiscal 1990, compared to 17.5 percent at the end of fiscal 1980.<sup>3</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another perspective is gained by comparing U.S. budget deficits in the 1980s with the average budget deficits in the same years for the seven leading industrial countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Calculating deficits as a percentage of GDP for all levels of government within each country, the OECD reports that the total U.S. government deficit (federal, state, and local) was close to the average deficit as a percentage of GDP for all of the G-7 countries throughout the Reagan years (see <a href="1980st6.gif">Table 6</a>).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Finally, interest rates fell sharply and consistently throughout the Reagan years despite deficits, as shown below. The academic literature shows no correlation between federal budget deficits and interest rates.<sup>4</sup>  By 1992, when the federal deficit hit a record $290.4 billion, interest rates were at their lowest levels since before 1980 (see <a href="1980st10.gif">Table 10</a>).
<p>

<b>What Happened to Inflation?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many Americans seem to have forgotten that inflation threatened the very foundations of the economy in 1980. Inflation soared during the late 1970s, reaching 11.3 percent in 1979 and 13.5 percent in 1980 -- a 25 percent rise in prices in just two years (see <a href="1980st7.gif">Table 7</a>). Many experts doubted that this problem, which had been gathering steam since the mid-1960s, could be cured without causing a deep recession or even a depression. Others doubted that it could be cured at all.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives argued that this inflation was caused by loose, "easy money" Federal Reserve policies which allowed the money supply to grow too rapidly. Thus, a central plank of the Reagan economic platform was a restrained monetary policy that would hold growth in the money supply to the level necessary to maintain real economic growth. Reagan pursued this policy vigorously and faithfully. The result: inflation was reduced by more than half, to 6.2 percent, by 1982 (see <a href="1980st7.gif">Table 7</a>), dropping to 3.2 percent in 1983 and remaining near that level for the rest of Reagan's term.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To this day, the inflation problem that seemed so threatening and unsolvable 15 years ago has not returned, but this overwhelmingly important achievement somehow has been all but forgotten in the debate over Reagan's economic policies and the 1980s.
<p>

<b>What Happened to Economic Growth?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By 1983, despite a steep recession in 1982 caused by the tight money policies needed to squeeze out the historic inflation level of the late 1970s, the Reagan policies of reduced taxes, spending, regulation, and inflation were in place. The result was an economic boom.
<ul>
<p><li>This boom lasted 92 months without a recession, from November 1982 to July 1990, the longest period of sustained peacetime growth in U.S. history and the second-longest period of sustained growth, including even wartime. It was also more than twice the average period of expansions since World War II.<sup>5</sup><p><li>The American economy grew by about one-third in real inflation-adjusted terms. This was the equivalent of adding the entire economy of Germany, East and West, or two-thirds of the economy of Japan, to the U.S. economy.<sup>6</sup><p><li>From 1950 to 1973, real economic growth in the U.S. economy averaged 3.6 percent per year. From 1973 to 1982, it averaged only 1.6 percent. The Reagan economic boom restored the more usual growth rate as the economy averaged 3.5 percent in real growth from the beginning of 1983 to the end of 1990.<sup>7</sup></ul><p><b>What Happened to Jobs?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A central feature of the 1980s was a boom in jobs and employment. The figures are impressive.<ul><p><li>From 1980 to 1990, 18.6 million new jobs were created, increasing U.S. civilian employment by almost 20 percent. Almost 23 percent -- about 4.2 million -- of these jobs went to black workers.<sup>8</sup>

<p><li>By 1989, unemployment for the year had fallen to 5.3 percent, the lowest since 1973 and down from 7.1 percent in 1980 (see <a href="1980st8.gif">Table 8</a>).

<p><li>In 1989, labor force participation reached a record 66.5 percent, and a record 63 percent of the population was employed. Black labor force participation also hit a record 64.2 percent in 1989, with female labor force participation reaching an all-time record of 57.5 percent in 1990.<sup>9</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, contrary to the myth makers' claims, most jobs created during the 1980s were good jobs.
<ul>
<p><li>About 82 percent were in the higher-paying, higher-skilled (technical, precision production, managerial and professional) occupations. Only 12 percent were in the lowest-paid, low-skilled service occupations, such as retailing and fast-food restaurants.<sup>10</sup><p><li>Data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that during Ronald Reagan's first term, 48.7 percent of new jobs were in the best-paid managerial and professional category.<sup>11</sup>  This trend continued into his second term.</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This represented a dramatic turnaround from the Carter years, when most new jobs were low-paid (defined as under $7,000 per year) and the number of high-paid jobs (more than $28,000 per year) actually declined.<ul><p><li>From 1977 to 1980, 41.77 percent of the new jobs paid under $7,000 per year in real 1984 dollars, while the number of jobs paying over $28,000 per year declined by 10 percent (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>).

<p><li>During Reagan's first term, only 6 percent of the new jobs paid under $7,000 and 46.7 percent paid more than $28,000 per year, both in constant 1984 dollars (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>). This was also a dramatic improvement over the 1973-1977 Nixon/Ford term, when 37.6 percent of the new jobs were in the low-paid category and only 11.2 percent were in the high-paid category (see Table 9).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics often claim the period from 1979 to 1984 produced more lower-paying jobs, but this is misleading because it includes two terrible Carter years, 1979 and 1980. In the words of <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> columnist Robert Samuelson, "Welcome to Economics Propaganda 101. The notion that the U.S. economy is producing mostly low-paying, unskilled jobs is an economic fiction."<sup>12</sup><p><b>What Happened to Interest Rates?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton likes to claim that he reduced interest rates to their lowest levels in 15 years. The truth is that they have been falling steadily ever since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 (see <a href="1980st10.gif">Table 10</a>).
<ul>
<p><li><b>The prime rate</b> declined from an average of 18.87 percent in 1981 to 6.25 percent in 1992 and was down to 6 percent in December 1992 from a peak of 21.5 percent at the end of 1980.<sup>13</sup><p><li><b>New home mortgage rates</b> declined from an average of 14.7 percent in 1982 to 8.07 percent in November 1992.<p><li><b>AAA corporate bonds</b> declined from an average of 14.17 percent in 1981 to 8.14 percent in 1992. In December 1992, the yield dropped to 7.98 percent.

<p><li><b>The yield on new three-month Treasury bills</b> declined from an average of 14.029 percent in 1981 to 3.45 percent in 1992. In December 1992, it fell to 3.25 percent.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Clearly, today's low interest rates are a product of the Reagan and Bush years, not the Clinton years.

<p>
<b>What Happened to Incomes?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Reagan economic boom also boosted family incomes across the board.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Real median family income</b>, adjusted for inflation, began to decline during the Carter years, falling almost 10 percent from 1978 to 1982. The Reagan recovery reversed this trend. Median family incomes started to rise again in 1983 and had increased by 11.3 percent by 1989.<sup>14</sup><p><li><b>Real average income</b> of U.S. households rose by 15.2 percent from 1980 to 1989, and by 16.8 percent from 1982 to 1989, compared to a 0.8 percent decline from 1970 to 1980.<sup>15</sup><p><LI><B>Real, per capita, disposable income</b> increased by 18 percent from 1982 to 1990. In other words, American living standards increased by almost 20 percent during the Reagan economic boom.<sup>16</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics often cite a decline in income from 1979 to 1989 among families in the lowest 20 percent of incomes. This, too, is thoroughly misleading. Average real household income for the bottom quintile declined by 14.2 percent from 1979 to 1983. The Reagan boom reversed this trend, increasing this group's average real income by 12.2 percent from 1983 to 1989. Average real income was still lower in 1989 than in 1979, but the problem was the precipitous decline in such incomes during the Carter years. Reagan engineered a major recovery in the lowest group's incomes (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Real household incomes also rose for every other 20 percent of income distribution during the Reagan recovery from 1983 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, by 10.1 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, by 10.7 percent.

<p><LI>For the second-highest quintile, by 11.6 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, by 18.8 percent.<sup>17</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Real incomes rose for every quintile from 1980 to 1989, and from 1980 to 1990 as well, but declined for every quintile during the Carter years from 1977 to 1980.<sup>18</sup>  A study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that real, per capita, before-tax income rose substantially for every quintile of income distribution from 1984 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the lowest quintile, by a stunning 68 percent.

<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, by 18.7 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, by 9 percent.

<p><li>For the second-highest quintile, by 12.1 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, by 19.2 percent.<sup>19</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, there is broad movement of people among quintiles in income distribution over time. This is clearly demonstrated in a Treasury study which found that 85.8 percent of those in the bottom 20 percent of income distribution in 1979 had climbed to a higher quintile by 1988, and 65 percent had moved up at least 2 quintiles.
<ul>
<p><li>Only 14.2 percent remained in the bottom 20 percent, and 14.7 percent of those who were in the bottom 20 percent in 1979 were in the top 20 percent by 1988. Thus, people in the bottom quintile in 1979 were more likely to be in the top quintile than in the bottom quintile by 1988.

<p><li>60 percent of those in the second-lowest 20 percent in 1979 had moved into a higher quintile by 1988.

<p><li>Of those in the middle 20 percent in 1979, 47 percent had moved up to a higher-income quintile by 1988 while fewer than 20 percent had moved down to a lower quintile.

<p><li>By contrast, a third of those in the top 20 percent in 1979 had fallen to a lower-income quintile by 1988, and over half (52.7 percent) of those in the top 1 percent in 1979 had fallen to a lower-income category by 1988.<sup>20</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The results of another study by Isabel Sawhill and Mark Condon of the liberal Urban Institute are similarly instructive.<ul><p><li>The average family income of those who were in the lowest quintile of income distribution in 1977 had increased 77 percent in real inflation-adjusted terms by 1986 when many had moved to higher quintiles.<p><li>The average for those in the second-lowest quintile in 1977 had increased 37 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the middle quintile in 1977 had increased 20 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the second-highest quintile in 1977 had increased only 10 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the top quintile in 1977 had increased only 5 percent in real terms by 1986.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to Sawhill and Condon, "when one follows individuals instead of statistical groups defined by income, one finds that, on average, the rich got a little richer and the poor got much richer."  The reason:
<blockquote>
	People who start at the bottom have nowhere to move but up, and are likely to do so as they become older, gain more seniority, and earn higher incomes. People who start at the top, some of whom may be there because of temporary sources of income like capital gains, have nowhere to go but down. This pattern, however, may be surprising to the general public, which has been led to believe that the poor were literally getting poorer over the past decade or two, and that the incomes of the rich were skyrocketing. This is simply not true.<sup>21</sup></blockquote>A widely cited study by the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office erroneously contended that the top 1 percent of income earners received 60 percent of the income gains in the 1980s, but this study was filled with faulty calculations.<ul><p><li>Capital gains income was not adjusted for inflation.<p><li>Most capital losses and partnership losses were not counted.

<p><li>Appreciation of pension fund assets and homes was not counted, understating the gains of the middle and working classes.

<p><li>Incomes of the bottom 60 percent of earners were substantially undercounted, compared to incomes for those groups reported by the Census Bureau.

<p><li>Families were assigned to income quintiles with an adjustment for family size, but incomes in the study were not adjusted for family size.

<p><li>Most shocking of all, using this same flawed methodology, the real era of greed would have been the Carter years of 1977-1980 when, calculating income distribution in the same way, 100 percent of the income gains went to the top 1 percent.<sup>22</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his careful book <i>What Went Right in the 1980s</i>, on the other hand, University of California Professor Richard McKenzie presents the actual distribution of income gains based on data collected and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He shows the percentages of the increase in real, before-tax, per capita income actually earned by each quintile from 1984 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the lowest quintile, 15.4 percent.

<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, 11.9 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, 9.0 percent.

<p><li>For the second-highest quintile, 16.7 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, 46.9 percent.<sup>23</sup><p></ul>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The impression conveyed by these Tables, which show that the top 20 percent earned less than 47 percent of the income gains, stands in stark contrast to the picture painted by the Congressional Budget Office, with its top 1 percent earning 60 percent of the gains.

Another widely cited article, "The Incredible Shrinking Middle Class," published in <i>American Demographics</i> for May 1992, argued that the middle class shrank in the 1980s as the number of families earning between $15,000 and $50,000 in constant 1990 dollars fell from 58 percent of all families in 1980 to under 53 percent in 1990. According to the article's own data, however, this occurred because the incomes of so many families grew above $50,000, not because middle-class incomes fell.
<ul>
<p><li>The percentage of families earning less than $15,000 in 1990 dollars fell from 17.5 in 1980 to 16.9 in 1990.

<p><li>The percentage of families earning more than $50,000 in 1990 dollars rose from 24.5 in 1980 to nearly 31 in 1990.

<p><li>During the 1970s, while the percentage of families earning $15,000 to $50,000 in constant dollars fell from 60.5 to 58, the percentage earning less than $15,000 rose from 16 to 17.5, while the percentage earning over $50,000 rose only from 23.5 to 24.5.<sup>24</sup></ul>Statistics on income growth for different percentages of the population will always show a somewhat larger income gain for the top group studied, whether it is 1, 5, 20, or some other percentage. There are two reasons for this.<ul><p><li>Income gains for the lower groups will be reduced because the fastest gainers from each group will climb to a higher group and be counted in that group's average incomes in later periods. For example, assume the income of a person in the bottom 20 percent rises from $5,000 in the first period to $20,000 in the second period. Because this puts him in the second-lowest quintile, his income will not be among those counted in the bottom quintile in the second period. Therefore, it cannot push up the bottom quintile's average for that period. On the other hand, all income gains for those in the top group will still be counted in that group's income in the second period, simply because there is no higher group into which the fastest income gainers can rise.

<p><li>Also, as incomes rise over time, the cut-off necessary to be in the top 1, 5, 20, or other percent will rise. This means the average income needed to qualify for the top group also will rise. For example, it may take $100,000 to be in the top 1 percent in the first year; in the second year, if the incomes of the next 9 percent rise rapidly during the year, it may take $110,000 to qualify for the top 1 percent. Many in the next 9 percent may climb over some in the top 1 percent to form a new top 1 percent with a higher average income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another device often used to distort income or other economic statistics for the 1980s is to include some of the Carter years or other bad years from the 1970s in the calculation. Periods cited may start with 1979, 1977, or even 1973. Shifting the starting point to years before 1981, when Ronald Reagan took office, lumps declining incomes or other declining economic performance from the 1970s with rising incomes or other economic performance from the Reagan years, leaving a distorted impression.

<p>
<b>What Happened to the Federal Tax Burden?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Probably the greatest myth about the 1980s is that Ronald Reagan slashed taxes dramatically for the rich, the result being that they no longer pay their fare share. The flaw in this claim is that it mixes tax rates with taxes actually paid and ignores the real trend of taxation.
<ul>
<p><li>In 1991 (the last year for which data are available), the top 1 percent of taxpayers in income paid 25 percent of all income taxes, the top 5 percent paid 43 percent, and the bottom 50 percent paid only 5 percent (see <a href="1980st11.gif">Table 11</a>). To suggest that this distribution is unfair because it is too easy on upper-income groups is nothing less than absurd.

<p><LI>The proportion of total income taxes paid by the top 1 percent rose sharply under Reagan from 18 percent in 1981 to 28 percent in 1988 (see Table 11).

<p><li>Average effective income tax rates were cut even more for lower-income groups than for higher-income groups. While the average effective tax rate for the top 1 percent fell by 30 percent between 1980 and 1992 -- and by 35 percent for the top 20 percent  of income earners -- it was reduced by 44 percent for the second-highest quintile, 46 percent for the middle quintile, 64 percent for the second-lowest quintile, and 263 percent for the bottom quintile (see <a href="1980st12.gif">Table 12</a>).

<p><li>The reductions for the lowest-income groups were so large because Reagan doubled the personal exemption, increased the standard deduction, and tripled the earned income tax credit (EITC), which provides net cash for single-parent families with children at the lowest income levels. These changes eliminated income tax liability altogether for over 4 million lower-income families.<sup>25</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics often add the Social Security payroll tax and argue that the total federal tax burden shifted more to lower-income groups and away from upper-income groups, but Reagan's changes were in the income tax, not in the Social Security payroll tax. The payroll tax was imposed by liberal members of Congress over the last 50 years, and it is they, not Ronald Reagan, who should be held accountable for its distributional effects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even if one counts the Social Security payroll tax, the share of total federal taxes increased for the following:
<ul>
<p><li>For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, from 12.9 percent in 1980 to 15.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the top 5 percent of taxpayers, from 27.3 percent in 1980 to 30.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the top 20 percent of taxpayers, from 56.1 percent in 1980 to 58.6 percent in 1989.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Similarly, even if one includes the Social Security payroll tax, the share of total federal taxes declined for four groups:
<ul>
<p><li>For the second-highest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 22.2 percent in 1980 to 20.8 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the middle 20 percent of taxpayers, from 13.2 percent in 1980 to 12.5 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the second-lowest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 6.9 percent in 1980 to 6.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li></ul>For the lowest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 1.6 percent in 1980 to 1.5 percent in 1989.<sup>26</sup><p><b>What Happened to Poverty?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite claims to the contrary, the Reagan economic recovery was effective in reducing poverty.
<ul>
<p><li>The poverty rate actually started to increase rapidly during the Carter years, rising by one-third from 1978 to 1983, when it climbed from 11.4 percent to 15.2 percent. It fell every year from 1984 to 1989, however, dropping by one-sixth from its 1983 peak to 12.8 percent in 1989.<sup>27</sup><p><li>The black poverty rate fell to 30.6 percent in 1989, the lowest on record except for 30.6 percent in 1978 and 30.3 percent in 1974.<sup>28</sup><p><li>From 1978 to 1983, the number of people in poverty increased by about 40 percent, from 24.7 million to 35.3 million. The Reagan recovery again reversed this trend, reducing the poverty population to 31.5 million -- a drop of 3.8 million -- in 1989.<sup>29</sup></ul><p><b>What Happened to the Misery Index?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A popular indicator of the economic performance of Presidents has been the so-called misery index, defined as the total of inflation and unemployment each year. Ronald Reagan engineered the largest reduction in the misery index in history. From 1980 to 1988 (Reagan's last year in office), the index fell by over 50 percent. At 9.6, the index in 1988 was lower than in any other year since 1970, except for 1972 (see <a href="1980sc1.gif">Chart 1</a>). The Presidency of Jimmy Carter, who invented the term, still holds the record for the highest misery indices.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Harvard University economist Robert Barro has developed a different index of Presidential economic performance. His Economic Report Card for Presidents includes the change each year in inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and growth in Gross National Product (GNP) under each President.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of all eleven Presidents since 1949, Reagan ranks both highest (first term, 1981-1985) and second-highest (second term, 1985-1989) in economic performance under Barro's index. Jimmy Carter ranks lowest, and George Bush ranks fifth (see <a href="1980st13.gif">Table 13</a>).

<p>

<b>The Boom in Charity</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1980s has been labeled by some as the decade of greed. The truth is that total giving to charitable causes in the United States grew at a record pace.
<ul>
<p><li>Between 1980 and 1989, charitable giving in real terms increased by 5.1 percent per year, compared to 3.3 percent per year from 1955 through 1979.<sup>30</sup><p><LI>Charitable giving per capita in real terms grew at a rate of 4 percent per year, double the rate of 2 percent per year from 1955 to 1979.<sup>31</sup><p><li>Between 1980 and 1989, charitable giving in real dollars rose by 56 percent to $121 billion.<sup>32</sup></ul><p><b>The Surge in Manufacturing</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another myth holds that during the 1980s, the U.S. economy was deindustrializing as manufacturing became uncompetitive and fell into decline. The facts tell a vastly different story.<ul><p><li>Manufacturing output rose by 38 percent in real inflation-adjusted dollars between 1980 and 1989. This left output at 23 percent of GNP in 1989, compared to 21 percent in 1980, and higher as a percentage of GNP in 1988 and 1989 than in any other year since World War II.<sup>33</sup><p><Li>The total industrial production index rose by about 30 percent from 1980 to 1990 and by about one-third during the Reagan recovery years of 1983 through 1990, about the same as total real economic growth. The more narrow manufacturing production index rose even faster, climbing by 39.5 percent from 1980 to 1990 and by 43.5 percent from 1983 to 1990.<sup>34</sup><p><li>Manufacturing productivity tripled, climbing almost 42 percent from 1980 to 1990 at a rate of 3.5 percent per year.<sup>35</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of this sharp rise in productivity, U.S. manufacturing employment fell from 20 percent of total employment in 1980 to 16 percent in 1990, even though manufacturing output was near its highest-ever levels of GNP.<sup>36</sup>  Producing more and more with fewer workers is a sign of economic health and efficiency, not of failure.<p><b>Understanding the Trade Deficit</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics have made much of the fact that our trade deficit climbed from $19.4 billion in 1980 to $109.1 billion in 1984 and $145.4 billion in 1987 (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). This is among the most meaningless economic statistics collected, however, and in no way indicates economic weakness during the Reagan years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Deficits in the international trade in goods and services inevitably are balanced by surpluses in international capital transactions. A dollar earned overseas by selling to the United States ultimately can be used only to buy U.S. goods and services or to invest in the U.S. Therefore, dollars sent overseas for imports must be used to buy U.S. exports or to invest in the U.S., and total transactions must always balance. Even if the money is held overseas, the foreigner is investing in dollars, which is also a form of investment in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An inflow of capital investment means generally that foreign interests, instead of buying U.S. goods and services with money made by selling imports to the United States, are using it to buy capital assets in the U.S. The result is a deficit in trade, but a surplus in capital transactions. This is not a sign of economic deterioration, however; it is a sign of economic strength. It means the U.S. economy is strong enough to attract foreign capital investment to fuel still more economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This was the chief cause of the rising U.S. trade deficit during the 1980s. President Reagan's reductions in taxes, regulation, and inflation made the U.S. economy very attractive to foreign investors. The results:
<ul>
<p><li>Foreign private investment in the U.S. more than doubled in just two years, from $42.6billion in 1980 to $88.8 billion in 1982.

<p><li>By 1986, it had more than doubled again to $187.5 billion; by 1989, it had climbed to $205 billion (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The effect is similar when U.S. citizens who have been investing abroad bring their capital home. Foreign interests, because they no longer are receiving dollars from those investments, also cannot use these dollars to buy U.S. goods and services, offsetting U.S. purchases of goods and services overseas. Everything else being equal, the trade deficit will rise when U.S. capital investment overseas falls and U.S. investors put their money in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This was another cause of our rising trade deficit; but like the inflow of capital investment from abroad, it is a sign of strength, not deterioration. It means the economy is attracting the increased investment that leads to still more economic growth. Under Ronald Reagan, the net outflow of U.S. investment abroad collapsed in just two years, from $111.2 billion in 1982 to $20.6 billion in 1984 (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). Reductions in taxes, regulation, and inflation appealed to U.S. investors just as they did to foreign investors, leading them to bring their capital home to invest in the booming U.S. economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Booming economies also tend to run trade deficits, however. They import increased inputs from around the world to fuel their rapidly increasing production, which may be sold to their increasingly rich citizens rather than abroad, leaving a net trade deficit.<sup>37</sup>  This happened in the U.S. as the Reagan economy boomed from the end of 1982 to the middle of 1990, as discussed above.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 1980s trade deficit certainly did not come about because U.S. goods and services were not competitive.
<ul>
<p><li>U.S. exports of manufactured goods rose by 90 percent from 1986 to 1992, compared to an increase of only 25 percent for the other leading industrial countries in the OECD. Our share of world manufacturing exports consequently increased from 14 percent in 1987 to 18 percent in 1991.<sup>38</sup><p><li>U.S. services are recognized as the best in the world, and net exports of those services multiplied by several times from 1986 to 1992.<sup>39</sup>  Exports accounted for 15.2 percent of GNP by 1990, up from 12.2 percent in 1980.<sup>40</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The U.S. ran a trade deficit for almost all of its first 100 years as it attracted tidal waves of foreign investment and its economy boomed, bringing in goods and services from around the world to fuel production and create the mightiest economic machine in world history. Trade deficits were an indication not of economic weakness, but of the skyrocketing economic strength of the new, free-market nation. During the Great Depression, by contrast, the U.S. ran trade surpluses.<sup>41</sup> Similarly, during the 100 years from Waterloo in 1815 to World War I in 1914, Britain dominated the world economically but also ran chronic trade deficits. As Wall Street financier Evan Galbraith has written, "America in the 1980s should be compared to Britain in its glory years, and not to a country that shows a trade deficit because its products are not competitive."<sup>42</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>By 1990, the trade deficit was falling rapidly, declining to $76.8 billion in that year (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). Of course, U.S. economic growth all but disappeared during these years as well, as the Reagan boom ended in 1990. Just as the 1980s trade deficit was not a sign of economic weakness, its decline around the turn of the decade clearly was not a sign of economic strength.

<p><li>In line with the decline in the trade deficit, foreign investment in the U.S. dropped precipitously, from $205.2 billion in 1989 to $65.5 billion in 1990 and $48.6 billion in 1991 (see Table 14).

<p><li>Private U.S. investment abroad also had climbed back up to $71.4 billion in 1991, and the weak U.S. economy no longer was pulling imported inputs to fuel booming growth. These factors accounted for the decline in the trade deficit, just as their reverse accounted for its earlier increase.

</uL>
<p>
<b>Understanding Debt and Wealth</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The claim that the U.S. economy was burdened with excessive debt during the 1980s also is erroneous. Wealth soared, creating the capacity for additional debt, but debt generally increased no faster than the trends of earlier decades.
<ul>
<p><li>Real personal assets rose by nearly $6 trillion, from $15.5 trillion in 1980 to $21.1 trillion in 1990, an increase of 36 percent. Because the increase in real personal assets was three times the increase in personal debt (which rose by $1.8 trillion), personal real net worth rose by $3.8 trillion, or 29 percent.<sup>43</sup>

<p><li>The stock market more than tripled in value from 1980 to 1990, a larger increase than in any previous postwar decade. The ratio of corporate debt to market value of corporate assets was the same in 1989 as in 1969.<sup>44</sup><p><li>Total debt liabilities of all private, non-financial sectors rose at a rate of 5.4 percent, compared to 6.15 percent for the 1950s and 5.01 percent for the 1960s.<sup>45</sup>  This hardly seems excessive when compared to previous years.<p><li>Total real private net worth rose by $4.3 trillion from 1980 to 1989, at which time it totaled $17.1 trillion in constant 1987 dollars, an increase of about one-third over 1980.<sup>46</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another popular complaint has been that the United States became a "debtor nation" in the 1980s. The value of foreign investment in the United States exceeded the value of U.S. investment overseas for the first time in 1988, we are told, and the "investment deficit" has grown every year since then.<sup>47</sup>  This actually is another sign of economic strength, however, because it means the United States became more attractive to the world's investors.
<ul>
<p><li>U.S. investment income from overseas continued to exceed income to foreign interests from U.S. investments over this period by close to $20 billion per year.<sup>48</sup>  This indicates that a true valuation would show that U.S. investments overseas still are worth more than foreign investments in the U.S.<p><li>U.S. investments overseas are older on average, and their historical costs,upon which "debtor nation" statistics are based, underestimate their current market value even more as a result. The government has yet to find a way to account fully for the current market value of investments.

<p><li>Much foreign investment is equity investment, which represents no burden of repayment by the American people. It simply will earn the value of what it produces, with no guarantee of profits, as the increased capital invested enhances overall economic growth, jobs, and incomes.<sup>49</sup></ul><b>The Bottom Line: International Comparisons</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The United States today remains the wealthiest society on earth.<ul><p><li>Adjusting exchange rates for purchasing power parity, which compares what goods and services families in each country can buy, the U.S. standard of living is easily the highest in the world, exceeding West Germany's by about 25 percent and Japan's by about 40 percent.<sup>50</sup><p><li>Measured by actual physical conditions, the United States has much more and newer housing space, more cars per capita, more appliances, and more comforts generally than Western Europe, Japan, or any other nation or region.<sup>51</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some have argued that America is declining because the U.S. economy has fallen as a percentage of the world economy during the years since World War II. This decline stopped in about 1975, however, with the U.S. economy remaining through the 1980s about 34 percent as large as the rest of the world's economies combined.<sup>52</sup>  Moreover, after World War II, with most of the world's other major economies devastated by the war, the U.S. economy accounted for a huge percentage of the world economy.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One should hardly be surprised to find that our share of the world economy has declined as these other economies have rebuilt; nor should one be surprised or alarmed that it has declined further as some of the world's underdeveloped countries have learned to prosper. Far from indicating a problem with U.S. economic strength, these developments benefit the U.S. as well as the rest of the world. It would have been unrealistic indeed to expect our unusual postwar position relative to 
other countries not to decline as a result of the mutually beneficial and hoped-for economic development of those countries.

<P>
<DD>
The Clinton Administration claims that a declining foreign affairs budget is threatening the ability of the United States to conduct foreign policy. Referring to Congress's attempts to curb wasteful government spending, former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his successor, Madeleine Albright, have stated that budget cuts have forced the closure of overseas embassies and other diplomatic offices.<SUP>1</SUP>  To deal with this alleged threat to U.S. diplomacy, the Clinton Administration is calling for increased spending in the foreign affairs budget, which includes funding for U.S. embassies, consulates, foreign aid programs, and international institutions like the World Bank and the United Nations.

<P>
<DD>
Secretaries Christopher and Albright are right to want a robust overseas diplomatic presence. Indeed, ensuring that the ability of the United States to conduct foreign affairs is unhindered should be a concern of every Administration. Christopher and Albright are raising a false alarm, however, about cuts in the foreign affairs budget. Funding for U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic programs is higher in real terms today than it was during most of the 1980s, in the time of the Cold War. In fact, current funding has remained fairly stable for the past few years and is greater than levels in 1991 (see <A HREF="bg1102c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).

<P>
<DD>
If more funding for embassies is needed because of pressing demands -- like the need to open and operate new embassies in the early 1990s in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union -- then there is plenty of money in wasteful and ineffective economic development aid and other non-essential accounts to cover the cost of these new operations. In short, there is no need for an increase in the overall foreign affairs budget.

<P>
<B>THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS BUDGET</B>

<P>
<DD>
Secretary Christopher claims that "spending on international affairs has been slashed by 50 percent [since 1985]."  He also insists that these "budget cuts have forced us to close over two dozen consulates and several embassies."<SUP>2</SUP>  The solution he advocates is the Administration's proposal to increase the overall foreign affairs budget to $19.3 billion in FY 1998, an increase of $1.2 billion.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Real increases.</B> Christopher's assessment that the overall foreign affairs budget has decreased in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985 is accurate. Close examination of the programs within the foreign affairs budget, however, reveals that embassies and consulates have not borne the brunt of reductions in the foreign affairs budget. In fact, funding for embassies and consulates has increased by 13 percent in real terms since 1985.<SUP>3</SUP>  Other diplomatic activities, such as student exchanges and public diplomacy, have seen only minor fluctuations in funding since 1985 (see <A HREF="bg1102c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).<SUP>4</SUP> 

<P>
<DD>
In addition, the State Department also has seen a sharp increase in its budget. For example, current funding for the State Department, once it is adjusted for inflation, is over 25 percent higher than it was in 1985 (see <A HREF="bg1102c2.gif">Chart 2</A>). In fact, spending in real terms for the State Department has risen steadily since 1987, peaking in 1994 and experiencing only a slight decline since then. Despite this drop, current funding for the State Department remains well above Cold War levels in the 1980s. This situation is a far cry from the budget "hemorrhaging" described by Christopher.<SUP>5</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>Where are the cuts?</B> The foreign affairs budget includes funding for many diplomatic activities and programs. In addition to spending for U.S. embassies and consulates, it supports numerous international organizations, development aid, security assistance, and export financing. In fact, non-embassy spending accounts for approximately 70 percent of the entire foreign affairs budget. Although expenditures on diplomatic programs within the State Department have risen steadily, spending on international financial programs and foreign aid has dropped.<SUP>6</SUP>  Reductions in development aid, security aid, and international financial programs -- not cuts in direct diplomatic funding -- are primarily responsible for the overall reduction in the foreign affairs budget (see <A HREF="bg1102c3.gif">Chart 3</A>).

<P>
<DD>
It is true that increasing demands were placed on the State Department immediately at the end of the Cold War. The dissolution of the Soviet Union required the establishment of a number of new embassies and consulates. The startup costs for these offices, such as purchasing or constructing buildings, mandated increased funding. Congress recognized this need and increased funding appropriately. This spending increase is apparent in the Conduct of Foreign Affairs budget from 1992 to 1994 (see <A HREF="bg1102c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).

<P>
<DD>
The initial costs of establishing these embassies and consulates passed long ago, however. It is unlikely that expenses for embassies and consulates should far outstrip the funding requirements in 1991, which were higher than during most of the 1980s. Funding for embassies and consulates has remained stable for the past three budgets. No cries of critical funding shortages were heard until recently. Therefore, the claim that the relatively modest reductions in funding since 1994 have caused the closure of embassies and consulates is disingenuous.
<P>

<B>THE FAILED LEGACY OF FOREIGN AID PROGRAMS</B>

<P>
<DD>
Instead of seeking to increase funding for the foreign affairs budget, the Clinton Administration should look to eliminate the numerous programs within the foreign affairs budget that are wasteful. The most likely candidate for elimination is economic development aid. Policymakers long have recognized that foreign aid programs are among the most inefficient and wasteful funded by the federal government. The Hamilton-Gilman Task Force Report of 1989, the <I>State 2000: A New Model for Managing Foreign Affairs</I> State Department report of 1992, and even Vice President Al Gore's "reinventing government" initiative concluded that U.S. foreign aid programs are in dire need of reform. These conclusions led Secretary Christopher to recommend in 1995 that the Agency for International Development (AID) be abolished and its activities merged with those of the State Department.

<P>
<DD>
Why eliminate economic development assistance?  The answer is clear: It does more harm than good to fragile, less-developed economies. For example, of the 66 less-developed countries that have received loans from the World Bank for longer than 25 years, 37 are no better off today than they were before they received those loans. Of these 37 countries, 20 actually are poorer than they were before receiving the loans.<SUP>7</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Neither does foreign aid necessarily advance U.S. interests abroad. In fact, most U.S. foreign aid goes to countries that frequently oppose U.S. interests. For example, two of every three recipients of U.S. foreign aid vote against the United States in the U.N. a majority of the time.<SUP>8</SUP>  If the Clinton Administration and Congress need to find foreign affairs items to cut, AID and economic development aid programs clearly are the best candidates.

<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>
<DD>The United States needs to have a strong diplomatic overseas presence. Congress and the Clinton Administration should work to ensure that U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic activities are fully funded. But there is no need to increase the foreign affairs budget to keep these embassies open. More than enough funding would be available if the Agency for International Development were abolished and economic development aid ended. Savings from these cuts could be applied to embassy activities, if needed. Secretaries Christopher and Albright were correct to be concerned about funding U.S. diplomatic activities. But they were wrong in thinking that increasing the foreign affairs budget is the only way to achieve this goal.

<a href="fyi109t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Comparing this Congress with Clinton's and Reagan's Selected Spending Cuts
<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.

Defenders of big government would have us believe that Congress and the President have shown tremendous fiscal restraint in recent years and that this Congress's efforts to reduce spending further can be achieved only by cutting muscle and bone. But waste, fraud, and abuse still abound in many government programs. Consider the following recently revealed examples:<p>

<b>Doing Well by Doing Good. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Baltimore Public Housing Authority's operations are funded largely by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) -- $52 million in operating subsidies for FY 1994 -- and the PHA has a waiting list of 25,000 poor families in line for housing assistance. Yet the Baltimore authority was found to have improperly used the public's money by buying eight new Chevy Blazers as take-home cars for its top managers, hiring a high-bid security firm that employed 29 convicted felons, and spending more than $25 million of building repair funds on no-bid contracts to contractors, including some who were friends and relatives of Authority employees. HUD asked that $725,000 be returned because of inflated costs or work never completed.<sup>1</sup>  Despite this record of mismanagement, HUD just awarded the same housing authority $115 million to construct 338 new apartment units for the poor as part of a court-imposed desegregation settlement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Kevin E. Marchman, HUD's Assistant Secretary-Designate for Public and Indian Housing, (202) 708-0950.
<p>
<b>They All Threatened to Leave. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 95 percent of the bonuses recently granted by the managers of the U.S. Export-Import Bank to their employees were "improper and excessive" and cost the taxpayer as much as $1 million in overpayments.<sup>2</sup>  According to the GAO, 1995 bonuses were granted to 200 of the Bank's 448 employees, but only 10 of the 200 employees were actually eligible to receive the money. Ex-Im's bonus abuse was uncovered a year earlier when a GAO audit revealed that just five government agencies accounted for 94 percent of these special retention bonuses. Although the Ex-Im Bank had the smallest work force of the five agencies reviewed, it accounted for 25 percent of all bonuses government-wide, and the GAO auditors noted that many of these awards "did not appear to comply with the statutory requirement."  Whereas the Department of Defense granted such bonuses to only 0.03 percent of its work force in 1994, 21 percent of Ex-Im employees received such bonuses that year, and nearly 45 percent received them in 1995. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the acting head of the Ex-IM Bank was stripped of his authority to grant bonuses by the Office of Personnel Management, his April 1996 recess appointment to the top Bank post by President Clinton was accompanied by the reinstatement of bonus-granting authority. And although Ex-Im Bank officials have argued that they are merely continuing Bush Administration practices, the GAO audit indicates that no such bonuses were granted by the Ex-Im Bank during those years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Martin Kamarck, President and Chairman-Designate of the Export-Import Bank, (202) 565-3500.
<p>

<b>Deadbeat Schools. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Students attending proprietary trade schools are eligible for federal student loans, and these loans have experienced excessively high default rates over the past several years, hitting a high of 41.2 percent in 1990. Included among the hundreds of proprietary schools that were selected for direct federal student loans are the California Medical School of Shiatsu, the Hypnosis Motivation Institute, the Trend Benders Academy, the Milpitas Electrolysis and Thermolysis College, and the Las Vegas Gaming and Technical School. Although improvements have been made in reducing the default rates at proprietary schools during both the Bush and Clinton Administrations, students from more than 200 of these schools have current default rates in excess of 40 percent, and these schools are still eligible for federal student loans.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Deputy Assistant Secretary Elizabeth M. Hicks, Office of Student Financial Assistance Programs, U.S. Department of Education, (202) 260-6536.

American consumers pay a heavy price to subsidize the sugar barons, of whom some of the richest are foreign citizens. The brothers Alfonso Jr. (Alfie) and Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, immigrants from Cuba but citizens of Spain, possess a fortune estimated at over $500 million. This fortune includes several Florida sugar mills, 170,000 acres of cane in south Florida, and another 240,000 acres of land in the Dominican Republic. But as "domestic" growers, they are entitled to the sugar import protection enforced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which adds about 8 cents a pound to what the American consumer pays for sugar and about $65 million to the annual income of the Fanjuls.<sup>4</sup>  As if this were not enough government help, the Fanjuls' other business interests have benefited from federal, state, and local affirmative action programs that provide minority set-asides for qualified firms. For example, the Fanjuls' investment firm, FAIC Securities, enjoys the right to market the debt of Florida municipalities and such government-sponsored enterprises as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Banks.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Daniel Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, (202) 720-3631.

Years of financial mismanagement have left the District of Columbia's government bankrupt and D.C. officials coming to Congress for yet another taxpayer bailout of hundreds of millions of dollars. So serious is the shortfall that clinics for the poor have been closed, teachers furloughed, snow covered streets unplowed, and police cars left unrepaired. But despite the fiscal crisis, Lloyd Arrington, Jr., President of the city-funded Economic Development Finance Corporation (EDFC), was able to maintain most of his costly perks despite the poor performance of the EDFC. Created in 1986 to encourage business development in the District of Columbia, and provided with $6.75 million in funds to loan to promising businesses, the EDFC and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Neighborhood Economic Development Corporation, made only 17 loans through 1994, or less than two loans per year. Although nine were in default or charged off as of 1994, the audit<sup>5</sup> reported that EDFC's President Arrington received a bonus of $17,000 on top of his $70,000 salary, another $1,650 to pay for parking, and $600 in "improper expenditures" for rented formal wear, dinners, and entertainment. Nonetheless, the audit does indicate that progress toward fiscal restraint is being made:  The EFDC's annual spending on flowers, which had hit a high of more than $2,000 per year in 1989 and 1990, had been phased out to zero by 1993. 
<p>

Who's in Charge:  City Council of the District of Columbia, (202) 724-8176.

"Today our federal [work force] is 200,000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President."

<p>-- President Bill Clinton, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1996

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
President Clinton wants to convince the American people he has pared back the bloated federal work force. The American people certainly have every reason to resent the large number of federal bureaucrats whose apparent mission is to turn their daily lives into the sort of nightmares described in the novels of Franz Kafka. These bureaucrats include auditors from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutinizing tax returns, regulators from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undermining productive enterprises, and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) trying to seize the guns of law-abiding citizens. Reducing the numbers of these bureaucrats should and will be popular with the American people.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The disturbing thing is that most of the eliminated positions cited by President Clinton are not coming from the IRS, the EPA, the ATF, or similar regulatory or enforcement agencies. The vast majority of the positions being eliminated belong to the people who helped win the Persian Gulf War. In short, most are from the Department of Defense. For example:<ul>

<p><li>Some 60 percent of the 200,000 eliminated positions cited by the President come from a single department, the Department of Defense.<sup>1</sup><p><li>Personnel reductions at the Pentagon are even more severe than the President would have Americans believe. The personnel reductions cited by President Clinton include only federal civilian employees, including those at the Department of Defense, but not active duty or reserve component military personnel. In fact, total federal employment, including both civilian and military personnel, as of the end of fiscal 1997 will have dropped by 849,000 positions from levels prevailing at the end of FY 1992.<sup>2</sup><p><li>Of all federal civilian and military positions lost since the end of FY 1992, over 89 percent (almost 760,000) will have come solely from the Department of Defense (see <a href="bgup278c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).

<p><li>President Clinton's cuts in defense jobs have not been limited to the public sector (see <a href="bgup278c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Defense industry jobs by the end of FY 1997 will have dropped by 795,000 positions from levels prevailing at the end of FY 1992.<sup>3</sup><p><li>In 1997, there will be 1.5 million fewer defense jobs (including those in the military, the civil service, and industry) than in 1992 (see <a href="bgup278c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).<sup>4</sup>  In total, defense sector employment is down by 22 percent. Meanwhile, IRS employment has dropped by only 6 percent, ATF positions have dropped by less than 5 percent, and EPA positions have <i>increased</i> by over 2 percent (see <a href="bgup278c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).</ul>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
President Clinton's federal employment policy is unbalanced. One department, the Department of Defense, bears a disproportionate share of personnel reductions. The President's policies punish defense employees in the private sector as well. The American people do not need federal bureaucrats from agencies such as the IRS, EPA, and ATF watching their every move and telling them how to live their lives. But they do need the sort of skilled people that contributed to victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War.
<p>
<b>RESTORING BALANCE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT POLICY</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
To restore balance to federal employment policy, the Clinton Administration should:<ul>

<p><li>Freeze military personnel reductions at the level recommended by the Clinton Administration in its 1993 "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy. This amounts to about 2.4 million positions, including active troops and reserves. A military of this size should be adequate to handle the nation's future military requirements. However, within these limits, the Pentagon should be flexible in dividing the number of billets for active and reserve forces. The Administration should decrease personnel strength in the Army National Guard and increase the number of active duty personnel, who are better suited to addressing the short-notice conflicts likely to arise in the post-Cold War world. Moreover, since the Navy's power projection capabilities are particularly suited to the post-Cold War security needs of the U.S., the Administration should ensure that the number of naval personnel is relatively higher than the number for other services.

<p><li>Limit further reductions in civilian positions at the Department of Defense to those achieved through privatization efforts. The current excessive reliance on public sector civilian employees to perform such routine services as depot maintenance of equipment for the Department of Defense and the military services should be reduced. Current law requires that public employees perform no less than 60 percent of this work. The private sector certainly is more efficient in performing maintenance and other services. Savings can be achieved by privatizing a significant number of services and allowing defense contractors greater flexibility to do the work. Additional civilian work force reductions outside the privatization effort, however, should be limited. This will ensure that civilian support and management positions within the Department of Defense are adequate to meet the needs of the military force required for U.S. security in the post-Cold War world. 

<p><li>Increase the Department of Defense procurement budget. Procurement funding -- the money the Pentagon spends to buy new weapons -- has fallen by more than two-thirds in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985. This has caused the loss of over 1.3 million defense industry jobs since the employment peak in 1987. Annual real increases in the procurement budget, which provides much of the money for defense industry jobs, will reverse this trend and help preserve the defense industry jobs that are necessary for a strong national defense. These increases are needed to replace aging weapons and equipment that will become obsolete by early in the next decade.

<p><li>Concentrate federal work force reductions within non-defense departments. Further reductions in non-defense civilian positions in the federal government should result from a policy of eliminating unnecessary and outdated federal programs and agencies. Putting caps or ceilings on the federal civilian work force does little to reduce the size or scope of government. In fact, it may lead to the poor delivery of government services by failing to distinguish between successful and failed federal programs. Instead, work force reductions should come from eliminating unnecessary agencies, consolidating similar programs, devolving authority to the states, simplifying taxes, and pursuing a policy of deregulation. The Heritage Foundation's budget plan, <i>Rolling Back Government</i>, would reduce the federal government from its current level of 14 cabinet-level departments to five.<sup>5</sup>  The plan also would reduce the non-defense federal work force by approximately 10 percent over the next five years (FY 1997-2001).</ul><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Reducing the federal work force is an appropriate goal. The American people should demand the elimination of wasteful bureaucracies. But cutting into America's fighting force and then claiming credit for downsizing the government is not only misleading, but damaging to national security. In essence, Clinton's federal employment policy is a cloak hiding the Administration's policy of weakening America's military strength.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Now that the true impact of President Clinton's federal employment policy has been revealed, Congress should set about the task of restoring balance to the federal work force. It should limit further reductions in the defense sector and focus instead on dealing with the real cause of waste in government: the bloated non-defense federal bureaucracy.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within the next few weeks, the U.S. Senate will have an opportunity to achieve genuine reform of transportation policy. But <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.00729:">S. 729</a>, a bill that would remove the transportation trust funds from the budget and from meaningful congressional oversight, is flawed and would not lead to needed reform. A preferable alternative would be legislative proposals now being prepared in the Senate that would return the highway programs to the states and allow them to collect the existing fuel tax and use it to finance transportation projects of their choosing. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sponsored by Senators Trent Lott (R-MS) and Max Baucus (D-MT), the Trust Fund Restoration Act of 1995 (S. 729) would give federal highway spending budgetary exemptions and protections that even Social Security does not now have.<sup>1</sup>  Thus enactment of S. 729 would be a missed opportunity for the Senate to redesign and localize government involvement in areas vital to the health of the economy. At a time when transportation problems increasingly are local in nature, today's centrally directed Eisenhower-era program offers no solutions. S. 729 would do nothing to alter that deficiency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House version of the bill (<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.00842:">H.R. 842</a> -- surprisingly entitled the Truth in Budgeting Act) passed the House this April. But many of those who voted for it did so in the belief that the bill would die, or at least be purged of its worst excesses, in the Senate. Unfortunately, they and the taxpayers may be very disappointed, because the process in the Senate is beginning to look like a scramble by special interests to obtain additional budgetary privileges. Already legislation has been introduced in the Senate (S.1395), sponsored by Senator William Roth (R-DE), to turn Amtrak into an entitlement by creating for it the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund. The Fund would be financed by diverting 0.5 cents of the 18.4 cents now collected by the federal fuel tax for the other transportation trust funds. That such a tax could be proposed to finance one of the government's more questionable activities reflects the growing aggressiveness of taxpayer-dependent industries as they try to place a lock on the public's money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The enactment of S. 729 would be an enormous obstacle to transportation reform. Instead of hiding the program by moving it off budget, Congress should turn its attention to solutions that are local in emphasis, and should work cooperatively with the Budget Committee, the governors, and reformers in the House and Senate to develop a reform package that will better address the transportation needs of the country.
<P>
<b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH S. 729</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Trust Fund Restoration Act (S. 729) would exempt all of the transportation trust funds from all of the key control provisions of the congressional budget process. These include budget caps that limit discretionary budget authority and outlays, pay-as-you-go rules, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequestration, and any other statutory budget limitations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sponsors contend that the special budgetary privileges S. 729 would grant are essential to protect federal highway and other transportation spending from congressional budget cutters who might want to divert the $20 billion-plus in revenues raised by the federal fuel tax to deficit reduction or to other programs. But insulating the trust fund from budget scrutiny would make it more difficult for Congress to set clear budget priorities. Moreover, experience demonstrates that the risk of a congressional diversion of trust fund money to other purposes is overstated. In fact, federal highway programs have benefited from federal spending well in excess of the dedicated fuel tax receipts allocated to the trust fund. Since 1957, total federal spending on highways has exceeded highway trust fund receipts by more than $37 billion, making the diversion of highway revenues to other programs unlikely. <a href="ib225t1.gif">Table 1</a> presents a year-by-year analysis of highway receipts and spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enactment of the bill would set back the prospects for transportation reform, regional equity, and honest budgeting. With the highway trust fund moved off budget, highway spending would be given preferential treatment and, unlike other programs, would be absolved from making any sacrifices in order to achieve fiscal restraint and a robust economy. Specifically:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would make it more difficult to achieve sound public finance decisions because it would allow lawmakers to avoid hard budget choices. Lawmakers should have to decide whether pork-barrel highway spending should be more important than spending for national security or programs targeted to the needy and disabled. The legislation would allow them to avoid making such choices in the case of highway spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is left of the federal budget would understate federal spending and taxes. By essentially removing highway funding from the normal presentation of the budget, the legislation would understate the size of the federal government. In FY 1996, some $302 billion, or 19.2 percent of spending, was already off-budget. S. 729 would add another $30 billion-$35 billion to that figure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Highway programs would be removed from ongoing congressional oversight, and the outdated and inequitable allocation of pay-in and pay-out by the states would be preserved. In the current allocation scheme, the 27 donor states that subsidize the 23 recipient states (and the District of Columbia) would remain unchanged. <a href="ib225t2.gif">Table 2</a> presents the states by gain or loss, with several states such as Florida, Georgia, and Kentucky receiving from the trust fund less than three-quarters of the share paid in.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The highway program would be exempted from the budget's discretionary spending caps. This would reduce the annual appropriations process for transportation programs to an empty exercise because any actions taken would not count for purposes of budget scorekeeping or deficit reduction. Furthermore, this diminished congressional oversight would take away the incentive to improve a program that has not changed fundamentally since its origins in the 1950s, and would make more difficult the development and enactment of any of the reform proposals to transfer, devolve, block grant, or give back some or all of the highway revenue and spending authority to the states. Once the program is moved off budget and no longer is subject to annual budget review or periodic authorization, Congress would have fewer scheduled opportunities to review and improve it, and, therefore, fewer opportunities to effect needed reforms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This final point is critical. Enactment of S. 729 would make it extremely difficult to reform outdated and ineffective transportation policies. Putting the program off budget and no longer subject to regular congressional review, authorization, and appropriation means that several prominent proposals to shift more of the resources and program management to the states would face greater obstacles to serious consideration and enactment. Such devolution is needed. With the interstate highway system completed, and with most transportation problems now largely local in nature, a centralized program operated by a Washington bureaucracy makes no sense.
<p>
<b>AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rather than weaken the oversight of highway programs and insulate them from budget review, the Senate should be seeking ways to devolve those programs to the states, where local taxpayers and elected officials can better determine how to get full value for the money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proposals include the modest reforms endorsed by the Step 21 Coalition (representing 22 states). The Coalition plan would streamline highway program procedures, make more equitable the allocation of funds among states, and preserve the integrity of trust fund receipts, among other goals. But more comprehensive and better targeted to the needs of the states is legislation soon to be introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL). Under Mack's "give-back" plan, all states would be given the right to collect the fuel tax and spend the receipts on transportation projects of their choosing, without interference from the federal bureaucracy or politically influentialspecial interests.<sup>2</sup>  The Mack plan would limit future federal highway involvement to the maintenance and improvement, as needed, of the existing interstate highway system and would limit the federal fuel tax to the revenues needed to meet this specific objective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Devolution of highway funding to the states is long overdue. Washington's continued involvement in transportation substantially raises the costs of local highway projects. The federal mandates that accompany money from Washington mean that narrow yet influential constituent groups, such as organized labor and highway construction and material supply companies, benefit enormously at huge cost to taxpayers.<sup>3</sup>  One such feature of federal policy that benefits organized labor is the Davis-Bacon Act, which is attached to the highway program. This Act requires that workers on all federally financed highway construction projects be paid wages that often are 20 percent to 40 percent higher than local norms. It is estimated that this provision alone adds $202 million per year in unnecessary costs just to California's highway program.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Spending approximately $20 billion per year in both large and small construction projects, the highway trust fund is far and away the country's largest source of civilian pork-barrel spending. Various interest groups, companies, and industries that benefit from its current mode of operation understandably perceive any movement away from the status quo as a threat to their long-established lucrative relationships with government. This is why lobbyists for construction companies are mounting such an effort to gain passage of legislation to move the trust fund off budget. The Senate should not bow to this pressure. Instead, it should craft legislation that continues oversight and budget control, and begins the transfer to the states of responsibility for highways and the finances to pay for them.
<p>

<b>TECHNICAL NOTES</b>
<p>
<a href="ib225t1.gif">Table 1</a>
<p>
Source: Columns titled General Fund Appropriations, Highway Trust Fund Expenditures, and Total Federal Expenditures - All Highways are from <I>Highway Statistics</I>, as reprinted in a memorandum dated April 15, 1995, from John W. Fischer and William A. Lipford of the Congressional Research Service to the Honorable Nick Smith on the subject of "General fund spending for highways."  Column titled Highway Trust Fund Receipts is derived from <I>Historical Tables, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1997</I> (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1996), Table 2-4, pp. 34-39. Column titled Excess Highway Spending is the difference between receipts (col. 3) and total expenditures (col. 4).
<p>
<a href="ib225t2.gif">Table 2</a>
<p>
This presentation and return ratio differs from that presented in Table FE221, which purports to show that all states, except Kentucky, received a greater share of funds than they contribute, an outcome that is mathematically impossible. This DOT misrepresentation of state status is accomplished by comparing actual current fuel tax payments into the fund with prospective spending from the fund, with the latter always larger than the former because it includes interest earnings and unexpended balances in the fund, an apples-and-oranges relationship. Table 1 presents the same information but in a way that compares apples to apples (or grapes to grapes) by measuring the share paid in with the share paid out. For example, in the case of Kansas, the table indicates that its payment into the fund accounted for 1.159 percent of fund revenues but that it received only 0.96 percent of spending, making it a donor state, while Pennsylvania accounted for 4.7 percent of revenues but received 4.9 percent of spending, making it a recipient state. All states in bold type are donor states.

Within the next few days, the 104th Congress will decide whether it will attempt to reform transportation policy or whether it will permanently preserve the status quo. The mistitled <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?c104:./temp/~c10421OA::">Truth in Budgeting Act (H.R. 842)</a>, which would move the highway trust fund off budget, would be a missed opportunity for Congress to redesign and localize government involvement in areas vital to the health of the economy.

This final point is critical. H.R. 842 would make it extremely difficult to reform outdated and ineffective transportation policies. Putting the program off budget and no longer subject to regular congressional review, authorization, and appropriation means that several prominent proposals to shift more of the resources and program management to the states would face greater obstacles to serious consideration and ultimate enactment. Such devolution is needed. With the interstate highway system completed and with most transportation problems now largely local in nature, a centralized program operated by a Washington bureaucracy makes no sense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proposals include the modest reforms endorsed by the Step 21 Coalition (representing 22 states), which would streamline highway program procedures, make more equitable the allocation of funds among states, and preserve the integrity of trust fund receipts, among other goals. More comprehensive and better targeted to the needs of the states is legislation soon to be introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL). Under Senator Mack's "give-back" plan, all states would be given the right to collect the fuel tax and spend the receipts on transportation projects of their choosing, without interference from the federal bureaucracy or the politically influential  special interests.<sup>1</sup>  The Senator's plan would limit future federal highway involvement to the maintenance and improvement, as needed, of the existing interstate highway system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington's continued involvement in transportation substantially raises the costs of local highway projects. The imposition of federal mandates means that narrow, yet influential, constituent groups, such as organized labor and highway construction and material supply companies, benefit financially.<sup>2</sup>  One such feature of federal policy that benefits organized labor is the Davis-Bacon Act, which is attached to the highway program. This Act requires that workers on all federally financed highway construction projects be paid wages that often are 20 percent to 40 percent higher than local norms. It is estimated that this provision alone adds $202 million per year in unnecessary costs just to California's highway program.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Spending approximately $20 billion per year in both large and small construction projects, the highway trust fund is far and away the country's largest source of civilian pork-barrel spending. Various interest groups, companies, and industries that benefit from its current mode of operation understandably perceive any movement away from the status quo as a risk to their long-established lucrative relationships with government. This is why lobbyists for construction companies are mounting such an effort to gain passage of legislation to move the trust fund off budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a recent interview, T. Peter Ruane, President of the American Road & Transportation Builders and the leader of the industry coalition backing H.R. 842, claimed that there were 230 strong votes for the bill "and another 40 we think we can deliver."<sup>4</sup>  Taxpayers should hope that Ruane is wrong and that there are enough Members of Congress who realize that H.R. 842 would be an enormous obstacle to transportation reform. Instead of hiding the program by moving it off budget, Congress should turn its attention to solutions that are local in emphasis, and should work cooperatively with the Senate, the states, the House Budget Committee, and the Transportation Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to develop a reform package that will better address the transportation needs of the country.

This presentation and return ratio differs from that presented in Table FE221, which purports to show that all states, except Kentucky, received a greater share of funds than they contribute, an outcome that is mathematically impossible. This DOT misrepresentation of state status is accomplished by comparing actual current fuel tax payments into the fund with prospective spending from the fund, with the latter always larger than the former because it includes interest earnings and unexpended balances in the fund, an apple to oranges relationship. Table 1 presents the same information but in a way that compares apples to apples (or grapes to grapes) by measuring the share paid in with the share paid out. For example, in the case of Kansas, the table indicates that its payment into the fund accounted for 1.159 percent of fund revenues, but received only 0.96 percent of spending, making it a donor state, while Pennsylvania accounted for 4.7 percent of revenues, but received 4.9 percent of spending, making it a recipient state. All states in bold face type are donor states.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In preparing to shut down the federal government in November 1995, before President Clinton's veto of the second continuing resolution to keep federal agencies operating, the Clinton Administration made the customary distinction between "essential" employees, who would remain on the job, and "non-essential" employees, who would be furloughed. For the U.S. Department of Education, the Clinton Administration determined that 4,394 of the department's 4,937 employees -- or 89 percent -- were "non-essential" and would be furloughed for the duration of the budget impasse.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unwittingly, the Clinton Administration confirmed what Congress should recognize: America does not need a federal Department of Education. Congress should take the opportunity afforded by the budget process to return to states, local governments, and parents the authority and responsibility for education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 19, 1996, President Clinton submitted a budget to Congress that requested a 7.2 percent increase in FY 1997 discretionary funds for the <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a>.<sup>2</sup>  While the Administration makes certain attempts to realize savings through consolidation and reform of redundant and outdated programs, the proposal reflects an unquestioning commitment to an institution that has failed to prove its value in reaching the President's stated goal of giving "every single American citizen the education that all of us need to compete and win in the new century."  The education establishment has failed to demonstrate any positive correlation between federal education spending and education performance. It is time to rethink the role of the federal government in education, not to spend more money in the hope that programs which have not worked in the past somehow will be made to succeed with increased funding.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Created by Congress in 1979 at the request of President Jimmy Carter, the Department of Education is doing precisely what its severest critics envisioned: usurping local and state control of education by slowly and steadily introducing federal programs, rules, and requirements. Although the department accounts for about six percent of total public funding of education, its influence is out of all proportion to its financial role. Indeed, the Department of Education is inserting itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the nation's 15,025 school districts. Bureaucratic, heavy-handed and intrusive, it is a metaphor for many of Washington's most wasteful and meddlesome domestic programs. As Chester E. Finn, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Education during the Reagan Administration, noted in recent congressional testimony:
<p><blockquote>
	The federal education apparatus illustrates what has gone awry in Washington over the past several decades. The national government has become meddlesome, intrusive and bullying. It now impedes more than it fosters. Much of what it mandates or encourages is misguided. It keeps people from doing what they know is right for their children, communities and states. It substitutes the rules of distant bureaucrats for the on-site knowledge of parents and teachers. And, particularly in the last several years, it has begun to lift from our communities the sense that they are responsible for the renewal and reform of American education and to suggest, instead, that Washington knows best and is taking charge.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why should the U.S. Department of Education be eliminated?  Its time has come and gone. It is time to restore common sense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thanks to the Reserve Powers Clause in the Tenth Amendment, all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states. Education is such a power; a federal role is both gratuitous and intrusive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is time to restore federalism to its founding principles, and there is no area more fruitful than education. Despite the desperate need for reform, there is no master template--certainly not one originating in Washington--to improve the schools. States and localities are "laboratories of democracy"; reform should originate at these levels, not be imposed from on high.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pedagogy - -the art of teaching and learning -- is quintessentially local in nature. Indeed, it goes on at the classroom and individual level. The closer decision-making is to the student and teacher, the better.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal role is costly as well as intrusive, requiring an expensive and burdensome bureaucracy to manage national programs. Washington should do only those things states and localities cannot do for themselves, such as national data collection and targeted research.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most alarming aspect of growing federal control of education is not administrative interference, however, but its adverse impact on academic performance, equally the product of sins of omission and commission. The increasing power of special-interest groups, the burgeoning size of school districts, the refusal of the public schools to submit to any market discipline, weakening community bonds, a pervasive anti-intellectualism in schools of education, general permissiveness, family dissolution -- all have played a role. At no time in American history has academic performance been more important. Yet, as the federal role has increased, education performance has declined. While cause and effect are elusive, and the department's supporters assert a variety of causes to explain the decline in student performance, these changes nonetheless occurred during, and as a part of, the federal ascendancy in American education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<a href="bg1076c1.gif">Chart 1</a> illustrates how SAT scores have declined in the last 25 years as the federal role in education has increased. Since the creation of the department in 1979, scores have stagnated: In 1980, the national average was a combined 890; in 1994, the average was 910. What appears to be a small amount of progress could be attributed to changes in methodology on the SAT, which include a shortened test and permission to use calculators. In terms of graduation rates, the 8 percent of eighth graders who failed to complete high school in 1978 rose to 12 percent in 1992. In other measures of reading, science, and math ability, there has been some measurable improvement. When compared to the scores of other industrialized nations, however, it becomes clear that measuring success against where we were 20 years ago may not be sufficient if we still consistently lag behind other industrialized parts of the world, as <a href="bg1076c2.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates. The United States spends more money per elementary and secondary school pupil than any other country, with little to show for such an investment (see <a href="bg1076t1.gif">Table 1</a>). How education money is spent is as important as the amount spent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even if the federal role has not been directly responsible for education decline, this is clearly not the time to do more of the same. Taxpayers should realize the obvious: The purpose of a federal role in education is to "federalize" the nation's schools, to make them march to a common drumbeat. And it is succeeding, to the detriment of education. At least since the advent of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, federal involvement in education has been designed to make each state more like the others.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not surprisingly, the descent to the lowest common denominator has been relentless. The inverse relationship between education performance and an increasingly intrusive federal education bureaucracy is so pronounced that it invites the most profound skepticism about any significant federal role in education. It is time for Congress to close down the Department of Education, reassign appropriate federal functions to their proper place in the national government, and return authority to those who really should be responsible for the nation's schools.

<P>
<b>THE ORIGINS OF THE DEPARTMENT</b>
<P>
<b>A Limited Federal Role</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1867, the federal government created a Department of Education to gather and disseminate statistics in order to improve the nation's public schools. The department was modeled after the Department of Agriculture, created in 1862 as a free-standing, sub-Cabinet-level federal agency, and was tasked with promoting the cause of education by publishing statistical reports and comparisons of school effectiveness. A bitter debate surrounded the establishment of the department as a free-standing agency, for although it was tasked only with data gathering and dissemination, many feared that it would grow to challenge state control of public schools. A coalition of Democrats and a wide spectrum of Republicans fought to abolish the department soon after its creation, and a compromise was reached, under which the office was moved to the Department of the Interior in 1868. The office continued to exist, but its influence was tempered by a Congress that allowed only modest increases in funding and personnel. Throughout the following century, amid several name changes and reorganizations, the agency played a carefully limited role in the development of federal education policy, with the Interior, Agriculture, and Labor departments also performing education-related functions.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the Office of Education grew, and so did its mission. In 1947, in the <i>Everson</i> case the U.S. Supreme court set the stage for increased federal involvement in education, establishing a precedent for federal involvement in state and local school policies by limiting public support for religious schooling. Two decades later, President Johnson's War on Poverty sought to improve the quality of and access to education with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. ESEA empowered the U.S. Office of Education to aid schools in low-income areas and strengthen state departments of education.<sup>5</sup>  The office performed analyses of state and local educational trends and gained authority to enforce racial discrimination guidelines. And while the Office of Education did not control curriculum, it supported a number of curriculum reform projects -- "new math" and MACOS (Man, A Course of Study), for example -- that were both intrusive and ineffectual. As the office distributed funds at the local level, it also required evaluations of regulatory compliance. No longer was the Office of Education merely a "statistical secretary" to the nation's schools.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1970s, education groups lobbied heavily for a Cabinet-level Department of Education. The National Education Association had long supported the creation of a Cabinet-level agency but had little support from Congress. President Jimmy Carter, in an effort to keep a campaign pledge, sought its creation soon after his inauguration. Overcoming opponents, supporters of a Cabinet-level department prevailed in 1979 with the Department of Education Organization Act, which passed easily in the Senate (72 to 21) but narrowly in the House (210 to 206).<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. Department of Education was created for the least defensible of reasons: politics. The education establishment desperately wanted its own Cabinet-level department, and creating it helped cement their political ties to liberals in Congress. In turn, a more pronounced federal role would raise the visibility of education and lead to more and more federal involvement in policymaking and funding. With such a dynamic in place, state and local education would become increasingly federalized. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Department increased the power of education interest groups, however, two decades of test scores show that public education has become progressively weaker and more ineffective. As Chester Finn observes:
<p><blockquote>
	It became clear that the authors want to substitute decisions made in Washington for decisions made by individual households and communities. They create new governance mechanisms and regulatory apparatus at both national and state levels. They use federal funding in a deceptive way that is designed to elicit the very forms of behavior that other parts of the legislation term "voluntary."  They throw obstacles onto such promising reform pathways as school choice and private management of public schools. They transform what has been a national movement into a federal program.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education thus was not, and is not, a child of carefully reasoned policy or pressing national need. It was the product of politics and is an instrument of interest group political power. That is why it behaves as it does. The calculus is straightforward: President Carter made a political promise and kept it. After decades of existence, a cautious and careful professional association -- the National Education Association (NEA) -- became politicized in the 1970s and 1980s. Determined to create a national education presence, the NEA had one overriding agenda: "one-third, one-third, one-third."  By this, the NEA meant that each level of government -- local, state, and federal -- would provide one-third of the total dollars for education.<sup>9</sup>  It also wanted a Department of Education to increase central control of education through an agency that would be influenced by organized teachers and administrators rather than parents. In exchange for the support of the National Education Association for his candidacy, Jimmy Carter and his liberal allies in Congress delivered a Cabinet department.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ironically, the department's severest critics included those who regard themselves as among American education's best friends. The concern at the time is best captured in <i>Washington Post</i> editorials opposing the creation of the department nearly 20 years ago:
<P><blockquote>
	If the House does agree to enshrine an insulated, supergraded federal educational bureaucracy in the Cabinet, the results are likely to be so costly and unhealthy for American education that many representatives, in retrospect, will be embarrassed to admit that they voted "yea."<sup>10</sup>
<p>

	We are not one-time offenders in this business.... [W]e are, in fact, hardened criminals, hopeless recidivists and probably -- why mince words?  -- incorrigibles. We have been fighting the creation of a separate Department of Education since 1953 [and] we remain adamantly opposed to the creation of this new department. We think it is an awful idea and nothing that has been said or that has happened in the last 26 years has given us reason to think otherwise -- including and especially the Carter administration's campaign in favor of it.<sup>11</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason for such a reaction was that President Carter's proposal was startling even by Washington standards. There simply was no compelling organizational reason to create a Cabinet-level Department of Education, except to usurp state and local power -- a claim not even the most ardent supporter would make in public. It was a simple political payoff, obvious to everyone. Joining the <i>Post</i> in its opposition to the new department was the Committee Against a Separate Department of Education, created by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Made up of education, research, labor, and civil rights groups from across the country, and including prominent figures such as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), the committee was afraid that the new department would have a baleful effect on America's long and successful tradition of local control of education. According to Moynihan, the department was a result of a "backroom deal, born out of squalid politics."<sup>12</sup>  Gregory Humphrey, director of legislation for the AFT, likewise declared: 
<P><blockquote>
	 We believe this is a hoax. It will not result in the improvement of education anywhere. [Test scores and literacy measurements] are the things people think of when they want an improvement in education -- not who talks to the President and when, or how many assistant secretaries can dance on the head of a pin.<sup>13</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite this criticism, when President Reagan proposed to abolish the department just two years later, he was barely able to find an author to carry his legislation. The abolition proposal vanished without a trace. Congressional support for a Department of Education was no stronger than when the Department had been created, but just as Congress had little energy or enthusiasm for creating the department, it could not marshal the resolve to dismantle it. The new <i>status quo</i> triumphed. 
<p>

<b>A DEPARTMENT IN SEARCH OF A JUSTIFICATION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The failings of the Department of Education (and the Office of Education before it) have been sins of omission as much as sins of commission. It is not just that Department officials foisted such things as "bilingual education" on an unwilling nation; the department also forfeited tremendous opportunities. Had it been a force for a constructive new federalism, it could have partially justified its existence as a "bully pulpit" for reform and academic excellence (as it was under Secretaries William Bennett and Lamar Alexander). But for most of its 18 years as a Cabinet department, it has been simply a handmaiden of special interests. Not surprisingly, the Department of Education is a department for producers (educators), not customers (parents and children). The problem is organic and institutional, and is not simply a function of lackluster political appointments.

<p>
<b>The National Interest in Education</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, there is a national interest in education: a compelling national interest in high quality education for all Americans, of all backgrounds and from all regions. But that interest is best served by a vigorous federal system, not by centralization. The states are and should be "laboratories of democracy"; to force them into the same mold does violence both to America's constitutional traditions and to the very nature of education. It misconceives both. If, for example, there were one best system by which to educate everyone, a uniform federal role might have some basis in logic if not in practice. The French (who invented modern bureaucracy) and the Japanese are among those who make such a claim; but among Americans, a uniform federal role, except in a carefully delineated fashion, has always been understood to be bad policy and worse practice. A robust federal system offers unparalleled opportunities to reform and improve education, state by state, community by community. As each state learns more about reform within its own borders, other states are free to learn from its reforms and avoid the pitfalls of the less successful. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The argument for state and local control of education begins with the Constitution and ends with common sense. The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reserves to the states all powers not specifically delegated to the national government, and education is quintessentially a state and local matter. From the time of the ancient Greeks to the present, education has been understood as a transaction between student and teacher. Everything else -- school districts, school boards, state rules and regulations, the federal role -- should be supportive, designed to assist teacher and student. Yet, as any candid observer must admit, a public school system, like any bureaucracy, tends to become insular and self-serving. The fault is not in teachers, but in the structure within which they must function. Unfortunately, the federal role reinforces this unhappy tendency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The further control is removed from the classroom, the greater the danger that teachers will be frustrated and students (and their families) shortchanged. Of all social activities (such as health care, criminal justice, housing, transportation, and economic policy), schooling is the least likely to profit from centralized control. Yet that has been precisely the goal of federal involvement. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, adding a federal dimension has not solved lower-level bureaucratic problems within the system -- it has made them worse. Not surprisingly, just as "command-control" economies have failed around the globe, command-control schools are failing. At issue is a deceptively simple administrative principle: decentralization. In the world of business, this means that those who are closest to the workplace should make as many decisions as possible. In the world of public administration, it means the same. Each unit of government should do what it does best -- and only that. Higher units of government should yield as much power as possible to lower units, and must be able to defend -- in terms of efficiency or justice -- whatever functions they retain.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps most important, the states have grown dramatically in their ability to deal with problems and seize opportunities. Not only have state legislatures become modernized, and state governors increasingly more sophisticated, but most states now have well-organized citizen watchdog groups and state and regional think tanks that provide oversight and policy guidance.<sup>14</sup>
<P>

<b>The Lack of Need for Federal Intervention</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the Department of Education been created for compelling policy reasons, had serious problems been successfully addressed, had something "broken" been fixed, or had student performance climbed upward over the past decade and a half, perhaps some federal involvement in education could be defended. But only a weak political defense was advanced at the time, and no intellectually serious defense is being advanced now.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
No government agency should be allowed to continue indefinitely without having to justify itself to the people's representatives. Each one should be required to demonstrate that it is doing something worthwhile -- in other words, to convince Members of Congress that it is worth preserving. Members of Congress should ask themselves three basic questions: Would the U.S. Department of Education survive serious scrutiny if forced to justify itself?  Has it improved American education significantly?  If Congress were starting from scratch, would it create the same bureaucracy that exists today?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal role in education emerged in waves, in response to crises perceived or real. In the modern era -- after the GI Bill, a program to support and reward veterans of World War II -- there were five major waves: first, under President Dwight Eisenhower with aid to higher education, a military/economic response to Sputnik; second, under President Lyndon Johnson with the Great Society; third, under President Richard Nixon with limited federal support for research and development; fourth, under President Gerald Ford with P.L. 94-142, a bill to aid handicapped children that created radical federal intrusions into the classroom by making education a federal civil right; and fifth, under President Jimmy Carter with the decision to upgrade the Office of Education within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to a separate Cabinet-level department.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Other programs have been added, but with the notable exception of special education, the broad contours of federal education policy were established under the Great Society. The announced reason for this was equity -- racial and economic justice. A long history of state indifference -- and even outright hostility--to the rights of black Americans finally mobilized a powerful constituency for federal intervention in education. Even though education is clearly a state and local function, both in terms of practice and in terms of policy, and as important as local control is, racial justice formed a higher claim, one that must be honored. But just as tough cases make bad law, moral fervor is no guarantee of balanced and effective legislation. As Finn notes,
<p><blockquote>
	There were genuine quantity-and-access problems at the time, and it was legitimate to enlist the national government in their solution. But the world has changed in the three decades since these programs were born and these assumptions fixed in policy. The essential nature of the education problem facing the United States is altogether different today.<sup>15</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Preempting the States.</b> Put bluntly, the task for the Carter Administration and liberals in Congress was to circumvent the Tenth Amendment, which specifically reserves to the states all powers not specifically delegated to the national government. Education is such a power.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The effect of this limitation is quite dramatic. Any federal role in education, insofar as it exists at all, is conditioned on one of two things: either some larger federal role, such as civil rights, or money. In the case of civil rights, the states must bend to federal law. But in all other areas -- curriculum, organization of instruction, homework, discipline policies, testing and measurement, or the hiring and firing of teachers, for example -- the amendment implies that the federal government can do no more than offer states and localities money and specify the terms. In other words, no compliance, no money; states and localities are free to refuse the funds, and Washington is free to withhold them. That is the theory. The reality, however, is that few states or localities refuse federal funds; the temptation of the "money power" has proven to be nearly irresistible.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Embedded in this broader debate is the "Mississippi problem."  Historically, the federal government treated all states equally; a rule for one was a rule for all. At one level, this is a sensible policy response in a federal system -- the equal treatment of equals. But the federal role in education was not motivated by such considerations; it was motivated by the conviction that there were vast disparities among the states that must be remedied. In this context, treating all states equally caused important problems. By default if not design, Mississippi became the benchmark. At the time of the Great Society, Mississippi was the poorest, lowest spending, lowest achieving, most racially segregated state in the nation. As the largest of the federal government's initial forays into education, Mississippi set the bureaucratic pace for everyone else: the lowest common denominator policy. Management by exception was never entertained; there would be one bureaucracy for all. And so it has remained.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
No matter that some states were more sophisticated and enlightened than official Washington, or that Washington bureaucrats had no claim to superior knowledge or virtue; each state would march to the same drummer. The appeal of "free" money proved to be nearly irresistible. State after state accepted official Washington's largess, and few if any appealed to their congressional delegations to change the rules. It was one-way federalism.
<P>

<b>RESTORING THE PROPER FEDERAL ROLE IN EDUCATION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The one irresistible impulse of any bureaucracy is to assume power -- indeed, to usurp power -- to serve its own internal dynamic. Put slightly differently, bureaucracy is designed to institutionalize the suspension of judgment, and bureaucracies do precisely what they are designed to do. They are "one-size-fits-all" institutions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given the predilections of bureaucracy and the fragility of the education process, what is the compelling reason for a federal Department of Education?  Is Washington more virtuous, more competent, more equitable, more knowledgeable, more capable, more caring, more decisive, or more clever than states and localities?  Make no mistake: That is the issue. Only something of this magnitude justifies federal involvement in education.<sup>18</sup>  By way of illustration, it is clear that there is an overriding federal responsibility to guarantee the constitutional rights of all Americans, in school and out. The same is true of national data collection; Washington is better equipped to collect and display the data than any state or locality -- indeed, than all states and localities. In this case, of course, official Washington is the proxy for all states and localities. At the other end of the scale, however, is the management of classroom instruction, curriculum, and textbook adoption. In the best of circumstances, official Washington is capable of little more than offering advice. To control classroom management in Washington does violence to everything that we know about education; its only justification must be political, not pedagogical. And a political justification is, on its face, indefensible.
<P>

<b>Legislative Initiatives</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Members of the House desiring to eliminate the department generally fall into two camps: those who believe it should be eliminated entirely and those who think it should be merged with the Department of Labor and the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. The only bill currently under consideration is one that would terminate the department, although there may yet be a merger bill. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.1883:">Back to Basics Education Reform Act</a> (H.R. 1883) sponsored by Representatives Joe Scarborough (R-FL) and Steve Chabot (R-OH), seeks to abolish the Department of Education within one year of enactment. The bill rolls all elementary and postsecondary education programs that are not terminated into two separate block grants to the states that are authorized for four years. These grants would be administered by a new Office of Educational Opportunities (OEO) within the Department of Health and Human Services, which also would run student aid programs, IDEA, and other programs not terminated or transferred elsewhere under the bill. The programs transferred to the new OEO would have their administrative accounts reduced by 30 percent, based on their FY 1995 appropriations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Abolishing the department and returning control of education to parents and to state and local governments would improve education and help to ensure that the federal government does not overregulate and interfere in an area that is fundamentally local in nature.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
H.R. 1883 eliminates major portions of the federal bureaucracy, including Titles I-VII and IX-XIV. A few of the larger programs remain intact. Impact Aid, a program designed to aid local school districts educating children living on military installations, is transferred to the Department of Defense. Indian Education programs are transferred to the Department of the Interior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
H.R. 1883 is an excellent vehicle with which to accomplish this precisely because it recognizes explicitly that the "principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution of the United States entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the States and the people and a Federal Department of Education is inconsistent with such principles (Sec. 2.1)."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) belongs to the merger camp but has yet to draft any legislation. Under his proposal, which currently exists only in outline form, the department would be merged with the Department of Labor and the EEOC, with the intent that a more relevant and efficient delivery system be established in order to ensure that America's children have the necessary knowledge and skills to prepare them for the workplace of the 21st century.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This proposal is driven primarily by the need to streamline and save, with the stated end goal being to "prepare our youth for the challenges of the 21st century."  As Representative Gunderson stated in a press release earlier this year, 
<p><blockquote>
	By simply consolidating programs and eliminating duplication, we can stem the immense bureaucratic growth of these agencies and realize some savings in the process.... [I]t is not the function of this proposal to debate the merits of each program. Rather, through broad consolidation and coordination of programs, we can make dramatic cost savings and achieve a better federal education and employment system at the same time.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unlike the Scarborough bill, which uses an underlying philosophy of the proper role of the federal government in education to determine what programs will be retained and where they will be lodged, Gunderson's focuses on streamlining the delivery of existing services rather than on whether the federal government ought to be involved in them at all. Having the Department of Education emphasize "work force preparation and policy" begs the question. Parents educate their children not only for the work force, but also for life. Even if education is tantamount to "work force preparation," that does not compel a federal role in bringing about that objective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Official Washington's role should be limited to doing those things states and localities cannot do for themselves and that also serve a larger national purpose. The list is short and does not require a Cabinet-level department to implement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Getting it right.</b> Congress should dismantle federal agencies that do not serve the public interest, and the Department of Education is the most visible example. Conceptually, as Bennett, Alexander, and Finn all have noted:
<P><blockquote>
	The federal government should recognize that education in America is "the constitutional responsibility of the states, the social responsibility of communities, and the moral responsibility of families";<sup>20</sup>
<p>
	"Except when the civil rights of individuals are menaced, the federal government should <i>never</i> impede the capacity of families, communities and states to decide how best to provide education to their children";<sup>21</sup>
<p>
	The bully pulpit is appropriate, but goals and standards must always be truly voluntary; federal funds should not be used as "carrots" or "sticks" in ways that effectively diminish state and local control; and
<P>
	The federal government should "dedicate itself to (a) fostering family responsibility and local control, (b) assisting states to fulfill their responsibilities as they see fit, (c) providing sound statistics, prompt and accurate assessment results and other information, and (d) safeguarding individuals from illegal discrimination."<sup>22</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Doing it right.</b> To send responsibility home where it belongs, to transfer legitimate federal functions to other federal agencies, and to eliminate what is unnecessary is the job for Congress. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> The protection of the civil rights of all Americans should be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice, as they are enforced in the larger society; a separate Office of Civil Rights in an Education Department is not necessary.
<p>
<li> Data collection, dissemination, analysis, and research should be transferred to a central Office of Data Collection in the Bureau of the Census.
<p>
<li> Aid to poor children in elementary and secondary schools (Title I/Chapter 1) should be made available to them as a transfer payment on their behalf, or as an education voucher. This should be negotiable in any school that satisfies a state's compulsory attendance statutes, without reference to whether the school is public or private, secular or denominational (as is the case in all other industrialized democracies). The administrative responsibility should be transferred to the states as part of an elementary and secondary education block grant administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
<li> College financial aid should be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services for the immediate future, and such aid should be merit as well as needs based (as it is in every other industrialized democracy). 
<p>
<li> All remaining funds should be made available as two block grants to the states, that would be gradually phased out. One block grant should be for elementary and secondary education programs and the other for higher education.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's taxpayers no longer believe in major federal solutions to problems that are quintessentially local in nature. Congress can undo the damage and restore education -- lower and higher -- to its rightful place. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Great Society and the cluster of programs that grew up around it describe the contours of the modern federal role in education. They are nothing if not large, ambitious, bureaucratic, and intrusive. While these programs were introduced for a variety of reasons, the most important was the simplest: the conviction that states and localities could neither get it right nor go it alone. Most Americans no longer believe this (if, indeed, they ever did). It is time to restore education to its rightful role and place; federal involvement has been tried and, by and large, found wanting. The principle that should guide us into the next century is simple: Devolve to states and localities the responsibility for education. That is the necessary first step. The results will be both profound and far-reaching: the restoration of federalism and the revitalization of the nation's schools.

<h3>APPENDIX </h3>
<p>
<b>DISMANTLING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the Department of Education was created, a number of important programs affecting schools were not transferred from other agencies to its control; as a result, interagency coordination remained a problem. For example, Head Start was left in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services), which also retained control over school lunch programs. The new Cabinet agency in fact consolidated some 25 percent of about 400 federal higher education activities and less than one-third of all educational expenditures then in the federal budget.<sup>24</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the department's limited scope, opponents who feared the growth of a federal presence in education turned out to be correct. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Department of Education had a budget over $14 billion, 7,000 employees, and as many assistant secretaries as its parent agency, HHS. Today, the department has more than doubled its budget (now over $31 billion) and has more than 240 categorical programs -- 100 more than in 1980. The range of its activities will be broadened even further if, as the Clinton Administration has proposed, it succeeds in establishing its own direct lending program. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Continued federal involvement in education is wasteful and inefficient, and involves responsibilities best left to the states and local communities. The following analysis describes each program, identifies its key problems, and presents a series of recommendations for reform.<sup>25</sup>  Reform consists of doing one of the following in each case: (1) sending the program back to the states and local communities through an elementary and secondary education or a higher education block grant; (2) transferring the program to another federal agency that can handle the issue more efficiently; or (3) terminating the program because it has outlived its usefulness or is better handled by some other agency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
FY 1995 appropriation figures are given for most programs in order to give a sense of the size of each program and the amount of money that would be saved or transferred to block grants.
<P>
<b>OFFICE OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION: TERMINATE AND TRANSFER FUNDS
<P>
1995 Appropriation: $9.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) should be terminated and its funds turned into an elementary and secondary education block grant administered within HHS in a newly created Office of Education. 
<p>
<b>I. Education Reform
<p>
Goals 2000: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $408 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enacted in 1994, the Goals 2000: Educate America Act provided funds to states, local districts, and schools to develop comprehensive education reform plans. Under the program, states applied to the federal government for funds to be used for academic standards, model curricula, staff training, and student assessments. Goals 2000 established three new federal boards: the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), the National Skills Board, and the National Education Goals Panel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year-old Goals 2000 legislation, President Clinton's most important education program, has been a failure. Instead of "revolutionizing, revitalizing and reforming" America's schools, as President Clinton promised, Goals 2000 actually has slowed the process of change.<sup>26</sup>  It has created suffocating new government bureaucracies, increased federal regulations, and boosted federal spending. Worse still, it threatens to undermine progress to improve American education performance by encouraging schools to ignore academic "outputs" -- the results -- and focus instead on obtaining federal dollars by showing Washington that more money is being spent on "inputs."  The program also threatens the relationship of students and their families to the education process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two fundamentally important ways:
Building Bureaucracies. Under Goals 2000, three new government bureaucracies were created: the National Education Goals Panel, the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National Skills Board. These bureaucracies continue the old, outdated traditions of education "command-and-control" organization that continues to keep control of schools in the hands of education "producers" rather than "consumers."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Federalizing Education.</b> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to local control, the legislation comes dangerously close to mandating a watered-down national curriculum designed in Washington. The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying national history standards met bitter criticism that the standards were diluted and politically correct. Indeed the proposed standards so clearly distorted American history that the Senate rebuffed them by a 99-1 vote on January 18, 1995.<sup>27</sup>  This episode indicates one of the inherent dangers in the Goals 2000 approach. If NESIC's members were appointed, it would have become a <i>de facto</i> national school board whose 19 members would approve or disapprove all state-developed plans to meet goals set by the Education Goals Panel. Continuing attempts to "federalize" state and local education discourages real innovation and inhibits the most important school reform initiative of the decade: the movement toward privatization and school choice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000's state and national programs will only strengthen the federal government's power to control local reform efforts, hampering efforts at grass-roots reform. Goals 2000 funding should be terminated and the money sent back to the states in the elementary and secondary education block grant to foster real reform such as school choice, vouchers, and magnet and charter schools.<sup>28</sup>

<P>
<b>School-to-Work Program: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriations: $125 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The school-to-work program, funded by the Departments of Education and Labor, was designed to "continue development of comprehensive State and Local school-to-work opportunities systems."  Federal money is to be used as seed money to bring about a more comprehensive national program. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act mandates that this program sunset by the year 2001. In its FY 1997 budget request, the Clinton Administration is asking for $200 million (an increase of $75 million over FY 1995) to expand the number of states receiving full implementation grants to 43 and fund national research, technical assistance, and evolution activities. States use grants to establish partnerships representing education, industry, and labor, and to develop new assessments and accountability procedures for their school-to-work systems. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School-to-work programs have existed in various forms for some time and are an important part of preparing our nation's youth to lead productive lives. Nevertheless, both the state and national programs should be terminated. The federal government is not implementing a new idea; it is seeking to provide national leadership in developing a "coherent strategy" to help students move into the workforce out of high school. In an era of budget constraints, it is not appropriate for the federal government to take on such a task. Seed money is not necessarily the answer to the problem of developing effective partnerships between businesses and schools, and state-level partnerships with businesses to set up apprenticeship programs to bring non-college-bound students into a technologically advanced work force do not need federal oversight or funding. It is in the interest of private industry to ensure that workers are properly trained and equipped. States should make the implementation of such programs a priority and aggressively seek funding to provide their youth with a work history that enables them to succeed in today's work force.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<b>II. Education for the Disadvantaged
<P>
Title I: Block Grant and Transfer<br>
1995 Appropriation: $7.2 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title I (formerly Chapter 1) funding for local education agencies and schools in areas with high rates of poverty provides additional educational assistance to five million low-achieving students. More than $90 billion has been spent on compensatory education since the program was created in 1965. Despite this huge investment, there is no evidence of any positive effect.<sup>30</sup>  Mary Jean LeTendre, Director of Compensatory Education during the Bush Administration, admitted that if Chapter 1's performance were displayed on a heart monitor, "We'd either pull the plug or get out the clappers."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pre- and post-tests administered to the same groups of students through a Department of Education study show that little progress has been made among Title I students. Comparisons of similar groups of children by grade and poverty show that program participation does not reduce the test score gap for disadvantaged students. Indeed, Chapter 1 student scores declined between the third and fourth grades in all poverty groups.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Chapter 1 instruction typically is offered for 30 minutes a day, five days a week. However, it contributes only about 10 additional minutes of academic instruction to each child's day. The benefit of additional time spent in Chapter 1 instruction too often is diminished by missed class time. During 1991-1992, 70 percent of elementary classroom teachers reported that students missed some academic subject during Chapter 1 reading/language arts instruction. Of this 70 percent, 56 percent indicated that students were missing regular reading/language arts activities during their Chapter 1 reading/language arts instruction.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another significant problem with Chapter 1 is an incentive structure that discourages reaching the very end for which the program was created. Since funds are allocated based on the number of educationally disadvantaged children in a district, as test scores rise so does the risk of losing program money. Having a large population of educationally disadvantaged children ensures funding.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guiding principle for Title I reform should be reconnecting the program to its true beneficiaries: students, not schools. As it is, Title I commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child; if that money were available as a Title I voucher, it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs, whether public, private non-sectarian, or private religious. Aid to poor children in elementary and secondary schools should be made available to poor youngsters as a transfer payment on their behalf, or as an education voucher. This should be negotiable in any school that satisfies a state's compulsory attendance statutes, without reference to whether the school is public or private, secular or denominational (as is the case in all other industrialized democracies). The administrative responsibility should be transferred to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As with AFDC and other forms of public assistance, Title I programs are best administered at the state level. Each state has different problems and concerns in educating its population and should be given the latitude to determine policy governing the distribution of funds to help the economically disadvantaged. Communities should be able to implement programs that respond to the needs of their children without being burdened with oversight from Washington. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following programs from the Office of  Elementary and Secondary Education's Education for the Disadvantaged should be terminated and the funds returned to the states through an elementary and secondary education block grant administered by the Department of Health and Human Services:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Capital Expenses for Private School Children. 1995 Appropriation: $41.4 million.</b><br> 
Provides assistance for local education agencies that provide "equitable services" for children enrolled in religious schools.
<p>
<li><b>Even Start. 1995 Appropriation: $102 million. </b><br>
Supports family-centered educational programs that involve parents and children.
<p>
<li><b>State Agency programs for Migrant, Neglected, and Delinquent Students. 
1995 Appropriation: $350 million. </b>
Provides services to children who have moved in the last three years and to incarcerated students. 
<p>
<li><b>State School Improvement. 1995 Appropriation: $27.5 million.</b> 
Designed to help states initiate school-based change, holding them accountable for improving the education of the disadvantaged. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following Education for the Disadvantaged programs should be terminated with no transfer of funds to the elementary and secondary education block grant: 
<p>
<li><b>Migrant High School Equivalency Program and College Assistance Migrant Program. 
1995 Appropriation: $10 million.</b> 
The High School Equivalency Program exists to help low-income migrant workers gain high school diplomas or equivalency certificates. The College Assistance Migrant Program provides stipends and tutoring to migrant students in their first year of college. These programs duplicate programs administered by Federal TRIO Student Support Services programs in the Office of Postsecondary Education, and at a much higher per student cost, and therefore should be terminated.
</ul><P>
<b>III. Impact Aid: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $27.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Impact Aid provides basic support to school districts affected by federal activities. The program was established during World War II to relieve the sudden financial pressure on school districts in which enrollment increased sharply because of an influx of relocated military personnel. Impact Aid Part A compensated school districts for educating children whose families lived on federal property. Impact Aid Part B was almost exclusively for children whose parents worked on federal property but did not live there. More than 2,400 school districts received Impact Aid funds. The Impact Aid program was reauthorized and altered in 1994, and the original categories of "A" children, "B" children, Section 3(d)(2)(B), Disaster Assistance, and Construction were replaced with other forms of assistance. Payments were continued on behalf of children living on Indian lands and children living on federal property who have parents in the armed forces. The 1994 reauthorization ended payments for the other categories of previously eligible children, including "B" children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program has outlived its initial purpose and should be terminated. Impact Aid is based on the erroneous premise that military bases and other federal facilities are a cost borne by local communities. This is curious, since communities as a rule lobby heavily for such facilities and complain about the losses that will result if they are closed. In truth, these facilities confer substantial benefits through job creation and the infusion of what may be millions of federal dollars into the local economy. Since local governments evidently are convinced their economies gain from the presence of federal facilities, there seems to be no reason to provide them with Impact Aid as compensation for them.
<p>
<b>IV. School Improvement Programs: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.3 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education funds 18 small elementary and secondary programs, many of them designed to address certain perceived needs or as favors to Members of Congress. While many of these School Improvement programs have worthy goals, none can be shown to serve a purpose that cannot be achieved at the state level. All 18 programs should be terminated and a portion of the funds appropriated to the elementary and secondary education block grant proposed at the beginning of this section.
<p>

<b>Eisenhower Professional Development State Grants: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $251 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Eisenhower Professional Development Program provides grants to the states for professional development. This program replaces the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science State Grants, which provided inservice training in mathematics and science. The underlying philosophy of the program is that "Real reform and improvement in elementary and secondary education require a teaching force that is up-to-date in the content areas and skilled in imparting knowledge to diverse populations of students. Only intensive, ongoing professional development will ensure that educators have the knowledge and skills necessary to teach children the challenging State standards."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In its FY 1997 budget request, the Clinton Administration agrees that this program has had "minimal impact on classroom effectiveness," yet still wants to expand it to offer "professional development" in additional subjects. The Administration's request terminates funding for <i>Innovative Education Program Strategies</i> (Title VI) because, as explained the department's FY 1996 budget request, as a block grant it did little to contribute to real education reform since the money was spent primarily on such routine things as equipment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration assumes that the past failures of both of these programs can be attributed to their block grant status and the inability of states to bring about reform on their own without large-scale federal control and regulation. However, this is contradicted by current studies that attribute the programs' ineffectiveness to faulty assumptions about student performance. For example, in his exhaustive review of 113 studies that examined the relationship between teacher education levels and student performance, University of Rochester economist Eric Hanushek concluded that only eight showed a statistically significant correlation between teachers' advanced degrees and student performance.<sup>34</sup>  These programs should be terminated not only because professional development is not a federal area, but also because of the overwhelming evidence of their inherent ineffectiveness.
<p>

<b>Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $476 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under this program, the federal government gives grants to the states (1) to improve cooperation between schools and the broader community so that all available resources are brought to bear on drug and violence problems; (2) to fund a broader range of local activities, including before- and after-school "safe haven" programs; (3) to target more resources to communities with the greatest drug and violence problems; and (4) to increase accountability through a greater emphasis on collection and use of outcome data. The national programs fund federal development of model programs, evaluation of state and local safe and drug-free schools programs, cooperative activities with other federal agencies, direct grants to communities with severe drug and violence problems, and campus drug prevention grants to institutions of higher education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence that this program has been effective in achieving its goals, as no comprehensive audit has been completed since the program was created. Such an audit would be difficult in any event because little is known about what method works best to prevent and reduce substance abuse. A recent study by the Research Triangle Institute, for example, showed that support groups and community service groups increased in number as federal funding reached the schools, but the results are unclear because it cannot be demonstrated that such groups are the best way to combat drugs and violence.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Money under this program is sent not to areas of specific need, but to 96 percent of the nation's school districts, with many the smaller districts receiving only a few hundred dollars. Moreover, districts that do receive large sums of money are not necessarily spending it wisely. A recent audit of the Fairfax County public schools in Virginia found that the county spent $176,000 of its Safe and Drug Free Schools grant to send hundreds of parents, administrators, teachers, and local business owners to a Maryland resort for meetings described as providing "the background for people to try and intelligently solve problems."<sup>36</sup>  In Montgomery County, Maryland, administering a $548,000 grant eats up more than $200,000.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While safe and drug-free schools are a laudable goal, this federal program does little to achieve that goal and duplicates similar efforts such as the Substance Abuse Block Grant, Title XX, the Preventive Health Block Grant, and programs under the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. Like education, crime and drug programs are administered best at the local level by individuals who are close to the affected community. States and communities affected by violence and drugs in their schools already are addressing these problems. Federal funding means federal strings that make it more difficult for state and local officials to do their jobs.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A nonprofit organization, RIF (Reading is Fundamental), has been contracted by the Department of Education to distribute free and inexpensive books to areas of particular need. The $10.3 million Inexpensive Book Distribution Program, although a worthy concept, could be funded easily at the state level or by private foundations.

This program was created under the 1995 Improving America's Schools Act to assist local education agencies in repairing and rebuilding school facilities. The department recommends terminating funding for the $35 million program due to the administrative complexity caused by the specific requirements LEAs must meet in order to receive assistance.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program seeks to promote competency in the arts by encouraging the integration of art into elementary and secondary curricula. Congress should terminate the Arts in Education Program, which should be funded by private organizations or the states. Most of the money under this program goes to just two organizations: the Very Special Arts Organization and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Very little actually reaches the nation's classrooms.

1995 Appropriation: $4.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This $4.5 million program makes competitive awards for programs that educate the public about the legal system and its underlying philosophical principles. Many of the grantees have been receiving funds since the early 1980s for the same projects and should be able to continue without federal assistance.

<b>Magnet Schools Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $111 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Magnet Schools Assistance program makes grants to local education agencies that are under some sort of desegregation plan, either court-ordered or federally approved. Preference is given to agencies proposing a new or significantly revised program and innovative educational programs. Congress should phase out Magnet Schools Assistance. Like charter schools, magnet schools already are well underway in many districts and are funded and controlled best by local and state authorities.

<b>Education for Homeless Children and Youth: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $28.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The objective of this program is to ensure that homeless children have equal access to education, and to run professional development programs to "heighten awareness of the special problems of homeless children and youth."  In essence, this program helps to advocate within state budgeting processes for the allocation of other funds for the homeless population. While this may be a worthy goal, it is hardly a federal responsibility. And because much of this money is used to lobby for additional funds, little is spent on the education of homeless children. Direct services for educating homeless children can be provided better through the elementary and secondary education block grant.
<p>

<b>Women's Educational Equity: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1974, this program has sought to promote educational equity through grants to local education agencies, nonprofit organizations, and individuals and through a national publishing center. This program is very small and funds only 32 grants of $100,000 each. The program has existed for 20 years but shows little evidence of success in achieving its objectives. If states find that gender equity is a problem that needs to be addressed, studies can be funded and administered at the state or local level; this is far better than a "one-size-fits-all" solution imposed from above. The federal government has no legitimate role in such subjective matters. 
<p>

<b>Training and Advisory Services: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $21.4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Training and Advisory Service Program, which supports federal Desegregation Assistance Centers (DACS), should be terminated. Most "desegregation-related" activities in the states, such as busing, have been expensive failures.<sup>38</sup>  Public school desegregation has reached the point where the federal government no longer needs to be involved in such activities.

<b>Drop-Out Prevention Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $28 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program has funded local demonstrations of approaches to curtailing high school dropout rates. By law, funding was to end in 1994, but ESEA reauthorization provided for two more years of non-competitive funding of projects that had been supported in previous years. According to the department, the activity thus "evolved into a program of direct, noncompetitive assistance to incumbent grantees" and was no longer a demonstration program. The program no longer merits funding.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to an audit requested by Congress, significant increases in federal funding had no impact on the number of fellowships offered by the foundation; fellowships actually decreased as the federal contribution increased. Other organizations in the private sector run government education programs and are able to provide economic assistance to those who are in need.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Native Hawaiians already are eligible to receive services from the Department of Education as long as they meet the criteria applied to all citizens. These programs duplicate those offered under Title I, as well as Special Education and other competitive grants offered by the Department. Since funding for such programs would be available to Hawaii through the elementary and secondary education block grant, separate funding is unnecessary.

<b>Foreign Language Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Foreign Language Assistance program provides formula grants to local education agencies to encourage and improve instruction of foreign languages in areas where there is a perceived critical national interest. Currently, support is limited to instruction in Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. This program was targeted for termination in the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review because it is "poorly structured to be an appropriate vehicle for the advancement of foreign language education in the schools."  The formula grants to the states are too small to have a significant impact on foreign language instruction.
<p>
<b>Charter Schools: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $20 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Charter Schools Program provides funds to "support planning and initial implementation of charter schools created by teachers, parents, and other members of local communities."  While charter schools certainly are desirable, the states do not need this funding to create them. Congress should terminate the Charter Schools Program and turn the funds over to the elementary and secondary education block grant.

<b>Technical Assistance for Improving ESEA Programs: Terminate<br>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration is proposing that funds be provided to complete the phasing in of 15 regional assistance centers to help states, local education agencies, schools, and other recipients of federal funds implement elementary and secondary education programs under ESEA. This is a consolidation of services previously supplied through 48 regional assistance centers. Since the programs these centers are supposed to help administer will be turned over to the states through block grants (Title I programs), terminated (bilingual education), or transferred (Indian education), these centers no longer will be necessary.
<p>
<b>V. Indian Education (IEA): Transfer   <br> 
1995 Appropriation: $82.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indian Education programs supplement the efforts of state and local education agencies and Indian tribes by providing additional funding to the Indian population. Local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to develop "comprehensive plans" for the education of Indian children apart from the plans they develop for other children. This program should sent to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, an agency far better equipped to deal effectively with the unique challenges facing the Native American population. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indian Education programs are similar to the Title I programs which serve all disadvantaged children. Special Programs for Indian Children include (1) a broad demonstration program for testing new approaches in such areas as early childhood education, dropout prevention, and public-private partnerships; (2) an educator professional development program to increase the number of qualified Indians involved in the education of Indians and to improve the skills of Indians already teaching; and (3) fellowships for Indians studying medicine, psychology, law, education, business administration, and natural resources. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Special Programs for Indian Adults help Indian adults acquire basic literacy, complete secondary school, and secure the education needed to enter advanced vocational programs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Both of these programs duplicate many Indian education programs run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the Interior Department. Therefore, the entire Indian Education program, including all program funding, should be transferred to that agency.

<b>OFFICE OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND MINORITY LANGUAGE AFFAIRS
<P>
Bilingual and Immigrant Education: Phase Out Over Three Years<br>
1995 Appropriation: $206.7 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government began funding local bilingual education programs in 1967. At that time, Congress made it clear that support should not be limited to any one instructional method; as the legislative report stated, the choice of method should be "left to the discretion and judgments of the local school districts to encourage both varied approaches to the problem and also special solutions for a particular problem of a given school."  This policy was reversed in 1974 when Congress effectively mandated that schools use "transitional bilingual education" (TBE) instructional methods, by which students are taught both in English and in their native language. In 1987, Congress loosened this restriction and allowed local governments to spend 25 percent of their bilingual education funds on "alternative" teaching methods, with 75 percent still required for TBE instruction. The federal programs assist local school districts in "building their capacity to operate high-quality instructional programs for recently-arrived immigrants and other Limited English Proficient (LEP) students."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Against the advice of local officials and many scholars, Washington continues to tie the hands of local school districts by requiring them to spend three-quarters of all their federal bilingual education funds on transitional bilingual education programs. Although federal funding is only about 3 percent of the total spent on bilingual education, the fact that the federal government favors transitional bilingual education over "alternative" teaching methods creates the impression that transitional education is the best way to teach recent immigrants and other Limited English Proficient students.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the federal preference for transitional bilingual education, numerous studies have shown that TBE programs are less effective than intensive English programs. A recent study by the Board of Education of the City of New York showed that 80 percent of students enrolled in special English programs were put in mainstream classes within 2-3 years, compared with only 51 percent of students in bilingual programs. Similar results were found in a READ Institute study of the schools in El Paso, Texas. Students in an English-based program in El Paso enter regular classrooms in 3 or 4 years, whereas bilingual students take 6 to 7 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education itself has concluded that TBE programs, which involve heavy reliance on the pupil's native language, can delay English proficiency for as many as six years after instruction begins.<sup>39</sup>  This is disturbing, given that the primary purpose of these programs is to assist Limited English Proficient students to join the American mainstream as quickly as possible. Yet the bilingual education establishment continues to push TBE, which has proved to be both a source of jobs and a pipeline to the federal Treasury.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although there remains intense debate over which bilingual teaching methods are most effective, a consensus is emerging that local school districts are best able to tailor their programs to meet the needs of their foreign students most effectively. Notes Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers: "The fact is that there is no proven method of bilingual education that guarantees English fluency. And I don't think that Uncle Sam, or anybody else ought to be shoving a particular message down anybody's throat."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As this $261 million program is phased out, local school districts should be permitted to use the money to develop the programs they deem most appropriate and effective in teaching English as a second language. This would restore the program to its original mandate of providing short-term federal funding to develop "special solutions" for Limited English Proficient students.<sup>40</sup>

<b>OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES (OSERS)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.8 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government has an interest both in ensuring that those who are disabled have access to quality education and in helping the states to achieve that goal. Therefore, the following programs would remain intact and be housed in HHS:
<ul><p>
<li> Special Education,
<li> Rehabilitative Services and Disability Research,
<li> American Printing House for the Blind,
<li> National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and

<li> Gallaudet University.
</ul><p>

<b>OFFICE OF VOCATIONAL AND ADULT EDUCATION<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Vocational Education program funds are used by states to support family literacy, vocational education, and job training, and to help adults complete a secondary education. Grants are allocated to the states according to a formula under which each state receives $250,000, with the remaining funds distributed in proportion to the number of persons age 16 years or older who have not completed a high school education. Basic grants integrate academic and vocational education and are allotted to states according to a formula based on state income, with an adjustment based on state per capita income. Currently, over $1.4 billion is spent on vocational and adult education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 17 vocational and adult education programs duplicate 154 employment training programs administered by 14 different federal agencies. In an effort to ameliorate this situation, the Clinton Administration rescinded 1995 funding for the Community-Based Organizations and Consumer and Homemaking Education Programs. Under the Clinton Administration's FY 1997 budget proposal, programs administered by the Office of Vocational and Adult Education would be combined and broken down into two sets of programs: state grants and national programs. There would be separate state grant and national programs for vocational and adult education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following programs would be consolidated under the Clinton-proposed state grants for vocational education:<p><ul>
<li> Tech-Prep Education ($108 million);
<li> Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Vocational Institutions ($2.9 million);
<li> State Councils ($8.8 million); and
<li> Permanent Appropriation (Smith-Hughes Act) ($7.1 million).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
State Literacy Resource Centers, Workplace Literacy Partnerships, Literacy Training for Homeless Adults, and Literacy Programs for Prisoners are Adult Education programs that fund relatively few programs in only a handful of states. All these activities are best handled by state and local governments, which are closest to those who are being served. These programs would be merged into adult education state grants in the Clinton Administration's FY 1997 budget request. The Administration correctly argues that a single state grant "would permit states to establish their own program objectives based on their own unique needs, and would give states the flexibility to use federal funds for a range of activities... aimed at achieving those objectives." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The research, technical assistance, and data collecting functions for adult and vocational education would comprise the national programs under the Clinton budget request.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Combining these programs into state and national programs makes sense, but not at the same level of funding. Funding for vocational education and adult education should be cut by 50 percent. Vocational education funds should be combined with the elementary and secondary education block grant and adult education funds with the higher education block grant, described below in the section on the Office of Post Secondary Education. Sufficient funds should be appropriated for research, data systems, and grant management at the federal level. The national program should be housed in the Department of Health and Human Services.

<p>
<b>OFFICE OF POST SECONDARY EDUCATION<br>
1995 Appropriation: $13.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Programs currently administered by the Office of Post Secondary Education should be transferred to the Office of Education at the Department of Health and Human Services. Programs under Student Financial Assistance should be transferred to HHS, along with certain reforms, cuts, and terminations. Higher education categorical programs should be consolidated into a higher education block grant to be administered by HHS.
<p>

<b>Pell Grants: Transfer to HHS<br>
1995 Appropriation: $6.2 billion</b>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Pell Grant program provides grant aid to low and middle-income undergraduate students. Unlike most other federal scholarship programs, it is the department's most "need-focused" student aid program. This proposal terminates most other merit-based scholarship programs in order to focus resources on need-based grant programs such as this one. Pell Grants should be sent to HHS along with other student financial assistance programs.
<p>
<b>Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants: Block Grant<br>
1995 Appropriation: $583 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The SEOG program, like the Pell Grant program, provides assistance to undergraduate students with financial need. Funds are allocated to institutions, however, based on statutory formula, and institutions match 25 percent. Students with exceptional need and Pell Grant recipients are given priority by the awarding institutions. This need-based program should be terminated and its funds included in the higher education block grant, enabling states to award money to institutions as they see fit.
<p>
<b>State Student Incentive Grants: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $63.4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The SSIG program provides dollar-for-dollar matching funds as an incentive to the states to set up need-based postsecondary student grant assistance. Since 1972, all 50 states have set up their own undergraduate need-based programs. The original objective of this program therefore has been met, and federal funding is no longer necessary.  (Elimination of this program also was recommended by the Administration's own National Performance Review.)
<p>
<b>Federal Perkins Loans<br> 
1995 Appropriation: $176 million and
<p>
Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.1 Billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Students receive federal student loans primarily through three programs: Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), and Federal Direct Loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Approximately 2,700 participating institutions currently administer Perkins Loans. Borrowers are charged 5 percent interest during principal repayment and no interest during in-school, grace, and deferment periods. The annual maximum amounts a student can borrow under the program are $3,000 for undergraduates and $5,000 for graduate and professional students. The cumulative maximum is $30,000 for combined undergraduate and graduate or professional study. The federal government currently pays $18 million annually to cancel loan obligations of borrowers who go into "public service employment," such as law enforcement, nursing, or teaching in Head Start programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the FFEL program, a student borrows money at a capped rate from private lending institutions. Banks making FFEL student loans have the loans insured by state and private nonprofit institutions, known as "guarantee agencies."  The federal government, however, reinsures these loans and is ultimately liable for up to 98 percent of defaulted loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The FFEL program offers four types of loans:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
1) Stafford Loans are subsidized, low-interest loans based on financial need. The federal government pays the interest while the student is in school and during certain grace and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
2) Unsubsidized Stafford Loans also are low-interest student loans. However, under this program, the federal government does not pay interest for the student during in-school, grace, and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
3) PLUS Loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students. The maximum interest rate for PLUS loans is higher than for Stafford or Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and the federal government does not pay interest for the student during in-school, grace, and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
4) Consolidation Loans allow borrowers with multiple student loans who meet certain criteria to combine their obligations and extend their repayment schedules. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All FFEL loans, except Consolidation Loans, have variable interest rates. The rate is capped at 8.25 percent for Stafford and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and 9.00 percent for PLUS Loans. Today, these variable rates are tied to the 91-day Treasury bill rate; beginning July 1, 1998, rates will be tied to the government borrowing rate (currently the 10-year Treasury bill rate).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These loan programs should be removed from the jurisdiction of the Department of Education and operated by the Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the following reforms should be instituted, both to reduce the cost of these programs and to cut defaults:  
<p>
<b>Reform #1: Eliminate the Perkins Loan Program.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Perkins Loan program is relatively small and exists largely to supplement the larger FFEL and Direct Loan programs. It easily could be eliminated or merged into these larger programs, reducing overhead and duplication. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Perkins Loan program also authorizes borrowers to have all or a portion of their loans canceled in exchange for service as a teacher, staff member in a Head Start program, volunteer in the Peace Corps or VISTA, law enforcement or corrections officer, nurse or medical technician, or family service agency employee. Yet there is no shortage of individuals interested in serving in these careers, some of which pay salaries and offer many rewards. There is no need to continue to forgive these loans for all individuals.
<p>
<b>Reform #2: Eliminate in-school interest subsidies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Students should be required to accrue interest on loans while attending school, with no payment of this accrued interest until after they leave school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal student loans are virtually an entitlement for college- or trade school-bound students, with most funds aiding students from middle-income families. The Department of Education estimates that about 30 percent of all college students are receiving subsidized federal loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Attempts over the past decade to scale back the eligibility for student loans have failed because of strong middle-class support for the program. But the program actually subsidizes members of the middle class with one hand while taking taxes from them with the other. Recipients of the loans, moreover, gain considerably at the expense of Americans who did not go to college. College graduates can expect average lifetime earnings about $600,000 higher than those of non-graduates, and many students who do not need loans borrow up to the hilt to obtain money for non-education purchases at below-market rates. The result: Those who do not graduate end up subsidizing those who do by giving them a passport to higher earnings. Taxpayer subsidies to college students at the very least should expire when they join the work force. Borrowers who have completed or quit college should pay lenders market interest rates on their student loans without further assistance from the government.
<p>
<b>Reform #3: Link loan eligibility to continuous academic achievement.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Student loan eligibility should depend on continuously satisfactory academic progress toward degree completion, with all students required to have a high school diploma before becoming eligible for a loan. Enforcement efforts should be increased to verify that students receiving federal assistance are still in school and working toward a degree, and objective standards, such as the student's retaining at least a C average for the entire academic program, should be introduced.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Taxpayers should not be financing the college education of students who are failing their courses. A publicly funded loan is an honor and privilege, not an entitlement, and students receiving federal loans must be given incentives to study hard and graduate. Students today can obtain loans even without graduating from high school, which merely adds to the probability of default. Moreover, they need only maintain a C average by the end of their second year of study.
<p>
<b>Reform #4: Include home equity in the determination of eligibility and modify the simplified needs test.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Higher Education Act of 1992 eliminated house and farm assets from consideration in determining a family's ability to pay for post-secondary education, thereby making it easier for many students to obtain Stafford loans. The Act specifies formulas by which to calculate a family's need for Stafford loans. The amount the family is expected to contribute is determined by what is essentially a progressive tax formula. In effect, need analysis "taxes" family incomes and assets above amounts assumed to be required for a basic standard of living. The definition of assets excludes house and farm equity for all families, and all assets for applicants with incomes below $50,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
House and farm equity should be included in the calculation of assets to determine a family's need for financial aid for post-secondary education. In addition, the threshold below which most families are not asked to report their assets should be lowered to its previous level of $15,000. Families whose houses appreciated during the 1980s are financially better off than they would have been if they had not owned a house then. Moreover, not counting this equity gives families who own a house an advantage over those who do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under current law, the needs test is used to determine which students enjoy subsidized interest. Revising the needs test would target subsidies more precisely to those who need them.
<p>
<b>Reform #5: Require lenders to share the risk of guaranteed student loan defaults.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This could be accomplished by reducing the standard federal re-insurance from 98 to 90 percent, except for loans designated lender-of-last-resort, which would continue to receive 100 percent insurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), conducted by the Education Department's Planning and Evaluation Service,<sup>41</sup> found that:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Defaulters were four times more likely than non-defaulters to begin their postsecondary education without a high school diploma. Of this group of defaulters, approximately 40 percent had not received a general educational development (GED) certificate.
<p>
<li>Defaulters were more than twice as likely as non-defaulters to have dropped out of their postsecondary program.
<p>
<li>Defaulters were more than twice as likely to be unemployed or underemployed (earning less than $10,000) than non-defaulters at the time repayment was scheduled to begin.
<p>
<li>Defaulters had fewer and smaller loans, which indicates that they attended postsecondary institutions for shorter periods or went to relatively inexpensive institutions. This statistic may be explained in part by the fact that a significantly larger percentage of defaulters attended trade or vocational schools with programs lasting two years or less. On average, 72 percent of private vocational/trade school students receive federal aid as compared to 40 percent of students attending public undergraduate institutions.<sup>42</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If lenders were required to bear part of the costs of loan defaults, they would be more cautious in making loans for institutions with high student default rates. The federal government should cover only 80 percent on defaulted loans. This reform would give lending institutions an incentive to take greater care in scrutinizing institutions and collecting loans.
<p>
<b>Reform #6: Increase the default risk shouldered by loan guaranty agencies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This could be accomplished by changing the current guaranteed loan program's guaranty agency reinsurance on defaulted loans from 98/88/78 percent, depending on the annual level of defaults, to 95/85/75 percent, except for loans designated lender-of-last-resort, which would continue to receive 100 percent reinsurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 45 guaranty agencies, which include USA Funds, California Student Assistance Commission, and America Student Assistance, have been too quick to turn defaulted loans over to the Department of Education and the taxpayers. If guaranty agencies were required to bear part of the costs of loan defaults, they would be more diligent in their collection efforts before turning responsibility for a defaulted loan over to the federal government.
<p>

<b>Work-Study: Terminate</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Work-Study program provides grants to participating institutions to pay up to 75 percent of the salaries of needy undergraduate or graduate students working part-time, typically in on-campus jobs. The remaining 25 percent of student earnings is provided by the school or other employer. Funds are allocated to institutions according to a statutory formula, and individual grant amounts are determined at the discretion of institutional financial aid administrators. To the extent feasible, participating institutions are required to place Work-Study students in employment situations that complement their academic studies. They also are required by statute to use at least five percent of their Work-Study allocations to support students working in community service activities. The federal government currently spends $617 million annually on Work-Study.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In most cases, CWS students are employed by colleges -- for example, in food service, administrative offices, and libraries, or as teacher's aides. Thus, the federal government is subsidizing the employment expenditures of these institutions. Expecting taxpayers to defray the labor costs of well-endowed institutions like Harvard University, which receives over $2.9 million in federal work-study grants, reveals just how poorly conceived a program CWS really is. 
<P>

<b>Federal Direct Student Loan Account: Terminate</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Direct Student Loan program, recently renamed the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, was authorized by Congress in 1992 as a "pilot" program. It was expanded by Congress in 1993, however, from a pilot program to a "transition" program. Now the Administration plans to replace the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, formerly known as the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program, with the Direct Student Loan program. Under the Direct Loan program, unlike the FFEL program, the federal Treasury borrows money and then lends it directly to schools, which in turn lend it to the students. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary impetus for implementing it is cost: Replacing the current system with direct lending is supposed to lead to billions of dollars in savings. All current indications, however, are that it will not produce such savings.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Direct Lending centralizes control of post-secondary education lending in the Department of Education and creates the potential for huge, unconstrained overhead costs. Despite talk of reducing bureaucracy by switching to Direct Lending, the Department of Education is hiring over 500 new employees to administer these programs and anticipates hiring 20,000 contract employees when phase-in is completed. The federal government is funding the rapid expansion of this controversial program through an unencumbered $2.5 billion authorization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not only does the Direct Student Loan program add to a growing bureaucracy, but it also adds to the national debt. Instead of allowing capital for student loans to be provided by private sources, the federal government now must borrow money to fund those loans. Several noted economists have warned that the Direct Lending program will add billions to the federal debt without saving a dollar. For example, Dr. Rudolph G. Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, cautioned federal lawmakers that they "may be on the verge of making a serious public policy mistake" when Congress was debating the program. Penner predicts in an economic analysis that direct lending may add $70 million to the federal debt by 1998, with financing costs that could erase any theoretical budget savings.<sup>44</sup>  Penner's concerns are supported by two other recently issued reports, one conducted by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and another by economist Dr. Perry Quick of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.<sup>45</sup>  All three studies conclude that any alleged savings associated with one direct lending program are highly unlikely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Estimates of the costs of the Direct Lending program change constantly. In 1993 when it was enacted, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the program could save $4.3 billion over five years.<sup>46</sup>  The most recent CBO report, however, takes into account the Credit Reform Act as amended by the 1996 Budget Resolution. The amended Credit Reform Act includes long-term administrative costs, and the CBO now projects that the program will save a mere $115 million over the next seven years. Eliminating the program entirely would save $1.5 billion in outlays over the next seven years.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, government-run loan programs historically have had higher default rates than programs run by the private sector. A government-run monopoly like direct loans is unlikely to improve on the quality of service in the FFEL program. More important, the Direct Loan program is not subject to provisions terminating the eligibility of schools with high default rates -- which understandably are very enthusiastic about the prospect of direct loans.<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the Direct Lending Program fails to provide the savings it promises, it should be eliminated. Our student lending policies are not perfect, but nationalizing the program is not the answer.
<p>
<b>II. Higher Education Programs
<p>
Federal TRIO Programs<br>
1995 Appropriation: $463 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
TRIO programs provide a variety of outreach and support services to encourage low-income, potential first-generation college students to enter and complete college. These support programs target federal grant recipients and other disadvantaged students, working in tandem with federal grant programs focused on eliminating financial barriers to post-secondary education. Funds from this program should be included in the higher education block grant and sent back to the states in the same manner as Title I funds for elementary and secondary education.
<p>
<b>Aid for Institutional Development (Title III): Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $230 million</b>
]<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, there are seven separate programs that support the operations and endowments of a few institutions of higher education. The Clinton Administration is requesting the same funding ($143 million) in FY 1997 for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, along with a $40 million decrease in Aid for Institutional Development Part A (Strengthening Institutions) as part of a two-year phaseout. The Administration also proposes to eliminate the Endowment Challenge Grant general "endowments" program while preserving the HBCU set-aside portion of the program. The Administration argues that the federal government can support the general improvement of institutions more efficiently by increasing the investment in student aid; tuition revenues from a student receiving financial aid may be used for "developmental" purposes, as well as for endowment-building activities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is unfair to the large majority of both public and private post-secondary institutions for the federal government to single out a few institutions for substantial amounts of federal aid. Many of the schools receiving this aid are financially secure and do not need special treatment. 
<p>
<b>III. Other Post-Secondary Education Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to Aid for Institutional Development, the Department of Education funds over 29 small post-secondary programs that address a range of issues and activities. Most have achieved their original purposes, either largely or completely, or could be supported more efficiently by other funding sources. In its budget request for FY 1997, the Clinton Administration recognizes the need to eliminate many of these programs because they duplicate other programs, have achieved their purposes, or are supported more appropriately with non-federal funds. However, all of the following small post-secondary programs should be eliminated:
<p>

<b>Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education (FIPSE)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $17.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Funds from this program support projects with competitive grants that "enhance postsecondary education quality and cost effectiveness," according to the department. Current funding covers about 200 new and existing awards. The pursuit of education quality and cost-effectiveness should be the goal of all institutions of higher learning seeking to attract students; the federal government does not need to provide such an incentive. This program also supports exchange programs with European Community and NAFTA countries, activities that are available at the institutional level without federal funding. FIPSE should be terminated, with a portion of its funding transferred to the higher education block grant.
<P>
<b>Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development<br>
1995 Appropriation: $500,000</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides support for the preservation of Native Hawaiian and Alaskan Native Art. Such funding is provided more appropriately by state and tribal governments. Moreover, funds are available for this purpose from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<P>
<b>Eisenhower Leadership Program<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides grants to institutions of higher learning and nonprofit organizations to develop leadership skills in students. The department, following National Performance Review recommendations, is requesting no additional funds for this program in FY 1997. Activities promoted by these grants already are included in the curricula of post-secondary institutions' education programs. There is no need for federal involvement.
<p>
<b>Minority Teacher Recruitment <br>
1995 Appropriation: $2.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program administers two types of grants: partnership grants to institutions of higher learning to recruit and train minority teachers, and teacher placement grants to help state departments of education develop programs to help train minority students to become teachers. While minority teacher recruitment reflects a valid and current need, this program is too small to have an impact on a national scale. Only 13 small awards were given in 1995. Research should be done at the state level to determine what programs would best serve this interest, as there is little evidence thus far that giving money to these programs brings minority individuals into the profession who would not already have been there. 
<p>
<b>Minority Science Improvement <br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program grants money to institutions that primarily serve minority communities to encourage advanced study in science. Funds for advanced study are available through student financial assistance; money does not need to go directly to institutions for such purposes. This program should be terminated, with a portion of its funds transferred to the higher education block grant. States are better able to determine for themselves how best to encourage high-quality engineering and science studies at the institutional level.
<p>
<b>Innovative Projects for Community Service<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.4 million </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides grants to nonprofit organizations and higher education institutions to encourage students to participate in community service. While this is a commendable goal, it is neither education-related nor a federal responsibility. In addition, it is too small to have an impact at the national level. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>International Education and Foreign Language Studies<br>
1995 Appropriation: $58.1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
IEFLS funds graduate and undergraduate foreign language and area studies programs. This program should be terminated with a portion of funds put into the higher education block grant. States would be encouraged to use a portion of this grant to fund language activities.
<P>
<b>Institute for International Public Policy<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Funds from this program support the Institute for International Public Policy of the United Negro College Fund, designed to increase minority representation in the Foreign Service. This program is a direct grant to an institution performing a function outside the federal role in education.
<p>
<b>Cooperative Education<br>
1995 Appropriation: $6.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program funds the demonstration of cooperative education, but over 700 post-secondary institutions currently operate programs combining work experience with academic study without federal support. Federal support is no longer needed. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Law School Clinical Experience<br>
1995 Appropriation: $14.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was designed to provide clinical experience to law students that is best provided by non-federal sources such as law schools themselves. In addition, schools already have the incentive to provide clinical experience to attract students since its inclusion in the curriculum is so highly regarded. As recommended by the National Performance Review and the department's FY 1997 proposed budget, this program should be eliminated.
<p>
<b>Urban Community Service<br>
1995 Appropriation: $13.0 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program funds higher education institutions that serve as a resource for urban areas attempting to solve urban social and economic problems. These issues are addressed more appropriately by other federal agencies, however. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over $10.2 million in non-competitive federal construction grants has been provided to Bethune-Cookman College to construct this fine arts center. Any additional financing that might be required is available through private sources. This program is therefore unnecessary. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Academic Facilities<br>
1995 Appropriation: $24.2 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program gives aid to institutions of higher learning for construction, reconstruction, or renovation of academic facilities. These institutions, however, should be responsible for funding their own projects. Providing such funds is not a federal responsibility, and this program should be phased out as soon as previously awarded grant and loan obligations are met. A portion of these funds should be sent back to the states in the higher education block grant.
<p>
<b>Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program<br>
1995 Appropriation: $300,000</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HBCU Capital Financing Program provides federal guarantees for private sector bond financing for the repair and construction of facilities at HBCUs. As with Aid for Institutional Development, providing such assistance to a select group of higher learning institutions is not a federal responsibility. Financing of this sort can and should be secured without federal assistance.
<p>
<b>National Early Intervention Scholarships and Partnerships<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was designed to "forge new Federal-State partnerships" aimed at encouraging disadvantaged youth to pursue higher education. The FY 1997 department budget proposes that this program be cut, since the current budget situation precludes adequate funding. While a worthy endeavor, reaching out to disadvantaged youth is best done at the local level. In addition, Pell Grants and other loan programs already encourage this.
<p>
<b>IV. Higher Education Scholarship Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education maintains several merit-based scholarships that do not focus on providing access to higher education for those who are economically disadvantaged. Most are small, categorical programs that are difficult to maintain and have high overhead costs. In addition, over $30 billion is already available to those who need money for higher education. Therefore, each of the following scholarship programs should be terminated:
<p><ul>
<li>National Science Scholarships ($4.4 million);
<li>National Academy of Science, Space and Technology ($2.0 million);
<li>Douglas Teacher Scholarships ($14.6 million);
<li>Olympic Scholarships ($1.0 million);
<li>Teacher Corps ($1.9 million);
<li>Women and Minority Participation in Graduate Education ($5.8 million);
<li>Harris Fellowships ($20.2 million);
<li>Javits Fellowships ($7.8 million);
<li>Byrd Honors Scholarships ($29.1 million);
<li>Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need ($27.3 million); and
<li>Faculty Development Fellowships ($3.7 million).
</ul><p>

<b>School, College, and University Partnerships<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was created to forge partnerships to foster student readiness for the workforce. It is a relatively small program that duplicates functions of other federal and state-funded job training programs. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.

<p>
<b>Legal Training for the Disadvantaged (CLEO)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides disadvantaged individuals with a basic understanding of our legal system. Non-federal sources now account for 40 percent of this program's total funding; the department believes this would continue even if federal funding was withdrawn, in addition to which aid would continue to be available through student financial assistance programs. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>V. Howard University: Phase out funding<br>
1995 Appropriation: $204.7 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Howard University is a federally chartered black college in Washington, D.C. Despite its federal charter, Howard is a private institution with over 13,500 students. The university's programs are tailored to enhance the opportunities of minorities in professional fields. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1995 Congress appropriated $206 million for Howard University -- over $15,000 per enrolled student. This appropriation was approximately $13 million above both the 1994 funding level and the Clinton Administration's request. Direct appropriations for Howard were first authorized in 1867. In 1988, Congress and the Department of Education directed Howard University to develop a plan for financial self-sufficiency; ten years later, that plan still has not been developed fully, and Howard remains one of the most highly subsidized private universities in the nation. Academic subsidies cover roughly two-thirds of the cost of educating Howard's students, enabling the school to charge less than the average for state-supported public institutions. These students receive still more subsidies through federal student aid programs. Moreover, 20 percent of its student population is made up of foreign students who enjoy a federal subsidy equal to that of their American counterparts, yet come from families who generally have not paid taxes to finance the school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to raising tuition for foreign students, another way for Howard to move toward fiscal independence would be to build up its endowment. The Howard University endowment has increased annually, due both to federal contributions and to private contributions from friends and alumni. The university should increase its efforts to solicit contributions from alumni and friends, as other institutions do. A five-year phaseout would give Howard the time and the incentive to build up its resources and endowment, as it promised Congress it would do ten years ago. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following reforms and phaseouts should take place over the next five years:
<p>
Phase out subsidies for:
<p><ul>
<li>Academic Programs (1995 Appropriation: $158 million);
<li>Endowment Program (1995 Appropriation: $3.5 million); and
<li>Research (1995 Appropriation: $4.6 million).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Require Howard University to raise tuition for foreign students by at least 50 percent to offset the current federal subsidy toward their education.
<p>

<b>OFFICE OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT<br>
1995 Appropriation: $324 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) is tasked with providing national leadership in the areas of educational research and statistics. Its stated mission is to promote excellence and equity in American education by:
<p><ul>
<li>  Conducting research and demonstration projects funded through grants to help improve education;

<li> Collecting statistics on the status and progress of schools and education throughout the nation; and

<li> Distributing information and providing technical assistance to those working to improve education. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, OERI has grown into a bloated bureaucracy with many programs that easily could be turned over to the private sector or eliminated altogether.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OERI was re-authorized under the Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994. The Clinton Administration's 1997 funding request would support the research and development programs of five new National Research Institutes, the National Education Dissemination System, the statistics and assessments activities of the National Center for Education Statistics, and the creation of a National Library of Education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1994 Act authorized the Assistant Secretary for OERI to support activities to increase the participation of minority researchers and institutions. The law authorized funds for the operation of regional educational laboratories to provide technical assistance, promote education reform, and assist rural education. OERI also operates more than 15 categorical programs with budgets ranging from $800,000 to $83.2 million. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OERI's budget should be cut in half, and the agency's statistical, research, and assessment functions should be consolidated in the Census Bureau. Library and technology programs should be cut and sent back to the states as part of the elementary/secondary education and higher education block grants. 
<p>
<b>I. Statistics, Research, and Assessment<br>
1995 Appropriation: $32.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The statistical functions of OERI, which build knowledge about education, should continue to collect data on education reform and progress. But the Census Bureau performs similar functions in a far less politically charged environment. OERI's essential functions have become increasingly partisan and bureaucratic in recent years. In 1994, H.R. 6 (the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994) alone created several new bureaucracies which operate under OERI, including five new National Research Institutes, a new National Education Dissemination System, and a new National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board. While the federal government should collect and disseminate information, it should not be in the business of setting reform priorities for state and local education agencies. The research, statistics, and assessment functions therefore should be consolidated in the Bureau of the Census.
<p>
<b>II. Improvement Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many of the small programs operating within OERI were recommended for elimination by the Clinton Administration in its National Performance Review. These functions either can be performed by the private sector, are new programs that are unnecessary or redundant, have outlived their original goals and purposes, or were created to benefit a special interest group. In addition, these small programs either do not need separate funding or receive substantial funding from non-federal sources. They should be eliminated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has recommended eliminating the following small programs in its FY 1997 request: 
<p><ul>
<li> 21st Century Community Learning Centers ($750,000), coordinated services projects that provide elementary and secondary school students and their families better access to social, health, and education services.

<li> National Writing Project ($3.2 million), a grant to the National Writing Project, a nonprofit educational organization that offers training programs in the effective teaching of writing. This program has received federal funds for many years and has been amply demonstrated as a strategy for improving the teaching of writing

<li> National Diffusion Network ($11.7 million), a general school improvement program that disseminates activities about programs that work well. 
</ul><p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Several other programs not recommended for termination in the department's budget request, including the Star Schools Program ($25 million) and International Education Exchange ($3 million), can and should be handed over to the states or the private sector. For example, the Star Schools program was enacted in October 1988 to equip small primary and secondary schools in remote areas across the country with classroom instructions via live satellite transmissions. This service is being provided by state institutions and by commercial industry. Private industry also provides help, through donations of computers and laboratory equipment as well as cash assistance, to the very types of disadvantaged schools that the Star Schools program is designed to help. Exxon Corporation, IBM, and General Electric alone have spent millions of dollars on pre-college education to improve student training in computers, mathematics, and the sciences. These private initiatives are far more promising than a federal program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Ready to Learn Television grant ($7 million) goes to Public Broadcasting specifically for the Children's Television Network, the makers of Sesame Street. This program existed without federal funding until 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Fund for the Improvement of Education ($37 million) supports school recognition activities and various research projects. The information gained from research projects funded by this program is intended to benefit all states and aid the cause of reform. School recognition is best administered at the state or local level. With the elementary and secondary education block grant, a state can institute its own recognition activities. The research dissemination activities of this program will be handled by the research, statistics, and assessment offices sent to the Census Bureau.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These remaining programs can be cut because their purposes can be accomplished perfectly well within research and assessment programs: 
<P><ul>
<li>Eisenhower Regional Mathematics and Science Education Consortia ($15 million), which supports grants to operate regional organizations that put together math and science instructional materials and train teachers and administrators in teaching methods and assessment;

<li>Eisenhower Professional Development National Activities ($21.4 million), which funds national activities for teacher skill development in core subject areas; and

<li> Javits Gifted and Talented Education program ($9.5 million), which funds demonstration activities intended to improve the ability of elementary and secondary schools to meet the educational needs of the gifted.
</ul><p>
<b>III. Libraries</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The administration's FY 1997 budget request eliminates all categorical library programs and proposes instead that legislation be enacted to authorize a program of public library assistance state grants. Public libraries, however, should be free of federal involvement and funded at the local level or privately. These programs therefore should be eliminated:
<p><ul>
<li>Public Library Services ($83.2 million);
<li>Public Library Construction ($17.4 million);
<li>Interlibrary cooperation ($18 million);
<li>Library literacy programs ($8 million);
<li>Library Education and Training ($4.9 million), which can be financed through student financial aid; and
<li>Library Research and Demonstrations ($6.5 million). Other funds are available to fund demonstrations and disseminate findings through the Research division of OERI transferred to Census.
</ul><P>
<b>IV. Educational Technology</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department has requested $357 million for educational technology for FY 1997. This is part of a new initiative designed to "leverage substantial new investments in computer equipment, the development of educational software, and the training of teachers in the use of educational technology."  States have demonstrated, however, that they do not need federal involvement to give their students "technology rich" learning environments. Companies such as Microsoft and Apple have forged state partnerships to accomplish this. The money should be given to the states through the elementary and secondary education block grant.

<p>
<b>DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT</b>
<p>
<b>Eliminate all funding for Departmental Management while abolishing the Department of Education.</b>

Over $865 million of the Department of Education's $31 billion FY 1995 budget was dedicated to Discretionary Salaries and Expenses ($520 million) and permanent costs ($345 million). Permanent costs include Direct Loan Servicing and Other Costs, Guaranty Agencies and Other Transition Costs, and Federal Payroll Costs: Direct Loans and Transition. The $520 million authorized for salaries and expenses pays the costs of the staff, overhead, contracts, and other activities needed to monitor and administer the over 240 programs operating within the department, including the Office of the Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights. The Clinton Administration has requested about the same level of funding for FY 1997, $506 million in discretionary authority and $355 in permanent budget authority. The increase in mandatory budget authority is due mainly to the costs of administering the Direct Student Loan program. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the abolition of the Department of Education, HHS will take over administration costs of programs housed in that agency.

<p>
<b>Office for Civil Rights</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary staff functions of this office are to investigate discrimination complaints, conduct compliance reviews, monitor corrective action plans, and provide technical assistance. It mainly handles disability and equity issues. The functions of this office should be moved to the Department of Justice, which already handles many education-related issues. Civil rights enforcement is more efficient and effective when consolidated in one central office, separate from the potentially conflicting agendas of separate agencies.

<h3>A PROGRESS REPORT ON CLOSING UNNEEDED AND OBSOLETE INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES</h3>
By Ronald D. Utt, Ph.D.<br>

Backgrounder No. 1072<br>

<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When the new Congress took charge in January 1995, the House and Senate leadership promised fundamental overhaul of the federal government. Included among the many proposed reforms was the closing or consolidation of redundant and obsolete government agencies. The most visible manifestation of this effort was the call by House freshmen to shut down the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Energy, and Education. Although this initiative was associated most closely with the more junior members of both houses, the goal of streamlining government by terminating programs and closing agencies also was embraced by the leadership, with Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) endorsing the Senate freshmen's plan to close four departments.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In sharp contrast to its record in past years, this time Congress actually followed through and achieved more than most observers expected, shutting down over 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs throughout the federal government. This performance is illustrated by the action taken on 41 independent agencies recommended for termination in a January 1995 Heritage Foundation study because of their obsolescence, redundancy, limited value, or regional focus.<sup>1</sup>  Excluding the five independent agencies that are not subject to the annual appropriations process,<sup>2</sup> Congress's record for the remaining 36 is:
<P><ul>
<li> 13 agencies terminated and $3.6 billion saved over the next five years.<p>
<li> Funding for 12 agencies substantially reduced (by 10 percent or more) and $2.2 billion saved over five years.<p>
<li> No change or only limited change (funding cut by 10 percent or less) at 11 agencies and up to $40 million saved over the next five years.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By taking significant action on 25 (or 70 percent) of the targeted agencies, this Congress reversed years of inaction on outmoded programs that had enjoyed uninterrupted growth in their budgets. Of the 11 agencies sheltered from significant cuts or termination, all but one -- the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission, whose funding was tripled -- saw their funding either modestly reduced or frozen at 1995 levels. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But while Congress has done more than its fair share to reduce government waste, the President has opposed many of these efforts by vetoing five of the appropriations bills; a sixth is stalled in the Senate, threatened by a filibuster. Because these six bills contain most of the proposed agency terminations, only about $600 million of the $5.8 billion in potential savings has been signed into law by the President.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to this progress in dealing with the 41 agencies cited in the January Heritage report, considerable success was achieved in dealing with scores of other obsolete programs, many of which were identified in <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/townhall_shop/roll.html"><I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I></a>, the Heritage blueprint for a radical downsizing of the federal government.<sup>3</sup>  In the Cabinet departments reviewed in Rolling Back Government, 251 programs or program offices were shut down or consolidated, and another 56 were cut significantly. In addition, Congress shut down eight programs within the legislative branch. Program terminations and reductions of this magnitude, in addition to being unprecedented, are a key component of Congress's $23 billion overall reduction in discretionary spending from last year's level.<sup>4</sup>4
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is obvious that tremendous progress was made in cutting wasteful, obsolete, and redundant federal programs during the first session of the 104th Congress, but much more can be done. Congress and the President should revisit many of the independent agencies that survived, including those that were substantially reduced, and make additional cuts and terminations as appropriate. Reformers should keep an especially close watch on those agencies that are scheduled for shutdown or consolidation to guard against end runs in Congress and last-minute presidential vetoes designed to keep these unneeded programs in business. 
<P>

<b>THE CRITERIA FOR CLOSURE</b>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When reviewing government programs for possible phaseout and funding reductions, lawmakers in each case should assess the program's value and whether it is truly national in scope. This means asking four questions:
<P>
1) Is the service provided by another government department or agency?
<p>
2) Is the agency amenable to management efficiencies through consolidation?
<p>
3) Can the agency's responsibilities be justified in an era of competing needs and limited resources?
<p>
4) Is the agency's principal focus of regional rather than national interest?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Examples of the wasteful replication of public services include the many different agencies and offices tasked with nuclear safety. One of these, the Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiation, was allowed to go out of business last year. Among the many similar agencies that remain are the <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (the largest and oldest), the newer and much smaller Defense Nuclear Facilities Board, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and the Presidential Commission on Catastrophic Nuclear Disasters. In addition to these overlapping independent agencies, the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Performance Assessment, Office of Nuclear Safety Enforcement, Office of Nuclear Safety Policy and Standards, Office of Radiological Oversight, and Division of Transportation and Packaging Safety all perform similar functions. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While one could argue that there is no such thing as too much nuclear safety, this scattershot approach, with independent offices spread throughout Washington, means costly replication.<sup>5</sup>  More troublesome from a safety perspective is the potential for unintentional lapses and gaps in oversight because of divided responsibility, communications difficulties, and excessive overhead at the expense of safety initiatives. Typical of this problem is the recent disclosure that the Department of Energy wasted $59 million on an uncompleted "Waste Management Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement." <sup>6</sup>
<P>

<b>Achieving Efficiency Through Consolidation</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even when the specific responsibilities of independent agencies are decidedly different, their functions may be sufficiently similar to allow for management efficiencies through consolidation. This can reduce costs and allow more federal financial resources to go directly to the intended beneficiaries rather than to administering bureaucrats. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Examples of federal administrative redundancy include the scholarship funds established to honor prominent Americans. The Barry Goldwater Scholarship Foundation and the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation, while worthy in purpose, are also top-heavy with bureaucratic burdens that diminish their ability to achieve their mandated purpose. According to the President's FY 1996 budget, the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation will spend $1.13 million to provide $2 million in scholarships, and the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation will spend $986,000 to provide just $1,008,000 in fellowships to students. A dollar spent on excessive administrative overhead is a dollar denied a student or scholar. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A better way to honor America's leaders would be to consolidate these scholarship programs within a single foundation or existing agency already involved in making academic grants, such as the National Science Foundation or the Department of Education. This would reduce overhead costs substantially. Given the modest size of each of these programs, it makes no sense to maintain five separate accounting departments, five mailrooms, five travel budgets, five costly executives, five executive assistants, and five versions of all the other services needed to operate a scholarship program. 

<P>
<b>Low-Priority Agencies </b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Other independent agencies perform functions that, while possibly interesting and important to a few, cannot be justified in an era when available government resources are far short of what is needed to satisfy more pressing national goals. If the Department of State and Department of Defense are fulfilling their missions adequately, taxpayers are entitled to ask why additional millions of dollars are spent on the Institute of Peace, the North-South Center, or the Japan-United States Friendship Commission. Apparently many Members of Congress agree, because two of these agencies were subjected to significant cutbacks last year. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, do the President and Members of Congress really need a Commission of Fine Arts, at a cost of nearly $1 million a year in salaries and administrative expenses, to advise them on matters of architecture, painting, and sculpture?  Apparently they still think so, because the 104th Congress chose to keep it fully funded for another year. Fortunately, the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities were not so lucky; they were subjected to major cuts last year. 

<p>
<b>Agencies of Regional Interest </b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some programs have purely regional benefits and no national impact. Examples are the several independent agencies conducting special programs for specific East Coast river basins, such as the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. These programs may have some significance for specific states or regions, but they provide little direct value beyond that. Congress apparently agrees, because all of these regionally focused agencies are scheduled to shut down or lose their federal financial support this year.
<P>

<center><h2>STATUS OF AGENCIES IN THE HERITAGE REPORT</h2></center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Below is a brief summary of the 36 agencies identified in the January 1995 Heritage study. In each case, the review indicates what action has been taken, how much money will be saved for taxpayers over the next five years, and whether the White House has signed the necessary legislation into law.
<p>
<center><h3>Agencies Congress Voted to Close Down</h3></center>
<P>
<b>Administrative Conference of the United States
<P>
Purpose:</b> Assists the President, Congress, and federal departments in improving the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedures used within government and with private citizens.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Given the general agreement within Congress and the executive branch on the need for a fundamental overhaul of the way government does business and serves the public, it is apparent that the Conference has little to show for the millions of taxpayer dollars it has spent in its 30 years of existence. The Commission should be abolished in favor of more comprehensive and more promising efforts being considered in Congress or recommended by the Administration's own National Performance Review.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has passed legislation to terminate the Conference and appropriated $600,000 for 1996 to cover the costs associated with the shutdown. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $9.5 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the legislation into law.

<p>
<b>Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations
<p>
Purpose:</b> Examines federal, state, and local trends, events, and programs that affect intergovernmental relations and makes recommendations as appropriate.
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Despite its stated purpose, the Commission has never played a serious role in the debate concerning levels of government in the federal system. Key debates and decisions on issues such as revenue sharing, unfunded mandates, interstate commerce, and transport generally have been handled elsewhere as mayors, governors, Congress, and the President work together to resolve problems and develop policy.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has passed legislation to terminate the Conference, and $784,000 has been appropriated to cover termination expenses and final work products.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $4.8 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the bill into law.

<p>
<b>Commission on National Community Service
<p>
Purpose:</b> Established in 1990 to encourage all citizens, especially young people, to engage in community service. Makes grants to states and other entities to create service opportunities for students and out-of-school youth.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> America has an extensive tradition of volunteer work and charitable giving, most of it oriented toward locally based community service organizations. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars for the federal government to encourage Americans to do what they already are doing in great numbers.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> The Commission was merged last year into the Corporation for National and Community Service, which Congress has scheduled for termination this year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Approximately $250 million to $300 million, based on FY 1995 spending of $54.4 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> No action is necessary on the Commission, but President Clinton has vetoed proposed termination of the Corporation, as discussed below.

<p>
<b>National Community Service Program
<p>
Purpose:</b> As one of two main components of the Corporation for National and Community Service, this program is supposed to encourage Americans to engage in volunteer work and community service. President Clinton's AmeriCorps is part of this program and exists to pay stipends and other financial benefits to "volunteers."
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> America's extensive tradition of volunteer work does not require federal involvement or financial support.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress voted to terminate the Corporation's National Community Service Program. (See next section for proposed cutbacks in other programs operated by the Corporation.)
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $2.862 billion. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President has vetoed the appropriations bill which included this termination.

<p>
<b>Delaware River Basin Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> Participates jointly with basin states -- Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania -- in the development of regional water and related resources. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The benefits of the Commission's activities accrue mostly to the contiguous states in the Delaware River Basin. Therefore, these states should fund the program in its entirety. There is no reason for federal taxpayers to fund costly programs of strictly regional interest and benefit.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress ended federal support for the Commission this year and has provided final payment of $343,000 to facilitate the transition to self-sufficiency.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $4.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this bill into law. 
<p>

<b>FDIC Affordable Housing and Bank Enterprise
<p>
Purpose:</b> Offers select properties in inventory to eligible households and organizations for low-income housing. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The Enterprise competes directly with the objectives and programs of HUD, as well as with those of numerous state and local programs with a similar purpose. Experience demonstrates that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has had a difficult enough time pursuing its main purpose -- promoting the safety and soundness of banks -- and ought not to involve itself in the difficult task of attempting to house the poor. The Enterprise should be terminated or consolidated with similar housing programs.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress enacted legislation to terminate the program, arguing that "[g]iven the plethora of housing programs already in existence through HUD and other federal housing agencies... the Committee questions the value of yet another program, no matter the merit of its intent." 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $82.1 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill which included this termination.

<p>
<b>Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides Native Americans with an opportunity to obtain post-secondary education in various fields of Indian art and culture. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> It is unwise for the federal government to be in the business of directly funding studies in one culture in preference to others. Existing student loan and grant programs from other sources can be used to support post-secondary education for eligible students through accredited institutions of learning. The program should be terminated or consolidated with other scholarship funds or related programs.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress provided the Institute with $5.5 million this year, compared with $11.5 million last year, with the understanding that federal funding will be phased out. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $56.6 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which terminated the Institute.

<p>
<b>Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin
<p>
Purpose:</b> Created on behalf of the four contiguous states and the District of Columbia to promote water pollution abatement and control and manage water and land resources in the Potomac River Basin. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Responsibility for the funding and management of this commission should rest entirely with the District and the affected states.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress provided the Commission with a payment of $511,000 as final year funding for the orderly transition to self-sufficiency.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the bill into law.
<p>

<b>Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiator</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> To find a state or Indian tribe willing to host a nuclear waste site. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> As with other independent agencies concerned with nuclear issues, this office should be consolidated with another independent agency, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or with the appropriate division within the Department of Energy or the Environmental Protection Agency.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action: </b>The Office was allowed to expire in early 1995. A number of these agencies are scheduled to self-destruct, and no specific congressional action is required. Indeed, as last year's government shutdowns indicated, most discretionary programs are of this nature.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $1 million per year.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> No action required.

<p>
<b>Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation<P>


Purpose:</b> Performs a variety of real estate development functions, including design, land acquisition, and construction of projects related to the improvement of the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor connecting the White House with the Capitol.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Since its creation in 1972, the Corporation has invested millions of tax dollars in this one-mile stretch of road, turning the once-decrepit strip of deteriorated buildings into one of <I>Scenic America</I>'s ten "Most Scenic Byways."  Although this task was fulfilled years ago, the Corporation continues to receive substantial public funds for commercial real estate development activities best left to the private sector.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has enacted legislation to terminate the Corporation by April 1, 1996, and has authorized the use of prior year funds to facilitate the shutdown. Real estate development in progress will be transferred to the U.S. General Services Administration. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $245 million. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill terminating the Corporation. 

<p>
<b>State Justice Institute
<P>
Purpose:</b> Established in 1984 to make grants and undertake activities to improve the administration of justice in the United States.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Continued high crime rates and public disappointment in the behavior of the court system over the past several years suggest that the Institute has not much to show for its costly ten-year effort to improve America's administration of justice.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress appropriated $5 million to provide for the orderly phaseout of direct federal support. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $67.5 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President vetoed the appropriations bill which included termination of the Institute.

<p>
<b>Susquehanna River Basin Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> Participates jointly with affected states in the development of water and related resources in the Susquehanna River Basin. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> As with similar commissions, the responsibility for funding and management should be turned over to the contiguous states.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress enacted legislation to withdraw federal support from the Commission and provided $318,000 to facilitate the transition to self-sufficiency. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $1.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.
<P>

<b>Thomas Jefferson Commemorative Commission</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Established to honor the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth. The anniversary occurred in 1993.
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Despite the passing of the anniversary three years ago, $31,000 was scheduled to be spent in FY 1995 and another $25,000 in FY 1996 for post-birthday events. Because it has met its stated objective, there is little or no reason for the Commission to exist.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action: </b>The Commission was allowed to expire, and no federal spending is scheduled after this fiscal year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $500,000.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> No action is required to fulfill such a previously scheduled expiration.

<p>

<center><h3>Agencies Congress Voted to Cut Substantially</h3></center>
<P>

<b>Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides independent advice to the President and Congress relating to the national historic preservation program. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Historic preservation, including the development of appropriate policies, should be a local responsibility. The only exception might be for landmarks of national significance, and these cases can be handled by the U.S. National Park Service and its Division of Cultural Resources.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has voted to reduce the Council's FY 1996 funding by 15 percent, down to $2.5 million from last year's $2.94 million, and advises the Council to find ways to be reimbursed by government agencies for which it provides a service. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.5 million. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included this funding cut.
<p>


<b>Appalachian Regional Commission</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Provides guidance and financial assistance to the 13 Appalachian states for basic facilities and support to promote economic growth in the region. Programs focus on transportation access and on community, business, and human development. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Although it is one of the more costly independent agencies, there is no convincing evidence that the ARC, after more than 30 years of operation, has been effective in creating new jobs or capital investment. In practice, it serves largely as a source of pork-barrel spending for the region's politicians. West Virginia, a focus of much of the Commission's attention, is still poor and becoming poorer relative to the rest of the country. The per capita income of West Virginia's population ranked 43rd in the country in 1980 but fell to 46th by 1994, and its unemployment rate is consistently one of the highest in the country. It is time to try something new for the problems of West Virginia and other Appalachian states -- such as tax cuts, enterprise zones, school choice, and deregulation.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action: </b> Finally recognizing the failure of pork-barrel projects to spur growth, this Congress slashed the Commission's budget by 40 percent, appropriating only $170 million for 1996 compared with $282 million last year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $568.6 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the bill into law.
<p>

<b>Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
<p>
Purpose:</b> Advises the President and Secretary of State on arms control, non-proliferation, and disarmament activities and participates in negotiations with other countries. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> As a product of the Cold War, ACDA largely has fulfilled its mission by a series of nuclear, conventional, and chemical weapons agreements. For many years, ACDA has been overshadowed by other U.S. agencies, particularly the State, Energy, and Defense Departments, in its pursuit of disarmament. The Agency is outmoded and duplicative and should be abolished, with arms control issues mandated to other, more appropriate agencies.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has reduced the Agency's budget by 34 percent, cutting it from $54.4 million last year to $35.7 this year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $101.5 million. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President has vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.
<p>

<b>Corporation for National and Community Service
<p>
Purpose:</b> Engages Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service focused on the nation's educational, human, public safety, and environmental needs.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Given America's proud tradition of volunteerism and charitable giving, much of it oriented toward locally based community service organizations, it is a waste of federal dollars to encourage Americans to do what they already do in great numbers.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has enacted legislation to terminate the largest of the Corporation's programs, the National Community Service Program, which includes AmeriCorps (see previous section). The House and Senate have yet to agree on spending for the Corporation's Domestic Volunteer Service Programs, which include such programs as VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America); the Senate has passed cuts from 1995 levels of 6 percent, while the House has reduced spending by 14 percent.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $71.5 million (Senate bill) to $154 million (House bill). 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> An earlier version of this bill was vetoed by President Clinton. The appropriations bill in which these cuts were proposed is stalled in Senate.    
<p>

<b>East-West Center
<p>
Purpose:</b> Promotes better relations between the U.S. and the nations of Asia and the Pacific through cooperative programs of study, research, and training. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The resources and talents of the State Department, which maintains a network of embassies and consulates in Asian and Pacific nations, should be sufficient to maintain good relations with these countries. Deficiencies that remain not likely to be rectified by the cooperative programs of the Center. 
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has cut the Center's budget by more than half (52 percent), reducing this year's spending to $11.75 million from $24.5 million in 1995. The House actually proposed to terminate the Center; the large cut reflects compromise with Senate. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $70.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill that included this cut.

<P>
<b>Institute of Peace
<p>
Purpose:</b> Conducts and supports research and scholarship in the fields of international peace and conflict resolution. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Although the world remains a dangerous place, responsibility for maintaining and enhancing peace should remain with the State and Defense Departments, in cooperation with Congress and the multilateral organizations to which the United States belongs and contributes. The scholarly endeavors of the Peace Institute replicate, at taxpayer expense, the efforts of academics and private research organizations concerned with international relations.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> A successful Senate filibuster against the appropriations bill that would fund the Institute makes the outcome uncertain; the House voted for a nearly 50 percent cut, while the Senate proposed to maintain funding at last year's level. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $16.1 million assuming House-Senate conferees split the difference and cut the Institute's budget by nearly 25 percent.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> Necessary legislation is stalled in the Senate.
<p>

<b>Legal Services Corporation
<p>
Purpose:</b> Funds private attorneys, nonprofit organizations, and state and local agencies to provide free civil legal assistance to the poor. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Financed in part by federal dollars and tasked with providing legal representation for the poor, Corporation-supported lawyers and grantees frequently have used their positions and resources to pursue political and lobbying activities. These efforts have included such things as legal action against welfare reform, Proposition 187 (California's immigration reform), and state and local tax reductions, to name just a few. Given its history of political activism, and given the substantial funding the legal services system receives from non-federal sources, taxpayer support should be ended and the Corporation privatized.<sup>7</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Corporation serves largely as a source of federal tax dollars for approximately 323 locally based grantees -- such as the Legal Aid Society of Central Texas and the Food Research Action Center -- that do the actual legal work. In addition to receiving taxpayers' money through the Corporation, these grantees in 1993 also received an additional $245 million from other sources, including IOLTA (Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts) funds, state and local grants, and private and nonprofit contributions. Moreover, the legal profession provides significant amounts of pro bono work for needy clients and social issues. A privatized Corporation easily could build on this extensive funding base and work with state, national, and local bar associations to secure and enhance IOLTA and other private or nonprofit funding for grantees and provide a tighter focus for their representational work.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> After years of rapid spending growth, this Congress has achieved what many thought impossible by enacting significant cuts in the Corporation's budget, reducing it from $400 million in 1995 to $278 million this year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $680.5 million.  
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President vetoed the appropriations bill which included this cut.

<p>
<b>Marine Mammal Commission
<p>

Purpose:</b> Coordinates America's marine mammal policy, reviews the status of the marine mammal population, and recommends conservation steps to relevant government departments. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> No other form of non-human life, endangered or otherwise, has its own commission. This costly precedent should be terminated. Existing federal programs, such as NOAA's Coastal Ecosystems Health and Recovering Protected Species programs, are tasked to perform similar responsibilities, as is the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service. 
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress passed legislation that would cut the Commission's budget by 14 percent, from $1.4 million in 1995 to $1.2 million in 1996.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $1.1 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.
<p>

<b>National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides payments for general operating support to Washington, D.C., arts and other cultural organizations. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Citizens of Washington, D.C., and visitors to the city are the beneficiaries of major federally supported arts and cultural programs well in excess of what is available in other cities. Washington's culturally rich environment would scarcely notice the loss of this $7 million taxpayer-funded program.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress enacted legislation that would cut the Commission's budget by 20 percent, from $7.5 million last year to $6 million in 1996.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $8.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included these cuts.
<p>
<b>National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Umbrella organization for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and Institute of Museum Services. The NEA provides grants to and contracts with groups, individuals, and state and regional organizations engaged in or concerned with the arts. The NEH funds activities intended to improve the quality of education and teaching in the humanities.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> In recent years, Americans have had good reason to be concerned about efforts to promote government-sanctioned art, from public commissions to approve or reject architectural design, to requirements that some portion of a building's construction budget be devoted to art, to the bureaucratically approved and funded art of the NEA. The NEA should be closed down and American artists encouraged to turn their energies to winning private support for their creative endeavors rather than engaging in political grantsmanship.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Similarly, the NEH recently demonstrated its questionable judgment by producing, among other things, a breathtakingly distorted curriculum for the teaching of American history, thereby confirming the worst fears of those who argued that federal involvement in education would promote propaganda rather than the search for truth. It is time to terminate the NEH before doctrinaire bodies like the National Committee for History Standards further undermine education and the appreciation of American culture.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> After years of escalating spending, Congress finally has made deep cuts in the budgets of the NEA and NEH. These cuts reflect a comprise between the House and Senate, with the House preferring to terminate these programs within the next two years. In the compromise plan, the NEA's budget, including its matching grant program, will be cut 39 percent from $162.3 million in 1995 to $99.4 in 1996; the NEH budget, including matching grants, will be cut by 35 percent, from $172 million in 1995 to $112 million this year, yielding potential five-year savings of $333.2 million and a total of $682.5 million over the next five years for both agencies.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $349.3 million (NEA) and $333.2 million (NEH).
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included these cuts.
<p>

<b>National Commission on Libraries and Information Science
<p>
Purpose:</b> Responsible for developing plans to meet the library and information needs of the nation, and for coordinating federal, state, and local government activities to meet these needs. 
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> America's system of libraries -- most of them locally based and supported -- is the envy of the world. Moreover, the rapid technological advances taking place within the information industries promise unprecedented access to a wealth of information at modest cost. Much of this rapid change is driven by the profit-seeking private sector, and there is little need for government involvement, financial support, or expert guidance. The federal government's greatest contribution would be to get out of the way and not try to "coordinate" the explosive innovations in information technology.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Although the House and Senate have yet to agree on a final number, if they choose to split the difference between the two positions, the Commission's spending will be cut by 30 percent, from $901,000 in 1995 to $639,000 in 1996. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $1.5 million (assuming final funding midway between the levels voted by each chamber)
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The appropriations bill that includes these changes is stalled in the Senate.
<p>

<b>North-South Center</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Promotes better relations between the United States, the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean, and Canada by bringing together scholars and students for cooperative study, training, and research.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> This program should be terminated in favor of long-standing activities of the State Department designed to sustain and improve relations within the Western Hemisphere. Improved commercial links, helped by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the NAFTA, and increased private contacts by business people, academics, journalists, and tourists render the Center unnecessary. 
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress cut the Center's budget in half, saving $2 million this year.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $11 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.

<p>

<center><h3>Agencies That Escaped Significant Cuts</h3></center>

<b>Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad
<p>
Purpose:</b> Encourages the preservation of cemeteries, monuments, and historic buildings associated with the foreign heritage of the United States.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation: </b>To reduce overhead and administrative cost, this task should be handled through the Foreign Service and cultural attaches in relevant U.S. embassies, using local contractors as appropriate.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress chose to maintain spending at last year's level.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included the Commission's funding.

<p>
<b>Commission of Fine Arts
<p>

Purpose:</b> Advises the President, Congress, and department heads on matters of architecture, sculpture, painting, and other fine arts, particularly as they relate to the appearance of the nation's capital. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Congress already has its long-standing office of the Architect of the Capitol, whose skills, resources, and capabilities are more than adequate to the task of providing advisory services, either directly or through referral, for Members of Congress, the President, or any Cabinet head needing expert guidance and advice on the fine arts. The Commission does not create art; it reviews and judges the work of others, a role best played by the public at large at no cost to the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress chose to maintain spending at last year's level, despite the fact that the Commission's $834,000 budget is applied only to salaries and administrative expenses.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included the Commission's funding.

<p>
<b>Commission on Civil Rights
<p>
Purpose:</b> Engages in studies concerning areas in which there may be denials of civil rights, and reports on these matters to the President and Congress. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> The Commission replicates the civil rights responsibilities of the federal government's many other civil rights offices, as described in the introduction to this study.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has cut the Commission's $9 million budget by only 3 percent and has not consolidated its operations with those of any other federal civil rights offices. 
<P>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included funding for the Commission.

<p>
<b>Corporation for Public Broadcasting
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides grants to qualified public television and radio stations, to be used at their discretion for purposes related to program production and acquisition. The Corporation was established in 1968 to provide additional programming and support to the nation's non-commercial radio and television stations. Public broadcasting now includes nearly 600 radio stations and 340 television stations. This extensive nationwide system receives more than 80 percent of its support from sources other than the federal government, with contributions from subscribers and business accounting for its largest and second-largest sources of income. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The CPB now provides 14 percent of the Public Broadcasting System's total financial support, the loss of which could be offset by greater reliance on other financial sources, improved management and administrative efficiency, and the elimination of low-priority programming and grant activities. The loss of federal dollars also could be offset by recouping some of the earnings of the many profitable production companies which share the subsidy and by selling commercial air time, particularly in time slots now devoted to CPB/PBS self-promotion and self-justification. Increasingly, CPB/PBS quality and content fall short of that available on the private sector's Arts & Entertainment Network, Discovery Channel, Learning Channel, and History Channel, as well as the growing number of competitors to CNN. These networks demonstrate that quality educational programming can be maintained in a commercial format and without federal financial support.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Unlike most other federal programs, the CPB is funded two years in advance, and this year's appropriation bills deal with FY 1998 funding. Although the House and Senate have yet to agree on a final 1988 spending target for the Corporation, their proposals either do not involve much of a reduction or would maintain current funding: The House proposes an 8 percent cut of $20 million, while the Senate would freeze the budget at the 1996 level of $260 million. Differences will not be resolved until a Senate filibuster against the Labor/HHS appropriations bill is broken.
<p>
<b>Three-Year Savings:</b> As high as $30 million (assuming the House and Senate split the difference); as high as $750 million (if the program is terminated). 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> Necessary legislation is stalled in the Senate.
<p>

<b>Defense Nuclear Facilities Board<p>

Purpose:</b> Responsible for evaluating the content and implementation of standards related to defense nuclear facilities of the Department of Energy. Also investigates events or practices at defense nuclear facilities that may affect public health adversely. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation: </b>The Board is one of five independent agencies concerned with nuclear safety issues, as described in the introduction to this study. It should be consolidated with one of the other independent bodies concerned with nuclear arms and energy to improve congressional and executive branch oversight at less cost to the budget.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has cut the Board's budget by only $900,000, just 5 percent less than last year's $17.9 million. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> At least $5 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.

<p>
<b>Japan-United States Friendship Commission</b>
<P>
<b>Purpose:</b> Makes grants to promote scholarly, cultural, and artistic activities between Japan and the United States. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Given the extensive business, cultural, academic, diplomatic, and political relationships between the United States and Japan, there is no shortage of interaction between the citizens and institutions of these two countries. The Friendship Commission's activities are both redundant and a waste of money.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Both houses of Congress have voted to maintain the Commission at $1.2 million, the same level of spending as last year.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill that included these cuts.

<p>
<b>Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> To formulate plans for a memorial to FDR. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Before his death, President Roosevelt requested that any memorial to him be simple, no larger than his desk, and placed near the National Archives. Although this request was fulfilled many years ago, Congress has persisted in trying to erect something grander. It should honor President Roosevelt by adhering to his request.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Notwithstanding FDR's request, the Memorial Commission is the only one of the 36 independent agencies discussed in this study to receive an increase in its budget -- in this case an increase of more than 200 percent to $147,000.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None; instead, taxpayers face a rise in spending of as much as $500,000 over the next five years if this is sustained.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the legislation that included this increase.

<p>
<b>National Capital Planning Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> Central planning agency for the federal government in the national capital. 
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Washington, D.C., is unique among U.S. cities in having a federally funded planning commission to help guide its development. Whatever expertise this commission may bring to bear, however the economic and social environment of Washington still continues to deteriorate. In any case, planning activities should be undertaken by the D.C. government.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress would reduce the Commission's budget by only 9 percent to $5.09 million from last year's $5.65 million. This is in marked contrast to Congress's termination of the similarly mandated Pennsylvania Avenue Redevelopment Commission.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.8 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.

<p>
<b>Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation<p>

Purpose:</b> Performs a number of functions intended to reverse neighborhood decline, develop housing strategies, and replicate successful neighborhood preservation strategies.
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Programs of the Corporation duplicate those of HUD, particularly now that HUD has established its Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities program to focus resources more precisely on impoverished neighborhoods.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress voted to maintain last year's funding of $38.7 million despite the Corporation's duplication of HUD's $4 billion Community Development Block Grant program. Congress should revisit the issue and apply to it the same standards it applied to the now-terminated FDIC Affordable Housing Program.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.
<p>

<b>Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board
<p>
Purpose:</b> To evaluate the technical and scientific validity of the activities of the Department of Energy's nuclear waste disposal program. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> As with the Defense Nuclear Facilities Board, the responsibilities of this Board should be consolidated with those of another nuclear safety agency or department, as indicated in the introduction to this study.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress chose to maintain the status quo by making no change in prior year spending.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.

<p>
<b>Office of Government Ethics
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides overall direction of executive branch policies designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure high ethical standards. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Recent significant ethical lapses within the executive branch and Congress suggest that the Office has been less than effective in imposing a higher ethical standard on government officials, notwithstanding the more than $8 million it spent in the last fiscal year. The enhancement of ethical conduct should be internal to each agency, and the monitoring of ethical standards should be the direct responsibility of the inspector general and general counsel of each department and agency. This ineffective Office should be terminated.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Despite this office's ineffectiveness, Congress has reduced its budget by only 5 percent to $7.7 million in 1996.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.4 million.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.

<b>TERMINATION AND CONSOLIDATION OBJECTIVES FOR THE FY 1997 BUDGET</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While this analysis recommends the abolition of just 41 of the approximately 130 independent agencies, this should not be construed as endorsing the activities of the other agencies or their current levels of federal funding. These 41 agencies were chosen as best representing those that could and should be terminated. Many others should be subjected to close examination, funding reductions, fundamental reform, or abolition according to the criteria outlined in this study. In most cases, agencies excluded from the current list are of a size and significance that require more exhaustive analysis. Among these, the Small Business Administration, General Services Administration, and Federal Communications Commission are just a few of the remaining independent agencies that should be reviewed by Congress for termination, substantial cutbacks, or major reform.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/townhall_shop/roll.html"><I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I></a>, Heritage Foundation analysts systematically reviewed many of the larger independent agencies, as well as the many divisions and offices within the Cabinet agencies. That study made numerous recommendations for program termination, privatization, consolidation, and reform, and many of these recommendations were adopted by the appropriations committees when they proposed the termination of 259 programs in last year's appropriations bills. Many were not, however, and those that were overlooked during last year's attempt at budget reform should be revisited this year as potential candidates for restructuring or elimination.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Just weeks after telling the nation, in this year's State of the Union address, that the "era of big government is over," Bill Clinton indicated that the obituary notice was somewhat premature when he delivered his a 20-page FY 1997 budget to Congress. In contrast to the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 (BBA), which he vetoed last fall, the latest Clinton budget would mean $1,927 in higher taxes and $3,155 in higher spending for every household in America over the next seven years. This is the eighth budget plan Clinton has delivered to Congress in a year; and, except for the FY 1996 budget submitted last February (which called for $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade), each has been short on specifics and long on promises.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While Clinton claims his FY 1997 budget will eliminate the federal deficit by FY 2002 using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, it does so only by using the same assortment of smoke, mirrors, and other gimmicks that has made taxpayers increasingly cynical about Washington's commitment to budget-making. Even worse, although the Clinton budget balances on paper, it flinches from making the tough decisions needed to eliminate wasteful and outmoded programs, end welfare as we know it, save Medicare from bankruptcy, or transfer failing federal programs to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The FY 1997 Clinton budget is not the end of big government, it is the embodiment of it. Clinton's plan, for example:
<ul>
<li>Increases federal spending by $361 billion over the next seven years and hikes tax revenues by $526 billion;
<p>
<li>Spends a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, or $306 billion more than the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995. That means $3,155 more for every household in America;
<p>
<li>Raises a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues over seven years, $187 billion more than the BBA, and $1,927 more in taxes for every household in America;
<p>
<li>Allows $119 billion more deficit spending through 2002 than the BBA, which is equivalent to passing along $1,227 per household in debt to the next generation of American workers;
<p>
<li>Fails to eliminate a single program of any significance;
<p>
<li>Fails to eliminate even one Cabinet-level agency;
<p>
<li>Increases entitlement spending by $365 billion over the next seven years while failing to save Medicare from bankruptcy, end welfare as we know it, or protect states from the exploding costs of Medicaid; and
<p>
<li>Spends $111 billion more on discretionary programs than the BBA while calling for billions more in spending on programs that have failed or become obsolete, that duplicate others, or that should be transferred to state and local government control.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The FY 1997 Clinton budget signals not the end of big government, but the continuation of status-quo government.
<p>

<b>CLINTON 8, TAXPAYERS 0</b><sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite a campaign promise to balance the budget in five years while providing tax cuts for working families, President Clinton has consistently resisted congressional efforts to enact a balanced budget plan with tax cuts. In addition to vetoing the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Clinton presented four budget plans to Congress during 1995 -- each time falling far short of balancing the budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. After a year of prodding, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan on January 5, 1996. CBO certified -- at least on paper -- that this new proposal would balance the budget by 2002. Closer review of each of the budget plans proposed by Clinton during the past year, however, including the FY 1997 budget, shows that the White House has never been serious about either balancing the budget or providing meaningful tax relief. It seems interested only in finding ways to spend more taxpayer dollars while appearing to agree that the budget should be balanced.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #1</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade. According to CBO, the President's February budget would increase the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The February Clinton budget did propose a few modest privatization initiatives, such as selling the Power Marketing Administrations, portions of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, the Naval Petroleum Reserves, and portions of the National Weather Service. It also proposed terminating a few small programs and consolidating some 270 programs into 27 new programs. In addition, the budget proposed a "Middle Class Bill of Rights" which included a modest $300-per-child tax credit for families that have children below age 13 and who earn less than $60,000 per year. But the Administration did little to fight for any of these proposals. On May 19, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This Clinton plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than his first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, this plan would produce $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second budget plan also included the modest tax cut for families with children in addition to tax deductions for higher education and expanded Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never balance the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform than the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<P>
<b>Clinton Budget #4</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The CBO scored this plan as $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up for its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In other words, the Administration wanted to have it both ways: Claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 18, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #5</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan to Congress. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is likely that Clinton never would have submitted this plan had it not been for the conditions Congress included in the continuing resolution passed on January 5, 1996. These conditions stipulated, in effect, that a bill to provide operating funds for unappropriated federal programs through January 26 would not be sent to the President until he submitted a seven-year balanced budget plan scored by the CBO. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, the fifth Clinton budget falls far short of being credible. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the fifth Clinton budget, most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction fell in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings was to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were "sunsetted" in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget would be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal is reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The sixth Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 9. It moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while boosting the net size of the tax cuts to $85 billion. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings than the last congressional offer and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs. 
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would be reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would force hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Moreover, each plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>
<b>WHAT CLINTON'S FY 1997 BUDGET WOULD MEAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The eight Clinton budgets clearly demonstrate that this President envisions a government that has a balanced budget but somehow remains largely unchanged from government with perpetual $200 billion deficits. In other words, Clinton wants it both ways. He says he wants a balanced federal budget, but he is not willing to challenge the size and scope of government as a credible balanced budget plan requires.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The boldest proposal the Administration can muster is to "reinvent government," which, in practice, amounts to putting a new paint job on a house whose foundation is collapsing under its own weight. American taxpayers sent government a very clear message in the 1994 election: They do not want useless and obsolete programs merely to waste their money more efficiently. They want the budget to be balanced in a timely fashion, and they want the result of this effort to be a smaller, less costly government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton FY 1997 budget would leave less money in the pockets of working families and more money in the hands Washington's big spenders.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It spends money taxpayers cannot afford. The 20-page FY 1997 Clinton budget proposes to "balance the budget" in FY 2002 while boosting spending $361 billion over the next seven years. It would spend a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, $306 billion more than would be spent under the Balanced Budget Act the President vetoed last December. This amounts to $3,155 more government spending for every household in America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It takes more of their money in tax revenues. The Clinton budget assumes federal tax collections will grow an astonishing $526 billion by FY 2002, a jump of nearly 39 percent. Also, the Administration expects the government to collect a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues over the next seven years, $187 billion more than under the BBA. This amounts to $1,927 more in taxes for every household in America. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It adds to tomorrow's debt burden. Because the Clinton budget fails to control federal spending, it would add $755 billion in accumulated deficits to the national debt, even while promising to balance the budget over seven years. Compared to the BBA, this is $119 billion more deficit spending over seven years, equivalent to transferring $1,227 per household in added debt to the next generation of American workers.
<p>

<b>Balancing the Budget Without Lifting a Finger</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As was the case with Clinton's previous "balanced budget" plans, the only way the FY 1997 budget can be made to balance -- at least on paper -- is by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future President and Congress. How does it do this?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>First, the Clinton plan purports to save nearly $596 billion over the next seven years, but less than 40 percent of these savings is achieved during the first five years.</b> The painful task of accomplishing 61 percent of the plan's deficit reduction falls to the first Congress and President elected in the next century. Indeed, some 54 percent of the plan's Medicare savings and 60 percent of its Medicaid savings will fall beyond a possible second Clinton term in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Second, while Clinton claims his budget balances according to Congressional Budget Office assumptions, it does not. Clinton makes his job of balancing the budget in FY 2002 easier by challenging or ignoring CBO assumptions</b>.<sup>2</sup>  For instance, CBO currently projects a $228 billion deficit in FY 2002. Clinton, however, reduces that projection to $221 billion by challenging one of CBO's technical assumptions, thereby avoiding the need to cut $7 billion in spending. Also, Clinton's budget uses Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates of proposed spectrum auction proceeds, rather than CBO estimates, to produce an additional $11 billion in deficit reduction in FY 2002 -- again, to avoid having to produce real spending cuts. The Senate Budget Committee reports that if honest accounting methods were used, Clinton's budget would produce a $9 billion deficit in FY 2002, not the balance the Administration claims.
<p>
<b>Modest Tax Cuts, More Tax Increases</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton budget also manipulates its proposed tax cuts in order to avoid having to make tough choices on curbing spending. The budget proposes a meager $98.5 billion in gross tax cuts over seven years, equivalent to returning just 8 cents of every $1,000 in taxes the government expects to collect. The centerpiece of the plan is a tax credit for dependent children that begins at $300 per child and increases to $500 per child in 1999.<sup>3</sup> However, Clinton "sunsets" the child credit after FY 2001, increasing taxes on these families by over $17 billion in 2002 -- the year Clinton promises to balance the budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton budget proposes to generate $59.4 billion in new tax revenues by "cutting corporate tax subsidies, closing loopholes, and improving tax compliance."<sup>4</sup> This amount exceeds the Administration's proposed seven-year savings in Medicaid ($59 billion) and is nearly 50 percent greater than its proposed welfare cuts ($40 billion). These new revenues effectively reduce the net size of the tax cut package to $39 billion, equal to a cut of just 3 cents for every $1,000 taxpayers will send Washington over the next seven years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One of the major contributing factors in the Clinton budget's ability to "balance" the budget in FY 2002 is the temporary nature of the tax cuts combined with the permanent nature of the new tax revenues. The new tax measures purportedly generate $11.9 billion in FY 2002. When this amount is added to the $17 billion tax hike on families resulting from the unseating of the child tax credit, the result is $29 billion in deficit reduction, roughly 15 percent of Clinton's total deficit savings in FY 2002. Again, there is no need to make tough choices on real spending cuts.
<p>

<b>The Failure to Address Exploding Entitlement Growth</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regrettably, Clinton proposes no credible solutions to the serious problems facing the nation's major entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare. The meager savings the Administration proposes to achieve from these programs fall far short of stemming the tide of red ink in the near term -- and far short of the fundamental changes needed to keep these programs from collapsing. The White House has been warned repeatedly of the need to curb runaway entitlements:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;CBO projects that, if nothing is done to slow the overall growth of entitlement programs, they will grow by $465 billion over the next seven years, a 63 percent increase. Worse yet, CBO expects entitlements to consume 57 cents of every dollar spent by the federal government in 2002 -- over 8 cents more than is spent today.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The long-term forecasts reported by the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, headed by Senators Robert Kerry (D-NE) and John Danforth (R-MO, now retired), are even more troubling. These projections suggest that entitlements will become a liability that cannot be sustained by the federal government, by the economy, or by the taxpayers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some examples of the Commission's findings:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Example:</b> "The gap between Federal spending and revenues is growing rapidly. Absent policy changes, entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume almost all Federal revenues in 2010. In 2030, Federal revenues will not even cover entitlement spending."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> "By 2030, unless appropriate policy changes are made in the interim, projected spending for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Federal employee retirement programs alone will consume all tax revenues.... If all other Federal programs (except interest on the national debt) grow no faster than the economy, total Federal outlays would exceed 37 percent of the economy. Today, outlays are 22 percent of the economy.... "<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> "The share of Medicare Part B cost paid by enrollees as monthly premiums has been shrinking since the program began. When the program started, the enrollee and the Federal government had a 50-50 partnership -- each paid 50 percent of the cost. Today, the Federal government pays 70 percent of Part B costs; by 2030 the government's share is projected to increase to 92 percent."<sup>7</sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Entitlements grow as a share of budget. </b>Under the proposed FY 1997 Clinton budget, overall entitlement spending would increase by $365 billion (nearly 50 percent) over the next seven years. While the Clinton plan would slow the aggregate growth rate of these programs to an average of roughly 6 percent per year from a CBO-projected average of 7.2 percent per year, entitlement programs will increase substantially as a share of the overall federal budget. Currently, mandatory programs consume 48.7 cents of every dollar spent by the federal government. The Clinton budget plan would increase the share of federal spending dedicated to these programs to 58.8 cents of every federal dollar by FY 2002.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One reason is Clinton's failure to address significantly the systemic problems within these programs. The other reason is that Clinton's budget plan achieves more than 55 percent of its overall deficit savings from discretionary programs -- which comprise just 36 percent of federal spending. As these annually appropriated programs shrink as a share of total spending, a greater share of the federal budget is consumed by "uncontrolled" entitlement spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Medicare is left at risk.</b> In April 1995, the Medicare Trustees issued a warning that the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund was in severe financial imbalance and that Congress should take "timely action to establish long term financial stability for the program."<sup>8</sup> Indeed, recent figures from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) show that in 1995, the HI program paid out $35.7 million more in benefits than it took in through the HI payroll tax, thus forcing HCFA to reduce the trust fund's accrued balance to pay its bills. This is a sign that the HI trust fund, which is expected to go bankrupt by the year 2002, could face a financial crisis even earlier than has been feared.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these warning signs, the Clinton Administration's Medicare reform proposal falls short of restoring the long-term solvency of the program. Even though the President's budget promises to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $124 billion over the next seven years compared to CBO projections, it provides too few details to justify such claims. The plan purports to allow beneficiaries more choices from the private sector, but it does not replace today's defined benefit program with a defined contribution program that truly gives America's seniors an unprecedented opportunity to choose their own health plan and range of benefits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Furthermore, the President's budget proposal maintains a heavy taxpayer subsidy of Medicare's Part B premiums by requiring beneficiaries to pay only 25 percent of Part B program costs. The original Part B program required beneficiaries to pay premiums which reflected one-half of program costs. Maintaining the taxpayer subsidy at 75 percent means there are not enough incentives to encourage enrollees to compare the costs and benefits of more efficient private alternatives with the costs and benefits of the Part B program. The more the subsidy is reduced, the more level the playing field between private-sector plans and government. The elderly would have incentives to choose more efficient plans in the private sector. The likely result: not just a reduction in the subsidy, but a significant reduction in gross budget outlays for Medicare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>More Medicaid costs are shifted to the states.</b> The Clinton Medicaid reform proposal would exacerbate the crisis facing most state governments: growing Medicaid costs that are siphoning off precious resources from such other priorities such as education, prisons, and infrastructure. Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated that "if no changes are made to current law, the states and the District of Columbia probably will need to raise taxes or cut other spending by $146 billion over seven years in order to meet their mandated obligations."<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton's proposal would control federal Medicaid costs by some $59 billion over seven years by implementing a "per capita cap" on the amount Washington sends to states to provide health care for the poor and elderly. But this purported reform retains Medicaid's existing entitlement structure by maintaining most of the current eligibility requirements in Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Maintaining these federal strings could impose an additional $47.4 billion in Medicaid costs on already financially strapped states.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Limiting federal Medicaid expenditures while increasing the financial exposure of the states is irresponsible. The President's proposal does not allow states the flexibility they need to design benefit packages or other major program parameters. If the federal government is going to cap its Medicaid expenditures, the states must be allowed to establish new benefit packages, provider reimbursement systems, and -- most important -- eligibility criteria. While the Administration's proposal allows for some limited changes in managed care enrollment, it represents a large unfunded mandate to the states because they will not have the freedom to control costs as dictated by the federal per capita caps. The magnitude of an such an unfunded mandate will vary from state to state because of differences in population. However, a large state, such as California, could face additional costs of $4.4 billion from the per capita cap.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Welfare reform ignores the root causes of poverty.</b> The Clinton welfare reform proposal will hardly make a dent in the massive federal welfare system that has cost taxpayers $5.5 trillion since 1965. The federal welfare system is a vast network of 78 interrelated, overlapping, means-tested programs designed to assist poor or low-income Americans. The cost to all levels of government was $350 billion in 1994, with Washington contributing 72 percent. This amounts to $3,400 for every taxpaying household in America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton proposes to trim the welfare state by an unnoticeable $40 billion over the next seven years. Real reform would send programs back to the states with only a few necessary strings attached, but the Clinton plan keeps the existing structure of federal anti-poverty programs and talks vaguely about giving flexibility to the states. Clinton also talks in tough terms about imposing real work requirements on welfare recipients but the reforms drafted by the Administration contain only sham work requirements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The most serious flaw in the Clinton welfare plan is its failure to address one of the major root causes of poverty: illegitimacy. Since 1965, the percentage of children born out of wedlock has grown from 7 percent of all children to 32 percent -- an almost five-fold increase. Rather than deal substantively with this problem, the Clinton plan simply tries to address the symptoms by spending more on job training and child care programs. 
<p>
<b>Spending Initiatives That Outweigh Spending Cuts</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While stating that "government should not do for individuals what they can do for themselves," the Clinton budget outlines a sweeping agenda of spending initiatives in areas such as education, high technology, crime fighting, and the environment. Remarkably, the discussion of this new spending falls under the heading "Spurring Economic Growth," thus confirming the Administration's strange and obsolete notion that directed government spending, not private spending, is the key to creating jobs and economic growth. Nowhere, however, does Clinton's budget provide even a hint of how it intends to achieve the $297 billion in discretionary spending cuts that comprise 55 percent of its deficit reduction plan. These details, presumably, will be outlined in the Administration's full FY 1997 budget, due to be published this month.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton's spending initiatives would add yet another layer of bureaucracy to the hundreds of failed programs currently funded in the federal budget in areas the President claims are priorities. Clinton has an obligation to explain to taxpayers why these hundreds of existing programs have failed, and why they have not been eliminated, before trying to justify pumping even more money into these areas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some of these new spending priorities include:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Job training.</b> The budget proudly states that the Administration has shifted more money into job training programs and would increase funding for Skill Grants for dislocated workers. Yet: 
<p><ul>
<li>The General Accounting Office (GAO) reports that 14 separate federal departments and agencies currently fund some 164 job training programs at a cost to taxpayers of roughly $25 billion per year. Moreover, the few controlled studies that have been conducted show that these programs have little or no success either in putting people to work or in raising their wages.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Education.</b> The Administration claims it has shifted more money to education programs such as Goals 2000 and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program. Now Clinton wants new programs to "connect every classroom to the information super-highway," in addition to expanded work-study for college students, merit scholarships for high school students, and charter schools. Yet: 
<p><ul>
<li>The Department of Education already manages roughly 240 programs, dozens of them targeted to the same students for whom Clinton would create new programs. Indeed, Goals 2000 does little to benefit students; it primarily funds state bureaucracies and duplicates many programs currently operated by the states. Also, many states already are experimenting with reform initiatives such as charter schools and do not need Washington's help. Moreover, there are some 240 programs targeted to "at-risk youth" scattered throughout such agencies as the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Labor. Creating more programs targeted to these young people only adds to the bureaucracy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Science and technology "investments."</b>  The Clinton budget places great emphasis on maintaining Administration's investments in high-technology spending. Yet:
<p><ul>
<li>These myriad "investment" programs have turned out to be little more than expensive corporate welfare. There is evidence to suggest that these programs not only do not create jobs, but actually may induce the recipient corporations to downsize their research and development departments.<sup>11</sup> Many corporations figure there is no reason to fund their own R&D if Washington will pick up the tab for them.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Crime.</b> The Clinton budget "fully funds the President's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) initiative," which the Administration claims will put 100,000 new police officers on the street. Clinton claims this program is responsible for the hiring of 23,000 new policemen to date. Yet:
<p><ul>
<li> The problem with Clinton's promise to put 100,000 new police officers on the street by 2000 is that the math does not work. The 1994 crime bill, which authorized the COPS initiative, provided $8.4 billion in federal funds over six years, enough money either to put only 20,000 permanent new policemen on the street or to pay 100,000 officers less than $15,000 per year. Since police officers make more than the minimum wage, state and local governments that accept these federal funds will have to finance the remaining cost themselves -- a cost that could total $28 billion over six years.<sup>12</sup> Congress would change this program from a matching grant to a simple block grant, allowing local governments to use the funds for other law enforcement-related purposes such as purchasing equipment, paying overtime, and establishing neighborhood programs. Clinton has rejected these reforms, and the reason is obvious: Block granting the funds will not force local governments to pay for Clinton's campaign promises. 
</ul>
<p>

<b>Discretionary Spending "Cuts"</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton FY 1997 budget proposes to spend $111 billion more on discretionary programs than the Balanced Budget Act the President vetoed, while claiming to save $297 billion over seven years from these programs. How can this be true?  The truth is these savings are calculated from the CBO "baseline," which projects higher spending on discretionary programs in future years. Thus, simply freezing aggregate spending on these programs at FY 1995 levels "saves" $258 billion over seven years. The roughly $40 billion in additional "savings" (bringing the total to $297 billion) is due to Clinton's proposal to spend less in future years, below what was spent in 1995. However, the Clinton budget would implement 95 percent of these cuts in FY 2001 and FY 2002, thus leaving the tough decisions to a future President and Congress.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The era of big government is far from over. The Administration's repeated use of gimmicks and accounting ploys to "balance the budget" casts doubt on its sincerity in negotiating a balanced budget plan with Congress. At every turn, Clinton fought attempts to cut spending, or even to reduce the growth in spending. Clinton challenged CBO's conservative economic assumptions because they required greater savings to balance the budget. In other words, he wanted more money for favored programs while claiming to support a balanced budget. Clinton repeatedly called on Congress to reduce the size of the BBA's tax cut package, not because eliminating the tax cuts would balance the budget any faster (say in five years rather than seven), but because smaller tax cuts would allow more money for government spending. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

<p>
	Consolidating federal job training programs and giving the funds to the states in the form of block grants is a major part of the Senate welfare reform debate. Because statistics indicate that more education leads to better-paying jobs, Congress and others assume that job training programs work. Unfortunately, they don't. Rather than focusing on who should have responsibility for job training programs, Congress must ask itself a fundamental question:  Why should we continue to spend taxpayer money on programs that don't work? 
<p>
	Job training programs, although well-intentioned, have not proven effective in raising the long-term hourly earnings of participants. They do not achieve this primary goal -- better-paying jobs -- because there is little, if anything, the government can do to alter the effect of neglecting the first 12 years of school.1 What is needed are more fundamental changes aimed at reducing illegitimacy and encouraging individuals to complete high school. Welfare reform that focuses on these two goals will reduce the demand for government job training programs that do not work.<p>	After 30 years, thousands of local job training programs, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, only a few dozen job training programs have been subject to rigorous evaluation. The few rigorous studies that have been conducted generally fail to show that job training significantly increases long-term hourly earnings. Process-based performance measures traditionally have been the easier, but inappropriate, method for determining whether these programs work. But performance measures can be manipulated easily to explain away poor results by those with an interest in holding on to federal job training money. If federal funding for job training is to continue, rigorous control group studies of these programs must be required.2 Without these studies, American taxpayers will never know whether they are funding effective programs or just throwing good money after bad. 
<p>

<b>FEW STUDIES AND DISMAL RESULTS</b>
<p>
	Federal and state job training programs are intended to enable participants to build productive skills that will provide them with higher real wages. Only a few job training programs have ever been subject to rigorous evaluations, and the results show a record of failure.3 As a report from the Secretary of Labor points out, "there are many areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is available."4  The few solid studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant increase in the hourly earnings of participants directly related to job training.<p>A national controlled scientific study of the Title II-A programs of the Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) reported these dismal findings:5<P><ul><li>	The program had no statistically significant effect on either the average earnings of young females or their employment.

<li>	The program had a large (7.9 percent) negative effect on the earnings of young males and no effect on their employment.

<li>	The program had no statistically significant effect on the average earnings of adult men.

<li>	Although the overall program had a small (3.4 percent) effect on the average hourly wage of adult women, classroom training did not have any statistically significant effect. Further, training for those adult women that received welfare or were high school dropouts had no statistically significant effect on earnings.

<li>	Immediate placement in a job did have a small effect on earnings, but not on higher hourly wages. The increase in earnings was due primarily to working more hours rather than to higher hourly wages.
</ul><p>
Further, in 1991 the General Accounting Office found that the majority of service delivery areas underreported administrative expenditures, resulting in a misrepresentation of program costs and amounting to a circumvention of the statutory limitation placed on administrative costs.6 <p>A controlled scientific study of the Summer Training and Employment Program (STEP) reported these disappointing findings:7<p><ul><li>	After two to three years, STEP graduates did not have higher graduation rates or grades than the control group.	<li>Graduates of STEP were no more likely to be working than the control group.</ul><p>A scientific control group study of the Job Corps, one of the most expensive job training programs, has never been conducted. However, a 1982 quasi-experimental study found these results:8  <p><ul><li>	Job Corps did not significantly help single mothers (the largest number of welfare recipients).<li>	Job Corps did not affect the overall arrest rate.<li>	Further, a report by the Department of Labor's Inspector General found that only 17 percent of the Job Corps funding went to educational and vocational training, compared to 26 percent for administration.9 A study by the General Accounting Office also raised "serious concerns about the validity of job placement information."10  The GAO was unable to verify job placement for 15 percent of their Job Corps sample. After 30 years and billions of dollars spent, this program has never been subject to rigorous evaluation and only recently has begun to determine the employment status of Job Corps students.11</ul><p>A controlled scientific study of the Jobstart program also reported disappointing findings:12<p><ul><li>	There was no significant increase in overall employment or earnings for the total four-year study period or for any individual year.

<li>	The program did not reduce welfare receipt.

<li>	Jobstart did not affect overall arrest rates. 
</ul><p>
A controlled study of the Teenage Parent Demonstration program reported only very small improvements in earnings:13<P><ul><li>	This demonstration project clearly indicates there are incentives associated with reducing welfare benefits to single mothers who do not stay in school or get a job. AFDC grants were reduced by $160 for those who chose not to participate.

<li>	However, even this significant penalty increased enrollment in school, job training, or employment by only 13 percentage points and annual earnings by only $300.

<LI>	There was no improvement in the poverty rate for participants.
<p></ul>
Controlled studies of the WIN and JOBS programs reported only very small initial improvements in earnings, and these tend to "fade out" after five years:14<p><ul><li>	The main effect of these programs is to speed up the transition from welfare to work.

<li>	There was only a small increase in average earnings per year, about $300 to $700, and after five years there was no difference in earnings between the control group and the group that participated in the program.

<li>	In most cases the increases in literacy skills and educational attainment did not translate into increased earnings or employment.15</ul><p>A study by the General Accounting Office also found that the Department of Health and Human Services "does not know whether JOBS is reducing welfare dependency because it does not gather enough information on critical program outcomes."16<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	After 30 years, thousands of local job training programs, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, only a few dozen job training programs have been subject to rigorous evaluation. The few studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant long-term increase in hourly earnings directly related to job training. Performance measures and benchmarks are easy but unsatisfactory means of determining whether or not these programs work. They are easily manipulated and explained away. If federal funding for job training is to continue, rigorous control group studies of these programs must be required.
<p>
	One thing is clear from the few studies that have been done:  Government can do little, if anything, to alter the effect of neglecting the first 12 years of school.
<p>
	The billions of dollars spent on government job training and public assistance programs are too much, too late. What is needed are fundamental changes aimed at reducing illegitimacy and encouraging individuals to complete high school. In addition, parents need to make their children stay in school, do their homework, stay out of trouble, and graduate from high school. Welfare reform that focuses on these goals will reduce the demand for expensive government job training programs that do not work.

Backgrounder Update #253<br>
June 16, 1995<br>
<p>
Updating <I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I>, May 1995.<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<P>

 Despite much talk in the Clinton Administration about ending
&quot;corporate welfare,&quot; the Administration actually has
flinched from offering concrete proposals. When President Clinton
released his first Fiscal Year 1996 budget in February, there
were only a handful of proposals to end corporate subsidies. And
when the President unveiled his revised budget blueprint last
week, he recommended only a $25 billion reduction in unspecified
corporate subsidies - and took pride in drawing attention to his
plans to boost spending on two high-technology pork programs slated
for termination by Congress. 
<P>
  The President's weak attack on corporate welfare contrasts sharply
with the way in which Washington policy groups and the new Congress
responded to the Administration's call to trim unnecessary business
subsidies. The Heritage Foundation, along with many other research
organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Progressive Policy
Institute, have reviewed the federal budget and identified dozens
of corporate welfare programs that should be eliminated. In <I>Rolling
Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I>, The Heritage
Foundation identified more than three dozen spending subsidy programs
as corporate welfare that should be reduced or eliminated, producing
more than $100 billion in savings over the next five years. As
the attached table illustrates, many programs were included in
the House and Senate budget proposals, but not in either one of
the President's two budget proposals. 
<P>
 For decades, the federal government has been providing American
businesses with billions of dollars in spending subsidies. These
have been justified by proponents as necessary to enhance U.S.
competitiveness in the world economy, encourage the development
of high technology products and research, maintain a strong national
defense, or assist socially disadvantaged groups. Most of these
spending subsidies are concentrated in three industry groups -
agribusiness, transportation, and energy and natural resources
- to support research, advertising, and other costs of doing business
that achieve these goals.
<P>
 Experience indicates that most spending subsidies for business
do not achieve their goals and are not in America's economic interest.
These subsidies can be expensive and actually hurt the economy.
Subsidizing one business or industry rather than another distorts
private investment decisions, taking resources from more efficient
uses. Over the last ten years, for example, the federal government
has spent, on average, about $14 billion annually subsidizing
production of wheat, corn, cotton, rice, and other commodities.
More than half of farm payments flow to farmers with gross farm
sales in excess of $100,000 annually. This has led to crops being
planted and harvested at great - but subsidized - cost in places
where production is uneconomic. Allowing farmers to make their
production decisions based on market forces rather than government
subsidies would result in a far more efficient farm economy.
<P>
 Some subsidies are just a waste of money, providing little economic
benefit. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is an excellent
example. SBA is supposed to aid the development and expansion
of small businesses through direct and guaranteed low-interest
loans worth more than $11 billion annually. However, SBA's loan
loss rate is greater than that of private lenders, and the U.S.
General Accounting Office (GAO) has questioned whether the SBA's
assistance actually helps stimulate small business development
at all. Other examples of waste include: monies from the $4.6
billion Community Development Block Grant program to pay for swimming
pools, carousel renovations, and other forms of local pork, and
the $17 million spent each year by the U.S. Travel and Tourism
Administration to help the $55 billion tourism industry promote
tourism in the United States.
<P>
 Rather than end corporate welfare, Clinton's budget actually
would add the high technology and information services sectors
to the list of heavily subsidized industries. The nation's economy
has been shifting from manufacturing to a high technology and
information services base. This has been occurring without government
help. But the Clinton Administration wants Congress to enact generous
subsidies to promote high technology products and research. For
example, the President proposes to increase, &quot;by almost $500
million a year by 2002,&quot; the Advanced Technology Program
(ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). In <I>Ending
Corporate Welfare As We Know It</I>, the Cato Institute points
out that in 1994 ATP money went to a number of Fortune 500 firms,
such as AT&amp;T, Shell Petroleum, Inc., Boeing, Inc., and Chevron
Corporation. At the same time the President is proposing to increase
such subsidies, he also is proposing to increase taxes to end
corporate welfare by eliminating a set of still undefined &quot;corporate
loopholes&quot; and &quot;special interest tax breaks.&quot;
<P>
 Spending subsidies too often either enrich those who have already
detected good profit opportunities or direct private capital into
less efficient investments. An example of the latter is the Administration's
support for high speed rail systems. The GAO reported that, without
federal support, such systems are unlikely to be built because
the private sector does not consider them to be financially viable.
The costs of laying one mile of track for a high speed system
can run between $10 million and $20 million. Nevertheless, the
Administration has supported spending as much as $1.3 billion
over five years, even though the American taxpayers might never
see one mile of high speed track. 
<P>
 Taxpayers may recall that programs like this have been proposed
and funded more than once before, only to turn into expensive
white elephants. In the late 1960s, the federal government spent
nearly $1 billion on the Supersonic Transport, which went bankrupt
and never flew a single passenger. In the late 1970s, the federal
government spent more than $2 billion on the Synthetic Fuels Corporation
to produce new forms of energy, but it was shut down without producing
a single kilowatt of power.
<P>
 Only when spending subsidies clearly provide a benefit in the
national interest, such as a strong defense, should they be preserved.
Because it is a legitimate function of the federal government
to provide a national defense, &quot;uneconomic&quot; investments
in the research and development of new defense technology are
justifiable. For example, R&amp;D investments within the Department
of Defense are critical to preserving the nation's security and
cannot be considered corporate welfare - even though they should
be scrutinized carefully for waste. On the other hand, the part
of NASA's budget spent on aeronautical research and development
programs that subsidize R&amp;D for the commercial aircraft industry
should be eliminated.
<P>
 As the House and Senate work on a final budget resolution, lawmakers
must resist the last-minute pressure of corporate special interests,
take a far bolder step than the Clinton Administration, and adopt
the deep cuts in corporate welfare. If Congress does not adopt
the House proposals in the final budget bill, it will show a lack
of will to make even the most basic cuts in spending subsidies,
the true &quot;corporate welfare.&quot; If so, Congress will be
guilty of the same hypocrisy as the Clinton Administration, which
has ignored its own call to end corporate welfare. Congress must
demonstrate evenhandedness in ending wasteful, unnecessary programs
and start making significant cuts in corporate welfare in the
FY 1996 budget.

<P>"The framers of the Constitution were great clockmakers in the science of statecraft, and 
they did, with admirable ingenuity, put together an intricate machine, which promised to 
run indefinitely, and tell the time of the centuries."</P>

<I>--James M. Beck,<BR>
Solicitor General of the United States, 1925-28</I></P>

<P>	<FONT SIZE = "+3">I</FONT>n 1800, when the nation's capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, 
D.C., all of the paperwork and records of the United States government were tightly 
packed into 12 boxes, and then transported the 150 miles to Washington on a horse and 
buggy. That was truly an era of lean and efficient government. </P>
<P>	In the early years of the Republic, government bore no resemblance to the 
colossal empire it has evolved into today. In 1800, the federal government employed 
3,000 people and had a budget of less than $1 million ($100 million in today's dollars). 
That's a far cry from today's federal budget of $1.6 trillion and workforce of 3 million.</P> 
<P>	Since its frugal beginnings, the U.S. federal government has come to subsidize 
everything from research into Belgian endives to maple-syrup production to the 
advertising of McDonald's french fries in Europe and Japan. In a recent moment of high 
drama before the Supreme Court, during oral arguments involving the application of the 
interstate-commerce clause of the Constitution, a bewildered Justice Antonin Scalia 
pressed the solicitor general to name a single activity or program that our modern-day 
Congress might undertake that would fall outside of the bounds of the Constitution. The 
stunned Clinton appointee could not think of one.</P> 
<P>	To win the epic battle over the budget that is now looming on Capitol Hill, this is 
precisely the type of question that fiscal conservatives need to start asking. It is 
instructive that during the entire debate over the controversial 1994 Crime Bill, not a 
single Republican rose up on the House or Senate floor and attacked the $10 billion in 
social spending on the grounds, not that it was wasteful, but that most, if not all, of it is 
simply not the proper responsibility of the federal government. Conservatives should 
have been asking the question: Where is the authority under the Constitution for 
Congress to spend money on midnight basketball, modern-dance classes, self-esteem 
training, and the construction of swimming pools?</P> 
<P>	In other words, fiscal conservatives need to go beyond making the case that 
government wastes money--which it surely does--and start making the case that most 
federal spending today is illegitimate because it lies outside Congress's spending powers 
under the Constitution.</P> 
<P>	The idea is not radical, nor is the strategy futile. For the first 150 years of this 
nation's history, proponents of limited government in Congress and the White House 
routinely argued--with great success--a philosophical case against the creation and 
expansion of federal social-welfare programs.</P>
<P>	There are critical lessons here for Newt Gingrich and his allies in their crusade to 
radically downsize government and topple the "old world order" in Washington. </P>
<P>	The U.S. Constitution is fundamentally a rulebook for government. Its guiding 
principle is the idea that the state is a source of corruptive power and ultimate tyranny. 
Washington's responsibilities were confined to a select few enumerated powers, 
involving mainly protecting the national security of the nation and preserving public 
safety. In the realm of domestic affairs, the Founders foresaw limited federal interference 
in the daily lives of its citizens. The minimal government involvement in the domestic 
economy that was envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution would be financed and 
delivered at the state and local levels. </P>
<P>	The enumerated powers of the federal government to spend money are defined in 
the Constitution under Article I, Section 8. These powers include the right to "establish 
Post Offices and post roads; raise and support Armies; provide and maintain a Navy; 
declare War;" and other activities related mostly to national defense.</P> 
<P>	No matter how long one searches through the Constitution, it is impossible to find 
any language that authorizes at least 90 percent of the civilian programs that Congress 
crams into the federal budget today.</P>
<P>	There is no granting of authority for the federal government to pay money to 
farmers, run the health-care industry, impose wage and price controls, give welfare to the 
poor and unemployed, provide job training, subsidize electricity and telephone service, 
lend money to businesses or foreign governments, or build parking garages, tennis courts, 
and swimming pools. The Founders did not create a Department of Commerce, a 
Department of Education, or a Department of Housing and Urban Development. This was 
no oversight: they simply never imagined that government would take an active role in 
such activities.</P>
<P>	Recognizing the propensity of governments to expand, and, as Jefferson put it, for 
"liberty to yield," the Framers added the Bill of Rights as an extra layer of protection of 
the rights of individuals against the state. The Bill of Rights was inserted to ensure that 
government would never grow so large that it could trample on the individual and 
economic liberties of American citizens. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution states 
the Founders `intentions quite clearly and unambiguously: "The powers not delegated to 
the United States by the Constitution...are reserved to the States respectively, or to the 
people." Such plain language would not seem to be easy to misinterpret. Put simply, if the 
Constitution doesn't specifically permit the federal government to do something, then it 
doesn't have the right to do it.</P>
<P>   The original budget of the U.S. government closely reflected the founder's vision. The 
very first appropriations bill passed by Congress consisted of 111 words--not pages, 
mind you, words. The main expenditures went toward paying the costs of the military, 
including $137,000 for "defraying the expenses" of the Department of War, $190,000 for 
retiring the debt from the Revolutionary War, and $95,000 for "paying the pensions to 
invalids." As for domestic activities, $216,000 was appropriated (or roughly what the 
domestic agencies spend in 15 seconds today!).</P>
<P>	Even expenditures for the most charitable of purposes were routinely spurned as 
illegitimate. In 1794, James Madison wrote disapprovingly of a $15,000 appropriation for 
French refugees: "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution 
which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of 
their constituents." </P>

<P>	This view that Congress should follow the original intent of the Constitution was 
restated even more forcefully on the floor of the House of Representatives two years later 
by William Giles of Virginia, who condemned a relief measure for fire-victims. Giles 
insisted that it was not the purpose nor the right of Congress to "attend to what generosity 
and humanity require, but to what the Constitution and their duty require."</P> 
<P>	
In 1827, the famous Colonel Davy Crockett was elected to the House of 
Representatives. During his first term of office, a $10,000 relief bill for the widow of a 
naval officer was proposed. Colonel Crockett rose in stern opposition and gave the 
following eloquent rebuttal to the bill:</P>

<UL>	"We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to 
lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living. I will not attempt to prove that 
Congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity. Every member 
upon this floor knows it. We have the right as individuals, to give away as much of our 
own money as we please in charity; but as members of Congress we have no right to 
appropriate a dollar of the public money."</UL>
<P>	After he sat down and a vote was taken, instead of unanimous approval as had 
been assumed, the measure failed with only a few votes in support of it. (Legend has it 
that Crockett, one of the poorest members of the House at that time, was the only one to 
contribute substantially to a private charitable fund for the widow.)</P> 
<P>	
In a famous incident in 1854, President Franklin Pierce was pilloried for vetoing 
an extremely popular bill intended to help the mentally ill. The act was championed by 
the renowned 19th-century social reformer Dorothea Dix. In the face of heavy criticism, 
Pierce countered: "I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for public charity." To 
approve such spending, argued Pierce, "would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of 
the Constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the Union of these States 
is founded."</P> 
<P>	Grover Cleveland, the king of the veto, rejected hundreds of congressional 
spending bills during his two terms as President in the late 1800s, because, as he often 
wrote: "I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution." </P>
<P>	Were Jefferson, Madison, Crockett, Pierce, Cleveland, and the countless other 
lawmakers during that age merely hardhearted and uncaring penny pinchers, as the 
federalists often charged? Did they not have within them sympathy for fire victims? Or 
the mentally ill? Or widows? Or impoverished refugees?</P> 
<P>	The answer is of course they were not uncharitable scrooges. They simply felt 
honorbound to uphold the Constitution. They perceived--we now know correctly--that 
once the genie was out of the bottle, it would be impossible to get it back in. Any 
unwarranted government interference, no matter how righteous or well-intended, would 
be, as Madison put it, "but the first link of a long chain of repetitions." Of course, we now 
know just how remarkably prescient Madison and his colleagues were. </P>
<P>	With notable exceptions, through the first 100 years of the Republic, Congress, 
the President, and the Courts remained mostly faithful to the letter and spirit of the 
Constitution with regard to government spending. As economic historian Robert Higgs 
noted in his famous book <I>Crisis and Leviathan</I>, until the 20th century, "government did 
little of much consequence or expense" other than running the military. The total 
expenditures for the federal budget confirm this assessment. Even as late as 1925, the 
federal government was still spending just 4 percent of national output. </P>
<P>	Several major turning points in American history mark the reversal of this ethic of 
extremely judicious use of the government's powers to spend and tax. The first was the 
passage in 1913 of the 16th Amendment, which permitted a federal income tax. This was 
the first major tax that was not levied on a proportional or uniform basis. Hence, it 
allowed Congress a political free ride: It could provide government benefits to many by 
imposing a disproportionately heavy tax burden on the wealthy. </P>
<P>	Prior to enactment of the income tax, Congress's power to spend was held in 
check by its limited power to tax. Throughout the 19th century, most federal revenues 
came from tariffs and land sales. Neither source yielded huge sums. The income tax, 
however, soon became a cash cow for a Congress needing only the feeblest of excuses to 
spend money.</P> 
<P>	The second major event that weakened constitutional protections against big 
government was the ascendancy of Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal agenda to the 
White House during the Great Depression. During this era, one after another 
constitutional safeguards against excessive government were either wholly ignored or 
spectacularly misinterpreted by the Congress and the courts. Most notable and tragic has 
been the perversion of the "general welfare" clause of the constitution. Article I, Section 
8 of the Constitution says:</P>
<UL>	"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and 
excises to pay the debts, provide for the common defense, and promote the general 
welfare of the United States."</UL>
<P>	Since the 1930s, the courts have interpreted this phrase to mean that Congress 
may spend money for any purpose, whether an enumerated power of government or not, 
as long as legislators deem it to be in "the general welfare of the United States." That is, 
this innocent clause has become the equivalent of carte blanche spending authority for 
Congress. </P>
<P>	This was exactly the opposite of what the drafters of the Constitution intended. It 
is almost beyond dispute that the Founders meant the general-welfare clause to be a 
limiting provision on government. They meant that the government's spending and taxing 
powers could only be used for purposes that were in the general welfare of the nation and 
its citizens collectively, not of particular groups of citizens--farmers, students, welfare 
recipients, minorities, the disabled. Jefferson was forever concerned that the general-
welfare clause might be perverted. To clarify its meaning, in 1798 he wrote: "Congress 
has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically 
enumerated." </P>
<P>	In fact, when the early federalists began to argue that the general-welfare clause 
gave Congress a generalized spending authority, they were forcefully rebuked. "Can it be 
conceived that the great and wise men who devised our Constitution," asked South 
Carolina Senator William Drayton in 1828, "should have failed so egregiously as to grant 
a power which rendered restriction upon power practically unavailing?" And then he 
asked the question that is really the essence of the issue: "If Congress can determine what 
constitutes the general welfare and can appropriate money for its advancement, where is 
the limitation to carrying into execution whatever can be effected by money?" </P>
	Exactly.
<P>	By the late 19th century, Congress had adopted the occasional practice of 
enacting spending bills for public charity in the name of "promoting the general welfare." 
These laws often made a mockery of this clause. In 1884, Senator John Morgan of 
Alabama stormed to the Senate floor to describe the impact of a relief bill approved by 
Congress to provide $400,000 of funds for victims of a flood on the Tombigbee River. 
Morgan lamented:</P>
<UL>	"The overflow had passed away before the bill passed Congress, and new crops 
were already growing upon the land. The funds were distributed in the next October and 
November elections upon the highest points of the sand mountains throughout a large 
region where the people wanted what was called `overflow bacon.' I cannot get the 
picture out of my mind. There was the General Welfare of the people invoked and with 
success, to justify this political fraud; the money was voted and the bacon was bought, 
and the politicians went around with their greasy hands distributing it to men who cast 
greasy ballots. And in that way the General Welfare was promoted!"</UL>
<P>	But the real avalanche of such special-interest spending did not start until some 50 
years later in the midst of the Depression. In their urgency to spend public-relief funds to 
combat hard times, legislators began to sound openly contemptuous of the constitutional 
restraints designed to prevent these raids on the public purse. "I have no patience 
whatever with any individual who tries to hide behind the Constitution, when it comes to 
providing foodstuffs for our citizens," argued New York Representative Hamilton Fish in 
support of a 1931 hunger relief bill. "I am going to give the Constitution," said James 
O'Conner, a congressman from Louisiana in that same year, "the flexibility--as will 
enable me to vote for any measure I deem of value to the flesh and blood of my day." </P>
<P>	The tradition of pork-barrel spending began in earnest during this period. In 1931, 
for instance, Congress introduced an act to provide flood relief to farmers in six affected 
states. But by the time the bill made its way through Congress, farmers in 15 states 
became its beneficiaries.</P>
<P>	One Oklahoma congressman succinctly summarized the new beggar-thy-neighbor 
spending ethic that had overtaken Capitol Hill: "I do not believe in this pie business, but 
if we are making a great big pie here--then I want to cut it into enough pieces so that 
Oklahoma will have its piece."</P>
<P>	In 1932, Charles Warren, a former assistant attorney general, wrote a popular 
book entitled <I>Congress as Santa Claus</I>. "If a law to donate aid to any farmer or cattleman 
who has had poor crops or lost his cattle comes within the meaning of the phrase `to 
provide for the General Welfare of the United States,' " he argued, "why should not 
similar gifts be made to grocers, shopkeepers, miners, and other businessmen who have 
made losses through financial depression, or to wage earners out of employment? Why is 
not their prosperity equally within the purview of the General Welfare?" </P>
<P>	Of course, we now know Congress's answer: All of these things are in the 
"general welfare." This is why we now have unemployment compensation, the Small 
Business Administration, the Department of Commerce, food stamps, the black-lung 
program, and on and on. Of course, all of this special interest spending could have 
been--no, should have been--summarily struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. 
But tragically, the Supreme Court eventually served as a willing co-conspirator in these 
spending schemes. </P>
<P>	In a landmark 1936 decision, the Supreme Court inflicted a mortal blow to the 
Constitution by ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was constitutional. The 
court's interpretation of the spending authority of Congress was frightful and fateful. In 
its ruling, the court wrote: "The power of Congress to authorize appropriations of public 
money for public purposes is not limited by the grants of legislative power found in the 
Constitution." </P>
<P>	James M. Beck, the great American legal scholar and former solicitor general, 
likened this astounding assault on the constitution to the Titanic's tragic collision with the 
iceberg. "After the collision," wrote Beck, "which was hardly felt by the steamer at the 
time, the great liner seemed to be intact and unhurt, and continued to move. But a death 
wound had been inflicted under the surface of the water, which poured into the hold of 
the steamer so swiftly that in a few hours the great ship was sunk." </P>
<P>	The New Deal Court essentially told Congress: It doesn't matter what the 
Constitution says or what limits on government it establishes, you are empowered to 
spend money on whatever you please.</P>
<P>   And so Congress does, even to the extent that its profligacy has placed the nation in 
great economic peril. </P>
<P>	Other than the Great Depression, by far the most important events that have 
fostered the growth of government in this century have been the two world wars. Periods 
of national crisis tend to be times where normal constitutional restraints are suspended 
and the nation willingly bands together under government for a national purpose of 
fighting a common enemy.</P>
<P>	Yet the recurring lesson of history is that once government has seized new 
powers, it seldom gives them fully back after the crisis ends. Surely enough, this 
phenomenon is one of Parkinson's famous laws of the public sector:</P>
<UL> 	"Taxes [and spending] become heavier in times of war and should diminish, by 
rights, when the war is over. This is not, however, what happens. Taxes regain their pre-
war level. That is because the level of expenditure rises to meet the wartime level of 
taxation." </UL>
<P>	In the five years prior to World War I, total federal outlays averaged 2 percent of 
GDP. In the five years after the war, they averaged 5 percent of GDP. In the years prior to 
that war the top income tax rate was 7 percent. During the war the tax rate shot up to 70 
percent, which was reduced afterward, but only to 24 percent--or more than three times 
higher than it had originally been. </P>
<P>	Government regulations of the private economy also proliferate during times of 
war and often remain in force afterward. Economist Robert Higgs notes that during 
World War I the federal government nationalized the railroads and the telephone lines, 
requisitioned all ships over 2,500 tons, and regulated food and commodity prices. The 
Lever Act of 1917 gave the government the power to regulate the price and production of 
food, fuels, beverages, and distilled spirits. It is entirely plausible that without the war, 
America would never have suffered through the failed experiment of Prohibition.</P>
<P>	World War II was also the genesis of many modern-day government intrusions--
many of which were and still are of dubious constitutionality. </P>
<P>	These include wage and price controls, conscription (which lasted until the 
1970s), rent control in large cities (which still exists), and, worst of all, federal income-
tax withholding.</P>
<P>	In the post-World War II era, Congress has often relied on a war theme to stretch 
its authority into domestic life. Lyndon Johnson launched the modern welfare state in the 
1960s, when he declared a "war on poverty." In the early 1970s, Richard Nixon imposed 
across-the-board wage and price controls--the ultimate in government command and 
control--as a means of winning the "inflation war." In the late 1970s, Jimmy Carter 
sought to enact a national energy policy with gas rationing and other draconian measures, 
by pleading that the oil crisis had become "the moral equivalent of war." </P>
<P>	While government has clearly been the major beneficiary of national emergency, 
the principal casualty has been liberty. This should give us pause as Congress now sets 
out to solve the health-care crisis, the education crisis, the epidemic of crime, and so 
forth. To Congress, a crisis is an excuse to expand its already near-ubiquitous domain.</P>

<H3>Reinvented Government</H3>
<P>	Shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin was asked how well the Constitution 
would survive the test of time. He responded optimistically that "everything appears to 
promise it will last." Then he added his famous quip, "But in this world nothing is certain 
but death and taxes." </P>
<P>	Ironically, the death wound that has been driven into the Constitution has been 
placed there by precisely those who insist that they want to make it "a living document." 
Yet to argue that we return to the spirit and the true meaning of this "living document" is 
to invite a look of scorn, malice, or outright disbelief from modern-day intellectuals. 
<P>	One is accused of trying to "turn back the clock" when urging that government be 
guided by the original intent of the Constitution. And so few make the case. This, 
ultimately, has left government free to curtail one economic liberty after another. So not 
surprisingly, these liberties have fallen like a row of dominoes. </P>
<P>	It is a strange and sad curiosity that in the entire debate now raging in Washington 
over downsizing government, not a single member of Congress of either party has 
objected to spending on the grounds that "I cannot lay my finger on the article of the 
Constitution which grants a right to Congress to expend money or regulate the economy 
for this purpose." It shows how far we have strayed from constitutional government that 
such a protest is not even bothered with.</P>

<P>	What the Congress needs now is a few Madisons, Jeffersons, Pierces, and 
Crocketts.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A>
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since World War II, Presidents and Members of Congress  have promised
American taxpayers that they would reform, in a  serious way, America's failed
welfare system. The reality, however, is  that the system keeps growing, new
programs are introduced  when earlier reforms do not work, and the level of
spending on  federal and state welfare programs continues to increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is a growing consensus that the current welfare system is  a disaster,
not only for taxpayers who are required to pay ever  larger amounts of money to
maintain and expand the system, but also  for the poor who supposedly are being
helped by it. While liberals  and conservatives agree that the current welfare
system is badly  broken, only conservatives have been prepared to take the steps
 to achieve structural reform  in 1995, liberals actually fought  to block
reform. In the election of 1996, conservative  candidates need to articulate the
clear choice. In particular, they must  remind voters that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>President Clinton promised serious welfare reform, but when  Congress
sent him legislation that would have accomplished this,  he vetoed it.</B>
Welfare reform remains a major domestic issue for  the President and Congress.
While the President promised in 1992  &quot;to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  end welfare as we know it,&quot;
the Clinton Administration's bill  did nothing of the sort. It did not stop
exploding welfare costs. It  did not establish meaningful work requirements. And
it did not  address the persistent problem of additional out-of-wedlock  births
among women who are getting welfare benefits. While  the President's bill
proposed a two-year time limit on welfare, a  reading of the fine print revealed
that it merely placed a few  welfare recipients in government &quot;make work&quot;
jobs while allowing  them to remain on welfare. Moreover, the work requirements
were  truly weak. The bill required only 7 percent of the welfare population  to
enroll in the work program by 1999, and would have  required those enrolled to
work for only 15 hours per week. Worse,  instead of controlling spending, the
Clinton plan would have continued  the automatic and rapid growth of welfare
spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the other hand, Congress passed a serious welfare reform  bill that
establishes serious work requirements, addresses the  problem of illegitimacy,
and slows the growth in federal welfare  spending. The President vetoed this
bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Current welfare costs are rising, and without some fiscal  discipline
imposed by Congress, taxpayers will be saddled with  enormous future tax
burdens.</B>  There are 77 overlapping welfare programs  to assist Americans
officially designated as poor. Total  welfare spending in the United States
exceeds $324 billion, or over  $3,400 for each taxpaying household in the United
States. Of this  spending, 72 percent is federal and 28 percent is state. About
90  percent of all state welfare spending is on federally designed welfare 
programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress strongly support federal welfare  programs, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  defend the current rate of
spending for these programs, and  oppose even modest reductions in the rate of
growth of welfare  spending. At current rates, the United States will be
spending $500 billion  on welfare by 1999, or a full 6 percent of the gross
national  product (GNP). Under current federal spending scenarios, this would 
mean $2 on welfare for every $1 we now spend on national defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Most important, serious welfare reform must address the illegitimacy
crisis.</B> In 1959, 28 percent of poor families with  children were headed by
women. By 1991, 61 percent of poor families  with children were headed by single
women. The illegitimate birth  rate among white high school dropouts is now a
stunning 48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Aside from its relationship to federal welfare policy,  America's overall
rate of illegitimacy is a social catastrophe. The social  science literature on
the subject is unambiguous and  indisputable: Children born out of wedlock do
not have the same chances in  life as do children born into intact two-parent
families. Children  born out of wedlock have lower levels of educational 
achievement, lower economic achievement, increased psychological and  behavioral
problems, and a greater propensity to substance abuse,  juvenile delinquency,
and crime. For the President and Congress,  the key relationship between the
growing problem of illegitimacy  and welfare policy is this: Should illegitimacy
be the basis of a  government entitlement to benefits?  Americans either are or
are not  going to subsidize illegitimacy. There are no compromises on  this
point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Needed: A Serious Policy for Welfare  Reform.</B> In overhauling this
failed system, policymakers should be guided by the  following four themes: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)  Reduce illegitimacy.</B> First, and most important,
welfare  reform must seek to reduce the illegitimate birth rate and promote the 
formation of stable two-parent families. Any &quot;reform&quot; that does  not
dramatically reduce the illegitimate birth rate will not save  money and will
fail to help America's children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  Demand reciprocity and work.</B> Reform must convert  welfare from a
one-way handout into a system of mutual responsibility  in which welfare
recipients are given aid but also are expected  to contribute something to
society for the assistance given. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Get costs under control.</B> Reform must control soaring  welfare
costs, which are slowly bankrupting the nation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Promote moral renewal.</B> Halting the growth of the  underclass
ultimately will require not only welfare reform, but also moral  and cultural
renewal. The government can assist in the process  of moral rebuilding by
allowing private social institutions, such  as churches and other community
institutions, to play a far  greater role in educating and shaping the moral
code of young  people. Among other steps needed to do this, parents must be
given  far greater choice in how their children are educated, including  the
right to use government vouchers to send their children to  religious schools.

<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A> </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Social collapse over the last 30 years has coincided with growth  in the
welfare state. The U.S. welfare system may be defined as  the total set of
government programs, federal and state, explicitly  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  signed to assist poor and
low-income Americans. Current  welfare assistance has three ostensible
objectives: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1) Sustaining</B> living standards through cash and non-cash transfers, 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2) Promoting</B> self-sufficiency, and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3) Aiding </B>economically distressed communities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most welfare programs are individually means-tested.  Means-tested programs
restrict eligibility for benefits to persons with  non-welfare income below a
certain level. Individuals with  non-welfare income above a specified cutoff
level cannot receive aid. Thus,  for example, food stamps and Aid to Families
with Dependent  Children (AFDC) are means-tested, and thus constitute welfare, 
but Social Security benefits are not. Some 94 percent of total  welfare spending
takes the form of means-tested aid given directly to  individuals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other welfare programs are community-targeted or  categorical.
Community-targeted programs provide assistance to  communities which contain a
high percentage of poor and low-income  persons or are economically distressed.
Some 5.2 percent of welfare  spending is directed through programs of this kind.
Pure categorical  programs provide aid to specific disadvantaged or generally 
needy groups, such as migrant farm workers, homeless persons, or  abandoned
children, without a formal means test. Only 1.2 percent  of total welfare
spending is dedicated to simple categorical programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Size of the Welfare System
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government currently runs 77 major interrelated  and overlapping
welfare programs. Many states also operate their  own independent programs. This
federal and state welfare system  now includes cash aid, food, medical aid,
housing aid, energy aid,  jobs and training, targeted and means-tested
education, social  service, and urban and community development programs. A list
of the  80 major federal and state welfare programs covered in this study  is
provided in the Heritage Foundation  monograph<I> America's Failed $5.4
Trillion War on  Poverty</I>.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In 1993, 48 percent of total welfare spending was devoted
to  medical programs. Cash programs took 22.1 percent. Food,  housing, and
energy programs comprised 18.8 percent of the total,  while education aid, job
training, social services, and urban and  community aid accounted for 11.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Total federal and state spending on welfare programs was  $324.3
billion in FY 1993. Of that total, $234.3 billion (72 percent)  came from
federal funding and $90 billion (28 percent) came from  state or local funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Welfare spending is so large it is difficult to comprehend. One  way
to make it more tangible is to recognize that, on average, the  cost of the
welfare system amounted to $3,357 in taxes from  each household that paid
federal income tax in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Federal and state welfare spending is now the third largest  category
of total government spending, ranking below the first  (combined Social Security
and Medicare) and second (total  government spending on general education) but
above the fourth (national  defense).

<P><B>How the Welfare State Has Grown</B><A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#2">2</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the first 150 years of U.S. history, the government played  little role
in welfare.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#3">3</A>  Charity or welfare
was conducted largely by  private religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As late as 1929, before the onset of the Great Depression,  federal, state,
and local welfare expenditures were only $90 million.  Adjusted into 1993
dollars, this would be $813 million.  Public-sector welfare spending in 1929
amounted to $6.68 per person in  1993 dollars. (Unless noted otherwise, all
spending figures in this  section have been adjusted for inflation into constant
1993 dollars.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Charts 1 and 2 show the growth in welfare since 1929. The  Great Depression,
which threw nearly a quarter of the labor force out  of work, led to a dramatic
change in government welfare  spending. Expenditures for work relief welfare
programs such as the  Civilian Conservation Corps, Works Progress
Administration, and  Civil Works Administration grew rapidly. By 1939, welfare
spending  hit a peak of $46.6 billion  compared with less than $1 billion  in
1929 (expressed in 1993 dollars). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In inflation-adjusted terms, welfare spending would not return  to the 1939
peak until the onset of the War on Poverty a  quarter-century later. The major
Great Depression anti-poverty programs  were terminated at the beginning of
World War II. In the post-war  period, welfare spending remained low relative to
the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, total welfare spending by federal, state, and local  governments
was $18.8 billion (in 1993 dollars), less than the cost of  the food stamp
program alone in 1993. During the 1950s and  early 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  1960s, welfare spending grew
slowly, reaching $34.9 billion  in 1964 at the onset of the War on Poverty. In
1964, welfare  absorbed 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) as compared
with  1.1 percent in 1950.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Explosion in Spending.</B> In his 1964 State of the Union  address,
President Lyndon Johnson announced the &quot;War on Poverty.&quot;   New
legislation and spending initiatives began to take effect  by 1965. Between 1965
and 1970, over two dozen separate  federal welfare programs were created.
Eligibility for older  programs, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children
and food  stamps, was expanded. In three years (1965-1968), welfare spending  in
constant dollars more than doubled, rising from $38.3 billion  to $80.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the first decade of the War on Poverty, there was  explosive growth in
all categories of welfare spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1965 and 1975, measured in constant dollars, cash  aid nearly
tripled, social service spending tripled, medical aid  almost quintupled, food
aid did quintuple, housing spending  increased sevenfold, and job training funds
increased fifteenfold. By  1975, total welfare spending had reached $119.4
billion (in  constant 1993 dollars), almost a fivefold increase compared with
1965  levels after adjusting for inflation. While total welfare spending 
absorbed 1.3 percent of GDP in 1965, just ten years later, some  3.8 percent of
the economy was devoted to welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since 1975 welfare spending has continued to grow rapidly,  although not at
the record pace of the 1965-1975 decade. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In constant dollars, federal, state, and local welfare
spending  rose from $158 billion in 1975 to $324 billion in 1993. After 
adjusting for inflation, welfare spending has risen in every year but two  from
1965 to the present.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Welfare spending is now 8.4 times greater than in 1965 when  the War
on Poverty began.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Cash, food, housing, and energy aid are six times greater  today than
when the War on Poverty began. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Charts <a href="welf_1.gif">1</a> and <a href="welf_2.gif">2</a> also belie the political myth that President  Reagan slashed
welfare spending. As the charts clearly show,  welfare spending grew during
Reagan's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-      Total welfare spending was $199 billion in 1980 when 
Ronald Reagan was elected President. By 1988, his last year in  office, welfare
spending reached $230 billion. Cash, food, housing,  and energy spending rose
from $89 billion to $102 billion over  the same period (all figures in constant
1993 dollars). Ronald  Reagan did not reduce welfare spending; he merely slowed
its  explosive growth rate.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Claims that Reagan cut welfare spending utilize the simple trick  of
selecting one or two programs in the list of 80 welfare  programs and
deliberately not counting the rest. By selecting one or two  programs that have
been reduced while ignoring the rapid growth  in the other 78, it is possible to
&quot;prove&quot; in every single year that  welfare has been &quot;slashed&quot;
when in fact aggregate spending  continues to increase.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While Reagan slowed the growth of welfare spending, it  exploded during the
Bush presidency at rates that rivaled those of the  late 1960s. In constant 1993
dollars, total welfare spending rose  from $224 billion in 1988, when Bush was
elected, to $324 billion  in 1993, when Clinton assumed the presidency: a $100
billion  increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending Per Low-Income Person. </B>A second way of  examining the
growth of welfare spending is to compare spending  increases with the growth of
the U.S. population. Chart 3 shows total  welfare spending divided by the number
of persons in the lowest  income quarter of the population. This calculation
provides a  reasonably accurate picture of the level of welfare resources 
available relative to the pool of potential  recipients.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#4">4</A>  Chart 3 reveals a now-familiar
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Welfare spending per low-income person was nearly zero in
 1929 but shot up during the Great Depression, reaching a peak of  $1,419 per
low-income person (in 1993 dollars). After World War  II, spending fell to low
levels and remained relatively constant  until the start of the War on Poverty
in 1965. Between 1965 and  1975, spending exploded, growing from $789 per person
to $2,938  (both figures in 1993 dollars). Spending grew moderately during  the
Carter years, leveling off during the Reagan presidency and  then exploding
again during the Bush era. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     By 1993, total welfare spending per low-income person  reached $5,023.
In constant dollars, this was three times higher than  the peak level in the
Great Depression.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><a href="welf_4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows the same trends in per capita spending but  limits 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  welfare spending figures to cash,
food, housing, and energy  aid. As in the <a href="welf_3.gif">previous chart</a>, welfare spending (in
this case cash,  food, housing, and energy) is divided by the number of persons
in  the lowest income quarter of the population. The chart clearly  rebuts the
claim that the growth in welfare spending has been limited  to medical programs.
The pattern is identical to that of the  previous charts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In constant dollars, welfare spending for the limited
basic  programs peaked during the Great Depression, remained  relatively low and
constant during the 1950s and 1960s, exploded upward  at the onset of the War on
Poverty, and remained in a nearly  vertical climb until the mid-1970s. Spending
leveled off during the  Reagan years and spiked sharply upward again in the late
1980s and  early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     In constant dollars, cash, food, housing, and energy aid per  person
is nearly five times higher today than at the beginning of the  War on Poverty.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Welfare Spending as a Share of GDP. </B>Another way to assess  the
growth in welfare spending is to measure the share of the  total economy which
is absorbed by welfare. Chart 5 shows total  federal, state, and local welfare
spending as a percentage of gross  domestic product. The data match the patterns
shown in Charts  1 through 4.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     During the Great Depression, welfare spending rose to
around  4 percent of GDP, peaking at 4.8 percent in 1939. The growth  of
spending as a share of GDP was driven both by increases in  real spending and by
shrinkage in the size of the economy due to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  Depression. It is also important
to note that most welfare  spending during the Depression was for work relief
programs, such as  the Civilian Conservation Corps, which bear little
resemblance  to most of today's welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     After World War II, welfare spending fell to 0.5 percent of GDP.  It
rose to slightly over 1 percent in 1950 and remained at that  level through the
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     With the onset of the War on Poverty, a massive share of  the economy
was rapidly diverted to welfare programs.  Welfare spending rose to over 4
percent by the mid-1970s. During  the Reagan years, a slowdown in the growth of
spending, coupled  with a growing economy, led to slight declines in welfare as
a share  of GDP. By 1988, welfare spending was 3.75 percent of GDP.  The Bush
era quickly reversed this trend; by 1993, welfare  constituted 5.08 percent of
GDP, a new record level exceeding the  previous peak set during the Great
Depression.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Comparing Welfare with Other Government Programs. 
</B>A final way to assess the growth in welfare spending is to compare it  to
the increase in spending on other government functions (Chart 6). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Since the onset of the War on Poverty, means-tested 
welfare spending by federal, state, and local governments has grown  more
rapidly than spending on all other major government functions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     In 1965, the U.S. spent 17 cents on welfare for each dollar  spent on
national defense. By 1993, this had risen to $1.11 on  welfare for each dollar
spent on defense.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     In 1965, the U.S. spent 29 cents on welfare for every dollar  spent on
primary, secondary, and post-secondary education by all  levels of government.
By 1993, the U.S. spent 91 cents on welfare  for every dollar spent on
education.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#5">5</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In 1965, the U.S. spent 51 cents on welfare for each
dollar  spent on Social Security and Medicare. By 1993, 77 cents was spent  on
welfare for each dollar spent on Social Security and  Medicare.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#6">6</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Even if the analysis is restricted to welfare spending on cash,  food,
housing, and energy programs, the trends are virtually  identical. Since the
beginning of the War on Poverty, means-tested  cash, food, housing, and energy
programs have grown more rapidly  than defense, education, or Social Security.

<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="welf_8.gif">Chart 8</a> also shows, the $5.4 trillion cost of the War on  Poverty nearly
equals the entire cost of the private-sector industrial  and business
infrastructure of the U.S.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#8">8</A>  For
$5.4 trillion one can  purchase every factory, all the manufacturing equipment,
and  every office building in the U.S. With the leftover funds, one could  go on
to purchase every airline, every railroad, every trucking  firm, the entire
commercial maritime fleet, every telephone,  television, and radio company,
every power company, every hotel, and  every retail and wholesale store in the
nation.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#9">9</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is interesting to note the total cost of the many peripheral  programs
which often are ignored in calculating the cost of welfare  or the War on
Poverty. For example, the $172 billion spent on  urban and community development
is nearly enough to buy the  entire plant and equipment of every auto
manufacturer, every airline,  and every trucking company in the U.S. The $445
billion price tag  for job training and social services for low-income Americans
 would purchase all the steel plants, all the factories producing new 
industrial equipment, all the electronics manufacturing plants, and  all the
furniture plants in the U.S., as well as the whole U.S.  commer
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  cial maritime fleet. With the
$440 billion which the  government has spent in housing and energy aid, one
could purchase the  entire U.S. construction industry, all the hotels in the
U.S., and the  entire chemical industry.

<P><B>Impact of the Welfare State on Families and Individuals
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Two Kinds of Poverty.</B> The growth of the welfare state has had  a
huge impact on U.S. society. In order to unravel its  effects, policymakers must
begin by understanding two separate  concepts: &quot;material poverty&quot; and &quot;behavioral
poverty.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Material Poverty.</B> Material poverty means, in the simplest  sense,
having a family income below the official poverty income  threshold, which was
$14,763 for a family of four in 1993. To the  man on the street, to say someone
is poor implies that he is  malnourished, poorly clothed, and living in filthy,
dilapidated, and  overcrowded housing. In reality, there is little material
poverty in  the U.S. as the public generally understands the  term.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#10">10</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1990, after adjusting for inflation, per capita expenditures of  the
lowest income one-fifth of the U.S. population exceeded the  per capita income
of the median American household in  1960.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#11">11</A>  There is little or no
poverty-induced malnutrition in the U.S.  Persons defined as poor by the U.S.
government have almost the  same average consumption of protein, vitamins, and
other nutrients  as persons in the upper middle class.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#12">12</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Children living in poverty today, far from being  malnourished, actually
grow up to be one inch taller and ten pounds heavier  than the average child of
the same age in the general population in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  late 1950s.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#13">13</A>  The principal nutrition-related
problem facing  poor persons in the U.S. today is obesity, not hunger; the poor
have  a higher rate of obesity than do members of other  socioeconomic groups in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, poor Americans have more housing space and are  less likely to be
overcrowded than is the average citizen in  Western Europe.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#14">14</A>  Nearly all of America's poor live
in decent housing  that is reasonably well-maintained. In fact, nearly 40
percent of  the households defined as poor by the U.S. government actually  own
their own homes.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#15">15</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Behavioral Poverty.</B> Behavioral poverty, by contrast, refers to  a
breakdown in the values and conduct which lead to the  formation of healthy
families, stable personalities, and self-sufficiency.  Behavioral poverty
incorporates a cluster of severe social  pathologies, including eroded work
ethic and dependency, lack of  educational aspiration and achievement, inability
or unwillingness  to control one's children, increased single parenthood and 
illegitimacy, criminal activity, and drug and alcohol abuse. While  material
poverty may be rare in the United States, behavioral poverty  is abundant and
growing at an alarming pace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The core dilemma of the welfare state is that prolific spending  intended to
alleviate material poverty has led to a dramatic  increase in behavioral
poverty. In welfare, as in other government  policies, you get what you pay for.
The current welfare system heavily  subsidizes illegitimacy, divorce, and
non-work. The past 25  years have seen dramatic increases in all three
behaviors. The War  on Poverty may have raised the material standard of living
of a  few Americans, but it has done so at the cost of creating whole  com
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  munities where traditional
two-parent families have  vanished, work is rare or nonexistent, and multiple
generations have  grown up dependent on government transfers. The disintegration
of  the family encouraged by the current welfare system has led in turn  to
other severe social problems, particularly a dramatic increase  in crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The anti-marriage and anti-work effects of welfare are simple  and profound.
The current welfare system may be conceptualized  best as a system that offers
each single mother with two children  a &quot;paycheck&quot; of combined
benefits worth an average of  between $8,500 and $15,000, depending on the 
state.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#16">16</A>  The mother has a
contract with the government. She will continue to receive  her &quot;paycheck&quot;
as long as she fulfills two conditions:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Condition #1: She must not work.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Condition #2: She must not marry an employed  male.</B><A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#17">17
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thus, the current welfare system provides heavy incentives  for individuals
to work less or leave the labor force entirely and  rely on the taxpayers for
support. Even worse, welfare has made  marriage economically irrational for most
low-income parents; it  has converted the low-income working husband from a 
necessary breadwinner into a net financial  handicap.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#18">18</A>  It has transformed marriage from
a legal institution designed to protect and  nurture children into an
institution that financially penalizes nearly  all low-income parents who enter
into it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Welfare also engenders long-term inter-generational  dependence. Of the over
4.5 million families currently receiving  assistance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  through Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC),  well over half will remain dependent for over ten
years, many for  15 years or longer.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#19">19</A>
 Moreover, dependence passes between  generations; children raised in families
that receive welfare assistance  are three times more likely to be on welfare
than other children  when they become adults.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#20">20</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This inter-generational dependency is a clear indication that  the welfare
system is failing in its goal to lift the poor from poverty  to self-sufficiency
and is trapping many families in a repeating  cycle of debilitating and
self-destructive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Welfare's Effect on Work</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The growth of the welfare state has coincided with a decline  in labor force
attachment. In 1960, among the lowest income  quintile of the population, nearly
two-thirds of households were headed  by persons who worked.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#21">21</A>  By 1991, this figure had fallen
to  around one-third, and only 11 percent were headed by persons  who worked
full-time throughout the year.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#22">22</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Part of this decline in employment can be attributed to the  increasing
number of retired elderly households in this income group,  but an equally
important factor is the decline in labor force  participation among non-elderly
heads of households.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For a growing number of poor Americans, the existence of  generous welfare
programs makes not working a reasonable  alternative to long-term employment.
During the late 1960s and early  1970s, social scientists at the Office of
Economic Opportunity  (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to
examine the  effect 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  of welfare benefits on work
effort. The longest running and  most comprehensive of these experiments was
conducted between  1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver and became known as the 
Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or  &quot;SIME/DIME.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#23">23</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME  and similar
experiments conducted in other cities would prove  that generous welfare
benefits did not adversely affect work  effort. Instead, the SIME/DIME
experiment found that each $1.00 of  extra welfare given to low-income persons
reduced labor and  earnings by an average of $0.80.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#24">24</A>  The significant anti-work effects
 of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including  married women,
single mothers, and husbands. They were  particularly pronounced among young
unmarried males; the number of  hours worked per week declined 43 percent for
those who remained  unmarried throughout the experiment and 33 percent for those
 who married.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#25">25</A>  The results of
the SIME/DIME study apply directly  to existing welfare programs: Nearly all
have strong anti-work  effects like those studied in this experiment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent research by Dr. June O'Neill of New York's Baruch  College, now
Director of the Congressional Budget Office,  confirms that higher welfare
benefits increase the number of  individuals who leave the labor force and
enroll in welfare. A 50 percent  increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit
levels was  found to lead to a 75 percent increase both in the number of women 
enrolling in AFDC and in the number of years spent on  AFDC.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#26">26</A>  In other words, increases in
benefit value cause a dramatic  expansion in welfare caseloads.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>An extremely important research discovery by O'Neill is that  high 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  AFDC benefits reduce the
employment of young adult men  even though few, if any, of these men benefit
directly from AFDC  payments. High AFDC benefits were found to reduce the 
employment of young adult men in a community by some 50 percent.  High benefit
levels apparently affect the work behavior of young men  in two ways. First,
they reduce the probability of marriage  and thereby reduce the necessity for a
young man to work to support  a family. Second, it is likely that many young
single men who  are boyfriends to single mothers on AFDC indirectly share in 
the mothers' welfare benefits; higher benefits thereby reduce  their need for
work.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#27">27</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Effects of Welfare on Family Structure</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The onset of the War on Poverty coincided with the  disintegration of the
low-income family  the black family in particular. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At the outset of World War II, the black illegitimate birth rate  was
slightly less than 19 percent. Between 1955 and 1965, it  rose slowly from 22
percent in 1955 to 28 percent in 1965.  Beginning in the late 1960s, however,
the rate of black illegitimate births  skyrocketed  reaching 49 percent in 1975
and 69 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If current trends continue, the black illegitimate birth rate  will reach 75
percent within ten years.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#28">28</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Rapid increases in illegitimacy also are occurring among  low-income whites;
the illegitimate birth rate among white high  school dropouts is 48 percent.
Overall, 30 percent of American  children are born to single mothers.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Across the nation, the welfare system has all but destroyed  family
structure in low-income communities. Welfare establishes  strong financial
disincentives which effectively block the formation  of intact two-parent
families. Suppose, for example, that a young  man has fathered a child out of
wedlock with his girlfriend. If  this young father abandons his responsibilities
to the mother and  child, government will step in and support the mother and
child  with welfare. If the mother has a second child out of wedlock, as  is
common, average combined benefits will reach around  $13,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, the young man does what society believes  is morally
correct (marries the mother and takes a job to support  his family), government
policy takes the opposite course.  Welfare benefits are almost completely
eliminated, and if the young  father makes more than a modest salary, the
federal government  begins taking away his income through taxes. The federal
Welfare  Reform Act of 1988 permits the young father to marry the  mother and
join the family to receive welfare, but only as long as he  does not work. Once
he takes a full-time job to support his family,  welfare benefits are eliminated
and the father's earnings are subject  to taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Largely because of welfare, illegitimacy and single  parenthood have become
the conventional &quot;lifestyle option&quot; for raising  children in many
low-income communities. As <I>Washington  Post</I> reporter Leon Dash has shown
in his  book<I> When Children Want Children,</I> most unwed teen mothers
conceive and deliver  their babies deliberately rather than  accidentally.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#29">29</A>  While young women do not
necessarily bear unwanted children in order to  reap windfall profits from
welfare, they are very much aware of the  role 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  welfare will play in supporting
them once a child is born. Thus,  the availability of welfare plays an important
role in influencing  a woman's decision to have a child out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Scientific research confirms that welfare benefits to single  mothers
contribute directly to the rise in illegitimate births. Recent  research by Dr.
C.R. Winegarden of the University of Toledo found  that half of the increases in
black illegitimacy in recent decades  could be attributed to the effects of
welfare.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#30">30</A>  Research by  Mikhail
Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University  shows that
childbearing by young unmarried women may increase by  6 percent in response to
a 10 percent increase in monthly  welfare benefits; among blacks, the increase
may be as high as 10  percent.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#31">31</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another study of black Americans by Dr. Mark Fossett and Dr.  Jill Kiecolt
finds that higher welfare benefits lead to lower rates  of marriage and greater
numbers of children living in  single-parent homes: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In general, in the Fossett study, an increase of roughly $100 in  the
average monthly AFDC benefit per recipient child was found  to lead to a drop of
more than 15 percent in births within  wedlock among black women ages 20 to 24.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#32">32</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the  University of
Washington shows that an increase of roughly $200  per month in welfare benefits
per family causes the teenage  illegitimate birth rate in a state to increase by
150  percent.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#33">33</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dr. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding constant  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  wide range of other variables
such as income, parental  education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50
percent increase in  the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits leads to
a 43  percent increase in out-of-wedlock births.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Research by Dr. Martha Ozawa of Washington University in  St. Louis shows
somewhat lower but still strong effects: An  increase in AFDC benefit levels of
$100 per child per month leads  to roughly a 30 percent increase in
out-of-wedlock births to  women age 19 and under.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#35">35</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, high benefits discourage single mothers from  remarrying.
Research by Dr. Robert Hutchens of Cornell University  shows that a 10 percent
increase in AFDC benefits in a state will cause  a decrease in the marriage rate
of all single mothers in the state by  8 percent.<A

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton, at the outset of his presidency, promised &quot;to  end
welfare as we know it.&quot;  Unfortunately, the Administration's  actions and
proposals on welfare contradict the President's  public statements. As recently
as April 1995, President Clinton  stated: &quot;[I]n 1992 I was elected to end
welfare as we know it. That  was part of my New Covenant of opportunity and
responsibility....  And I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform the
country  had ever seen.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#37">37</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Elsewhere, the President has said that &quot;You could not design  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  program that would be too tough
on work for  me.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#38">38</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But the welfare reform bill the President submitted to  Congress had the
following characteristics:
<ul>
<P><li>Virtually no welfare recipient was required to work.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>There were no time limits on welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>Only 7 percent of the AFDC caseload was required to work  even by 1999.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>Even the small number of recipients required to work were  required to do so
only for a few hours per week.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>WORK (the name of the new work program) participants were  to be paid an
effective wage rate of $16.00 per hour.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The bill limited useful work and the filling of government  job openings
with former welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The minimum work requirements were wrongly targeted at  the mothers of
preschool children rather than the mothers of  children at school. (This
provision expanded the welfare system to  provide child care to these mothers of
young children.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The administrative cost alone for running each WORK person  was $4,000.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#39">39</A>
</ul>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President's plan, called the Work and Responsibility Act  of 1994,
turned out to be more public relations than reform; if  enacted, like so many
other welfare reform measures of the past,  it 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  would do nothing but forestall
serious systemic change  of America's welfare system. When the rhetoric is
removed,  the Clinton Administration plan represents little more than a 
continuing rapid expansion of the current destructive  system.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#40">40</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress passed a significant reform of  America's failed welfare
system based on three themes:
</P>
<P>
<ul>
<P><li><b>Reducing</b> the growth of illegitimacy;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li><b>Reducing</b> dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li><b>Limiting</b> the elements of reform in the legislation.
</ul>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among the many elements of reform in the measure, seven  are crucial:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>1) The bill ends the automatic entitlement nature of AFDC  spending, with
states that increase their welfare caseloads no longer  rewarded by an automatic
increase in federal funding. This  change imposes a fundamental fiscal
discipline at the state level that  is essential to real reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>2) The bill establishes a family cap. Mothers already enrolled  in AFDC will
not receive an automatic increase in federal benefits  if they give birth to an
additional child while on welfare.  (However, states will be permitted to enact
legislation to &quot;opt out&quot; of this  requirement.)
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>3) The bill provides a funding mechanism to reward states  which reduce
out-of-wedlock births without increasing abortions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>4) The bill provides $75 million per year for a new block grant  for
abstinence education.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>5) For the first time in the history of AFDC, the bill  establishes serious
work requirements for welfare recipients. Up to 40  percent of the AFDC caseload
will be required to work or become  self-sufficient by the year 2002. Unlike all
previous work  requirements in the AFDC program, those in this legislation are
real.  Recipients who do not obtain private-sector jobs will be required to 
perform community service in exchange for benefits according to a  &quot;pay
after performance&quot; rule. Recipients will not receive benefits  until the
required work has been performed satisfactorily. If they fail  to perform the
required hours of work, benefits will be reduced  pro-rata.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>6) The bill properly recognizes that the goal of workfare is to  reduce
welfare dependence and welfare caseloads, not to  maximize the number of welfare
recipients in make-work public service  jobs. It recognizes that the best road
to self-sufficiency is to reduce  the number of persons who become dependent on
welfare in the  first place. Unlike President Clinton's plan, which rewards
states  for expanding welfare addiction, Congress for the first time focuses  on
rewarding states that reduce the number of individuals who  get hooked on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>7) The bill establishes a firm time limit for receipt of  federal AFDC
funds; an individual may receive federal AFDC aid for  not more than five years.
States may exempt 15 percent of the  AFDC 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  caseload from this limit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President vetoed this welfare reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Tax Relief for Families. </B>In tandem with comprehensive  welfare
reform, Members of Congress have recognized the need to  reward work, especially
among lower and middle-income  families<B>. </B>
</P>
<P>Congress thus enacted a $500-per-child tax credit in its  balanced budget
package. For the average family with two children, that is  a significant break,
as <a href="welf_t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed this legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
</B>The 104th Congress affirmed the continuing expansion of the EITC enacted in 
previous years, passing a budget which would have raised the basic  EITC rate
for a working family with two children from 36 percent  of earnings in 1995 to
40 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress correctly rescinded Clinton's 1993 expansion of  EITC coverage to
individuals who were not parents. Single persons  who work full-time at the
minimum wage automatically have  incomes above the poverty level; expanding the
EITC to include single  persons therefore was both expensive and inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress did change the EITC formula for parents with  children so that the
value of the credit would phase down more quickly  as family earnings rose above
$18,000 per year. However, parents  in this income range also would be eligible
for the new  $500-per-child tax credit. Overall, under the congressional plan,
95  percent of parents with children would see their incomes rise. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->

<P>

<P>President Clinton vetoed these changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Rebuilding the Good Society.</B> The reform of America's  welfare system
should be animated by a broader social vision.  Candidates running for the
presidency and the Congress should be clear,  in this area, about what kind of
society they wish to see for  current and future generations of Americans. This
vision of the better  life should not be confined simply to the need to reform
public  assistance to low-income Americans. It extends to the broader  society.
The chief object of conservative social policy should be  nothing less than the
restoration and support of the traditional  two-parent family. The traditional
family is the foundation of American  society: the principal social institution
by which the work ethic,  self-discipline, intellectual motivation, and moral
character are  passed on to the next generation. When the family is weakened,
the  nation is weakened. (For a discussion of how to make specific changes  to
improve America's social order, see Chapter 6, &quot;Social  Breakdown.&quot;)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For decades the federal government has pursued policies  which promote the
collapse of the family. Vast changes are required in  a wide range of social and
welfare policies. These changes  should include reducing the government's
financial burden on  middle-class families with children; reforming welfare to
control costs  and require work; promoting policies to reduce illegitimacy  and
thereby improve the quality of life for America's children;  reforming divorce
law and strengthening marriage; and revitalizing  the institutions of civil
society.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The traditional family is the original department of health,  education, and
welfare. But for several decades the government has  pursued policies which
discourage marriage and make it difficult  for the traditional family to carry
out its functions. In 1950, the  median family of four paid just 3 percent of
its income to the  federal government in taxes. Today that figure has risen to
24  percent; when state and local taxes are thrown in, the total is even 
higher: 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Welfare to Require Work and Control Costs.</B> A  considerable
portion of those taxes supports a welfare system which,  with its huge costs and
harmful consequences, requires immediate  and drastic reform. Since most of the
funding for the current system  is provided at the federal level, it follows
that the basic structure  of reform should occur at the national level. Reform
should  promote individual responsibility by converting welfare from a  one-way
handout into a system in which recipients are expected to  contribute something
for temporary aid received. In addition, it must  be undergirded by firm
budgetary controls on the growth of  future spending. Welfare bureaucracies are
prolific in inventing new  programs which allegedly promote self-sufficiency but
 accomplish nothing or actually draw more people into dependence.  Without
definite limits on the amount of money flowing into this  system, such
counterproductive &quot;reforms&quot; are difficult to block.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The extraordinary cost of financing the Great Society and the  War on
Poverty has been borne largely by the middle class,  especially parents with
children. In response to this crushing tax  burden, many in the middle class
have delayed marriage and, when  they have married, have put off having
children, reducing the  number 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  of those they do raise.
Ironically, even as it discourages child  rearing by traditional middle-class
families, government  aggressively subsidizes child rearing by never-married
women who  generally are ill-prepared to act as parents. The results of this 
disastrous policy are all too apparent. Any government policy which  places
punitive and crippling financial burdens on traditional  two-parent families
while subsidizing illegitimacy is a recipe for eventual  social collapse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Specific policies needed include the following: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cut taxes on middle-class families with children.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The government must realize that healthy families are the  foundation of a
successful society; it must seek to strengthen marriage  as the crucial
institution in which future generations of  Americans will be raised. The most
obvious step it can take in this regard is  to reduce dramatically the current
crippling tax burden it places  on young working and middle-class parents with
children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $500-per-child tax credit passed by the present Congress  and vetoed by
President Clinton is only a first step. This tax  credit should be enacted now
and followed in the near future by  larger tax cuts for families with children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cap the growth of welfare spending. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No matter how frequently policymakers supposedly end  welfare, the costs
continue to rise. Welfare absorbed around 1.5 percent  of GNP when Lyndon
Johnson launched the War on Poverty in  1965; it rose to over 5 percent by 1993.
With a $324 billion price  tag, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  welfare spending now amounts to
$8,300 for each poor person  in the U.S. Worse, Congressional Budget Office
figures show  total welfare costs rising to $500 billion, about 6 percent of
GNP,  by 1999. To the Clinton Administration, ending welfare has  meant spending
even more.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The long history of bogus welfare reforms, all of which  promised to save
money but did not, leads to one obvious conclusion:  The only way to limit the
growth of welfare spending is to do just  that: limit the growth of welfare
spending. The entitlement nature  of federal welfare programs which permits
unlimited  automatic spending increases should be repealed, and the future
growth  of federal means-tested welfare spending (excluding medical  programs)
should be limited to 3 percent per  annum.41  Most non-medical means-tested
programs should be folded into a single  welfare block grant to the states, with
funding permitted to increase  at 3 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By slowing the outpouring from the federal welfare spigot,  this spending
cap would gradually reduce the subsidizing of  dysfunctional behavior:
dependency, non-work, and illegitimacy. It  would send a warning signal to state
welfare bureaucracies, most  of which, cushioned by a steady and increasing flow
of federal  funds, have found no reason to grapple with the tough and 
controversial policies needed to reduce illegitimacy and dependency. With a  cap
on future federal funds, state governments for the first time  would be forced
to adopt innovative and aggressive policies to reduce  the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish serious workfare. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although liberals often talk about requiring welfare recipients  to work,
existing welfare law makes it extremely difficult for  states to require this.
Similarly, the welfare &quot;reforms&quot; proposed by  President Clinton would
have made it impossible for states to  operate efficient work programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should establish serious work requirements for  able-bodied
recipients in federal welfare programs. The key to  successful workfare is the
number of welfare recipients who are required  to participate. Real reform would
require all fathers in the  AFDC-UP program to perform 40 hours of community
service work  per week. It also would require able-bodied single persons in the 
food stamp program to work. Finally, half of all single mothers  on AFDC should
be required to perform community service for  benefits by 1999.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a serious workfare program, recipients would be required  to look for
private-sector jobs. If a recipient cannot find a  private-sector job, he or she
should be required to perform  community service in exchange for welfare
benefits according to a &quot;pay  for performance&quot; rule. Under a &quot;pay
for performance&quot; system,  the recipient would not receive benefits until
the required work  had been performed satisfactorily; if the recipient failed to
perform  the required hours of work, welfare benefits would be reduced 
pro-rata.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of serious workfare is to reduce welfare dependence  and caseloads,
not to maximize the number of recipients in  make-work public service jobs. A
properly designed system must be based  on an understanding that the most
important effect of any work  requirement is to separate recipients who truly
need assistance  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  cause they cannot find employment
from those who do not but  are willing to take a free handout if it is offered.
Thus, a properly  designed workfare program has its greatest impact by 
dramatically shrinking the number of individuals who apply for welfare in  the
first place. Serious workfare recognizes that the best road to  self-sufficiency
is to reduce the number of persons who become  dependent and &quot;get hooked&quot;
on welfare initially.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish sensible workfare priorities. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Workfare programs should be efficient and low cost.  Workfare should be
established first for those who have the least  justification for being out of
the labor force: able-bodied, non-elderly  single persons on welfare, followed
by fathers in two-parent families  on welfare and absent fathers who fail to pay
child  support.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#42">42</A>  After workfare
has been put in operation for the preceding groups,  single mothers on AFDC who
do not have pre-school children should  be required to work.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#43">43</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>High day care expenses mean that putting a single mother with  a young child
to work in a community service program  costs roughly two to three times as much
as requiring a mother with  an older child to work. Because work programs
inevitably  operate within fixed budgets, an emphasis on workfare participation 
by mothers with younger children leads to a sharp reduction in  the total number
of persons who will be required to work. One  little-understood aspect of the
debate is that liberals often attempt  to focus workfare programs on mothers
with very young  children precisely because they understand this quickly soaks
up  available funds and thereby limits the number of recipients required to 
participate. Liberal welfare advocates also try to undermine the  gen
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  eral concept of workfare by
claiming that all workfare  programs cost more than they save; they promote the
least  cost-effective programs (that is, those with a heavy emphasis on mothers 
with young children) precisely for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Around half of AFDC single mothers have no pre-school  children under age
five. Workfare should be imposed on single  mothers with children under age five
only after most mothers with  older children have been required to work.
However, if an  AFDC mother gave birth to another child after her enrollment in 
AFDC, that should not exempt her from work requirements even if  the child is
under age five. This rule is needed to prevent  mothers from having additional
children to escape the work requirement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Recognize the limits of job training. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A perennial panacea in the welfare debate is that education and  job
training will enable single mothers to obtain good jobs and  become
self-sufficient. Unfortunately, despite over three decades of  experience,
government-run training programs have failed to raise  the wage rates of welfare
recipients by more than a tiny amount.  For example, the U.S. Department of
Labor in 1993 completed a  controlled scientific evaluation of its massive Job
Training  Partnership Act (JTPA) program. This evaluation showed that the 
average hourly wage of female trainees was raised by 3.4 percent;  the hourly
wages of males were not increased at  all.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#44">44</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The failure of government training programs is especially  salient given the
very low cognitive ability levels of many welfare  mothers. A recent study by
Child Trends, Inc., finds that mothers in  the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program have  signifi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  cantly lower math and verbal
abilities than other women of  the same ethnic group who are not enrolled in
welfare  programs. When all U.S. women are ranked according to basic math and 
verbal skills, over half of welfare mothers are found to have  cognitive skill
levels placing them in the bottom 20 percent of the  overall population. The
study states: &quot;The average aptitude or  achievement scores of welfare
mothers are significantly below the  mean of even the lowest of the occupational
 classes.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#45">45</A>  Government can do
little if anything to alter these cognitive skill levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The very low cognitive abilities of welfare mothers, coupled  with the
impotence of government educational and training  programs and the cost of child
care, underscore the futility of  reform schemes aimed narrowly at making unwed
mothers employed  and self-sufficient. What is needed is more fundamental change
 aimed at reducing illegitimacy and restoring marriage. To repeat the  basic
historical lesson: Raising children is a difficult and  expensive task which
generally requires the efforts of the mother and  father bound by the commitment
of marriage. It is very difficult for  a single parent to find the time and
emotional resources needed  to raise a child while also working to support the
family. The  importance of marriage and the contribution of both parents is 
intensified in the case of parents with low personal skills and  earning
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The well-being of American children requires policy changes  that not only
will reduce illegitimacy and promote marriage, but  also will encourage
potential parents to defer child-bearing until  both the mother and the father
have acquired the education, job  skills, and personal maturity needed to
support a family and nurture  their children properly. Above all, it is
imperative to eliminate the  wide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  array of programs which subsidize
and encourage young,  poorly educated girls to have children out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Replace food stamps with commodities. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major historic expansion of the welfare state occurred when  the food
stamp program replaced older aid programs which  distributed food commodities
directly to the poor. The current food  stamp program gives individuals food
coupons which they can use  to purchase food in stores. Unlike food commodities,
food  coupons can be sold on the black market and converted into cash. 
Replacing the older food commodities programs with food coupons was  a serious
mistake that further encouraged rapid increases in  welfare dependence and
illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should reverse this mistake. Families on AFDC and  other persons
receiving food stamps (excluding the elderly and  disabled) should be given a
carefully selected basket of food commodities  in lieu of food stamp coupons.
Each basket should be carefully  balanced to provide the proper levels of
proteins, calories,  vitamins, and minerals for the family or individual
receiving aid. This  policy can ensure that no family receiving aid will be
malnourished  or hungry. It also can be operated at a lower cost than the 
current program. Moreover, this policy would eliminate food stamp  fraud by
restricting the beneficiary's ability to sell food stamps on  the black market;
there would be little or no black market for the  donated commodities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More important, replacing food stamps with commodities  would reduce
dependence and out-of-wedlock births by reducing  the overall attractiveness of
welfare. Assuming that substituting  food 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  commodities for food stamps would
reduce the consumer  &quot;utility&quot; of food benefits by a third and the &quot;utility&quot;
of the overall  AFDC/food stamp benefit package by 15 percent, it also could 
reduce illegitimate births by more than 5 percent and the AFDC  caseload by over
20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Limit cash benefits to young unmarried mothers. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It has been a tragic mistake for the government to pay money  to 14-year-old
girls on condition that they have children out of  wedlock. The government
should begin to address the  illegitimacy problem by ending its disastrous
policy of giving direct AFDC  and food stamp benefits to unmarried young
mothers. This almost  certainly would lead to a sharp and substantial drop in
illegitimacy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today's welfare system mainly involves failed attempts to pick  up the
pieces for an ever-increasing number of individuals who  have violated the above
rules. But from the perspective of society  and the child, to have a baby you
cannot support either financially  or psychologically is profoundly
irresponsible. Government  policy not only must stop subsidizing and promoting
such  irresponsible behavior, but must actively discourage it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Serious welfare reform must focus on the root behavioral  problems of
illegitimacy and divorce, not merely on the superficial  symptom of welfare
dependence. Despite rhetoric pledging to &quot;end  welfare as we know it,&quot;
President Clinton is unwilling to take the  serious steps needed to deal with
the crisis of illegitimacy. The  Clinton Administration seeks to devise schemes
to help individuals  leave welfare rather than to reduce the self-destructive
behavior that  led to dependence in the first place. This approach is
self-deluding.  No 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  array of government programs is
going to make a  20-year-old woman who has had one or two children out of
wedlock  self-sufficient. Nor, despite her best efforts, is that single mother
likely  to be able to provide a truly healthy emotional environment for  her
children as they develop.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By paying young women to have children out of wedlock,  the present welfare
system encourages them in a course of action  that in the long term proves
self-defeating to the mothers and  harmful to both the children and society.
Placing millions of single  mothers in work and training programs will have
little positive effect  on society as long as the illegitimate birth rate
remains over 30  percent. Congress must go to the heart of the dependency
problem  by seeking to reduce the number of illegitimate births. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At the same time, government should not abandon all aid to  children born
out of wedlock; federal AFDC and food stamp  funds currently given directly to
unwed mothers under age 21 should  be converted into block grants to the states.
State governments  could use the funds to develop innovative policies for
assisting  teenagers who continue to have children out of wedlock. Such policies
 could include providing in-kind benefits, promoting adoption and  orphanages,
or supporting the mothers in tightly supervised  group homes; but federal funds
should no longer be used to provide  direct cash welfare benefits to teen
mothers. The limitation on  benefits should apply to all children born to unwed
mothers age  21 and under one year or more after the date of enactment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Do not provide increased AFDC and food stamp benefits to  mothers who
bear additional children while already enrolled in  the AFDC program. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 --></B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the current welfare system, if a mother enrolled in  AFDC bears
additional children, she receives an automatic increase  in AFDC and food stamp
benefits. No other family in America  receives an automatic increase in its
income by having more  children. There is no reason to provide expanded welfare
benefits  to single mothers who have additional illegitimate children  while
already dependent on welfare. A limitation of this sort already  has been put
into effect in the state of New Jersey by Democratic  Assemblyman Wayne Bryant.
Evidence from controlled  scientific experiments designed to determine its
effects show a 10  percent decrease in illegitimate births to mothers on AFDC as
a result  of the family cap.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#46">46
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require the establishment of paternity for children  receiving AFDC. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Current law requires that an AFDC mother make a &quot;good  faith&quot;
effort to identify the father of her child in order to receive  AFDC. This law
is ignored. The government should require, for  children born prospectively,
that the mother identify the father in order  to receive any federally funded
welfare aid.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#47">47</A>  Exceptions to this
 rule in a few hardship cases could be made, but they should not  exceed 10
percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Modern DNA testing permits determination of a child's real  father with
absolute confidence. Once the mother has identified the  father and paternity
has been established, the father can be required  to pay child support to offset
welfare costs. If the father claims  he cannot pay any child support because he
cannot find a job,  the government may require that he perform community service
 to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  fulfill his obligation.
Experiments with this approach in  Wisconsin have led to surprising increases in
the ability of absent fathers  to locate private-sector employment and pay child
support.  Moreover, the definite expectation among young men that they will  be
identified and required to pay child support for their children  may put an end
to the ethos in some communities where young  men assert their masculinity by
fathering children they have no  intention of supporting.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Encourage state-based &quot;faith and families&quot; programs. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The &quot;faith and families&quot; program created by Mississippi  Governor
Kirk Fordice is one of the most innovative and interesting  welfare reforms in
the U.S. today. This program seeks to link single  mothers on AFDC with church
congregations throughout the state,  placing at least one welfare family under
the tutelage of each  church. The congregation effectively becomes the case
worker for the  welfare mother, providing mentoring, moral authority, life
skills  training, and contact with employment opportunities. The  recipient
continues to receive her welfare check from the government  bureaucracy, but
most other aspects of managing the case are  under church control. The program
also is voluntary in that any  recipient can choose to have her case handled by
welfare bureaucrats  rather than a church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Striking a theme which would have been common in earlier  generations but
has been painfully absent in American discourse  for over half a century,
Governor Fordice has declared that &quot;God,  not government, will be the
savior of welfare recipients.&quot;  This  new policy should be copied in other
states.

their children?

<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Nothing punishes single parents and their children more  than the
current welfare system. For millions of children and their  parents, this system
is the proverbial free ticket to a bus going  nowhere. The reason: It is riddled
with perverse incentives that  discourage work and marriage while encouraging
illegitimate  birth and long-term dependency. Precisely because single-parent 
family life is much harder on the children, as well as their mothers and  the
broader society, it is no kindness for government to make  either single
parenthood or long-term dependency easier and more  common. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given the perverse incentives of the system, millions of  parents and their
children cannot escape to a better life, but will be  locked instead into more
of the same. It is a condition that not only  undermines their upward economic
mobility and eventual  independence, but also robs them of hope for the future
and reinforces  spiritual despair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Conservative welfare reform aims to discourage single  mothers from having
more children out of wedlock while helping  them through the transition to a
life in which it is economically  rational to marry or get a job.

</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives in Congress want to cut welfare?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives in Congress are not proposing to cut  welfare.
Under the Republican proposals aggregate welfare spending  on non-medical
programs will grow at roughly 4 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress generally oppose serious welfare reform  and, as
evidenced during the debate on school lunch programs, do  not even favor
reducing the rate of welfare spending. Total  welfare spending in the United
States is $324 billion, 72 percent of it  federal and 28 percent of it state
spending. Moreover, nine-tenths  of all state welfare spending amounts to a
state contribution to  federal programs. At the current rate of spending,
assuming nothing  is changed, the United States will be spending $500 billion on
 welfare by the year 1999, or 6 percent of the gross national  product (GNP). To
put this in perspective, at the current rate,  taxpayers will be shelling out $2
in welfare spending for every $1 we  now spend on national defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives in Congress simply want to impose some  discipline on welfare
spending, just as they do in other areas of  federal spending. They are prepared
to let already high levels of  welfare spending grow, but only at some
reasonable rate, not at the  explosive rate at which it has been growing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. But didn't conservatives in Congress propose to cut  school lunch and
women, infants, and children (WIC) programs last year?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Congressional appropriators last year attempted to convert  the
federal school lunch and breakfast programs into a block  grant, which would
grow at 4.5 percent per year. Liberals  complained that the original baseline
for growth in the program was 5.1  per
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  cent, and thus that reducing the
growth in spending amounted to  a &quot;cut.&quot;  It is patently dishonest to
call a growth in spending a  cut, but even with this modest change, Congress
still would be  wasting federal funds by providing school lunch subsidies to 
middle-class families and even to the children of millionaires instead of 
targeting them exclusively to poor children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As for WIC, it was not cut. It was folded into a block grant with  a few
other programs. The money available for WIC, like the  money available for
school lunches, was to increase. Incredibly, under  the traditional WIC program,
benefits were available to families  earning up to $28,000 per year even though
a family in that  income range pays about $6,000 per year in federal taxes. 
Conservative policy for middle-income families is not to give them welfare 
benefits, but to cut their taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't spending reductions in existing federal welfare  programs and
block grants jeopardize poor families? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Few, if any, welfare programs have operated as expected,  so poor
families have not benefited as expected. The largest  federal program, Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC),  was designed in 1935 to support widows
and orphans. Only 1.5  percent of the beneficiaries today are widows and
orphans. Instead,  AFDC has served as the financial mainstay of single
parenthood  among low-income persons. Likewise, there are nine different federal
 jobs and training programs for low-income persons, costing an  estimated $5.3
billion.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#48">48</A>  After three decades of
federal job  training programs, the wage rates of beneficiaries have hardly been
 affected. A Labor Department study of the impact of the Job  Training
Partnership Act, for example, showed that female  trainees' 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  wages increased by a mere 3.4
percent and that male  trainees' wages did not increase at all. Five recent
scientific studies of  federal jobs programs for poor people showed that none of
 them worked. Few federal jobs programs ever lead to real,  permanent jobs in
the private sector.

they think is best for their  communities, welfare reform can serve low-income
people more  efficiently. States and local communities, working with  dedicated
people in private organizations in these communities, are likely  to have the
best ideas about what works in preventing teen  pregnancy or in setting up day
care and jobs programs to help lift poor  people out of poverty and dependency.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If conservatives want to lift low-income families out of  poverty,
how do they propose to help them?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The best way to keep a mother and her children out of  poverty is
to help make sure they have a working father with a regular  paycheck who comes
home every night. Right now, if a young  man marries the mother of his child and
makes anything over $6.50  per hour, we tax his  income. For persons currently
on welfare,  this does not encourage either marriage or upward economic
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But by making serious tax changes, particularly by giving  low-income
families generous tax relief, a conservative social  policy would reward work,
increase disposable family income, and  help keep families together. Under
Representative Dick Armey's  pro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  posal to replace the current tax
code with a flat tax, for  example, any family of four with an income of $33,000
per year or  less would pay no income tax at all.49  Moreover, by eliminating 
outdated penalties on savings and investment, conservative tax  policies would
stimulate more investment and economic growth,  and thus create more real jobs,
open up new opportunities, and  generate higher wages for family breadwinners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If conservatives in Congress want to help low-income  working
families, why didn't they support President Clinton's family  tax relief
proposal rather than pass a balanced budget plan that  would gut the popular
Earned Income Tax Credit and raise taxes on  families earning less than $30,000?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Even after changing the Earned Income Tax Credit, the  Balanced
Budget Act of 1995, with its $500-per-child tax  credit, would benefit 5.4
million more low-income working families  with children than the Clinton
Administration tax proposal with  its $300-per-child tax credit. In fact, the
congressional proposal,  vetoed by President Clinton, would allow a low-income
family  to take a $500-per-child tax credit first, and then receive the  full
value of the EITC on top of the child credit. Under the  Clinton plan, a
low-income family would have to deduct EITC  benefits from income tax before
taking the less generous $300-per-child  tax credit. Thus, a family with two
children would have to  earn $24,000 a year before becoming eligible for the
Clinton  credit. Worse, because the Clinton tax credit is available only to 
families with children under the age of 13, families are denied tax relief  for
children precisely when the cost of raising them becomes  even more expensive.
Under the Clinton tax credit plan, 2.8  million children in families earning
less than $30,000 per year would  be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  denied eligibility for tax
relief. Under the congressional plan,  a family would be eligible for a more
generous tax credit at  roughly $17,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What steps can the government take to reduce illegitimacy?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> First, unlike age, disability, or veterans status,  illegitimacy
should not be the basis of a legal entitlement to a  government check. Unwed
mothers can and should be assisted in other  ways, including the establishment
of group homes for unwed mothers  or maternity homes. Young men and women may be
entitled to  a mistake, but taxpayers cannot afford to subsidize further 
mistakes through automatic increases in benefits to women who continue  to have
additional children while on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, sexual abstinence programs should be incorporated  into welfare
reform measures, particularly at the state level. The  data show that such
programs work,<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#50">50</A> much as the Just
Say No  campaigns against illegal drugs in the 1980s worked. Teenagers are  not
stupid. They can see the difference between a young man's  lifelong commitment
to the mother and their baby and the  momentary enjoyment of sexual pleasure
with life-changing consequences  and without the commitment of marriage. All the
proposals to  make marriage more attractive also help to reduce illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Third, it is time to get serious about cracking down on  statutory rape. In
a significant percentage of illegitimacy cases, the  mother is well below the
age of consent and the father is in his  mid-twenties. It is past time that such
adult males, taking advantage of  teenage girls, face charges of rape.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Fourth, toughen child support enforcement. Policymakers  should inflict
financial pain on men who sire children and then  abandon the mothers. Men
should be made to take responsibility for  the upbringing of their children.
Tough enforcement of child  support also helps get the message across that the
costs of  illegitimacy must be borne by the father as much as by the child and
mother.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. But don't congressional conservatives want to consign  poor children
to orphanages?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> For neglected, unwanted, or physically or sexually abused 
children, state or local authorities might determine that an  orphanage is not
an unreasonable solution. In some cases, it is the only  viable option. And,
regardless of the negative images conjured up by  liberal opponents, sound
policy should include this possibility.  While Hillary Rodham Clinton ridiculed
the concept as &quot;absurd,&quot;  under persistent questioning from
Representative Bill Archer of  Texas, Chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, HHS  Secretary Donna Shalala admitted that even under the Clinton 
Administration welfare plan, orphanages would be an option. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't conservatives expecting too much of private  charities when
the government cuts back on the spending increases in  social services? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. First, under real welfare reform, with new 
incentives to work and get off the welfare rolls, there will be a drop in  the
welfare rolls even as there is a simultaneous increase in total  welfare
spending. In other words, there will be more money,  rather than less, for those
in need. Second, under the congressional  block grant approach, state and local
governments will work  directly 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  with local charitable
organizations, not only to provide social  services, but also to help poor
people become self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>After decades of painful experience, Congress and the federal  bureaucracy
must admit that neither they nor the programs they  have designed over the past
half century have been effective in  reducing the welfare rolls, curbing
illegitimacy, or making  low-income Americans economically independent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Beyond the promise of welfare reform, Congress can assist  private charities
even more directly in helping the poor. Senator  Daniel Coats (R-IN), for
example, has introduced a bill that would allow  a tax credit of as much as
$1,000 for donations to charities that  directly help the needy poor. This will
increase the ability of  charities to help these people.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't conservative cuts in social programs increase the  number of
hungry children?  HHS says that over 1 million people will  be thrown into
poverty. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The HHS study is flawed. It assumes that the conservative 
congressional reforms, just like the several previous  and  notoriously
unsuccessful  liberal attempts to &quot;end welfare as we know  it,&quot; will
fail and that welfare rolls will continue to increase at about  3 percent per
annum. But there are dramatic differences, both in  assumptions and in policies,
between liberal and conservative  welfare reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the past, liberals have attempted to make the welfare  system work. For
the future, conservatives want to make welfare  recipients work. Conservative
policies can assume a decrease in the  wel
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  fare rolls precisely because they
introduce serious work  requirements into welfare reform. For example, in
dealing with  married AFDC families, states that have introduced serious work 
requirements for welfare recipients have registered significant drops  in the
welfare rolls ranging from 50 to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In speaking of the HHS study, American Enterprise Institute  Senior Fellow
Ben J. Wattenberg remarked that &quot;The assumptions  of these studies
strangely do not take into account the very purpose  of the bill  to encourage
young people to have children after  marriage, not before, thus sharply
improving children's economic  circumstances. Studies that assume welfare reform
will not work  are the work of those who believe that welfare reform will not 
work. Hence, the studies are useless and  misleading.&quot;<A

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Congress soon will have an opportunity to promote the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The measure to accomplish this task is Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>), sponsored by Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and <a href="http://www.house.gov/talent/welcome.html">James Talent</a> (R-MO). The bill would assist families in areas with high rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and poor schools. Through serious tax incentives and regulatory relief, coupled with innovative school reform pilot projects and home ownership incentives, the bill would achieve:<ul>

<p><li>Increased job creation;

<p><li>Small business expansion and formation;

<p.<li>Moral renewal;

<p><li>Expanded educational opportunities;

<p><li>Greater private philanthropy to aid the poor; and

<p><li>Greater participation by religious organizations in providing services to the poor.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Far too many of America's urban and rural neighborhoods are characterized by large numbers of people in poverty, as well as by juvenile crime, illegitimacy, joblessness, and female-headed households. Because companies are not investing in these areas, local economic growth and opportunity are hampered. And quick-fix short-term solutions, such as raising the minimum wage, do little to help improve the lives of people entangled in a web of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The problems of these communities are related to weaknesses of the local economy and the weakening of the moral and social fabric of the community itself; for policymakers to view the decline of these communities as the result of only one or the other prevents them from bringing about real and sustainable reform. Congress needs to strip away regulatory and institutional barriers that thwart rebuilding the broken lives and economies of these areas. The adoption of a wholly new and comprehensive urban policy of the sort that is embodied in the Saving Our Children bill would help the citizens of these communities achieve a better life for themselves and their children, not just by creating a far more favorable climate for business activity, but also by empowering the citizens of these communities to become active decision makers in their own lives and the lives of their children rather than merely passive subjects of the decisions of inflexible government social service and education bureaucracies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Recent studies have shown that a comprehensive approach to community development is the best way to bring substantive change to distressed and impoverished communities. It also appears that the social programs that work best are community-based. Such local initiatives are the most effective means of attacking the often difficult problems that individuals and families have with joblessness, poor education, crime, drugs, and welfare dependency. For example, a 1989 study reported that 81 percent of families in poverty face multiple obstacles to achieving self-sufficiency.<sup>1</sup>  For many years, government agencies have tended to focus on single issues, such as housing or health. But policymakers increasingly are realizing that a piece-by-piece approach to urban policy is not likely to succeed. As Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros puts it, "We believe the best strategy to community development is a community-driven, comprehensive approach which coordinates economic, physical, environmental, community and human needs."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill gives Congress and the Administration an opportunity to act on this commitment and change the way the federal government has been involved in community development over the last 30 years. By lessening federal regulations and taxes, and increasing parents' freedom to choose schools that reflect their ideals, the communities that need the most assistance can serve as local laboratories of reform, generating ideas and inspiration for various other communities across the nation, as well as for policymakers in Washington.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE SAVING OUR CHILDREN BILL DOES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill has five main elements. The first two apply to the 100 "renewal communities" created by the bill. The remaining three major reforms apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>1. Creation of Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Title I creates up to 100 renewal communities across the nation, based on the degree to which an area is characterized by poverty and distress. Through tax relief, regulatory reform, and savings incentives for Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) recipients, this title would aid the poorest communities in the nation. Specifically, it would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> federal, state, and local tax and regulatory relief through provisions such as 100 percent capital gains tax exclusion on qualified assets held within a renewal community for at least five years.

<p><li><b>Enhance and increase</b> community involvement and ownership, in part through the creation of Family Development Accounts. These accounts would encourage EITC recipients to save money tax-free for certain expenditures such as higher education or buying a home for the first time.

<p><li><b>Improve</b> the delivery of local government services by encouraging privatization and increases in efficiency.

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2. Education Scholarships for Poor Children within Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As a condition of becoming a renewal community, a locality would administer the federally funded Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program established under Title IV of the bill. Low-income parents within the renewal community would be given federally funded scholarships to send their children to primary and secondary schools chosen by the parent. Poor parents would be able to use these scholarships to choose to send their children to a variety of schools, including alternative public schools, private schools, and private religious schools. Because religious schools can play a critical role in rebuilding the moral foundation of America's inner cities, they are included as an essential component of the scholarship program.

<p>
<b>3. Charitable Contribution Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To encourage charitable contributions to private organizations aiding the poor, the bill would create a tax credit that refunds 75 percent of a taxpayer's contribution to any private charity engaged primarily in providing direct services to the poor. The maximum eligible contribution would be $200 for single filers and $400 for joint filers. The credit would be available to all federal income tax filers nationwide, regardless of whether they itemize deductions on their tax returns.
<p>

<b>4. Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Until now, religiously affiliated drug treatment centers have been hampered in their ability to receive funds under the Public Health Service Act. Title III of the bill would amend current law to allow such organizations to receive federal funds for the treatment services they provide without restricting their religious activity. In addition, this section recognizes that religious education and religiously motivated drug treatment personnel can have a vital and important role in effective drug treatment. Thus, it would loosen unnecessary bureaucratic credentialing requirements on treatment staff which may bar religious drug treatment programs from receiving federal drug rehabilitation funds. These provisions would apply nationwide.

<p>
<b>5. Work Opportunity Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
With teenage unemployment at nearly 20 percent, this provision gives employers tax incentives to hire individuals who are welfare recipients or "high-risk" youth, the persons who have a more difficult time securing permanent employment. This tax provision also would apply nationwide.
<p>

<b>CREATING RENEWAL COMMUNITIES</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Title 1, state or local governments would apply to the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) to have certain depressed areas designated as "renewal communities."  Up to 100 such communities would be created nationwide. To qualify under the terms of the bill, the local area must be low income, and local authorities must agree both to ease regulations that impede economic activity and to operate the scholarship program for poor children provided in Title IV. If more than 100 localities applied to become renewal communities, HUD would select the 100 poorest. Upon becoming a renewal community, a locality would receive substantial tax and regulatory relief. Designated renewal communities would retain their status for seven years.
<p>

<b>1) Eligible Areas.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To become one of the 100 renewal communities, a local area would have to be nominated by a state or local government officials and would have to meet the following criteria:
<ul>
<p><li>The locality must be an economically depressed area within a larger city or county.

<p><li>The locality must be characterized by pervasive poverty and distress and entirely located within the jurisdiction of a local government eligible to receive Community Development Block Grant funds (according to Section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974). This means that a renewal community must be a subsection within the jurisdiction of a local government that is itself characterized by poverty and distress, not simply a pocket of poverty within an area of general affluence.

<p><li>The unemployment rate within the locality must be 1 1/2 times the national unemployment rate.

<p><li>Each census tract within the locality must have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent.

<p><li>At least 70 percent of the households within the locality must have incomes below 80 percent of the median income of households within the jurisdiction of local government.

<p><li>The locality must have a continuous boundary and be located within the jurisdiction of one local government.

<p><li>If any part of an area is located within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population greater than 50,000, the minimum population within the renewal community area must be at least 4,000. For all other non-rural and non-MSA areas, the population within the proposed community must be at least 1,000 or located entirely within an Indian Reservation.

<p><li>Ten percent of the renewal communities must be in rural areas. For an area to be considered "rural," it must be within a local government jurisdiction with less than 50,000 people, be outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by the Census bureau, or otherwise be considered rural by the Secretary of HUD.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2) Required Commitments by Local Officials.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For an area to become a renewal community, state and local government officials and representatives of neighborhood organizations must express in writing their commitment to reduce taxes, regulations, and burdens on businesses within the renewal community area in at least five of the following seven ways:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Reduce</b> taxes and fees;

<p><li><b>Increase</b> the level of efficiency of local services;

<p><li><b>Develop and implement</b> crime reduction strategies;

<p><li><b>Streamline</b> government requirements and regulations;

<p><li><b>Foster</b> coordination between and involvement of private organizations and community groups, and encourage such groups to provide jobs and job training, technical, financial, or other assistance to employers, employees, and other residents from the renewal community;<sup>3</sup>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> state or local income tax benefits for fees paid for services, such as trash collection, that formerly were performed by the government but now are privatized; and

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> the donation or sale of land, homes, and commercial/industrial structures to neighborhood organizations, community development corporations, or private companies.
</ul><p>

<b>3) Required Economic Growth Measures.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To establish a renewal community, state and local officials must repeal or suspend government regulations, except for those required to protect health and safety. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>License requirements</b> for occupations that do not require a professional degree;

<P><li><b>Zoning restrictions</b> on home-based businesses that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Permit requirements</b> for street vendors that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Zoning and other restrictions</b> that impede the formation of schools and child care centers; and

<p><li><b>Restrictions on competition</b> for businesses providing public services, such as cable TV, taxicabs, or trash removal.
</ul>
<p>
<b>4) Tax Breaks to Stimulate Jobs in Poor Neighborhoods.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enterprise Zones, if crafted correctly, hold great promise in restoring economic vitality to poor neighborhoods.<sup>4</sup>  Experience with "enterprise zones" has shown that targeted tax relief on business activity in depressed inner city areas over time can cut the unemployment rate in those areas by a third or more.<sup>5</sup>  To create jobs and stimulate business activity in local communities, the Watts-Talent bill will match tax cutting and deregulation at the local level with a sharp reduction in federal taxes within the locality.
<p>
<b>Exclusion from Capital Gains.</b> Once a local area has been designated a renewal community, the bill would reduce federal taxes on private investment in any qualified renewal community enterprise (defined as a business that derives at least 80 percent of its gross income from within the community and has at least 35 percent of its employees living in the renewal community). The tax benefits for investment in qualified businesses within the renewal community area include a 100 percent exclusion of capital gains tax. An individual would not be taxed for any capital gains resulting from the sale of assets of a qualified renewal community enterprise held for more than five years. This exclusion is limited to $100,000 per tax year and a $500,000 total.
<p>
<b>Deduction of Stock Purchases.</b> Individuals in these communities would have the option to deduct certain purchases of stock of qualified renewal community enterprises instead of taking the 100 percent exclusion from capital gains.
<p>
<b>Deduction for Tangible Property.</b> Individuals and businesses in these communities also would have reduced up-front taxation on investments in tangible property within the renewal community. Under current federal income tax law, businesses and individuals may deduct up $17,500 from their federal income tax to cover current year capital investment costs.<sup>6</sup>  Under the Watts-Talent bill, an extra $35,000 could be deducted for investment in renewal community businesses.<sup>7</sup>
i<p>
<b>Tax Credit for Revitalization.</b> To encourage the renovation of decaying buildings that often blight impoverished areas, Section 107 of the bill gives taxpayers a tax credit equal to a percentage of their qualified revitalization expenditures within the renewal community. A person either could receive up front a tax credit of 20 percent of revitalization expenditures for the tax year a revitalized building is completed or could elect to receive a credit of 5 percent each year for ten years, beginning with the year the building is completed. The maximum expenditure for which a taxpayer may receive credit is $10 million. The building may not be a residence and must be located within the renewal community, and the revitalization costs must exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the structure.
<p>
<b>Establishing Family Development Accounts for Renewal Community EITC Recipients.</b> Section 106 of the bill also authorizes the creation of Family Development Accounts (FDAs) designed to encourage low-income families to save a portion of their income or their Earned Income Tax Credit refund. Cash donations would be deductible, even if the individual does not itemize. Withdrawals from these accounts would be tax-free if the money is used for certain specified expenditures. Contributions to FDAs would be limited to the lesser of $2,000 or the total amount of a person's compensation included in gross income for a given tax year. Persons donating to the family accounts of others would be limited to a deduction of $1,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Family Development Account funds can be used tax-free for the following expenses:
<ul>
<p><li>Post-secondary education tuition and expenses;

<p><li>First-home purchasing costs;

<p><li>Business capitalization expenditures, including capital, plant, equipment, working capital, and inventory expenses, with such businesses required to have an approved business plan;

<p><li>Medical expenses not otherwise covered by insurance; and

<p><li>Qualified rollovers which involve paying into another individual's FDA with funds from one's own account.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If an employer paid into a worker's FDA, the employer's contribution also would be counted as compensation. Matches also could be provided by state or local governments, service organizations, corporations, local churches, foundations, or other such organizations.
<p>

<b>5. FDA Matching Fund Program Demonstration Areas. </b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development could select up to 25 communities, with a minimum of two rural areas and based on their relative impoverishment, to serve as demonstration areas for an FDA matching fund program. Within these areas, each qualified individual would have an amount, equal to the amount deposited into the FDA account by the individual, matched by the federal government. This matching amount would be limited to $1,000 each year. The maximum one person could ever receive from the federal government is $2,000.

<p>
<b>6. Community Reinvestment Act.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
To encourage financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities, Section 501 of Title V directs that such efforts be taken into account when assessing an institution's compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 USC 2903).
<p>
<b>7. FDA Application Fees.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
Section 502 waives "application fees" required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a drug developed within a renewal community.

<p>
<b>LOW-INCOME EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In order to become a renewal community, local officials also must agree to operate the bill's Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program for poor children within the community. The program provides federally funded scholarships to enable poor parents to send their children to a broader range of primary and secondary schools. It has two goals:
<ul>
<p><li>GOAL #1: To expand educational opportunity for poor children by giving their parents a broader range of choice in determining where the child goes to school; and
<p><li>GOAL #2: To foster moral renewal in a community by enabling poor parents to send their children to religious schools which teach moral principles and instill virtue as an essential ingredient of education.
</ul><p>
<b>Parental Right of Choice.</b> Parents would be eligible to receive funds under the scholarship program for their children if (a) they live in the designated renewal community; (b) the family income does not exceed 185 percent of the poverty line; and (c) they have elected to participate in the program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Parents of children who received financial assistance under this program would be free to choose from a wide range of types of schools, including alternative public schools, charter schools, private schools, and private religious schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A parent would be able to redeem a scholarship at any private or private religious school within the locality which meets the health and educational standards for private schools within the locality which existed as of January 1, 1996.<sup>8</sup>  All schools which redeemed these special scholarships would be required to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of Section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and not to discriminate on the basis of race.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require renewal communities to give parents timely information to enable them to make informed decisions about the education of their children. At the very least, the information would have to explain the scholarship fund, describe the eligibility requirements and selection procedure, and provide information about alternative public schools and scholarship schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A locality would have to allocate scholarships and transportation aid to eligible parents who apply for aid on a first-come, first-served basis or through another mechanism of selection determined by the locality which does not discriminate on the basis of the type of school selected by the parent. The scholarships are not entitlements.

<p>
<b>Types and Value of Scholarships for Poor Children</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far too many poor children are trapped in poorly performing schools. Funds under the program are intended to broaden the educational choices of poor parents and children within the renewal community. If the parents chose to send their child to an alternative public school where tuition is already paid, under the bill they would receive funds to cover the costs of transportation. If they elected to send their child to a private school, they would receive a scholarship for the child which could be used only to pay for tuition and educational fees at the selected school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each locality would determine the precise monetary value of scholarships for children in their locality. The bill establishes the range of local options, but the maximum value of the scholarship also must not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a public school in the locality. Further, the scholarship must have minimum value, which shall not fall below the lesser of a) 60 percent of the average cost of educating children in the public schools in the locality during the preceding year or b) the normal tuition charged by the private school.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each renewal community would be given a fixed amount each year to pay for scholarships and transportation aid for poor children. If the number of low-income parents who applied for scholarships and or transportation aid was insufficient to utilize all the funds available, any surplus funds could be used to assist in educating low-income children within the community's public schools.
<p>

<b>Poor Parents, Poor Children, and Religious Schools</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Americans are increasingly concerned about the character and quality of the social order, the apparent decline in the culture, and the corrosive influences of that culture on family life and the moral condition of the country. These concerns are common to Americans, regardless of their racial or income group or where they live and work. For a variety of reasons, individuals and families, children especially, are even more vulnerable to social pathologies, including violent crime, illegal drug use, and illegitimacy and family breakdown.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<b>Importance of Religion.</b> A central goal of the  Saving Our Children bill is to foster moral renewal in inner-city communities wracked by crime, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, and family disintegration. The sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is the most important aspect of a child's education and that moral renewal is critical to solving urban social problems. The power of religion to help the poor help themselves is amply documented.<sup>11</sUP>  Investigating the condition of black inner-city youth, Richard Freeman of Harvard University finds that boys who regularly attend church are 50 percent less likely to engage in crime than boys of similar backgrounds who do not attend church; they also are 54 percent less likely to use drugs and 47 percent less likely to drop out of school.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Boys and girls who attend church regularly are two-thirds less likely to engage in sexual activity in their teens. Regular church attendance halves the probability that a woman will have a child out of wedlock.<sup>13</sUP>  Children attending religious schools are two-thirds less likely to drop out than are nearly identical children who attend secular schools.<sup>14</sup>  Children ages 10 to 18 who do not attend church are a third to a half more likely to exhibit anti-social and dysfunctional behavior.<sup>15</sUP>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Social consequences follow from school choice.<sup>16</sup>  The bill therefore helps poor parents give their children a sound moral upbringing by allowing them to use scholarships to send children to religious schools.
<p>
<b>Constitutional Issues.</b> The Supreme Court has held that as long as the parent, not the government, decides where the scholarship will be spent on a child's behalf, public funds can be used for education in a religious institution because the government has neither advanced nor inhibited a particular religion and therefore has not violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.<sup>17</sup>  For example, in the 1986 case of <I>Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,</I> Larry Witters, a blind man, wished to use state vocational funds to attend religious seminary to help him fulfill his personal goal of becoming a minister. The U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that Witters's use of state vocational funds to attend seminary did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Writing for the majority, Justice Thurgood Marshall asserted:
<blockquote>
	It is well settled that the Establishment Clause is not violated every time money previously in the possession of a state is conveyed to a religious institution. For example, a State may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without constitutional barriers.<sup>18</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justice Marshall further argued that it was permissible for Witters to use government vocational funds to attend seminary because the individual, not the government itself, was determining how to allocate the money:
<blockquote>
	Any aid provided under Washington's program that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients. The decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not the state.<sup>19</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, local officials may not prohibit poor parents from using the Watts-Talent scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools and may not discriminate in any way against parents who choose to place their child in a religious school. If provisions of a state constitution prohibit state and local funds from being spent at religious institutions,<sup>20</sup> the renewal community can segregate all federal funds from state funds. But state and local officials may not prevent poor parents from using federal scholarship funds designated for poor children to pay for tuition in religious schools.
<p>

<b>Eligible Schools and Civil Rights Safeguards</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To receive scholarships, a school must comply with relevant anti-discrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and also must satisfy applicable state and local requirements for curriculum and facilities and meet health and safety standards which existed as of January 1996. Schools are ineligible, however, if they advocate criminal behavior or are operated by an organization advocating criminal behavior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The sponsors of the bill are careful to ensure that the scholarships will not become a Trojan horse leading to a government takeover of private or religious schools. The bill includes specific safeguards both to protect private schools which redeem scholarships from government intrusiveness and to protect the liberty of religious schools:
<ul>
<p><li>No additional regulations on burdensome paperwork may be imposed on private schools which redeem scholarships;

<p><li>Private schools redeeming scholarships will not be subject to regulations restricting religious instruction and shall be protected by the rights granted in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993;

<p><li>Any religious school may require its employees to adhere to its religious tenets and moral code of behavior;<sup>21</sup> and

<p><li>Private schools will be permitted to operate as single-sex institutions, or to operate classes separated by gender (Section 409[b][6]).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's language also includes a critical clarification to protect personal and religious liberty: No provision may be construed to give the federal government authority to direct or control the curriculum, administration, or personnel of any private school participating in the scholarship program (Section 410[c]).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require evaluation of the effects of the scholarship program. It authorizes studies comparing the performance of children with similar backgrounds to determine whether those from renewal communities who participate in the scholarship program outperform those who do not. In addition, the authorized studies would examine parental involvement and the degree to which it is improved when parents are able to choose where they send their children to school.

<p>
<b>Targeting Education Funds to Poor Communities</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal scholarship funds would be channeled to renewal communities through two funding tiers, with 80 percent of the funds allocated through the first tier. Under the first tier, the share of federal funds received by a renewal community shall be pro-rated based on the number of school-age children with family incomes below 185 percent of poverty residing in the community, relative to the total number of such low-income children residing in all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twenty percent of scholarship funds must be allocated through the second tier. To encourage private-sector and state and local government contributions to the scholarship program, second tier funds are to be divided according to the level of non-federal financial support given to the program within each locality. The share of these funds given to a specific renewal community would be equal to that community's pro-rated share of non-federal contributions to the scholarship program within all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>

<b>REINFORCING AMERICA'S INDEPENDENT SECTOR</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To an increasing degree, Americans realize that government solutions to poverty enacted during the latter part of this century have failed. Since the beginning of the War on Poverty in 1965, the U.S. has spent $5.4 trillion to aid low-income Americans.<sup>22</sUp>  But in many ways, poor communities are worse off now than when Congress started to establish this vast array of federal social programs over 30 years ago. The following provisions would apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>A Charitable Tax Credit</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Saving Our Children bill creates a new tax credit, intended to encourage Americans to allocate more of their charitable contributions to private organizations that are fighting poverty effectively with low administrative overhead. According to Section 201 of Title II, taxpayers who donate to a qualified charity would receive a 75 percent tax credit for donations up to $200 for single and $400 for joint filers. This credit would be available regardless of whether a taxpayer itemizes deductions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A charity is qualified to receive donations under this provision if its predominant activity is the provision of direct services to individuals whose annual incomes generally do not exceed 185 percent of the official poverty line. A qualified charity must provide direct services to low income persons and may not participate in political activities such as lobbying, litigation on behalf of service recipients, public policy advocacy, public policy research, or voter registration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers, because they are closer to the needs of their communities, are better able to make decisions about where funds should go than are bureaucrats in Washington. They can target funds to programs that work. Giving taxpayers additional means with which to make financial contributions to worthy poverty-fighting organizations would enable them to become more involved in their communities, fostering a greater sense of civic duty and fellowship.
<p>
<b>Using Faith-Based Drug Treatment Centers</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 301 of Title III (Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse: Services Provided through Religious Organizations) applies nationwide. It amends the Public Health Service Act to meet three goals:<ul>

<p><li><b>To permit</b> faith-based substance abuse treatment centers to receive federal assistance and to prohibit discrimination against such centers;

<p><li><b>To make</b> it easier for individuals receiving federally funded drug treatment to select drug treatment therapy that is religious in nature; and

<p><li><b>To protect</b> the rights of individuals receiving drug treatment by ensuring that no individual can be required to receive services from a religious organization and guaranteeing that individuals who do not wish to receive drug treatment services from religious entities must be provided with alternative secular services.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faith-based drug treatment is different from secular treatment in that it encourages a person to look beyond himself for the strength to overcome addiction. That apparently is why faith-based treatment is more effective than secular treatment: Individuals in any religious denomination or group have lower levels of drug use regardless of whether the denomination teaches against the use of alcohol, although denominations that teach against any use of drugs or alcohol exhibit the highest rates of drug avoidance.<sup>23</sup>  Likewise, religion has been shown to be a powerful force in helping alcoholics abstain from alcohol. For over half a century, Alcoholics Anonymous has encouraged participants to invoke a higher power to help them recover from their addiction.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reviewing the religious treatment of addicts, research psychiatrists at the Duke University Department of Psychiatry concluded in 1992 that the "role of religious commitment and religiously oriented treatment programs can be significant factors which ought to be considered and included when planning a mix of appropriate treatment alternatives.... Perhaps the greatest advantage of religious programs is their recourse to churches as a support system.... Religious treatment programs are not suitable for everyone. For those men and women who can accept the creeds, rituals, and commitments required of such programs there seem to be certain advantages."<sup>25</sup>
<p>
<b>Eliminating Discrimination.</b> Under Title III of the bill, religious organizations are eligible to receive program funds and provide drug treatment services on the same basis as any other nonprofit private organization. While religious organizations would be required to meet the general requirements for effective drug treatment, neither the federal government nor any state government receiving federal treatment funds shall discriminate against an organization because of its religious character. Neither the federal nor any state government could interfere with the definition, practice, or expression of an organization's religious beliefs; nor could they require the organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, sacred scripture, or other such symbols. Religious organizations which receive funds under the bill also could require any or all employees to adhere to their organizational religious and moral tenets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the same time, the language of the bill would protect the religious liberty of drug users receiving treatment. Any person who objects to participating in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization shall be given the option of receiving treatment in an alternative program operated by a secular organization.
<p>
<b>Personal Help.</b> States may provide beneficiaries with vouchers that enable them to choose among a wide variety of drug treatment programs under Title III. If a person needing drug treatment is given a voucher or other mode of reimbursement which enables that person to select the treatment program in which he will participate, the drug treatment monies may be used for any religious worship and instruction which is part of the overall drug treatment. This provision is fully in accord with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the religious establishment clause in <I>Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District , Mueller v. Allen, and Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind.</I>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If a person with a drug abuse problem freely elects to participate in a religious drug treatment program rather than secular alternatives, the individual could be required to follow the rules set forth in the program and to participate in any religious practice or instruction that is part of the treatment program. Any individual who does not wish to participate in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization is given the full right to refuse such treatment. Such individuals must be given the option of attending an equivalent alternative secular treatment program.
<p>
<b>Broadening Help for the Addicted.</b> The bill's language also stipulates that state or local governments should recognize that religious education can have a critical role in providing effective drug treatment. In applying education qualifications as a condition for receiving federal funds, state or local governments would have to give credit for religious education that is equivalent to the credit given for secular course-work of similar grade levels and duration. Furthermore, any religious organization which is barred from receipt of federal drug treatment funds by means of education and credentialing standards imposed by state or local government could appeal to the Secretary of Labor to waive such standards. The Secretary must waive the standards if:
<ul>
<p><li>The organization has provided effective drug treatment for at least three years;
<p><li>The Secretary determines the requirements for education and training of personnel effectively bar the organization from receipt of funds; and
<p><li>The state or local government is unable to demonstrate empirically that such qualifications are necessary to have a successful drug treatment program.
<p>
</ul>
<b>CREATING REAL JOBS IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, found in Section 201 of Title II of the bill, is designed to encourage the employment and economic betterment of those whose past makes it difficult for them to secure a job and make a fresh start. The bill would replace the expired Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC). The Work Opportunity Tax Credit offsets the cost of hiring persons who fall into a number of categories, including AFDC or food stamp recipients and their families; economically disadvantaged veterans, ex-felons, and high-risk youth; vocational rehabilitation referrals; and qualified summer youth employees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Employers would be eligible to claim a 35 percent credit on the first $6,000 of first-year wages paid to a qualifying individual (for a maximum credit of $2,100). In the case of certain summer youth, employers could claim a 35 percent credit on $3,000 of wages (for a maximum credit of $1,050).
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has an opportunity to change the direction of American social policy. The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 contains a new comprehensive strategy to help resolve America's urban problems. It assumes that the choices and decisions of low-income Americans who want to help each other and themselves should be respected, is grounded in the experience of local organizations and community groups, and harnesses the initiative and genius of local institutions in an empowerment strategy that can work.
<p>
Specifically:<ul>

<p><li><b>The bill would reduce urban unemployment by reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in inner-city areas.</b> This type of economic policy can reduce unemployment in affected localities by a third or more.

<p><li><b>The bill would expand educational opportunity by providing poor parents with scholarships which could be used to pay for tuition in private schools.</b> By giving poor parents the same sort of choice in education that middle-class families already have, the bill would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education, and reduce the rate of school failure.

<p><li><b>The bill would help churches and religious institutions rebuild the moral foundations of inner cities by allowing poor parents to enroll their children in religious schools.</b> The authors of the bill recognize the simple and uncomplicated truth that the development of a strong moral character, reinforced by religious discipline and the habitual practice of virtue, is the necessary basis for success in school, in work, and in life itself. The church, as an institution, is society's most effective weapon in saving children from alcohol abuse, illegal drugs, violent crime, sexual promiscuity, illegitimacy, and dependence. By allowing inner-city churches, through a school choice program, to play a far greater and more decisive role in shaping the hearts and minds of America's young people, the Saving Our Children bill would be a large step forward in combating the social ills that plague America's inner cities.

<p><li><b>The bill would further encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social service programs to help the poor.</b> It would expand the role of private-sector charity in aiding the poor. Federal, state, and local governments spend nearly $400 billion each year on a wide variety of programs to aid low-income Americans. By a wide margin, the public regards many, if not most, of these government programs as failures. By providing a generous tax credit for individual taxpayer donations to private charities which aid the poor, the Watts-Talent bill would enable the private sector, and religious charities in particular, to bring new and innovative local approaches to the struggle against poverty, drugs, family disintegration, and crime through programs that work and can make a real difference in the lives of young men and women.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comprehensive urban policy embodied in the Saving Our Children bill gives Congress an excellent opportunity to make a bipartisan stand for children. It rejects the premise that all that is needed for our nation's poorest communities are larger benefit checks from the government. It goes beyond simply managing the symptoms of impoverishment to tackle the root causes of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. It establishes the economic conditions which enable depressed communities to become more profitable places for work and business. And it recognizes and harnesses the positive energy of the nation's churches and religious institutions to advance the character and quality of American life.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Stand for Children rally, held in Washington on June 1, called attention to the plight of the nation's children. However, the unstated, underlying goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and implicitly to criticize those in Congress who have sought to reform it. Thus, while the Stand for Children event properly called attention to the disastrous condition of America's children, it is important to recognize that children are suffering precisely because of the governmental policies supported over the last 25 years by the leading organizations promoting the rally.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The simple fact is that children are suffering because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Designed as a system to help children, it has ended up damaging and abusing the very children it was intended to save. The welfare system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. The current system is based on the assumption that higher welfare benefits and expanded welfare eligibility are good for children. According to this theory, welfare reduces poverty, and so will increase children's lifetime well-being and attainment. This is untrue. Higher welfare payments do not help children; they increase dependence and illegitimacy, which have a devastating effect on children's development.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Americans often are told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. This also is untrue.<ul>

<li>The 4.7 million families currently receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) already have spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare.

<li>When past and estimated future receipts of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families currently receiving benefits, is 13 years.

<li>Among the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. More than 75 percent will spend over five years on AFDC.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is welfare dependence, not poverty, that has the most negative effect on children.
Recent research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Welfare dependency as a child has a negative effect on the earnings and employment capacity of young men. The more welfare income received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the boy's earnings will be as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical non-welfare income.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy. Research by CBO Director O'Neill also shows, for example, that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will cause a 43 percent increase in the number of illegitimate births within a state. Illegitimacy, in turn, has an enormous negative effect on children's development and on their behavior as adults. Being born outside of marriage and raised in single parent homes:<ul>
<li>Triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children;

<li>Nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity;

<li>Doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and,

<li>Doubles the probability a boy will become a threat to society, engage in criminal activity, and wind up in jail.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Overall, welfare operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful the child will be as an adult. If America's children are to be saved, the current welfare system must be replaced. The automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. Welfare should no longer be a one-way handout; recipients should be required to work for benefits received. Steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen mothers.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Finally, Americans must help children rise upward out of poverty and despair by enlisting the support of those institutions that have a record of real success. The evidence is clear that religious institutions have enjoyed dramatic success in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. In order to help poor children, America must rely on the healing and guiding force of the churches. This can be done by giving poor parents government-funded education vouchers which could be used to send their children to private schools, including religious schools.
<p>

<b>THE FAILED LIBERAL PARADIGM</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The liberal welfare state is founded on faulty logic. This flawed logic, embedded in nearly all liberal thinking about welfare, runs something like this:<ul>
<li><b>PREMISE #1:</b> Children in families with higher income seem to do better in life.

<li><b>PREMISE #2:</b> Welfare can easily raise family income.

<li><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Welfare is good for kids.</ul>
<p>From this logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The recent reform legislation passed by Congress sought to slow the automatic growth of welfare spending. Thus, it violated the cardinal tenets of the liberal welfare system, leading to cries of alarm from the welfare establishment and a prompt veto by President Bill Clinton.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In fact, each of the central tenets of modern welfare is misleading and deeply flawed. Together, they become a recipe for a disastrous system of aid which harms rather than helps, aggressively crushing the hopes and future of increasing numbers of young Americans. It is useful to examine each of these cardinal liberal tenets individually.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 1: Raising incomes is crucial to the well-being and success of children.</b> The common liberal corollary to this premise is that poverty causes such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, low work ethic and skills, and drug use. Hence, reducing poverty through greater welfare spending will reduce most social problems. History refutes this belief. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If the theory that poverty causes social problems were true, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods then we do today. But crime and most other social problems have increased rather than fallen since these earlier periods.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families, not family income, lead to children's success. Families with higher incomes tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education, and marriage which they pass on to their children. It is those values, rather than the family income, that are key to the children's attainment. Attempting to raise the family income artificially through welfare is very unlikely to do much to benefit the child, but it is likely to destroy the very values that are key to the child's success.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 2: It is very easy to raise family income through welfare.</b> This also is untrue. Because welfare reduces work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent families, it actually may cause an overall decrease in family incomes. Welfare is extremely efficient at replacing self-sufficiency with dependence but relatively ineffective in raising incomes and eliminating poverty.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 3: Higher welfare benefits and broadened eligibility will help children and improve their success in later life.</b> In certain limited cases, such as when it is needed to eliminate serious malnutrition, welfare can help. But there is no evidence that enlarging benefits and expanding enrollments in most U.S. welfare programs will improve children's lives.
<p>
<b>The Truth About Welfare.</b> In contrast to the failed premises of welfare liberalism are the following hard facts about welfare and children:<ul>

<li>Except in very limited cases, such as those involving serious malnutrition, welfare programs do not yield fewer problems and better life outcomes for children.

<li>Welfare programs intended to combat poverty do not help children but do increase welfare dependence, which in turn is very harmful to children's well-being.

<li>Welfare programs intended to raise family incomes do not benefit children but do significantly increase illegitimacy and single-parent families, which in turn have decisively negative effects on children's development.</ul>

<p>Overall, the wider and more generous the welfare "safety net," the greater the problems of dependence and illegitimacy will become, and the greater the harm to children.
<p>


<b>EXAMINING WELFARE'S IMPACT ON CHILDREN</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The available scientific evidence clearly refutes the liberal hypothesis that attempting to raise family income through more generous welfare payments will benefit children. For example, the average monthly value of welfare benefits (AFDC and food stamps combined) varies between states. The conventional liberal assumption is that children on welfare in states with lower benefit levels will be markedly worse off than children in states with higher benefits. Children on AFDC in high-benefit states, according to the theory, should have improved cognitive ability when compared to children without access to more generous welfare. However, research published in 1994 by now-Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill and Anne Hill of Queens College, City University of New York, demonstrates that this theory is incorrect. O'Neill and Hill examined the IQs of young children who were long-term welfare dependents, having spent at least half of their lives on AFDC. Contrary to the expected theory, they found that the higher welfare benefit did not improve children's cognitive performance. The IQs of long-term welfare-dependent children in low-benefit states were not appreciably different from those in high-benefit states.<sup>1</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, this picture is overly optimistic. In restricting the sample to long-term dependent children, the analysis ignores the effects of higher welfare benefits in encouraging welfare enrollment and lengthening the time spent on welfare. O'Neill and Hill have shown that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will lead to a 75 percent increase in the number of mothers with children enrolling in AFDC and a 75 percent increase in the number of years spent on welfare.<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once the effects of increased dependence are included, it becomes clear that higher welfare benefits have a decisively negative effect on children. Comparing children who were identical in social and economic factors such as race, family structure, mothers' IQ and education, family income, and neighborhood residence, Hill and O'Neill found that the more years a child spent on welfare, the lower the child's IQ. The authors make it clear that it is not poverty but welfare itself which has a damaging effect on the child. Examining the young children (with an average age of five-and-a-half), the authors found that those who had spent at least two months of each year since birth on AFDC had cognitive abilities 20 percent below those who had received no welfare, even after holding family income, race, parental IQ, and other variables constant. <sup>4</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	O'Neill and Hill conclude:<p><blockquote>

	Our findings of a negative impact of a welfare environment are particularly troubling. After controlling for the effects of a rich array of characteristics, a mother's long-term welfare participation is associated with a significant reduction in her child's [IQ] score and this effect is reinforced by the mother's having grown up in an underclass neighborhood, defined as one with a high proportion of welfare recipients. Although long-term welfare recipients are generally poor, persistent poverty does not seem to be the main reason for the poor performance of these children. Moreover, our analysis suggests that policies that would raise the income of children on welfare simply by increasing AFDC benefits are not likely to improve cognitive development. Children on welfare in high benefit states do not perform measurably better than their counterparts in low benefit states. <sup>5</sup>
</blockquote><p>
	<b>More Evidence on Welfare's Negative Impact.</b> A similar study by Mary Corcoran and Roger Gordon of the University of Michigan shows that receipt of welfare income has negative effects on the long-term employment and earnings capacity of young boys. The study shows that, holding constant race, parental education, family structure, and a range of other social variables, higher non-welfare income obtained by the family during a boy's childhood was associated with higher earnings when the boy became an adult (over age 25). <sup>6</sup>    However, welfare income had the opposite effect: The more welfare income received by a family while a boy was growing up, the lower the boy's earnings as an adult.1<sup>7</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Typically, liberals would dismiss this finding, arguing that families which receive a lot of welfare payments have lower total incomes than other families in society, and that it is the low overall family income, not welfare, which had a negative effect on the young boys. But the Corcoran and Gordon study compares families whose average non-welfare incomes were identical. In such cases, each extra dollar in welfare represents a net increase in overall financial resources available to the family. This extra income, according to conventional liberal welfare theory, should have positive effects on the well-being of the children. But the study shows that the extra welfare income, even though it produced a net increase in resources available to the family, had a negative impact on the development of young boys within the family. The higher the welfare income received by the family, the lower the earnings obtained by the boys upon reaching adulthood. The study suggests that an increase of $1,000 per year in welfare received by a family decreased a boy's future earnings by as much as 10 percent.<sup>8</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Other studies have confirmed the negative effects of welfare on the development of children. For example, young women raised in families dependent on welfare are two to three times more likely to drop out and fail to graduate from high school than are young women of similar race and socioeconomic background not raised on welfare. <sup>9</sup> Similarly, single mothers raised as children in families receiving welfare remain on AFDC longer as adult parents than do single mothers not raised in welfare families, even when all other social and economic variables are held constant.<sup>10</sup>
<p>

<b>WELFARE PROMOTES ILLEGITIMACY<sup>11</sup></b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The welfare system does added harm to children by promoting illegitimacy. The anti-marriage effects of welfare are simple and profound. The current welfare system may be conceptualized best as a system that offers each single mother with two children a "paycheck" of combined benefits worth an average of between $8,500 and $15,000, depending on the state. <sup>12</sup>  The mother has a contract with the government: She will continue to receive her "paycheck" as long as she does not marry an employed man.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		As long as a father and mother remain unmarried, they may obtain income from two sources: the mother's welfare and the father's earnings. However, if the parents marry they must rely on the father's earnings alone. Welfare thus has made marriage economically irrational for most low-income parents. It has transformed marriage from a legal institution designed to protect and nurture children into an institution that financially penalizes nearly all low-income parents who enter into it.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Similarly, welfare has made it possible to raise a child without either the father or the mother having to hold a job. Welfare thus has made a father with low education and skills at best financially irrelevant -- and at worst a net financial handicap to the mother and the child. Welfare has worked like an acid, slowly corroding the social foundation of marriage in low-income communities. All parties -- the father, the mother, and especially the child -- are damaged by this.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Largely because of welfare, illegitimacy and single parenthood have become the conventional "lifestyle option" for raising children in many low-income communities. As Washington Post reporter Leon Dash has shown in his book When Children Want Children, most unwed teen mothers conceive and deliver their babies deliberately rather than accidentally. <sup>13</sup> While young women do not bear unwanted children in order to reap "windfall profits" from welfare, they are very much aware of the role welfare will play in supporting them once a child is born. Thus, the availability of welfare plays an important role in influencing a woman's decision to have a child out of wedlock.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		In welfare, as in most things in life, you get what you pay for. The current welfare system pays for non-work and non-marriage and has achieved dramatic increases in both. Scientific research confirms that welfare benefits to single mothers contribute directly to the rise in illegitimate births. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births. <sup>14</sup> Other studies showing the effect of welfare in increasing illegitimacy are listed in the appendix to this paper.
<p><b>THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF RISING ILLEGITIMACY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	From the very beginning, children born outside of marriage have life stacked against them. The impact on the child is significant and can be permanent. Out-of-wedlock birth and growing up in a single-parent family means the child is more likely to experience:<ul>

<li>Retarded cognitive (especially verbal) development;

<li>Lower educational achievement;

<li>Lower job attainment;

<li>Increased behavior and emotional problems;

<li>Lower impulse control; and

<li>Retarded social development.
<p>
Such children are far more likely to:
<li>Engage in early sexual activity;

<li>Have children out of wedlock;

<li>Be on welfare as adults; and

<li>Engage in criminal activity.</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The absence of married parents is related to retarded development in early childhood.</b> Illegitimacy leads to delays in development. A study of black infants (aged 5 to 6 months) living in households of lower socioeconomic status in America's inner cities found that male infants who experienced "minimal interaction with their fathers" had significantly lower levels of overall mental development and lower social responsiveness for novel stimuli. <sup>15</sup>  Illegitimate children tend to have lessened cognitive development. <sup>16</sup>  <sup>17</sup> <sup>18</sup>   Many of these children have problems in controlling their activity (popularly called "hyperactivity"). This lack of control usually is an indication of problems in learning that will arise later in the child's development. <sup>19</sup> The effect on boys is greater, at least in the early years. <sup>20</sup> <sup>21</sup>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Similar findings were enumerated again in the recent 1992 National Institute of Child Health and Development summary, "Outcomes of Early Childbearing: An Appraisal of Recent Evidence." <sup>22</sup>  And such findings are in line with earlier studies. For instance, Project TALENT, a federal survey commissioned in 1960, which tracked the development of 375,000 high school students from 1960 through 1971, found that children born outside marriage were likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves. Once again, all of these effects were greater for boys. <sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>	The absence of married parents risks emotional and behavioral problems during childhood.</b> The effects of illegitimacy continue to compound through childhood. The National Health Interview Survey of Child Health (NHIS-CH) confirms that children born out of wedlock have far more behavioral and emotional problems than do children in intact married families. These problems include:<ul>

<li>Antisocial behavior --  disobedience in school, cheating and lying; bullying and cruelty to others; breaking things deliberately; failure to feel sorry after misbehaving;

<li>Hyperactive behavior -- difficulty concentrating or paying attention; becoming easily confused; acting without thinking; being restless or overactive;

<li>Headstrong behavior -- easily losing one's temper; being stubborn, irritable, disobedient at home; arguing excessively;

<li>Peer conflict -- having trouble getting along with others, being not liked, being withdrawn;

<li>Dependent behavior --  crying too much, being too dependent on others, demanding attention, clinging to adults.
</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Children raised by never-married mothers have significantly higher levels of all of the above behavior problems when compared to children raised by both biological parents. When comparisons are made between families that are identical in race, income, number of children, and mother's education, the behavioral differences between illegitimate and legitimate children actually widen. Compared to children living with both biological parents in similar socioeconomic circumstances, children of never-married mothers exhibit 68 percent more antisocial behavior, 24 percent more headstrong behavior, 33 percent more hyperactive behavior, 78 percent more peer conflict, and 53 percent more dependency. Overall, children of never-married mothers have behavioral problems that score nearly three times higher than children raised in comparable intact families.44 <sup>24</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Children born out of wedlock have less ability to delay gratification and poorer impulse control (control over anger and sexual gratification). They have a weaker sense of conscience or sense of right and wrong. <sup>25</sup>  Adding to all this is the sad fact that the incidence of child abuse and neglect is higher among single-parent families. <sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Being born out of wedlock increases the probability of teen sexual activity.</b> Boys and girls born out of wedlock and raised by never-married mothers are two-and-a-half times more likely to be sexually active as teenagers when compared to legitimate children raised in intact married-couple families. This finding applies to both blacks and whites. Children born out of wedlock whose mothers marry after the child's birth appear to be slightly less likely to be sexually active as teens but are still twice as active, on average, as legitimate teens of intact married couples. <sup>27</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents is related to poor academic performance during school years. The risks and consequences of illegitimacy continue through the middle years of childhood and express themselves in poor academic performance. A 1988 study by Sheila F. Krein and Andrea H. Beller of the University of Illinois finds that the longer the time spent in a single-parent family, the lower the education attained by a child. In general, a boy's educational attainment was cut by one-tenth of a year for each year spent as a child in a single-parent home. Controlling for family income did not reduce the magnitude of the effect noticeably. <sup>28</sup>  These findings are confirmed again and again in studies, conducted in the United States and abroad, which which demonstrate that illegitimacy is also associated with lower job and salary attainment. <sup>29</sup> <sup>30</sup>  <sup>31</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents leads to intergenerational illegitimacy. Being born outside of marriage significantly reduces the chances the child will grow up to have an intact marriage. <sup>32</sup>  Children born outside of marriage themselves are three times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up. <sup>33</sup>   Daughters of single mothers are twice as likely to be single mothers themselves if they are black, and only slightly less so if they are white. <sup>34</sup>  And boys living in a single-parent family are twice as likely to father a child out of wedlock as are boys from a two-parent home. <sup>35</sup>  The TALENT study, noted earlier, already had found that children born to teenage parents are more likely to become teen parents themselves. <sup>36</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Illegitimacy is a major factor in America's crime wave.</b> Lack of married parents, rather than race or poverty, is the principal factor in the crime rate. It has been known for some time that high rates of welfare dependency correlate with high crime rates amo
ng young men in a neighborhood. <sup>37</sup>  But more important, a major 1988 study of 11,000 individuals found that "the percentage of single-parent households with children between the ages of 12 and 20 is significantly associated with rates of violent crime and burglary."  The same study makes clear that the widespread popular assumption that there is an association between race and crime is false. Illegitimacy is the key factor. The absence of marriage, and the failure to form and maintain intact families, explains the incidence of high crime in a neighborhood among whites as well as blacks. This study also concluded that poverty does not explain the incidence of crime. <sup>38</sup>  This is a dramatic reversal of conventional wisdom.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Research on underclass behavior by Dr. June O'Neill confirms the linkage between crime and single-parent families. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, O'Neill found that young black men raised in single-parent families were twice as likely to engage in criminal activities when compared to black men raised in two-parent families, even after holding constant a wide range of variables such as family income, urban residence, neighborhood environment, and parents' education. Growing up in a single-parent family in a neighborhood with many other single-parent families on welfare triples the probability that a young black man will engage in criminal activity. <sup>39</sup><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In vetoing the welfare reform legislation passed by the House and Senate, President Clinton has embraced the central erroneous tenets of liberal welfarism. The Clinton Administration's report on welfare, which formed the basis for the President's veto, makes clear a belief that rapid and automatic increases in welfare spending are essential to the well-being of children and that any attempts to slow the growth of future welfare spending will significantly harm children. <sup>40</sup>  The organizers of the recent Stand for Children rally share a similar view.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		The President's veto and the Stand for Children rally are both founded on the failed hypothesis that combating poverty through more generous welfare spending is crucial to children's future. This thinking is simply wrong. An expanded and more expensive welfare system will not benefit children. Instead, expansion of welfare leads to greater dependence and illegitimacy, which in turn have devastatingly negative consequences on children. Those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependence and illegitimacy. That is the core of Congress's reform.

<b>APPENDIX<br>
Research on Welfare and Illegitimacy</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Despite repeated claims to the contrary, the overwhelming majority of scientific studies conducted in the last decade and a half show that welfare promotes illegitimacy and discourages marriage. Many show that welfare has a dramatically positive effect in increasing the level of illegitimacy in U.S. society. The following is a list of 19 studies on welfare and illegitimacy; of these, 14 have found a relationship between higher welfare benefits and increased illegitimacy.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	1. Research by Mikhail Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University shows that childbearing by young unmarried women may increase by 6 percent in response to a 10 percent increase in monthly welfare benefits; among blacks, the increase may be as high as 10 percent.

Research by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. June O'Neill, has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births.

In general, an increase of roughly $100 in the average monthly AFDC benefit per recipient child was found to lead to a drop of over 15 percent in births within wedlock among black women aged 20 to 24.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	8. Another recent study finds large effects of welfare on illegitimacy. A 20 percent increase in welfare benefit levels across all states would increase the probability of teen out-of-wedlock births by as much as 16 percent.

This study finds a small relationship between higher welfare benefits and total births to white women, but no significant relationship between welfare and illegitimate births. The study does, however, show that being raised in a single-parent home doubles the probability that a young woman will have a child out of wedlock.

<li>         The impact of increasing the lenience and generosity of welfare in undermining work and prolonging dependence has been confirmed by controlled scientific experiment. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to examine the effect of welfare benefits on work effort. The longest running and most comprehensive of these experiments was conducted between 1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver, and became known as the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or "SIME/DIME."  Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME and similar experiments conducted in other cities would prove that generous welfare benefits did not affect "work effort" adversely. Instead, the SIME/DIME experiment found that each $1.00 of extra welfare given to low-income persons reduced labor and earnings by an average of $0.80. The significant anti-work effects of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including married women, single mothers, and husbands. The results of the SIME/DIME study are directly applicable to existing welfare programs: Nearly all have strong anti-work effects like those studied in the SIME/DIME experiment. See: Gregory B. Christiansen and Walter E. Williams, "Welfare Family Cohesiveness and Out of Wedlock Births," in Joseph Peden and Fred Glahe, <i>The American Family and the State</i> (San Francisco: Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1986), p. 398.

<li>         A further refinement of the Corcoran and Gordon study adjusted for differences in years spent by a family in poverty. The study showed that, in general, if two families had the same level of non-welfare income and spent the same amount of time "in poverty," the more welfare income received by the family, the worse the consequences for a boy raised in the family. For example, if two boys were raised in families with identical non-welfare incomes and spent the same time "in poverty," the more welfare received by one of the families, the lower the earnings of the boy raised in that family when he becomes an adult.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The National Governors' Association (NGA) is proposing a new welfare reform plan, and Congress has initiated hearings on the governors' proposal. Unfortunately, this proposal, crafted by NGA bureaucrats and borrowing significant elements from President Clinton's welfare reform schemes, is another blueprint for flawed welfare reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Members of Congress should realize that the NGA plan repudiates most of the key elements of the Contract With America proposed by conservatives in the fall of 1994. The Contract contained a solid, comprehensive welfare reform based on three themes:
<p><ul>
<li><b> A national goal of reducing illegitimacy</b> and establishing a number of modest national policies to advance that goal;<p>

<li><b> National work requirements</b> for AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) recipients; and<p>

<li><b> Greater flexibility to state governments</b> in the operation of welfare programs.<sup>1</sup> 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House/Senate conference bill passed by Congress, and vetoed by President Clinton on January 9, retained these three basic elements of reform, albeit with the pro-marriage provisions weakened. But the NGA plan effectively eliminates the first two principles of reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Decision makers enticed by the NGA's "bipartisan" reform package would do well to remember history. America supposedly ended welfare just eight years ago, when Congress in 1988 passed a comprehensive "bipartisan" reform which promised to replace welfare with work. This so-called reform, also predominantly shaped by the NGA, turned out to be a sham:  Daycare spending soared; welfare caseloads skyrocketed; even today, almost no welfare recipients are required to work. With the NGA bureaucracy again in the lead, history is about to repeat itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA plan is heavily flawed in four key aspects.
<p>
<b>1) The plan abandons the welfare reform goal of reducing illegitimacy.</b> NGA officials have completely misdefined the real goal of reform. Their plan explicitly abandons the goal of saving marriage and reducing illegitimacy, which was the number one welfare reform plank in the Contract With America; the shift is so complete that the governors' policy declaration does not mention rising illegitimacy even as a minor social problem, let alone propose a reform structure to deal with it.
<p>
<b>2) The plan eliminates all work requirements for AFDC recipients.</b> The plan drawn up by the NGA bureaucracy completely guts the work requirements from the House-Senate conference bill and substitutes bogus requirements designed to deceive the public while preserving the status quo. The work requirements in the NGA plan are far weaker than those in the Democratic alternative bills supported by President Clinton, S.1117, introduced by Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) in the Senate, and the amendment to H.R. 4 introduced by Representative Nathan Deal (D-GA) in the House. In fact, under the NGA plan, no welfare recipients will be required to work.
<p>
<b>3) The plan has a pervasive anti-marriage bias.</b> Since the NGA bureaucracy rejected reducing out-of-wedlock birth rates as a reform goal, it is not surprising that the plan is indifferent, or effectively hostile, to marriage throughout. To the extent it modifies the conference welfare bill passed in the House and Senate, the NGA plan systematically discriminates against marriage. Further, it would penalize financially those states which pursue a pro-marriage welfare strategy and reward those which concentrate on the narrow goal of providing job-training and employment to single mothers.
<p>
<b>4) The plan embodies the Clinton Administration's "reform" structure.</b> The NGA plan incorporates many major elements of President Clinton's anti-dependency plans. As such, the governors' proposal encourages states to pursue the least efficient strategies for reducing welfare dependence and penalizes states that pursue efficient plans.
<p>

<b>ABANDONING MARRIAGE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most important element of any reform plan is the goal. If the goal is set properly, all other elements eventually will fall into place. If the nation sets the wrong goal, no amount of tinkering will help. The number one goal of welfare reform must be to save marriage and reduce illegitimacy. All else is secondary. Setting a clear, paramount goal of reducing illegitimacy also serves a public education function:  It frames the debate, alerts Americans to what is truly important, and establishes social expectations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' proposal is a failure because it sets the wrong goal. NGA officials declare that there are three "crucial elements" of real welfare reform:
<p><ul>
<li> Providing more government-funded daycare;
<p>
<li> Increasing child support payments from absent fathers; and 
<p>
<li> Imposing time limits and work requirements (with gaping loopholes) for welfare recipients.<sup>2</sup>
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The rise in illegitimacy and the collapse of marriage do not even merit a concerned comment, let alone aggressive policies, from the NGA.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, over the last year, the focus of the welfare debate has undergone a radical metamorphosis, from combating illegitimacy to providing public support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Eschewing the issue of illegitimacy, the NGA plan instead appears as a preparation for a future in which marriage plays a sharply diminishing role in America, and the government is heavily involved in meeting the needs of an ever-growing population of single-parent families. The triumph of liberals on this aspect of the debate has been complete:  Fighting illegitimacy is "out," and funding government daycare is "in." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' plan, borrowing heavily from the "reform" schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals, dovetails neatly with the interests of America's enormous welfare bureaucracy:  an industry that thrives on social decay. While the plan will trim the growth rate in welfare spending slightly in the near term, by failing to deal with ballooning rates of illegitimacy it sets the stage for an unavoidable and explosive rise in welfare and social service spending in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nor are the governors alone. Under its recently passed version of welfare reform, the Republican-controlled Congress has committed itself to spending nearly half a trillion dollars, over the next seven years to subsidize and support illegitimacy and single parenthood through multiple welfare benefits, daycare, job training, and other services. Under the congressional plan, government will spend $1,000 to subsidize single parenthood and illegitimacy for each dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA welfare reform plan will distort these priorities even further. When the dust settles on welfare reform, even token efforts to fight illegitimacy will have fallen by the wayside.

<P>
<b>The Crisis of Illegitimacy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But decisive action to deal with the collapse of the family is urgently needed. Last year, nearly one-third of American children were born out of wedlock. Even worse, the illegitimate birth rate continues to rise relentlessly -- by about one percentage point each and every year. Within the black community, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now 69 percent. This figure astounds even Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), who first issued his prophetic warnings about the erosion of marriage among blacks in the early 1960s. Moynihan's warning was vilified at the time, but the breakup of the black family and the accompanying social calamities have far outstripped his worst nightmares. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ominously, the illegitimate birth rate among whites now is edging toward 25 percent -- almost exactly equaling the black rate when Moynihan first raised his alarm. The white family is teetering on the same precipice, heading rapidly toward the same lethal decomposition that devastated black communities in the late 1960s and 1970s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The collapse of marriage and the concomitant rise in illegitimacy together form the number one problem facing America; family collapse is the root cause of other social problems, such as poverty, crime, drug abuse, and school failure.<sup>4</sup>  Some reasons why:
<p><ul>
<li>Children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than are those born to couples who remain married. 
<p>
<li>Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out-of wedlock themselves than are girls from intact non-welfare families. 
<p>
<li>A boy from a single-parent home in the inner city is twice as likely to engage in crime as a similar boy who is poor but living with a father and a mother.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some would argue that federal action on illegitimacy is unneeded:  If left alone, the governors will tackle the problem on their own. But the governors' silence speaks volumes. Few, if any, governors have made reducing illegitimacy a central theme of reform; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. By refusing to acknowledge or mention the collapse of marriage, the governors are implicitly condoning and (through inaction) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. They are embarked on a path which will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born out of wedlock and raised in government-supported daycare centers. This is not reform. It is a national disaster.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of welfare reform must be to save marriage. But the governors have formally stated that promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy is not a meaningful part of their reform plan. If the House and Senate adopt the governors' plan, they will have agreed with them and will have abandoned even token efforts to stem the rise of illegitimacy and decline of marriage in American society.
<p>

<b>THE NGA'S SHAM WORK REQUIREMENTS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nearly 90 percent of Americans believe that welfare recipients should be required to work for the benefits they receive. In response to this public pressure, the U.S. welfare establishment has a simple solution:  sham work requirements that create the illusion that beneficiaries must work while, in fact, few actually do. For example, as part of the 1988 welfare reform (the Family Support Act) the public was told that "welfare will be replaced by work."  But the NGA opposed real work requirements. As a consequence, the reform, enacted by a nearly unanimous bipartisan vote in the Senate, was a sham. Daycare funding exploded, AFDC caseload grew by some 30 percent, and today only some 2 to 3 percent of AFDC recipients actually are required to work. History is about to repeat itself.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A major provision of the conference bill passed by Congress is a requirement that some AFDC recipients must work.5  Section 407 of the bill requires certain percentages of the AFDC caseload to work for benefits and provides a fairly tight definition of work. However, even these work participation requirements have loopholes. For example, up to 20 percent of those counted as working can be in vocational education instead.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The following table shows the nominal work participation rates in the conference bill and the real rates, once loopholes are taken into consideration. 
<center><P>
<table border>
<tr><th>YEAR</th><th>Nominal Participation Rates</th><th>Real Participation Rates</th>

<td>1996</td><td>15%</td><td>10.5%</td>

</tr></table></center><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, in the typical state, some 10 percent of AFDC recipients already are employed, voluntarily, in part-time jobs and can properly be counted toward the state work requirement rate. This means that, in the typical state, only 25 percent of AFDC recipients would be required to work by 2002.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even this rate is far too high for the NGA. While the NGA proposal nominally accepts the work participation rates from the conference report, the plan actually includes a cavernous loophole which effectively obliterates all work requirements. The NGA proposes to count routine caseload turnover toward the work participation rates, so any AFDC recipient who ever obtained work and left AFDC could be counted toward the participation requirement. It is important to note that there always has been a considerable turnover in the AFDC caseload. Hundreds of thousands of recipients obtain jobs and leave AFDC in any given year as an equal or greater number of persons enroll. This routine turnover occurs even when total AFDC caseloads are rising rapidly. The governors wish to be given credit for this automatic turnover and to portray the status quo as successful reform.<sup>7</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By claiming credit for individuals who have obtained a job and left AFDC during the last 24 months, a governor could automatically obtain a work "participation rate" of roughly 40 percent without in any way altering the existing welfare system.<sup>8</sup>  Nearly all states would be able to meet their work requirements for the next seven without the least change in the status quo. Thus, the NGA bill is almost a perfect repeat of the bogus 1988 reform. Once again, complicated sham work requirements will be substituted for the real thing.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not surprisingly, the Clinton Administration is enthusiastic about counting normal caseload turnover as "work."  Very similar "credit for turnover" provisions played a key role in the Democratic alternative reform legislation rejected earlier this year in the House and Senate. Congressional Republicans at the time denounced these provisions as a crude effort to deceive the voters. It would be ironic if a Republican-controlled Congress now embraced the same deception.
<p>

<b>BUT ISN'T ENDING AFDC ENTITLEMENTS THE KEY TO REFORM?</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is true that the NGA plan does end the entitlement status of AFDC and eliminates many of the unnecessary restrictions in the existing AFDC code, thereby giving greater flexibility to the states.<sup>9</sup>  Replacing automatic entitlement funding with block grants also imposes greater fiscal discipline on each state. Under the current entitlement system, when a state expands its AFDC caseload, it gets an automatic increase in federal AFDC funds. If a state shrinks its caseload, its federal funding is cut. If the current automatic entitlement funding mechanism were replaced by a block grant system, each state would be given a fixed amount. Since the block grant amount would not expand automatically if a state's AFDC caseload grew, a block grant funding system would give states a greater incentive to curtail caseload growth.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The current entitlement nature of AFDC is objectionable and should be eliminated. However, eliminating entitlement status alone is not reform, or even a small part of reform. The impact of eliminating the entitlement nature of AFDC has been greatly overrated. Under the current funding system, states must match federal AFDC funding in the state (generally the state pays 40 to 50 percent of total AFDC costs within the state). Thus, states always have had a strong financial incentive to curtail AFDC caseload growth; this, however, has not prevented the program from swelling to the point where one out of five children receives benefits each year.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been recent efforts to exaggerate the importance of ending AFDC's entitlement status. For example, it has been claimed that ending the entitlement status and "block granting" were the only welfare goals of the Reagan Administration. This is misleading. A hallmark of welfare policy under President Reagan was the effort to establish national work requirements for welfare recipients. Bills to accomplish this aim were introduced year after year during the Reagan presidency.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reality, eliminating AFDC entitlements would have only a modest effect on reform. Other far more significant factors in shaping reform at the state level are the overall framing of the welfare debate and the shaping of public expectations; the actual goal of reform in the minds of decision makers; the momentum of past policies; the vast influence of the state welfare bureaucracies; and the explicit goals, incentives, and requirements established by the federal government.<sup>10</sup>

<p>
<b>OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE NGA PLAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' plan would create a huge performance incentive fund, costing roughly $6 billion over the next seven years. This fund -- a central feature of the Clinton reform strategy -- would provide cash bonuses to states which have higher rates of AFDC mothers obtaining jobs. This is a very limited and illogical measure of success. For example, increasing marriage and reducing out-of-wedlock births would have far more beneficial effects on children and society than merely increasing employment of single mothers. But the NGA plan is indifferent or hostile to the issues of illegitimacy and marriage.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even from the more limited perspective of reducing welfare dependence, the NGA plan is illogical. 
Welfare dependence can be reduced by six means:
<p><ul>
<li> Reducing illegitimacy;<P>
<li> Reducing divorce;<p>
<li> Increasing marriage among women who have had children out of wedlock but have not yet enrolled in welfare;<P>
<li> Encouraging single mothers to take jobs before they enter AFDC;<p>
<li> Increasing marriage among welfare mothers; and<p>
<li> Having welfare mothers obtain jobs.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Employment of welfare mothers is, in fact, the least effective of these six mechanisms for purposes of shrinking dependence, reducing child poverty, and enhancing the well-being of children. However, employing welfare mothers is the mechanism which least disrupts the ideological status quo and it is attractive to the huge welfare bureaucracy, whose material interests require a growing population of welfare recipients needing more and more services, such as daycare and training. Hence, despite its irrationality, the employment of welfare mothers remains the almost exclusive focus of the NGA plan. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA plan thus is narrowly focused on the least effective means of reducing dependence and the one which is least beneficial to children. Under the proposal, states which concentrate on other aspects of reform would bear a heavy financial penalty. But by encouraging states to focus on the least effective and least desirable means of reducing dependence, the governor's plan actually will slow the reduction of welfare dependence.<sup>11</sup> 
<p>

<b>Rewards for Bogus "Success" </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA's focus on "exits from welfare," borrowed from the Clinton Administration, is illogical. The evidence indicates that serious work requirements have their strongest impact not by encouraging people to leave welfare, but by reducing the number of persons who bother to apply for welfare in the first place. Similarly, a state which restricts welfare entry to the truly needy (those who are the least able to support themselves) almost certainly will have proportionally fewer "exits" from the welfare caseload than would states with more liberal entrance standards.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The entire notion of measuring success in welfare by caseload exits makes no sense. It is like measuring success in the war on drugs not by a decline in drug use, but by an increase in the number of persons passing through rehabilitation, or judging the nation's health by counting the number of successful exits from hospitals -- a criterion which might be popular among hospital administrators but would make no sense for society at large. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, there is little relationship between "employment exits" and the level of welfare dependence or caseload size. In the NGA plan, there is no requirement that "successful" states actually lower caseloads. States would be rewarded for "success" even when their caseloads were consistently growing. If, for example, the NGA "performance incentive fund" had been created seven years ago, states automatically would have been rewarded with billions for "success," year after year, while their AFDC caseloads were growing between 25 and 30 percent. Unfortunately, the creation of bogus measurements of successful reform is no accident -- such measures are a key element in the welfare industry's strategy to forestall real change.
<p>
<b>Anti-Marriage Bias</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even from the limited perspective of promoting welfare exits, the NGA plan is inconsistent. The NGA bureaucrats would reward states when a single mother gets a job and leaves welfare, but give no reward if a mother marries and gets off welfare -- even though the marriage is far more effective in reducing long-term dependence and poverty. In keeping with the prevailing ideology of the nation's welfare establishment, the NGA plan is heavily biased against marriage and focused on obtaining employment for single mothers.
<p>
<b>No Real Money for Reducing Illegitimacy </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The vetoed House-Senate conference bill did contain a fund to reward states which reduced illegitimacy without increasing abortions, and the NGA plan retained this. However, it is useful to compare this illegitimacy reduction bonus fund with the NGA's "performance incentive fund," which rewards the employment of AFDC mothers. The performance incentive fund rewards states on a comparative or relative scale; states would be ranked, and states with higher employment records relative to other states would be given substantial bonuses. Such a comparative reward system creates automatic winners; cash incentives will be paid out automatically under the plan even if the overall level of real performance remains the same or deteriorates. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, the illegitimacy ratio bonus fund is linked to absolute -- not relative -- performance, so a state must achieve a real reduction in its illegitimacy ratio (the proportion of births which are out of wedlock) in order to receive a reward. The requirements are very difficult to achieve -- so much so that little or no bonus money actually will be paid from this fund. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA thus has adopted very tough absolute standards for rewarding illegitimacy reduction but lax comparative standards for rewarding employment. Yet the latter standards guarantee winners. Consequently, under the NGA plan, little or no money would be paid to reward states for efforts to reduce illegitimacy, while $6 billion in rewards would be given automatically for efforts to employ welfare mothers. Once again, the NGA's relentless bias against promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy is apparent. 

<p>
<b>Large Increases in Mandatory Day Care Funding</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The House-Senate conference bill increased federal daycare funding by $2 billion over seven years. The NGA plan would require another $4 billion. Overall, this means that federal daycare funding would be increased by a third. States would be required to spend all the increased funds on daycare even if they would prefer to spend it on other services to the poor.
<P>
<b>Family Cap </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conference bill prohibited states from using federal funds to give higher welfare benefits to women who have children out of wedlock while already enrolled in AFDC; states could choose to "opt out" of this restriction by enacting specific legislation. The governors' plan eliminates the family cap provision entirely. As under current law, states could have a family cap if they wish, but there is no legal impetus for them to do so.<sup>12</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The family cap is not only sound policy; it is widely supported by the public. Nearly nine out of ten Americans "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out-of-wedlock."<sup>13</sup>  The popularity of the family cap is so great that the Clinton Administration does not publicly oppose the policy. Nor did the White House cite the inclusion of the family cap provision as a reason for its veto of the House/Senate conference bill.
<p>

<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Contract With America advanced three principles of welfare reform:  promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy, requiring work, and increasing state flexibility. The NGA plan abandons the first two of these principles despite the fact that they are supported overwhelmingly by the public. Real welfare reform must carry out the principles of the Contract.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Restoring a sensible debate on marriage and illegitimacy is crucial. This issue has been trivialized or ignored by those pretending it is merely a question of whether the family cap provision in the House/Senate conference bill should be retained or eliminated. In reality, conservatives have proposed nearly a dozen national measures aimed at reducing illegitimacy. Many were included in the Contract With America. But in each case, they have been resisted by the Washington establishment and, one by one, they have been whittled away. What is now required is a complete reorientation of the debate back to the topic of illegitimacy, and the establishment of multiple measures to deal with the problem. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to produce real reform, the following ten steps are needed.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1)</b> The leadership of the House and Senate should assert publicly that reducing illegitimacy is the key goal in welfare reform and should commit to an ongoing effort to use the "bully pulpit" to raise concern about the collapse of marriage in society.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2)</b> The family cap provision of the conference bill (with the opt out clause) should be retained in any future legislation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>3)</b> The illegitimacy reduction bonus fund established in the conference bill is a good idea and should be retained. However, the criteria for successful performance are so strict that even those states which make serious attempts to reduce illegitimacy will be unlikely to achieve them. Of course, incentive bonuses which are nearly unobtainable are not likely to have much effect on state plans and activities. The success criteria for this fund should be softened to give states a more realistic opportunity to obtain the bonuses. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>4)</b> The NGA performance incentive fund rewards only employment by welfare mothers, even though this is the least effective and least desirable way of reducing dependence. The fund should be altered to reward a composite score of all of the following:  a reduced illegitimacy rate, reduced divorce rate, reduced AFDC application rate, increased AFDC employment exits, and increased AFDC marital exits. Moreover, states should be rewarded only if caseload and illegitimacy actually are declining.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>5)</b> States should be given the option of providing food commodities rather than food stamp coupons to AFDC mothers and retaining any resultant savings for other anti-poverty efforts. By reducing the attractiveness of the welfare life-style, this policy has the potential to greatly reduce future out-of-wedlock births.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>6)</b> The amount of funding in the conference bill's abstinence program should be increased from $75 million to $200 million per year in any future legislation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>7)</b> Each state should be required to submit a plan showing how it intends to reduce illegitimacy. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>8)</b> Within the existing AFDC program, a new set-aside fund should be established providing $300 million per year for states to devise their own programs to reduce illegitimacy without increasing abortion (with firm evaluations required).
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>9)</b> The work requirements in the conference bill should not be weakened or undermined through the governors' proposal to count employment exits. Performance goals should not be linked to exits in any way, since the best reform schemes will reduce enrollments rather than increase exits. The hourly work requirements for AFDC recipients, especially AFDC-UP fathers, should not be reduced.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>10)</b> Under the bill, daycare funds could be spent only for daycare even if the governors wish to use them for other services for the poor. This "lock in" of the daycare money should be eliminated in future legislation.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On the crucial issues of work and illegitimacy, the NGA plan resembles the Democratic alternative bills introduced in the House and Senate much more closely than it does the original Contract With America. Indeed, the work requirements in the NGA plan actually are weaker than those in either Democratic bill.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The welfare "reform" proposed by the National Governors' Association is, in reality, an anti-reform. The NGA has abandoned the goal of saving marriage and reducing illegitimacy. Instead, NGA officials call for a massive investment in government daycare for an expanding population of single-parent families. The NGA seeks to abolish the work requirements in the conference bill passed by the House and Senate and to substitute sham requirements in their place. The bill is biased against marriage. The NGA has adopted a reward and incentive system which has as its exclusive goal the employment of single mothers despite the fact that this is the least effective means of reducing dependence and improving children's well-being.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sham reforms such as that proposed by the NGA are very harmful. By creating the illusion of reform, bogus reform reduces public pressure for change and thereby helps to preserve the existing system. The bogus welfare reforms of 1988, created in large part by the NGA, delayed action on real reform for nearly a decade. This sad mistake should not be repeated.

<li>Statement on "Welfare Reform" as adopted by the governors on February 6, 1996.<p>
<li>In an February 29, 1996, article in the <I>Washington Times</I>, entitled "Can Welfare Reform Survive Friendly Fire?"  Robert Carleson maintains that the National Governors' Association did not ignore the catastrophic rise in illegitimacy. Carleson cites "findings" contained in the welfare legislation passed last year by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton. The findings say that illegitimacy is harmful. It is important to note, however, that these findings are merely rhetorical and are not linked to policy. It is true that the NGA, as a practical matter, used the conference bill passed by Congress as a textual base and amended it to produce its own proposed policy. But one can be quite certain that no governor actually looked at the huge conference tome, and it would be very surprising if any governor was aware of the few paragraphs of legally irrelevant "findings" buried deep within the 650-page conference document. Certainly no one at the NGA seems to have regarded these forlorn paragraphs as important. All one need do is listen to the NGA's own words. In its official statement of policy, reducing illegitimacy is not mentioned as a goal or "crucial element" of reform, and the NGA, of course, makes not the slightest reference to the "findings" on illegitimacy. <p>
<li>See Patrick F. Fagan, "Rising Illegitimacy:  America's Social Catastrophe," Heritage Foundation <I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 19, June 29, 1994. See also Patrick F. Fagan, "The Real Root Causes of Violent Crime:  The Breakdown of Marriage, Family, and Community," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1026, March 17, 1995.<p>
<li>Some of the "work" requirements in the conference bill are illusory; for example, individuals who have received AFDC for over two years are required to "work," but a state may count one hour of job search per year as "working."  These "requirements" are very similar to the cosmetic provisions of the sham reform of 1988. However, the work provisions of Section 407 of the bill are quite different, and for the first time in the history of AFDC, require a certain percentage of recipients actually to work <p>
<li>Another loophole permits states to subtract women with children under age one from the denominator for purposes of calculating their work participation rate. Such women comprise about 10 percent of the AFDC caseload; excluding them from the caseload count effectively cuts the required work participation rates by 10 percent.<P>
<li>It is important to understand the distinction between routine caseload turnover and net caseload reduction. With caseload turnover, a certain number of persons leave the welfare rolls but an equal or greater number enter; the total size of the caseload remains the same or increases. With net caseload reduction, the actual number of persons on welfare declines due to a drop in enrollments or an increase in exits which exceeds new enrollments. Caseload turnover is omnipresent and meaningless; it not a valid measure of success in reducing dependence. Caseload reduction is difficult to achieve and has rarely occurred in the history of AFDC. The goal of welfare reform is not to increase the number of persons cycled through the welfare system (although the welfare bureaucracy would like such a goal); it is to reduce the level of dependence. Caseload reduction is a proper measure of that goal. The House-Senate conference bill established performance standards which gave states proper credit for anti-dependency efforts which resulted in real caseload reduction, but not for mere turnover.<p>
<li>NGA bureaucrats in fact are demanding any individual who has ever obtained a job and left AFDC be counted toward the state's work participation rate. The figures become very complex since these individuals would be counted in both numerator and denominator for purposes of calculating the participation rate. However, the bottom line is simple:  Even if caseload turnover only for the prior six months is counted, the actual work standards in the bill would be gutted, at least through the end of this century.<p>
<li>In particular, the plan would eliminate the current JOBS program, which has made it difficult for states to operate serious workfare programs.<p>
<li>However, some proponents of the NGA plan regard ending the entitlement nature of AFDC not only as the most important, but as the only acceptable element of reform. Such individuals tend to adhere to the philosophy of "value neutral revenue sharing."  Under this doctrine, the federal government should collect the revenue for the welfare system and hand it over to state governments with no requirement other than that the funds be spent to aid the poor. According to this narrow doctrine, most of the welfare provisions of the Contract With America (and especially those dealing with work and illegitimacy) are not only unnecessary, but also highly objectionable. From this perspective, "success" in welfare reform necessarily means opposing and eliminating most of the Contract's welfare provisions as unwanted impediments on the states. Not surprisingly, the NGA plan draws very high praise from adherents of this view. However, this seems to be a perspective which is not widely shared.<p>
<li>It could be argued reasonably that the rewards and incentives provided in the NGA plan are irrational but that this fact is of lessened importance because it is greatly outweighed by the impact of removing the AFDC entitlement funding mechanism. In this view, giving each state a fixed-sum block grant creates an implicit fiscal discipline which will drive states to pursue rational means to reduce dependency, irrespective of the explicit, contrary system of goals and bonus incentives. However, in the experience of this writer, explicit goals, reform concepts, and rewards play a very large role in shaping the outlook of state-level bureaucrats and decision makers, a role which greatly outweighs any implicit fiscal impetus. <p>
<li>Under the current law, a state government must request a federal waiver to enact the family cap. Under the NGA plan, a waiver would no longer be needed.<p>
<li>Family Research Council poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, mid-October 1995. The poll surveyed 1,000 randomly selected American adults about their views on welfare and social issues and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<Font size="+2">A</font>merica is entering a great age of social 
entrepreneurship, rivaling the private organizational creativity of 100 years ago. The mid-to-late 19th and 
early 20th centuries saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Scouts movement, the Carnegie libraries, the 
NAACP, thousands of colleges and universities, and countless other private organizations. As Americans 
turn away from reliance on Washington, they are once again applying Yankee ingenuity by building 
private institutions to address our great cultural crises. Already we are seeing new experiments such as 
privately funded voucher programs that enable poor schoolchildren to escape inadequate public schools, 
organizations that seek to rehabilitate prisoners through religious conversion, and groups such as Promise 
Keepers that aim to instill responsibility among fathers and husbands.
<p>

<b><i>Police Training for Youth</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I always knew what I wanted to do when I grew up: I always 
wanted to be a cop. Growing up in Boston, I admired the police and the responsibility they took for others. 
From my earliest years, when police officers helped me across the street on my way to school, they were 
strong role models. It was a natural thing for me to emulate them.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For a lot of kids today, it's not so simple. Many kids are 
alienated from the police, and their peers reinforce the alienation. Instead of seeing cops as assisting 
people, they see them as authority figures to be defied. Before many young people mature and finally 
realize that they'd like to have police careers, they already have police records. It's a tragic waste of kids 
who could have made good, even great, police officers. It's also a big problem for society because -- as 
demographers warn -- the late 1990s will bring an increase in the youth population and a likely rise in the 
crime rate.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For all these reasons, I have a dream of developing a youth 
police career path to provide the children of New York City with police role models in their developmental 
years. By exposing kids to positive interactions with police, the career path would help keep them focused 
and directed in their teen years and simultaneously ensure the police department of a stronger field of 
candidates from which to choose.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Although we would continue to reach into elementary schools 
with antidrug programs, the official police youth career path would begin with kids in their early teens, 
who could attend a youth academy for six weeks in the summer beginning at age 12. The academy would 
familiarize them with the police department and heighten their interest in police careers while giving them 
a strong dose of antidrug and antigang education. The NYPD ran a successful pilot youth academy in 
Brooklyn last summer with 150 attendees, and we've raised the funds, from private and government 
sources, to enroll a thousand attendees from all over the city this summer.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After the youth academy, we would recruit kids into the next step in a youth career path -- the Law 
Enforcement Explorers, a division of the Boy Scouts of America, open to young men and women ages 14 
to 21. Now established in 66 of the New York City police department's 97 precincts, transit districts, and 
housing service areas, the NYPD Explorers serve about 2,000 young people with a program of character 
building, citizenship training, and physical fitness. 

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While participating in the Explorers, young people could also 
attend a specialty high school for students interested in policing, fire fighting, and other public-safety 
careers. A public-safety high school, now in the early planning stages, would show young people how their 
academic work builds toward their desired careers and use examples from police and other public-safety 
agencies as teaching tools. It would also surround them with like-minded students with similar goals, 
exerting a very different and more beneficial kind of peer pressure.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NYPD is raising the qualifications for police officers this 
year, requiring candidates to have 60 college credits and to have reached the age of 22. In a continuation of 
the youth career path, students attending colleges in the City University system could serve as police 
cadets, a police internship offering college credits for working in unpaid, part-time positions with the 
NYPD. The department would also assist cadets in finding part-time paying jobs in the private security 
industry or in the New York City school security system, both of which have had difficulty in recruiting 
quality personnel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In either capacity, cadets could practice the skills of projecting 
authority, mediating conflicts, and defusing potentially violent situations. Another advantage of using them 
in the school security system -- which Mayor Giuliani is planning to place under the direction of the NYPD 
in the near future -- is that these young security guards would serve as role models to the next generation of 
young people. Unlike the cadet program we have now -- which provides stipends to 320 cadets a year out 
of city and federal funds -- this program would earn its own way. By the time the cadets were ready to 
enter the police department, they'd have a significant work history, college background, and police 
training. They would probably require less training at our police academy, and would certainly be better 
prepared for the discipline and lifestyle of police work. Our academy would thus build a police force from 
a better base of candidates.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Peer pressure leads many young people astray. In some of the 
more impoverished neighborhoods, just hanging out on the street corner can be a career path straight to 
crime. Through the police youth career path, we would offer the kids the opportunity to hang out with us. 
If we capture them early, it can make all the difference in the world. The kids get a focus and a goal, 
private security and school security get better employees, and the city gets a much better crop of candidates 
for police officers. The department would have a larger pool of minority candidates and a larger pool of 
candidates who live in the city. The very group -- teenagers and young adults -- that is predicted to cause 
all the law-enforcement problems in the late 1990s can begin to be part of the solution. In my dream, 
everybody wins.

<b><i>A Great-Books Junior College</i></b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My idea is to create a new one- or two-year junior college for 
bright students (or even not-so-bright students) to earn the education they did not receive in high school 
and won't get in college. Actually I heard this idea first from Hillel Fradkin of the Bradley Foundation. But 
it's a good one, and I think it can work.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I begin with reference to a resource of which I am painfully 
aware: a cohort of unemployed Ph.D.s of (academically) conservative bent who are well educated in the 
works of great authors. To these political philosophers could be added others in history, literature, 
languages, science, and mathematics to teach a curriculum encompassing all that is necessary and 
fundamental and currently neglected or perverted in higher education.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This junior college would draw inspiration partly from disdain 
for political correctness and dislike of the educationists' notion of "self-esteem." But it would also be 
devoted to the love of learning and powered by the enthusiasm of youth. Its graduates could go on to name 
universities with prestigious degrees, football teams, and alumni associations. At these institutions, most of 
them now tired and corrupt, they would be welcomed -- or at least tolerated -- as something fresh, new, and 
strong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	American education today is perhaps too weak even to resist 
its chosen enemies -- those who believe in quality. A new institution like this would serve a need and make 
a point. All it requires, really, is an entrepreneur.

<b><i>"Pick Up Your Room"</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This one is going to be tricky. I dream of seeing the revival of 
the institution of childhood. That would mean: Children would be taught to clean up their rooms before 
they started on the environment. Their ability to keep domestic peace would be valued over their opinions 
on world peace. A 12-year-old would own a gun only to hunt squirrels. The streets would be safe for 
children to play outside, unwatched, until dusk. They could get into scrapes with other kids without 
activating a battalion of police and social workers. Girls would be left alone to have tea parties if they 
wished, and boys to play with war toys.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the schools, teachers would be more concerned about a 
child's grades than his self-esteem. Sex would never be considered "safe." Television, even -- or especially 
-- public television, would never be considered educational. Children would address their teachers -- and 
all adults -- as Mr. and Miss, or as "Sir" and "Ma'am," and not, like impertinent phone solicitors, by their 
first names.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, a revival of the institution of childhood implies a 
revival of the institution of parenthood. Mothers and fathers might by tired, nagging, grumpy, and 
uncomprehending -- but they would be present. A baby sitter would once again be called a baby sitter and 
not a "caregiver." During the day, she would sit in furry slippers in the living room, watching soaps. She 
certainly would not be expected to hold degrees in Early Childhood Education, because nobody would 
imagine that a baby sitter could substitute for parental love, attention, and discipline.

<b><i>A Dream That Won't Die</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream is not a new one. It is now 40 years old. It is a 
dream of institutional change that will enable parents to choose the schools their children go to. It is a 
dream of a private educational industry that can  compete on equal terms with our present system of 
elementary and secondary schooling -- a governmental monopoly dominated by the teachers' unions for the 
benefit of its officials and members, not of the students.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, a parent who chooses to send his child to a private 
school is required to pay twice for his child's schooling -- once in the form of taxes and once in the form of 
tuition. This imposes a heavy burden on lower income classes and ensures that only the well-do-to are free 
to choose. We can and should remedy that inequity by allowing students who choose to go to private rather 
than public schools to receive scholarships or vouchers equal to a substantial fraction of what the state 
would have been required to spend.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No institution in our country is as technologically backward as 
schooling. We school children today just as we did 200 years ago: A teacher in a classroom instructing a 
group of students. Some schools have added computers but, in the main, have not made effective use of 
them. If we opened the gate to widespread competition, we would enjoy a dramatic change in technology. I 
cannot predict what that change would be, any more than one could have predicted the consequences of 
breaking up AT&T's monopoly on telephone service, or of inventing an elementary personal computer in a 
garage.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similarly, a widespread scholarship system of the kind I 
describe would open the door to an influx of innovative enterprises offering different kinds of schooling to 
attract customers. Faced with competition, the public schools would have to improve or close down. No 
doubt some would be unable to stand the heat, but others would rapidly improve. The result would be a 
large, creative, highly developed, private educational industry that offers schooling for every taste, plus a 
vastly improved but somewhat smaller public-school system. A widening gap between the earnings of less 
skilled and more skilled workers threatens our social cohesion; an improvement in the quality of schooling, 
especially for lower-income families and the so-called underclass, would make a major contribution to 
closing that gap.

<b><i>Private Science Funding</i></b>

<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The visionary institution builders of the last century 
bequeathed us not only orphanages and schools but observatories and research universities; not only 
institutions to uplift the unfortunate but also ones to explore the universe. Since the end of World War II, 
however, science has become dependent upon government as a funder and direct employer. The results 
have been mixed: We've enjoyed a tremendous expansion of knowledge and suffered the inevitable 
corruption spawned by the bureaucratic process, which favors the cautious, the well-known, and the 
politically connected.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, government is beginning to lose its quasi-
monopoly on scientific funding. Since the explosion of commercial opportunities in the biological sciences, 
Wall Street has become a major source of research money. Meanwhile, the new fortunes of our age, and 
some philanthropic innovators, are creating models for 21st-century scientific philanthropy.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most striking example may be the privatization of the 
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) since Congress defunded it in 1993. With money from such 
technology entrepreneurs as David Packard and William Hewlett (founders of Hewlett-Packard), Paul 
Allen (Microsoft), and Gordon Moore (Intel), the reborn Project Phoenix continues to scan the skies with 
radio telescopes, seeking signs of life.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Quite unlike bureaucracies, the rich are quirky. Their tastes in 
science may be eccentric -- witness the experiment in living known as Biosphere II. And as the MacArthur 
Foundation's "genius grants" demonstrate, they may endow trendy leftism along with innovative, cross-
disciplinary science and true iconoclasm. Such is the trade off we tolerate in exchange for dispensing with 
the application forms, the lobbying, the disciplinary boundaries, and the scientific conservatism of 
government grantmaking.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Wealthy benefactors often have a personal interest in what 
they fund. Michael Milken suffers from prostrate cancer. His millions have energized the search for a cure, 
thanks to quick-turnaround grant-making -- a total of $25 million -- and another $4 million in philanthropic 
"venture capital" to create a consortium for pooling resources and data. I hope we shall see many more 
such experiments.

<b><i>Metropolitan Home</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our fragmented metropolitan areas have come to resemble 
battlefields where national corporations, developers, county planning boards, historical societies, 
environmental lobbies, and neighborhood groups slog it out. City planning nowadays means staking out 
one's own turf and keeping interlopers at bay, be they Wal-Mart, the builders of affordable housing, theme 
parks, or simply development in general. Some have proposed federal regulations to mandate regional 
quotas for housing or to force metropolitan cooperation. The last time we attempted top-down city 
planning was in the 1960s. These disastrous, federally funded renewal programs bulldozed neighborhoods 
and erected acres of public housing -- much of which is now dysfunctional. That is not the way.

<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps the last successful effort to improve American cities 
was the nationwide movement for civic amelioration during the first two decades of this century. The 
movement was spearheaded by business leaders, municipal politicians, social reformers, and architects, and 
found its chief impetus in the American Civic Association, founded in 1903. If only we could find the will 
-- and the spirit -- to develop a civic association for the 1990s.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is not about "saving the cities." Our old, decaying urban 
areas are just part of the problem. Nor is it about recreating a lost urban past. We must first recognize that 
our new metropolitan way of life will take us in new directions. A revived civic association could provide a 
vision for an urban future that seems to be missing today. It would also encourage dialogue among the 
warring metropolitan factions. I propose a national organization with local chapters, bound by the principle 
that only citizens acting locally have the power to improve their surroundings. Communities -- unlike 
markets -- don't just happen; they have to be earned.

<b><i>A Capitalist Labor Movement</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most important private institution created by American 
society in the early decades of the 20th century was the American labor movement. The greatest 
institutional need in American society as the 20th century ends is for a new labor movement.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Though the phrase "cold war" entered the English language after 
World War II, a cold war between democratic capitalism and totalitarian communism had begun decades 
before World War II and lasted for decades after it. Capitalist society won that war for political and 
military as well as economic reasons, but to the extent that victory can be stated in economic terms, it was 
the victory of capitalism's private labor movement over communism's worker state. Communism was never 
militarily defeated, and the hunger in the former communist states for Western-style political democracy is 
moderate. But eventually the most repressive regimes in history were overwhelmed by worker demands for 
the abundance enjoyed by the West.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, the condition of Western workers is in steady 
deterioration for reasons that the early labor movement would be incapable of addressing. Capital is 
organized across national boundaries; labor is not. In an unequal contest, labor grows more disorganized 
and weaker in the West, most especially in the United States, with each passing year. Wages stagnate, 
benefits are eliminated, the work week lengthens, safety conditions worsen.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, capital scours the world for the cheapest, most 
disorganized, most easily exploited labor -- including child labor, prison labor, and even outright slave 
labor. Unless this deterioration can be arrested, we may see once again the desperate conditions that in the 
late 19th century made the worker state seem a reasonable alternative.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What would a new capitalist labor movement -- private, just as the 
first one was private -- look like? I don't know, but thanks to mutual funds and pension plans, stockholders 
and workers are increasingly the same people.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new stockholders have not found a way to collectivize 
and mobilize their capital on behalf of themselves as, simultaneously, labor. If they could do this, they 
might be seen as creating a new kind of labor movement. The strike would not be the tool of choice for this 
labor movement; but if the movement could impose its will in other ways, the middle class that the first 
labor movement played so large a part in creating might begin to recover from its current, precipitous 
decline.

<b><i>Hand Up for Homeless</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Bill Williams was living in the alleys of Long Beach this time 
last year. He was well educated and had exceptional verbal skills, but used his "smarts" to do little jobs 
until he had enough money to buy his drugs for the day. He would "zone out," promising himself that 
tomorrow he would change. This went on for three years.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Finally, one day he called "Info Line" and was told about 
P.A.T.H. (People Assisting the Homeless) in West Los Angeles. He lied about having been drug free for 30 
days and was admitted to Phase I of P.A.T.H.'s residential program.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today he is an account executive at a publication called 
Senior Life. He has his own apartment and drives a company car.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today Bill Williams and hundreds like him are hard-working, 
taxpaying members of society. Why? Because representatives from churches, synagogues, and the business 
community met 10 years ago and decided that they would try to do something to help the growing numbers 
of homeless people gravitating toward the affluent Westside of Los Angeles.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Residents of the P.A.T.H. home-site are required to seek 
employment immediately. They are also obliged to keep the building clean and do their own laundry; in 
return they occupy a room in a newly remodeled building -- a safe and cheerful environment. A tight 
spending constraint limits them to a bus pass and $10 a week for incidental expenses.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Members of the P.A.T.H. community have recently learned to 
write resums, contact potential employers, and acquire computer skills at P.A.T.H.'s Job Access Center 
located in the same building.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While at P.A.T.H., men and women (and children over four) 
live with others who are also determined to change their lives. Peer pressure and support, a small but caring 
staff, an executive director with a "staff sergeant" approach and confidence that "tough love" works -- all 
these contribute to a rehabilitation/success rate that exceeds 90 percent. P.A.T.H.'s board of directors raises 
half its budget in the private sector, and possesses the courage and vision to make P.A.T.H., as one resident 
called it, the "Rolls Royce of homeless programs."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The people who started P.A.T.H. had a dream. Prompted by 
the needs of the community, they decided to help people who had a chance to return to the mainstream. 
Other communities could emulate P.A.T.H. There are many other folks like Bill Williams who need a hand 
up, not a handout.

<b><i>Venture Capital for Charter Schools</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Suppose you believe in the continuing importance of public 
education but deplore the heavy hand of centralized school bureaucracy and reject the Progressive-era 
vision of "the one best system." What do you do? One answer is charter schools -- described by education 
historian Diane Ravitch as "semi-autonomous, public entities that are freed from most bureaucratic rule and 
regulations by state and local authorities in return for a commitment to meet explicit performance goals."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nineteen states now have laws authorizing charter schools, 
and hundreds have come into existence. Still, it's hard to get them launched; high start-up costs discourage 
all but the hardiest parents, teachers, and nonprofits. Here as elsewhere, lowering the barriers to 
entrepreneurship would pay rich dividends in the future.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I'd like to see private institutions emerge in every city to 
provide seed money, on a competitive basis, to local coalitions willing to plan and execute new kinds of 
public schools. The tax code should permit tax credits, up to a limit of (say) $100, for contributions to these 
institutions. Foundations would be important players. I wouldn't rule out public-sector contributions to 
these institutions -- but only in the form of one-time endowments.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fledgling Fund for New York City Public Education, 
while not exactly in this mold, illustrates the possibilities. Of an applicant pool of about 175 would-be 
educational innovators, according to the New York Times, "at least 10 will be awarded start-up grants of 
about $125,000 each, paid in installments over three years." Many others will get technical assistance. And 
dozens of new coalitions, catalyzed by the possibility of early assistance, may choose to proceed even 
without it.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While the debate over vouchers rages across the ideological 
battlefront, can't we come together around the modest but important goal of liberating entrepreneurial 
energy within the public-school sector?

<b><i>A College for My Children</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Inevitably, my most cherished dream involves my three children.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I'd like to believe that by the time they're ready for college 
(the oldest is now nine) there might be a college worth attending, without threatening their sanity and 
decency with the current mania for politically correct lies. There's simply not enough time for my kids to 
count on the sweeping changes that are desperately needed in virtually all the institutions of higher 
education in this country. But we do have a chance to capture (or even to create) one elite college or 
university as a haven and an example.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To accomplish this, traditionalists and conservatives must 
organize and pool their resources. Last year, when Yale University arrogantly returned a $20 million gift to 
Lee Bass because that donation would have required a focus on Western civilization as uniquely worthy of 
attention, I decided that my alma mater could henceforth do without my own modest contributions.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Instead, I would like to combine those resources with funds 
from thousands of other disillusioned university alumni who want to establish an alternative to the trendy, 
libertine, left-wing hegemony of the Ivy League. It's time that loyal graduates of Harvard and Stanford (not 
to mention Vassar and Amherst) woke up to the fact that their admirable and instinctive support for 
institutions that once nurtured them involves not only a tragic waste of money, but the continued 
endorsement of the most destructive forces in American life. Corporations must also recognize that their 
huge contributions to elite educational institutions are funding attitudes and activities that undermine the 
very survival of the free-enterprise system.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those who dissent from the prevailing statist and relativist 
pieties should assemble their resources and use that power to steer one selected institution in a more 
positive direction. Maybe $20 million wasn't enough to influence Yale, but let's try raising the ante, and 
focus on a somewhat smaller target -- say, for the sake of argument, Dartmouth or Williams (two gorgeous 
campuses!). It should be possible at least to install a new administration at an appropriate campus that 
would mobilize the forces of the market and offer a first-class conservative/moderate alternative to the 
prevailing folly. With 30 or 40 elite institutions hewing to an identical left-wing line, wouldn't one 
university, positioned self-consciously toward the right, enjoy an instant competitive advantage, attracting 
the finest students and faculty? And speaking of faculty, if corporations could be persuaded to endow 
chairs generously, think of the intellectual dream team that might be assembled under one academic roof. 
Perhaps one could lure away the brilliant fellows of <a href="/heritage">Heritage</a> (or AEI or Hoover 
or Cato) for a few years of inspired teaching. How about Bill Bennett as president? For key academic 
positions, you could choose Sowell, Stelzer, Bork, Wilson, Kristol (any Kristol), Himmelfarb, Steele, 
Gilder, Williams, Blankenhorn, Whitehead, Elshtain, Arkes, or any number of other intellectual luminaries. 
It's my dream, but you're more than welcome to play the game of filling in the blanks.
<p>
	The remarkable achievements of little Hillsdale College -- in remotest rural Michigan, with only 
1,200 students and no graduate school -- give some indication of the potential for this scheme. Under the 
inspired leadership of President George Roche, Hillsdale has pursued a courageous conservative path, 
refusing all government aid and exerting surprising national influence. It is also earning a constantly 
improving reputation for academic excellence. If no established "big name" campus can be successfully 
coopted, with priceless assets of atmospheric mystique and proud traditions (which are being trashed every 
day), then the resources accumulated for that purpose might well be pumped into the Michigan institution 
to enable it to step boldly into the academic major leagues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Looking at higher education today, there's an obvious 
opportunity. It makes no market sense for every elite institution to target students and professors with the 
same liberal values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By the same token, it makes no market sense for every TV 
network, or news division, or movie studio, to target precisely the same consumers of popular culture. 
There should be room for more wholesome, more conservative alternatives, and money to by made by 
offering them -- but that's another dream. . . .

<b><i>Public-Private Job Training</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If, as President Reagan said, "the best social program devised 
is a job," then those without jobs, or without the skills that employers demand, need some help to acquire 
those skills and join productive society. We need programs that work with the private sector to provide 
well-constructed and economical training in job skills. The best example of this that I know of is "Jobs for 
America's Graduates" (JAG).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	JAG grew out of the successful "Jobs for Delaware's 
Graduates" (JDG), a program I created in 1979 while governor of Delaware. JDG, a nonprofit partnership 
charged with preparing, counseling, and placing high-school seniors in career jobs, was so successful that it 
spawned JAG for the purpose of spreading Delaware's success throughout the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Having helped 175,000 young people, JAG today is one of the 
largest organizations of its kind, and one of the most successful. Ninety percent of the at-risk young people 
enrolled in JAG graduate from school, and within nine months, the proportion that has found a job, enlisted 
in the military, or enrolled in post-secondary education or training is 80 percent -- 30 percentage points 
above the results for non-JAG youths with similar profiles. JAG achieves these results at a cost of just 
$1,200 per participant, less than one-third the average cost of similar programs around the nation. The 
taxes paid by the participants upon joining the workforce more than pay for the program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	JAG works because it is overseen by and responsible to the 
private sector, because its leaders are accountable for results, and because the young people themselves 
must meet the employability standards of businesses and take charge of their lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Supporting America's youth, reducing the cost of social 
programs, and protecting the future base of our taxpayers are good, sound, conservative principles. As we 
approach the 21st century, "Jobs for America's Graduates" puts these principles to work.

<b><i>Report Cards for Schools</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Colin Powell went to public school in the Bronx. Like so 
many other Americans, he owes his start in life to that great institution, free public education. But today, 
not all schools give kids enough chance to succeed. At some public schools in the Bronx, textbooks are in 
such short supply that children have to share in class, and afterward the books are collected and sent down 
the hall to another waiting class. Are spending cuts to blame for the shortage? No.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	From 1980 to 1993, for example, spending on New York City 
public schools increased 148 percent, even though the number of students increased only 3 percent. Even 
after taking inflation into account, New York City spent 37 percent more per pupil in 1993 than in 1980.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Spending on central administration grew almost five times as 
fast as spending for regular classroom teaching. Too much of our education funds went for bureaucrats, not 
books; administrators, not educators; red tape, not learning aids.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The problem is not merely citywide, it is statewide: From 
1980 to 1993, school enrollment in New York declined by 9 percent, but spending shot up by 142 percent. 
School districts spent more and more and taxed local residents again and again. Yet many teachers have to 
reach into their own pockets to pay for classroom supplies.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is not to spend more, but to spend more wisely. A 
school report card would help parents and taxpayers hold school boards accountable for how our scarce 
education dollars are spent and how well students perform. School boards should be required to publish 
one annually on every school under their purview, with figures on spending per pupil and students' 
performance on standardized tests. Parents and taxpayers have a right to know how their schools stack up 
and whether their education dollars are producing results.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	School report cards should be a new addition to an important 
American institution -- public school. Parents, taxpayers, and teachers need to hold school boards and 
elected officials accountable for spending, so that scarce education dollars are used wisely to give every 
child a chance in life.

<b><i>Faithful Professions</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Writing of Americans in the early 19th century, Tocqueville 
observed not that they were great institution-builders nor that they were great organizers, but that they had 
mastered the "science of association," which he thought necessary to the maintenance of civil society itself. 
He chose the term "association" carefully, for it invokes not just the structure through which individuals act 
together, but also the very act of coming together and, for Tocqueville especially, the community of 
opinion and sentiment that collective action at once depends upon and helps to form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I note this because for each of my "dreams," the need is 
clearer than the institutional or organizational means of addressing it. First, I think that achieving peace in 
our current culture wars depends on transcending the hostility toward religion that now seems entrenched 
in the secular professions: law, medicine, journalism, teaching. As a first step, perhaps like-minded 
individuals within the ranks of each profession would associate, dedicated to informing their professional 
activities with the witness of their religious faith. Whether or not such association begins among members 
of the same church or denomination -- though the movement might be stronger if it does -- it must become 
ecumenical, or federative, if it is to succeed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My second hope is that society reestablish respect for the 
vocation of mothers and dissolve the pernicious, ubiquitous social pressure upon mothers to leave their 
children with someone else and go make money. Here the organizational means to the end seem even more 
elusive -- a "Home Makers" on the model of "Promise Keepers" doesn't quite seem fitting -- although the 
freedom of mothers to nourish and nurture requires fathers to resume their duty to provide and protect. 
These tasks involve in no small part recovering the wisdom once embedded in tradition now abandoned, 
and then bringing that wisdom to life in contemporary circumstances. In this, the current wave of 
institution-building differs from the Progressive urge to remake society in the then-clear light of modern 
science, but it also recalls in a way the task that faced Tocqueville's Americans as they marched across an 
untamed continent, bringing civilization as they knew it to a savage land.

<b><i>Motor Trend for Schools</i></b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Twenty years from now, the failures of government-run 
schools will be so obvious that America will have either moved to a voucher system or else be in the 
process of doing so. Yet there are no final victories in politics, so friends of educational choice must work 
over the next 20 years to create a civic infrastructure to nurture this new design for freedom. All Americans 
-- not just parents -- ought to be able to trust that fraud in the educational marketplace will be punished, 
and that educational incompetence will be identified, so that parents can choose to take their children 
elsewhere. Yet because the workings of the invisible hand are so alien to education, voluntary nonprofit 
groups simply must be part of this process.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Inspired perhaps by Margaret Thatcher's prochoice reforms, 
the British government publishes "League Tables," which rate school performance nationwide. Such 
watchdogging can be useful, but the experience of "Goals 2000" in the past six years reminds American 
conservatives that politicians can abuse or even invert any assessment function left in their control.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So America circa 2016 will need a range of nongovernmental 
entities rating schools' performance by various criteria and publicizing their findings. For years, Americans 
have relied on Consumer Reports to help them evaluate everything from potholders to pickup trucks. And 
Money and Motor Trend, to name just two magazines, have both carved out commercial niches for 
themselves as guides to investments and automobiles, respectively. Yet because education will always be 
more than just a commodity, those who would lead America to a renaissance of citizenship should 
encourage religious, fraternal, and neighborhood groupswhether or not they themselves choose to 
participate in the voucher-driven education marketto issue their own report cards on school performance.

<b><i>Group Homes for Welfare Moms</i></b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The best way to reform welfare, as I suggested in <i>The 
Dream and the Nightmare</i> in 1993 and in a series of articles since, requires the creation of a new 
institution -- a national network of communal hostels, or group homes, for welfare mothers and their 
children. Such hostels would focus on the welfare of children, not the job prospects of young women. The 
hostels would provide structured, caring environments for nurturing citizens with consciences and the 
ability to learn. By the time today's underclass children are in Head Start, let alone school, it's very late to 
begin teaching the cognitive and moral categories that are learned in early childhood, that families 
normally teach, and that underclass children don't adequately acquire. Without mastery of these categories, 
it is hard to think, to apply yourself, and therefore to learn.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The hostels should have rules of conduct for the mothers who 
live there, to help them get control of their lives, but above all to ensure the order and structure children 
need. In the same vein, the hostels should require mothers to take daily workshops in child rearing to learn 
some of the basics that young underclass women often don't know: that babies cry because they have 
needs, not because they are "bad"; that children need to be talked to and responded to, not ignored and not 
hit, if they are to grow up able to function as members of society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No doubt such a system will discourage many unmarried 
women unable to support babies from having them -- a worthwhile result. No less important, the smaller 
number of babies born under such circumstances, despite all of society's discouragement, will get a fair 
chance to grow up happy and productive citizens. However sweeping this reform, it must be weighed 
against today's dreadful welfare system, which condemns millions of children to grow up with so much 
human talent unawakened, lost to themselves and to society.

<b><i>A Religious Reawakening</i></b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most of our nation's great problems stem from a decline in 
morality. A string of unbalanced federal budgets nearly four decades long reflects a moral failure to live 
within our means. A rapidly growing $5-trillion national debt evinces the immorality of one generation 
imposing an unpardonable burden on future generations to pay for what essentially amounts to bread and 
circuses. The pretense of the charity of the welfare state represents our immoral struggle to live at the 
expense of others. Part and parcel of this welfare state is the intergenerational extortion of the young and 
yet-to-be-born by older Americans through Social Security and Medicare. Then there is the politics of 
"entitlement" that has spawned unprecedented dependency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Governments cannot patch up the public and private 
imprudence that scars the modern American landscape. The ameliorative action government can take is to 
eliminate those programs and laws that have undermined traditional values and morality. Just as language 
evolved intrinsically, without government direction or control, so did moral or ethical standards. Honesty, 
restraint, self-reliance, and social cooperation evolved as standards because they produced greater 
tranquillity and generated more wealth than their counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much of our moral code has religious roots. Government 
attack on religion, under the contrivance of adhering to the "Establishment Clause," has played an 
important role in the decline of morality. It is religious teachings that bolster the moral standards against 
lying, treachery, deceit, fornication, adultery, confiscation, and instant gratification. Religion promotes 
loyalty to family, friends, and community. Marxists and those in America who see the state as supreme find 
moral relativism far more friendly to their agenda than the absolutism of religion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream of an American moral reawakening will reduce 
both the size and scope of problems we now call on government to solve. The problems that remain will be 
dealt with more compassionately through family, social organizations, and community as they were for 
most of our history.

<b><i>Work Requirements for Public Housing</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream is that sometime soon, the billions of dollars 
invested in public-housing bricks and mortar will be transformed into the sites of regenerated central-city 
working neighborhoods. There is reason to believe we have the ability to bring about such a change. Right 
now, although not a desirable place to live for most families, public housing embodies a large public 
subsidy to each family who benefits from it, equal in many instances to the monthly AFDC cash grant 
itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But although the cash value of a public-housing subsidy 
makes it a boon of sorts, free or almost free housing fosters an attitude that one's apartment unit, and by 
extension the surrounding project, are not worth the effort of maintaining standards. Destructive behaviors 
by residents and those in the surrounding community reinforce and reflect this attitude.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I envision reforms to require work as a condition of living in 
public housing, either in the private sector or in a community-service job to improve one's housing site or 
perform other neighborhood building activities. In the welfare-reform field, we have discovered the power 
of universal work requirements and expectations. In the current environment, individuals improving their 
lives through work are isolated and demoralized by those in the larger dependent environment around 
them. But public-housing sites have the potential to create a controlled physical space where expectations 
of work are enforced. For the formerly idle, enforced work initially may not be pleasant, but at least 
everybody will find themselves in the same boat.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beginning in March, residents of Milwaukee's largest public-
housing project will receive welfare payments only in proportion to required work completed; over time, 
this work requirement will be a condition of their lease as well. Fashioning work requirements to improve 
and build urban communities of the future will be our major challenge.

<b><a name="hig">Heather Higgins</a></b><br>
<b><i>New TV Shows</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	First, I propose two television productions. One would be 
called America's Legal Nightmares, and would expose myriad real-life instances of citizens persecuted by 
the state -- by the EPA, for example, or by Child Protection Services. The second, American Stories, is 
Michael Medved's companion idea; this program would celebrate individuals who have transcended 
personal hardships.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, before we can launch any systematic efforts to develop 
private charity, we must establish a reliable, independent referee of charities' effectiveness and reliability. 
The few organizations that track private charities lack the resources to follow any but the largest ones. 
When they evaluate a charity's finances, they must rely on its own accounting, for which the rules are 
notoriously lax and potentially misleading. We need to establish explicit financial reporting standards for 
501(c)(3) public charities and fund organizations both to evaluate and rate them by Marvin Olasky's 
criteria of effective compassion, and disseminate these findings, perhaps on the Internet.

<b><i>A Revival Parallel to the Evangelicals</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklink.html">Russell Kirk</a> 
wrote, culture arises from the cult. Nonreligious people can be good people, as many a Stoic proved. But 
there never were very many Stoics. Human nature being what it is, most people need a religious foundation 
for their morals, if their morals are to be sound. Only the Transcendent has power enough to overcome 
their natural inclination to "do their own thing."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It follows that if America's culture is to be rescued from the 
sewer into which it has fallen, we need a revival of religion. In theory, a number of religions offer a sound 
moral basis; it should be no surprise that the Confucian cultures of East Asia believe we could learn some 
things from them. But it is difficult to envision Confucianism or another non-Christian religion suddenly 
sweeping America. For reasons of history, if a religious revival is to happen here, it will be Christian. The 
choice is that or nothing.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such a revival has in fact been under way for some time, 
spearheaded by the Protestant Evangelicals. They have done fruitful work, and the fact that there is any 
resistance at all to the destroyers of our culture is largely their doing. However, much of the citizenry 
remains beyond their reach. For many reasons, these people are uncomfortable with either the Evangelical 
message or the Evangelical style. No one is at fault for this; it is a fact of life that people differ.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I dream of an effort parallel to the Protestant Evangelical 
revival, not in competition with it. Both would be aimed at the unchurched, not each other.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The new effort would be led by a real new order; a new religious 
order, similar to older orders such as the Benedictines, the Cistercians, and the like. It would be liturgical, 
apostolic, and sacramental, but it would not be part of any of the four churches with those characteristics 
(the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and orthodox remnants of the Anglicans and Scandinavian 
Lutherans). It would be supported by all of them, it would draw from all of them, and it would be 
recognized as legitimate by all of them. But the key difference is that it would not require anyone to join 
any organization to partake of a liturgical and sacramental religious life led by clergy who were part of the 
apostolic succession. In our sad times, it is probably necessary to say that this new order would adhere 
rigorously to the creeds and the doctrines of the Church as laid down and universally accepted before the 
split of 1054 a.d. And it would preach and practice, within the limits of human frailty, traditional Christian 
morals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It would dismiss with complete disinterest all the turf fights, 
jurisdictional squabbles, historic slights, and other ephemera that stand between the liturgical, apostolic, 
and sacramental church and people hungry for that church. It would thus bolster the sound elements, not 
only within our own culture, but in other nations as well.

<b>Essays by James Q. Wilson & Kathleen Sylvester call for an end to money for teen moms to live on their own</b>
<p> <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
March-April 1996, Number 76</i><hr width=50%></center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sociologist James Q. Wilson proposes that unmarried, pregnant girls live in some type of supervised, privately run group home as a condition of receiving government benefits. This, he argues, would help provide the social structure that young single mothers and their children now lack, but desperately need if they are to escape the cycle of dependence. <a href="#syl">Kathleen Sylvester</a> of the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a> describes a version of this concept that was approved by Congress last fall as part of its welfare reform package. President Clinton vetoed the bill.<p><h3>James Q. Wilson<br><i>Beginning with Our Children</I></h3><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The American political regime as envisioned by its founders was not supposed to have anything to do with character. It was supposed to enable people living in villages and towns to compose their differences at the national level in order to secure a more perfect union and ensure domestic tranquillity and justice. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It was assumed that it was in private associations (family, neighborhood, and peer groups) and small political institutions (village and town governments) that character could be formed, so the national government could take character for granted. "Men," Madison wrote, "are presumed to have sufficient virtue to constitute and maintain a free republic." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Today, by contrast, we are properly concerned with the issue of character, placed on the national agenda by both political parties. Why is it that the assumptions that influenced the men who gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 are no longer the assumptions we bring to the contemplation of the true purpose of our national polity?<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One reason is that government has gotten bigger. As government gets bigger, it touches all aspects of our lives. As it touches all aspects of our lives, we increasingly put our concerns back on the government. The price of big government is an ever-expanding agenda. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Forty years ago, when I began studying politics, it was inconceivable that the federal government would ever be held responsible for crime, drug abuse, illegitimacy, welfare, civil rights, clean air, or clean water. Today it is responsible for all those things. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not only have our aspirations and the size of the federal government changed, but so has our culture. In many spheres of our lives, we are no longer confident that local private institutions like families, churches, and neighborhoods are sufficient to form a culture that will sustain and enrich a free society. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One of the areas in which this concern has become most sharply focused is illegitimacy. An illegitimacy crisis that affects both blacks and whites has been growing without let up since the early 1960s. It has shaped the profound debate now unfolding in Washington about the relationship between federal welfare programs and the very formation and maintenance of families. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When Title IV, which created the program now known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), was added to the Social Security Act of 1935, it was the least controversial part of that landmark legislation. For years after its enactment, it caused scarcely a national political ripple. The reason was that it gave federal support to a few state programs designed to provide short-term compensation to women who had been widowed due to the First World War or coal-mining disasters, or who had been divorced or deserted by husbands. It nationalized these programs by extending them to the other states. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one expected it would become a way of life and no one ever expected teenagers would apply for it. All that has changed. Today, the typical new AFDC enrollee spends only two or three years on welfare and then moves on. It acts as a stopgap measure to provide for the needs of women and children during a particularly difficult time in their lives. This is the group for whom AFDC was originally intended. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But if you look at the total number of welfare recipients, as opposed to those who enter the roles in any given year, you notice that the typical recipient has been on welfare for 10 years. Increasingly, this has extended into second and third generations. Many come and leave quickly, but a few remain. And the number who remain now constitute the largest share of the whole. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There is a spirited debate about why this should be so. I think it is fair to say that no one can confidently claim to know the answer to this question. It is difficult to sustain the argument that the existence of welfare causes dependency if it did not do so during the first 30 years of its history. Evidence about the effect of state differences in welfare payments on rates of welfare participation is inconclusive. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There has probably been a profound cultural shift that has destigmatized illegitimacy and removed barriers that once inhibited people from remaining on AFDC for long periods of time. Even if we assume that the system of public payments did not cause this phenomenon, it certainly makes it possible. If the system did not exist, the current degree of dependency would not exist.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if you disagree with that assertion, the system has surely not cured its own defects. Rates of illegitimacy and single parenthood among black and white Americans have risen steadily since the early 1960s and that trend shows little sign of tapering off. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The harms associated with single parenthood and illegitimacy are now so well documented that the evidence need not be reviewed. But let me give you one example gathered by the government itself. A few years ago, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services selected more than 30,000 households across the country, designed to represent a statistical cross section. They interviewed the mother, father, or both about the welfare of their children. Except for the very highest income level, children raised in single-parent households are materially worse off, irrespective of race. They are worse off in terms of educational achievement, social well-being, aggressiveness, and difficulty with the law. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It should not take massive studies to establish this phenomenon. It is evident to many who confront life in hospital emergency rooms, police stations, juvenile courts, or welfare offices on a daily basis. The problem has crystallized in our concern about the unmarried teenage mother. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If you survey the history of families around the world, every culture has had teenage mothers. Indeed, what is striking today is how long many women wait before having children. But what was different in the past is that those girls gave birth as part of an embedded structure: with a husband, parents, grandmothers, aunts, uncles, and siblings. They were part of an extended family or a village in which there were many people who not only helped take care of the child, but taught the mother to be a mother and required that the father be a father. The debate I hear in Washington about reforming the current system is remarkably inattentive to the core fact that young girls living apart from other adults cannot expect much success at raising children alone. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead, the debate is posing questions such as: How do we save money on the welfare budget? How soon can we require recipients to work? How can we use modern technology to go after deadbeat dads? These may all be worthwhile concerns, but they should be viewed as subordinate to the central goal of saving the children whose lives are being destroyed as a consequence of growing up in this environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To solve this problem, we must ask all levels of government and the private sector to do something American government has never had to do before: constitute and support a viable alternative to the traditional family for the children and young women most at risk. One trembles even to utter the phrase "viable alternative," because in the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition, the king with all his legions stops at the threshold of the hut of the very poorest peasant. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We all understand that government cannot raise children. But there is something out there that is not working and government must change its allocation of incentives to give us a fighting chance of solving the problem. Let me suggest a strategy and then indicate how it might be implemented. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We must get young, unmarried, pregnant girls embedded in a social structure under adult supervision. This not only provides their children with a chance for a good start in life, but teaches them how to be a parent and protect themselves from the desperate conditions of gangs, drugs, and crime that often exist around them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I therefore propose that if young, unmarried, pregnant women wish to establish an independent household at public expense, they should be given this support only on the condition that they live in some kind of family shelter or group home managed under private auspices, including religious groups. Part of the welfare reform debate currently raging in Washington focuses on the so-called Ashcroft Amendment, sponsored by Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment states that nothing in the proposed welfare reform bill shall prevent religious groups from providing social services to welfare recipients on an equal basis with secular groups. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is not clear what is meant by "services," or how funds would be transferred to these groups. But it is sending the message to young women that the character of the children they are raising is so important to this society that we insist they raise them in a truly adult setting provided by one of a variety of private organizations. And we will reinforce this by saying that your check cannot be cashed unless it is cosigned by the person who manages the program. You are free to choose the program -- secular or religious -- you wish to join. But we will not fund you to set up an independent household, given what we know about the harm it does to the children. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Up to this point I have said nothing about the other half of the equation -- the men involved. The riskiest policy for a male observer is to act as if this were a problem created by women that could be solved by placing more constraints on women. But let me clarify a few points from the perspective of someone who has been researching the history of families and fatherhood around the world. Men and women differ in their willingness to make a commitment to the welfare of a child. This can be established by the simple fact that in any culture where there are single-parent families, more than 90 percent of them are headed by women. This cannot happen by accident. If it were simply a matter of cultural convention, you would find places where half or more of single parent families were headed by men. But you do not. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Men and women differ due to evolution, biology, and a variety of other factors. But since women care for children when men will not, much of civilization has been devoted to the problem of disciplining males. Society in all cultures has invented a few techniques to get males to play their role. When I was growing up, young unmarried women who got pregnant had a couple of choices. They either went away to live with relatives, had the child, then returned while the relatives raised the child, or they told their fathers and brothers the identity of the father of the child. The father and brothers then told the boy, "Either you marry the girl or we will beat you to death." The other option for the boy was to run away and join the Navy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; None of those options seems to work anymore. The force of custom and shame is no longer as powerful as it once was. The law once played a role in forcing men to take responsibility by requiring that paternity be clarified. Women once played a role by denying sexual access to men unwilling to make a commitment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If you want to summarize in hyperbolic terms what the core problem of character formation is today, it is that the only one of these forces that still operates is the woman's willingness to say "no." In place of law, we have no-fault divorce. In place of custom and shame, we have created a sense that everyone should "do his own thing." And fathers and brothers, far from beating up someone who has impregnated a daughter without marrying her, are themselves busy with other people's daughters. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, this leaves the burden on women. But women should not bear the burden alone; the state should be on their side. To the extent it can, it is desirable for the state to enforce the obligations of paternity. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This has proven to be extremely difficult. For several years, particularly since Congress passed the Family Support Act in 1988, programs have been in place to get states to devise ways of collecting child-support payments from absent fathers. Many states have vigorously pursued the fathers, but have not collected much money. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But again we are moving away from the core problem. The key is not to supply dollars, but to supply the father. It is his presence, not just his money, that has been lost. The average child raised by a mother only sees his father a few times a year. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The problem of reconstituting this character-forming institution cannot be solved by government. But I would suggest that just as we have formed and are encouraging charter schools, we should form and encourage "charter families" --  private-sector groups that are willing to accept government money to provide long-term shelters for young girls who cannot or will not live with their own parents and who have children with no fathers to take care of them. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I have no idea whether this will work. But we must encourage this type of experimentation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Money is going to flow from Washington to the states in the form of block grants. With some degree of restriction, states will have the opportunity to design and implement their own welfare programs. Most states will reproduce less expensive forms of the current system. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But I hope the states will use this opportunity to tear up the old script. Leave the existing system intact for women who need it as a bridge to get through death, desertion, or divorce, and will leave welfare in two or three years. But provide a radically different option, privately run and with a built-in social structure, for those young girls who are now raising the next generation of our children. <P><I><b>James Q.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1863, President Lincoln signed a charter establishing a home for orphans and "unprotected females" --  as unwed mothers were then known -- just a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Last September, during the Senate's contentious welfare-reform debate, there was a rare moment of bipartisan agreement as Senate Democrats were joined by Mr. Lincoln's party in nearly unanimous support of a similar institution: the "second-chance home." In an amendment later adopted by the House of Representatives, the U.S. Congress went on record in support of reviving an old institution -- the maternity home -- in a new form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Second-Chance Home amendment, offered by Democratic Senators Kent Conrad and Joseph Lieberman, would provide $150 million in seed money for states to support community-based residences for welfare mothers under 18. Young women whose own families are unstable would be required to live under adult supervision in these homes with their children as a condition of receiving welfare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This provision was included in the welfare-reform bill vetoed by President Clinton. But the idea and its principles already are attracting broad support. States and communities are not waiting for federal funding. The "second-chance home" may become a new social institution. And even more importantly, it may offer a model for partnerships between government and communities that restore values to social programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One reason that second-chance homes are becoming popular is that they are practical. They are designed to deal with the realities of teen mothers' lives rather than the stereotype that they are simply promiscuous young women having babies to get welfare checks. Remember, these women have been badly nurtured. Many have been subjected to neglect or physical violence. Studies show that as many as two-thirds were victims of rape or sexual abuse at an early age-crimes often committed by males living in the same household. Many suffer from mental and emotional problems. They are easy prey for older men. The Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that almost two-thirds of teenage mothers' babies are fathered by men who are 20 or older.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the life prospects of teenage mothers are severely limited by their lack of socialization: They raise their children as their parents raised them; they model their social behavior after peers from the same neighborhoods. They have few role models for any other life.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For many of these young women, it will take a new home and a new family -- a second-chance home. Communities as varied as Los Angeles, New Albany, Indiana, and Wheeling, West Virginia, are offering such homes. There are several hundred of them around the country, mostly privately funded. While the homes differ in structure, they all offer three common elements that teen welfare mothers need to change their lives: socialization, nurturing and support, and structure and discipline.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These homes offer a genuine social contract. The young mothers must help with household duties, stay in school or job training, and take good care of their children. They must stay drug free and abide by curfews. They learn to manage money and manage conflicts. In return, they get help with day care and health care and schoolwork. They get protection from violent family members and abusive boyfriends. Most importantly, the teen mothers receive the support of caring adults and lessons in everyday living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The notion that government has a fundamental obligation to help these young mothers is one Democrats have long supported. But the idea these young women owe society a reciprocal obligation is one that some in the party have resisted. The welfare debate signaled a change: Many Democrats are ready to abandon the moral relativism that has characterized liberal social policy. While those on the party's far left still argue for an unfettered right to public support, a growing number of Democrats are willing to impose standards on welfare mothers, sending a powerful message that society no longer offers unconditional financial support for women who bear children out of wedlock. Senator Lieberman, in offering his amendment, called a system that supports the birth of children to young unwed mothers "profoundly troubling" and one that "does not reflect the best values of our country." Many Democrats, it seems, are ready to reassert the importance of values in social policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Republicans have traditionally been more comfortable talking about values, but less willing to acknowledge a basic government role in assuring the welfare of citizens in need. And to be sure, many conservative Republicans -- those who would cut off public aid to teen mothers under 18 -- still take the callous and wrongheaded view that the fundamental goal of welfare reform is to punish illegitimacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But Democrats and Republicans in a number of states -- including Massachusetts, Iowa, Maryland, and California -- are working together to create second-chance homes. If these political leaders are wise, they will continue on their bipartisan path: They will support the Democrats' assertion of a fundamental role for government in social problems, and they will heed the Republicans' insistence on the importance of values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whose values? The values of communities. If second-chance homes are created as real "community-based" institutions, they will begin to remedy one of the unintended consequences of the New Deal. For when government assumed primary responsibility for poor families, communities were relieved of obligations to care for their own citizens, and the notion of social reciprocity disappeared. Government became a wedge between communities and individuals, providing each group excuses to ignore its obligations to the other.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second-chance homes should not be "government-run" or purely government-funded. They should be run by community-based institutions, including churches and non-profit organizations. That is how the most effective homes for teen mothers are now run. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Teen Parent Residence in Albuquerque, New Mexico, offers an example. The program, based in a cluster of low-income apartment units subsidized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, costs the state just $67,500 for services to 14 teen mothers and their children for one year. The young mothers, who are enrolled in the federal Job Corps, use their welfare checks to pay below-market rent for the apartments they share. The state pays for an apartment in the cluster for the resident "house mother," for a night-duty nurse, and for some professional counseling services. Virtually everything else comes from the community.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The local health clinic teaches the young mothers about child development. The Agricultural Extension service teaches nutrition classes. Local youth groups offer baby-sitting services. Albuquerque's Hispano Chamber of Commerce not only donates money to the program, it hires the program's graduates. Families from local churches take the mothers and children home for Sunday dinner-and sometimes to Sunday services as well. The young women and children who live in the Teen Parent Residence have become part of the community. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is possible, of course, to spend much more money on residential facilities for young mothers. In New York state, group homes staffed and run entirely by professionals cost more than $50,000 a year per mother and child. While this approach guarantees uniform standards, it also guarantees that the young mothers will live in isolation from their communities. These expensive, bureaucratic institutions reinforce the old paternalistic notion of the left that government can invent a program to solve every problem. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Second-Chance Home legislation takes an important step away from bureaucratic rigidity by specifying that beneficiaries of federal programs can't be discriminated against if they live in these group homes. This means, for example, that young mothers won't lose their food-stamp benefits if they cook and eat together -- something current food-stamp regulations prohibit. In practical terms, it means that a small community-based organization that wants to help four or five teen mothers won't have to apply for federal waivers so young women can keep their food-stamp income and use it to buy groceries for the home. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now as welfare decisions shift to state policymakers, they, too, must resist urges to overregulate and micromanange. Governors and legislators deciding how to set policies for second-chance homes should use these principles for guidelines:
<p><ul><li>	Funding should be used as Congress intended -- as seed money. It should go only to communities that pledge broad community involvement and a match of in-kind services.<p>
<li>	Churches and other religiously affiliated institutions have a long history of service to families; these organizations should be eligible for public funding to continue providing services.<p>
<li>	Evaluate them on what they accomplish. Judge the homes by the number of mothers who don't get pregnant a second time, the number who finish school, and the number who get off welfare. This would allow providers to help teen mothers by whatever means work. <p>
<li>	Government's monopoly over social policy is quickly eroding. In response to this change, government must offer communities a new "bargain." Government must catalyze and support the efforts of communities. At the same time, government policy should be consistent with a declaration by our nation's civic, moral, and community leaders that it is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and men to make babies they cannot support. In this way, government can help reestablish the importance of values -- those of communities and families -- in social policy. That is the best way to define a social agenda for the next century.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;St. Ann's, the institution that Lincoln chartered, still operates today just outside of Washington, D.C. And though the lives of its residents are vastly different from its first beneficiaries, they still meet Lincoln's definition of "unprotected females." They are still young women who need society's support to make decent lives for their children. Politicians of both parties who revere Lincoln should heed his wisdom.<p><I><b>Kathleen Sylvester</b> is the vice president for domestic policy at the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a>.</I>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Over the past few decades, government welfare programs have 
been designed to lift the burden of caring for the poor from ordinary people, by allowing them to write a 
check to pay the professionals who would solve problems. It is time for government to reassert a healthy 
pressure on the American people: Congress should phase out federal-assistance programs and push states to 
develop ways for individuals and community-based groups to take over poverty-fighting responsibility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our predecessors understood the Constitutions charge to 
provide for the common defense but to promote the general welfare -- by ensuring an environment within 
which individual and community action could flourish. When, for example, Congress in 1854 passed a bill 
for federal construction and maintenance of mental hospitals, President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bill. 
Should this bill become law, that Congress is to make provision for such objects, the foundations of 
charity will be dried up at home, he said.


<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Pierce's veto was sustained. His concern about dried up 
charity was typical of the era: Municipal aid to the poor could dry up private charity; state relief could dry 
up city aid; federal programs could dry up state efforts. Hardly the way to promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the mood of that era -- not to mention the Constitutional 
vision for addressing social needs -- has been lost. The concept of the modern welfare state placed 
responsibility for fighting poverty not at the lowest level but the highest. National entitlement programs 
came to dominate the social-services scene. The reversal of Pierces doctrine was so complete that even 
conservatives in the 1980s, who favored reducing the growth of welfare programs, still talked of the 
importance of maintaining a federal safety net. They did not understand that the federal safety net was not 
only inefficient, but conceptually mistaken.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<I>What?</I> Criticize the safety net itself? Yes. When I took 
my children to the circus recently, I realized how infrequently the Ringling Brothers safety net is used. For 
an acrobat, a fall to the safety net is a failure; if he falls stunt after stunt, he will be fired. Most people 
during the Depression had the psychology of the acrobat: The newly installed federal safety net was to be 
used only when the choice was between it and a hole in the ground. But over time, as attitudes softened and 
welfare programs expanded, that desire to avoid using the safety net was often lost. The destigmatizing of 
welfare in the 1960s meant that the acrobats no longer needed to strain for those extra inches, because the 
audience would still applaud even if they fell into the safety net every time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What America needs is not a safety net but a vast variety of 
small trampolines, suited to individual needs, movable so as to be present for individual crises, and 
providing a level of bounce fitted to the skill level and psychology of the individuals they are designed to 
save. Governments role under such a plan is clear: Get rid of constraints on the construction and 
movement of trampolines, and -- if it does not appear that enough trampolines will be produced -- provided 
incentives to get more. In that way, government can promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What would this mean in terms of practical policy? Nothing 
short of a revolutionary proposal: We must place in the hands of state officials all decisions about welfare 
and the financing of it, and then press them to put welfare entirely in the hands of church- and community-
based organizations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Under this radically decentralist proposal, Congress would 
acknowledge that even the block-grant concept violates common sense -- far better to leave the money in 
the states in the first place. Congress would acknowledge that block grants reduce accountability, for the 
goal of block grants is to free state governments from centralized control, but it also tends to free them 
from taxpayer control because the funds are viewed as free money blown in from Washington. Congress 
would acknowledge that block grants tend to breed scandal; without real accountability to either the 
national capital or the states citizenry, funds are wasted and pressure mounts for Congress to attach not 
just strings but ropes to hold the sides of the box together.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In this scenario, a bold Congress, pushed hard by the 
newcomers of 1994 and 1996, would not fall into the same old trap and recentralize. Instead, Congress 
would pass, effective at the end of the block-grant era, a massive tax cut, with federal taxes decreasing by 
the amount no longer block-granted. (A side benefit: If Congress moves toward a flat tax, the tax rate could 
be set lower than is currently anticipated.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States would then use their own taxing authorities to implement 
new programs, or duplicate the old ones if they choose to do so. If a new Congress were to make that 
decision in 1997, states would have four years to plan for the post-federal welfare era. They could tax 
residents adequate amounts to care for the poor, but provide incentives for citizens to contribute sizable 
amounts of time or money to local poverty-fighting charities by providing exemptions to the new tax.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is not as if a dollar-for-dollar replacement for the $350 billion 
annual cost (in 1994) of federal and state welfare spending (70 percent of it coming from Washington) is 
necessary: We know that much money is wasted and worse than wasted, actually causes harm. Yet, if more 
trampolines are needed, we should not be opposed theoretically to governments, once they have worked to 
reduce barriers, also working to promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The best way for legislatures to do this would be to offer the 
average taxpayer a deal as follows: Come the year 2001, under the Welfare Replacement Act of 1997, 
your federal tax burden will be reduced by an average of $3,000. We certainly do not want to be accused of 
being cruel or mean-spirited, so we will raise state taxes by an average of $2,500. However, we also want 
to promote personal involvement with community-based organizations that offer effective compassion to 
the poor, and if you provide to such an organization a combination of money and time totaling at least 
$3,000 -- thus leaving the quantity of societal commitment to the poor unchanged -- you will be exempt 
from the new tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This would obviously represent a sweeping change from the 
current system. Now, taxpayers who itemize can deduct from their taxable income the contributions they 
make to a wide range of religious, charitable, and educational organizations, at their marginal tax rate (the 
lowest is 15 percent, the highest is 39.6 percent). This is helpful, but not good enough, and movement 
toward a flat tax might eliminate that deduction anyway. Under the new system proposed here, states 
would push taxpayers in a massive way to become involved with groups that provide direct social services 
to the poor, and offer exemption from taxation for such purposes to those who were helping others in their 
own way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At least 11 critical questions about such a revolutionary 
departure from current practice immediately arise:
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>What percentage of taxpayers would choose to support local 
charities and thereby gain exemption?</I></b> That is very difficult to predict, but with four years of 
preparation it is likely that many would, resulting in a tremendous boost to nonprofit finances and a large 
increase of citizen involvement. Those who did not become involved would pay the new tax, and states 
could use that fund to pay for any missing trampolines.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Would church-based and community-based organizations be 
ready to expand or replicate themselves in order to make use of their new resources in a new 
century?</I></b> They would have time to prepare, and the encouragement of a new system would blow 
away the compassion fatigue that has built up over the years. 
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Would acceptance of exemption-creating contributions force 
poverty-fighting charities to accept governmental control?</I></b> At the moment, charitable 
organizations that seek government grants come under government oversight; some church-related 
programs have gained financially but lost their souls in the process. Even nonreligious charities accepting 
public funds have been forced to treat all of their clients bureaucratically, within the parameters set by law 
and regulation, rather than dealing with each human being on an individual basis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The advent of new tax exemptions would not automatically 
free up religious groups and other community-based institutions to participate as equals in the social 
services sector. Despite precedents set by the GI Bill and other programs that allowed consumer choice, the 
ACLU would not be amused by the removal of secular liberalism from its established, privileged place.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Still, the offer of an exemption (signifying a right not to pay 
because of other services rendered) is as clear a hands-off statement as a legislature can make. Exemptions 
offer a greater degree of protection than deductions, credits, or especially vouchers, since the latter requires 
government not only to overlook revenue but to send out checks. A political coalition strong enough to 
obtain tax exemptions should be strong enough to keep them from being abused by antireligious zealots.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Wouldnt some exemptions from taxation go for funds sent to 
phony, needless, or simply ineffective projects? Wouldnt these cases be cited by partisans of the 
welfare state as reasons for opposing the exemption system?</I></b> Certainly, and those cases would 
make an impact on people who are startled to find that some among their fellow human beings are foolish, 
incompetent, or gullible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Markets work not because everyone exercises perfect 
judgment, but because, on balance, most people make good judgments most of the time. Even with all the 
anticipated human error, a charitable sector in which the funds are allocated by individual private decisions 
is likely to be less wasteful than the current system. Besides, with more resources at stake, more careful 
analysis of charitable effectiveness is likely to become common. Publications that examine charities the 
way a Consumer Reports examines products would emerge.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Wouldnt acceptance of volunteer time as part of the 
exemption-creating contribution open the door to fraud?</I></b> It is true that proof regarding the 
giving of money tends to be clearer than that concerning time, the valuation of which can be complicated. 
Still, emphasis on the crucial meaning of compassion -- suffering with -- is vital, and a plan that provides 
incentives for contribution of money but not time is incomplete.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many groups already keep records of volunteer hours, so 
bookkeeping would not be an insurmountable problem. Corruption could be kept to a minimum by keeping 
the general credit for exemption purposes at the level of the minimum wage -- enough to provide a bit of 
compensation for work time lost and to signify societal commitment to compassionate action, but not 
enough to promote widespread cheating.
<P>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>What would happen to health care for the poor?</I></b> 
Medicaid is the single biggest element of current federal and state welfare expense; of the $324 billion that 
federal and state agencies spent on welfare in 1993, $132 billion went for that one program. And yet, many 
cities have free or sharply-reduced-price clinics where some dedicated doctors and nurses volunteer their 
time. What can governments do to help such organizations?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Jackson, Mississippi, the Voice of Calvary Family Health 
Center sees about 8,000 patients each year, and would like to expand its operations or start other clinics 
like it. Center director Lee Harper contrasts her clinic with higher-budgeted state operations and concludes, 
When you have more money, you tend to waste more. Still, she needs more funds. Job one, however, is 
getting more hours from volunteer doctors, dentists, and nurses. If we get the health professionals, well 
get the money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such an urgent need translates into a specific proposal that 
could be implemented at the federal level in lieu of all the macro-reform proposals of the 1990s: Give 
medical professionals tax credits for hours regularly worked at clinics. If a typical doctor, dentist, or nurse 
worked one day every two weeks at a clinic or in a similar way spent time to provide health care to poor 
individuals, billions of dollars in medical expenses could be saved. Participating health personnel, in 
return, could receive a tax credit equivalent to 10 percent of their salaries. Such a credit could be the 
cornerstone of the personal alternative to bureaucratic health-care plans that are rightly regarded with 
skepticism.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why substitute a state tax (with exemptions) for a federal 
one? Why not simply reduce taxes and allow individuals to spend the money as they see fit?</I></b> 
Advocates of individual rather than governmental responsibility have the personal emphasis right, but will 
a reliance merely on individual goodwill and effort lead to the production of enough trampolines? For 
those who emphasize original sin rather than natural goodness, there is a middle ground between 
government and individual: Call it societal responsibility, within which government requires payment but 
leaves to the individual taxpayer how the money shall be spent.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Will it be possible to restrict tax-exempting contributions to 
those organizations that are actually engaged in fighting poverty and its associated 
pathologies?</I></b> In some cases the correct category will be obvious, but in others careful judgment 
will be required. For example, it would seem that general donations to a college or a private school should 
not be used for exemption purposes, but donations to a college or school scholarship fund for poor students 
should be. General donations to a church should not produce an exemption, but those to the churchs 
specific poverty-fighting endeavors (an anti-addiction program for example) should be. General donations 
to a hospital should not; donations to a free or reduced-rate clinic for the poor should.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such categorization would be necessary, even though it could 
cut into the individual flexibility that straightforward tax reduction would allow. No matter how carefully 
state legislatures define the new tax category for poverty-fighting organizations, officials would have to 
write and apply regulations implementing the new tax. That authority potentially could allow a state 
agency to exclude organizations that it did not favor for ideological, theological, or political reasons. Some 
organizations might change what they do and the way they do it in order to conform to the regulatory 
standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such a threat does not mean that the new system could not 
work. It does mean that eternal vigilance will continue to be the price of liberty.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why not rely on pure voluntarism to do what is 
necessary?</I></b> The seeds of welfare replacement are already planted; if we wish to move quickly 
enough to save a generation of children during the first decade of the 21st century, those seeds need lots of 
water. If men were angels, no incentives for goodness would be necessary, but devolution to the states and 
further devolution through an exemption system is a good way for human beings to shift resources from 
the public sector to the private sector. Such a shift would provide a pool of capital for worthy charities to 
use in replicating themselves and thus replacing the welfare state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stimulation of voluntarism through tax exemption is an 
impure tactic, but our predecessors in this country, with their realistic view of human nature, were not 
above using impure motives to promote virtue. Colonial settlers who took in a poor person received 
compensation from the township, and some of them may occasionally have profited a bit (although that 
would be more than made up for by the time they spent mentoring the needy person). A farm family that 
adopted an orphan gained a farm hand, though the economic advantage was outweighed by the hard task of 
being new parents to someone who had grown up under tough conditions.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why require $3,000 to receive the exemption from payment 
of $2,500?</I></b> If some people hesitate to give (in money or minimum-wage time) the greater amount 
necessary to receive an exemption, that is fine; the quality of their giving would probably be low. Some 
personal contribution by the taxpayer is important to build a sense of involvement with and responsibility 
for the work of the charitable organization. The goal is to have as many taxpayers as possible think through 
their giving, and not merely respond to direct-mail appeals.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why would taxpayers be expected to make better decisions on 
groups to support than government officials have?</I></b> Competition has made the American 
economy the strongest in the history of humanity, and the American political system the envy of the world. 
The American people have proven themselves capable, on average and over the long haul, of making good 
economic and political judgments. Taxpayers who invested $500 of their own money and time in order to 
direct $2,500 to satisfying projects would be likely to make equally good judgments in the charitable 
sphere.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Decisions about where funds shall go would no longer be a 
function of political struggles over the budgets of government agencies, but would result from the 
decisions of millions of individual donors. Independent charitable organizations would for the first time in 
generations be on a level playing field with those groups favored by government. Some errors would 
occur, but there is every reason to expect this system of delivering assistance to the needy to be far more 
effective than the current model of top-down government monopoly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Yes, some innovators would fail, but isnt it better to win a 
football game 50-14 than to play so defensively as to fall into a 3-3 tie? Given the growing number of 
damaged children and ruined adults under our current regime, isnt it better to take the rational risks that 
could liberate millions, rather than suffer constant winter without Christmas?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, decentralization offers the best shot for each state to 
innovate in the way that is right for its unique population and specific problems. Since we do not know 
precisely which legislative plan would best promote the offering of individual compassion, an emphasis on 
state-level action maximizes the opportunity to find out for sure which tactics work best. Furthermore, 
there may be greater opportunity to move quickly in some states than in Washington.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While each state would have to sort out its particular 
problems, all must face, for example, rising rates of illegitimacy. Abstinence programs are a start. When 
pregnancy nevertheless results and marriage does not, states should foster group-living arrangements for 
women while pregnant and during the year or two afterwards, so that those who would otherwise be alone 
will have a support network. States should challenge biases against adoption, and stress the advantages to 
the child of adoption at birth (or up to age two, at the latest). Having a baby out of wedlock should not 
bring with it the reward of any governmental cash payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No public-policy measure can take the place of the personal 
changes that are necessary to raise high the standard of American compassion. With supportive laws and 
rules compassionate individuals can make real progress toward reducing some of our most serious social 
pathologies, but the crucial change is still the one that goes on in each individual soul, not in the federal or 
state capitols.

<h2>In the Trenches of A City's War on Poverty</h2>
<b>by Kim A. Lawton</b>
<p><p><P></center>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For Marcia, release from a California prison was 
both a blessing and a curse: She suddenly had to figure out how to care for herself and her infant 
son. An abuser of heroin and cocaine for more than 20 years, she had few job skills or prospects. 
She had been on welfare, but balked at returning to that treadmill. And if she checked into a drug 
treatment program, she probably would be separated from her baby. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I knew that I was going to begin using [drugs] again . . 
. and I knew that I didn't want to do that," says Marcia, who asked not to be fully identified. "I 
just was tired of it all." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then she heard about House of Grace, a residential 
program in San Jose for abused, homeless, or addicted women. It is one of the few recovery 
programs in the county that allows mothers to stay with their children. As soon as Marcia and her 
son moved into the program's renovated apartment complex in December 1994, house director 
Denise Lutcher got actively involved in her life. Lutcher and her staff went to work assessing 
Marcia's physical, emotional, vocational, and spiritual needs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For residents like Marcia, that list of needs is 
usually long. Women receive counseling, attend recovery classes, complete their education, and 
learn life skills such as managing a budget and caring for their children. But they must also 
follow a clear set of rules. They must wean themselves from welfare and other government aid 
within six months. They are permitted no televisions or telephones in their rooms. A resident 
who fails her weekly drug test just once faces immediate expulsion. And the women must attend 
Bible classes and chapel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The program helped me to get a hold of my life 
because of the tools they teach," says Marcia. Today, at 42, she is entering the final phases of her 
recovery program at the House of Grace. She has enrolled in a local college, where she is earning 
top grades in a program on computing and information systems. She holds a part-time job. Her 
son, now two, is flourishing in a community with other stable parents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	House of Grace typifies the strategy -- and the 
success -- of a community-based and religiously rooted approach to helping the urban poor. It is 
one of several programs set up by CityTeam Ministries, a private, nondenominational Christian 
agency working in the inner city of San Jose. Last year, CityTeam administered a budget of $7 
million and a staff of nearly a hundred, and provided intensive, on-going help to more than 5,000 
individuals and families -- all without a dollar of public funds. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As noted in a recent Hudson Institute report, the 
agency has transformed itself to meet the changing social needs of San Jose. As the city grew 
from a small industrial town in the 1950s to a world technology capital, it drew thousands of 
poor Anglo, Vietnamese, and Latino families, out-of-work laborers, gangs, and crack addicts. 
Meanwhile, CityTeam evolved from a homeless shelter for white, middle-aged alcoholic men 
into a comprehensive program for homeless and drug-addicted women, children at risk, and 
entire families living in or on the edge of poverty. And it has done so by mobilizing an army of 
volunteers and donors, energizing a committed and innovative staff, and applying an intensive, 
holistic approach to solving problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Each of CityTeam's programs combines a 
philosophy of compassionate intervention mixed with strict accountability, an emphasis on long-
term changes in destructive behavioral patterns, and a strong religious underpinning. The Bible is 
the main guide both to morality and to practical living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While some state agencies were devoting a lot of 
time and money to providing the homeless with food and housing, CityTeam began to focus on 
drug and alcohol addiction -- which it considers the root causes of most homelessness -- and in 
1983 established a residential recovery program. While most state-funded recovery programs last 
about 30 days, CityTeam staff believe more time is needed for permanent changes; participants 
remain in recovery programs for between 18 and 24 months. And while government-supported 
rehabilitation programs demand that staff members have degrees in social work, the rescue 
mission's house manager is himself a former crack addict and a graduate of the group's recovery 
and Christian training programs; he's now completing his master's degree.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Field workers realized that preventing addiction 
meant reaching children before they began using drugs. From this insight emerged a youth 
program that includes Camp May-Mac, a summer camp for at-risk inner-city children. 
Throughout the year, CityTeam keeps about a thousand kids busy with regular recreational 
activities, neighborhood clubs, tutoring, leadership development, and Bible studies. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even here their approach is unconventional: The 
group's youth workers actually move into the troubled neighborhoods of east San Jose in order to 
build stable relationships with children at risk. CityTeam President Pat Robertson says kids know 
where the organization's workers live and know that they can reach those workers anytime, day 
or night. "[We] are not just commuting in and out," he says. "The problems of the community are 
our problems."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Whole families are helped through the agency's 
family-relief center, where counselors distinguish urgent and immediate needs from long-term, 
underlying issues. Volunteers distribute food, clothing, and furniture, provide rent assistance, 
assemble holiday food boxes and kits of school supplies, and teach English as a second-language 
to Spanish and Vietnamese residents. Volunteers also act as unofficial caseworkers, following up 
with client families. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Harry Brown, the vice president for administration, 
says CityTeam's extensive volunteer network enables the agency to provide a level of support 
and personal help that rivals publicly funded programs in the city. CityTeam volunteers -- about 
3,000 in any year -- are involved in everything from baby-sitting to tutoring to prayer. Most 
volunteers are recruited through local churches or ads. While some volunteers work only once a 
year, others offer a regular commitment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CityTeam applies the same targeted grass-roots 
approach to fundraising as it does to delivering social services. Most staff members spend up to 
eight hours a week fundraising, providing the agency with about 40,000 active donors -- an 
impressive base for a local charity -- with average contributions of less than $200. "It's Joe and 
Sally Smith at 50 bucks a month who sustain our organization," says Brown. "It's possible 
because there are a large number of stakeholders who believe in the goal and are willing to 
participate in the process."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to a 1995 study by Independent Sector, 
an umbrella group for nongovernmental organizations, most private charities rely heavily on 
direct government subsidies. But Robertson says that because of CityTeam's strong religious 
emphasis, the ministry consistently refuses to accept any government aid, which imposes rules 
against proselytizing clients and discriminating among job applicants. At CityTeam, all staff 
members must share the agency's evangelical Christian beliefs; most programs require 
mandatory chapel attendance or Bible studies and encourage involvement in local churches. "We 
focus on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ and how that influences life on a practical 
level," says Curt Floski, the director of the Rescue Mission and Recovery Program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Staff members say the religious component, with its 
emphasis on personal transformation, is indispensable. An internal 1992 study seems to 
corroborate that: Of the men who had graduated from CityTeam's addiction-recovery program 
between 1986 and 1992, more than 60 percent were still "working and clean and sober." National 
experts have found that among low-income and low-education groups -- the agency's principal 
client population -- recovery success rates typically remain below 16 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Can the CityTeam approach be duplicated in other 
urban areas? The group launched a branch outside Philadelphia in the mid-1980s, and it has 
earned high marks from community leaders. "They have done more to end human suffering in 
Chester [Pennsylvania] than any other organization I know of," says Jack Holefelder, the 
president of the Delaware County Chamber of Commerce.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In San Jose, CityTeam has established the 
International Center for Urban Training. Through seminars, instructional manuals, and work in 
agency projects, trainees learn about the group's holistic service philosophy. The staff also teach 
techniques for fundraising, volunteer recruitment, strategic planning, public affairs, and 
government relations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Officials say they are committed to developing 
models of ministry that can be broadly replicated to help the poor. "One of the things you find is 
that needs out there are relatively common, and the solutions that apply to them also have 
relatively common applications," Brown says. "You have to have a set of core values [relevant] 
to the issues, and then you have to consistently implement those values." And the vital dynamic, 
Robertson says, is personal involvement and intervention: "Programs are best done at the local 
level when you can look people eyeball to eyeball." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The people who challenged Marcia to change made 
a crucial difference in her life. For the first time, she says, she learned that she possessed both 
abilities and responsibilities -- and that it was time to offer them to her family and community. 
Now she spends her evenings teaching "life skills" seminars to other women living at the House 
of Grace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Marcia learned it was possible to walk away from a 
life of addiction, and she has remained drug free. And most importantly, she says, she acquired a 
spiritual foundation for her life. "It's everything that I needed," she says, "things that I lacked for 
so long, or that I was too medicated to even realize were missing."

<H2>Charities on the Dole</h2>

<b>by Kimberly Dennis</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Those who expect Americas charities to replace government as a 
provider of social welfare ought to look a little closer. They will find that the so-called independent sector, 
which receives between one-quarter and one-third of its funds from taxpayers, isnt so independent after 
all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In fact, many social-service agencies actually receive most of their 
funding from government. Save the Children owes 60 percent of its budget to the generosity of taxpayers, 
Catholic Charities 65 percent, CARE 78 percent, and the United Cerebral Palsy Association more than 80 
percent. Topping this list is the inaptly named Volunteers of America, which receives 96 percent of its $51-
million budget from government sources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal government now channels $39 billion a year in grant 
money through nonprofits. New Yorks social-service economy employs more people than Wall Street. 
Private social-service agencies actually represent the city governments largest group of vendors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The governmentnonprofit complex doesnt just consume taxpayer 
money. It uses that money to lobby for government programs that would consume even more taxpayer dollars. Congressmen <a href="http://www.house.gov/istook/welcome.html">Ernest Istook</a> and David McIntosh have drawn widespread attention to this problem through their efforts to limit federal  
financing for nonprofits that engage in political advocacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We now know that the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which must share some of the blame for our teetering Social Security system, received $74 million in 
government funds in 1994. The Environmental Defense Fund, an advocate of stringent business regulation, 
got $500,000 in government support. The National Council of Senior Citizens, which received $71 million 
courtesy of taxpayers, recently spent much of its energy lobbying Congress on behalf of President 
Clintons health-care proposals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tax-funded nonprofits also compete with the very profitmaking 
businesses whose taxes support them. In Pennsylvania, a nonprofit hospital that receives government funds 
operates a marina. In New York, government-funded housing competes with private development, and 
homeless shelters crowd out cheap single-room-occupancy residences. In our nations capital, George 
Washington University, a nonprofit institution that receives public funds, operates a hotel and a restaurant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nonprofits that compete with businesses to provide of goods and 
services take advantage of tax exemption in many ways. In 1993, the Childrens Television Workshop 
received $22.5 million in tax-free royalties from the sale of Sesame Street products. A Sesame Street store 
just opened in an Indianapolis mall; one can only wonder how the owners of the toy shop a few doors away 
feel about losing business to a store that generates tax-free revenues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The independent sectors natural affinities should lie with the business 
sector. After all, its vitality depends on the wealth business creates. But as more and more support for 
nonprofits is channeled through government, the independent sectors allegiances have shifted to Capitol 
Hill and the federal bureaucracy. It is not just that these institutions think their well-being (and hence 
societys) depends on a generous government. They also view for-profit ventures as second-rate, morally 
inferior, and perhaps even evil. Theyd rather see people eat in a soup kitchen than in a diner, live in a 
habitat for humanity than in a trailer park.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are, of course, many small, innovative, and values-driven grass-
roots charities that are addressing human needs much more efficiently than failed federal programs and 
social-service agencies. These groups mostly avoid government money, because they know that 
government support comes with strings attached.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These strings involve more than just paperwork and regulations. 
Government support also changes charities incentives, giving them reasons to keep caseloads up instead of 
getting them down by successfully turning around peoples lives. It distorts their missions. It turns lean, 
cost-effective organizations into bloated bureaucracies, and dilutes their spiritual or religious message. In 
instances where the Salvation Army decided to accept government funds (which constitute about 15 
percent of its revenues), it stopped requiring church attendance as a condition of its assistance. 
Unfortunately, this experience is all too common. The charity that stays genuinely independent from 
government is still the exception.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although charities are supposed to offer an alternative to government 
provision of social welfare, they have become so dependent upon and aligned with government that they 
no longer represent a way out of the welfare state. If we place our faith in private nonprofits as they are 
currently organized, we are in for a big disappointment. Before we can rely on charities to help us 
dismantle government, they must wean themselves off the dole.

<H2>Delta Force</h2><br>
<b>by Joe Loconte</b>
</CENTER>
<P>
	States across the country are trying to reduce welfare costs and attack the system's culture of 
subsidized family breakdown. They're capping benefits for additional children born into welfare 
families, booting childless recipients from the rolls, and setting time limits on assistance. One of 
the nation's most provocative experiments aims to reform not only welfare but the individuals 
who receive it -- by turning over the state's role as social worker to local churches and 
synagogues.
<p>
	"God, not government, will be the savior of welfare recipients," says Mississippi governor 
Kirk Fordice. The Republican governor is convinced that the religious community can succeed 
where government by itself cannot -- by transforming the attitudes and behaviors of the welfare 
class. What is emerging in Mississippi is an unprecedented alliance between the governor, the 
state's Department of Human Services (DHS), and scores of local churches_all determined to 
tap the moral and spiritual resources of congregations to help lift Mississippi's 167,000 welfare 
recipients into permanent economic independence.
<p>
	Mississippi appears ripe for such an experiment. It is at once one of the nation's poorest states 
and one of its most religious. There are more churches here per capita than in any other state, but 
it also has the largest percentage of citizens receiving welfare assistance. Here many children still 
begin their school days in prayer, but more and more of those same children are having babies, 
pushing the state's illegitimacy rate to 44 percent. Here the cab drivers listen to Christian radio 
but navigate in cities where more than half of all children now live with an unmarried mother.
<p>
	A Gallup poll reveals that Mississippi and its southern neighbors boast "the greatest 
concentration and highest levels of religious fervor in America." So why hasn't all of this 
religiosity translated into stronger families, fewer people dependent on government welfare, and 
fewer social problems?
<p>
	It is perhaps ironic that a politician, not a preacher, has moved that question near the center of 
welfare reform in Mississippi. A year ago, Fordice summoned the state's religious leaders to the 
capitol, where he more or less read them the riot act. He challenged them to reach out 
aggressively to needy families in their communities, but to stop repeating the errors of 
government assistance. "The present system does absolutely nothing to inspire self-esteem, 
independence, or healthy family relationships," he has said.
<p>
	The "Faith and Families Project" hopes to revolutionize that system by matching welfare 
families, typically headed by an unmarried mother with at least two children, with congregations 
ready to become their <i>de facto</i> social workers. DHS officials expect participating 
churches to help individuals find good jobs and keep them. That means getting personally 
involved in ways that most state caseworkers, each tracking more than 200 families, cannot: 
lending emotional support and helping with child care, household budgeting, even grocery 
shopping.
<p>
	So far, the state has struck an arrangement that is keeping church-state litigators quiet. 
Churches are not asked to provide any financial support to welfare recipients; families are not 
required to attend the churches providing help. No welfare benefits are funneled through 
congregations, but government assistance, averaging $858 a month per family, continues until 
the family is independent.
<p>
	State officials expect, however, that congregations will do what they dare not try: wield moral 
authority and spiritual values among the state's 50,000 AFDC families -- one by one -- to 
transform their culture of dependency. "The problem is not material poverty, it is behavioral 
poverty," says Donald Taylor, executive director of the Mississippi DHS. "We're not interested 
in getting churches to replace welfare. What we're asking them is, `what can you provide to help 
move a family from economic slavery to economic independence?' "
<p>
	The answers are becoming increasingly urgent as Congress converts the federal welfare 
system into block grants, shifting primary responsibility for the poor back to the state and local 
level. Mississippi's tough welfare-to-workfare program, buoyed by rapid job growth, has helped 
reduce AFDC rolls by 12,000 families over the last three years. But state and federal welfare 
costs, including Medicaid, food stamps and supplemental security income, hit $2.3 billion in 
Mississippi in 1993, or at least $16,870 per family in poverty. Moreover, no state has a higher 
portion of its welfare expenses -- about 80 percent -- paid by the federal government than 
Mississippi.
<p>
	By maintaining the state's safety net but focusing on permanent behavioral change, Fordice 
hopes to reduce generational poverty. The goal: to see each of the state's 5,000 congregations 
adopt a welfare family, or about 10 percent of the existing caseload. Fordice hopes to bring down 
the number of long-term dependents, keep newly independent families from slipping back into 
poverty, and help families at risk -- hopefully making large new state expenditures on welfare 
unnecessary.
<p>
	Will it work?
<p>
	Beatrice Branch, Mississippi director of the NAACP, expects "minimal" results, claiming the 
plan "does not have broad-based support." Rims Barber, an ACLU lobbyist in Jackson, calls the 
program an election-year ploy, "a strong PR campaign, but that's all." 
<p>
	Try telling that to the Rev. Ronald Moore, the pastor of Stronger Hope Church in north 
Jackson. Moved by the governor's vision to enlist the aid of local churches, Moore began to 
challenge his black, middle-class congregation to reach out to welfare families in the city's 
depressed central and south sections. His congregation of about 200 has adopted 17 families, and 
five have found full-time employment. "I think the governor has hit a grand slam," says Moore. 
"He has caused many church leaders to say `yes, we've dispensed love, but there is a group of 
people who we've not really changed.' "
<p>
	Much of the state's religious community -- dominated mainly by independent-minded Baptist 
churches and black congregations with memories of racial segregation -- remains skeptical about 
any partnership with government. Nevertheless, about 175 churches have contacted the DHS to 
get profiles of welfare families in their neighborhoods, and have adopted more than 75 families 
on AFDC. In September, the Mississippi Family Council hosted a conference on breaking the 
welfare cycle that drew more than 200 church leaders and lay people.
<p>
	 The most common refrain was that churches -- black and white -- are indeed failing in their 
most basic moral and spiritual responsibilities to the poor.
<p>
	"There is something wrong with a gospel that will not lead people out of poverty," says the 
Rev. Thomas Jenkins, chairman of the church-based New Lake Development Foundation in 
central Jackson. The foundation offers tutoring programs and classes for the General Equivalency 
Degree, carpentry, computer training, and transitional housing for women and children -- all 
emphasizing the implications of faith on daily decision-making.
<p>
	Moore, who recruits congregations statewide for the program, emphasizes the role of the 
church in teaching personal responsibility and hard work, sexual abstinence and fatherhood. His 
favorite theme: "Stop doing what the government's been doing. Government has been trying to 
treat the effect, the aftermath. But we've got to go back to the basics and treat the cause." 
<p>
	Over the last year, Moore has addressed more than 300 pastors representing several 
denominations. Numerous churches have endorsed the initiative, including the National Baptist 
Convention, the nation's largest black denomination.
<p>
	Top DHS officials, handpicked by Governor Fordice, are reading from the same reform 
hymnal. Executive director Taylor has invited a leading consulting firm to work with his deputies 
and divisional directors to remake the agency's philosophy of assistance. State caseworkers who 
continue to function as "enablers," Taylor says, are in for a rude awakening. 
<p>
	The buzzwords at the DHS now are "accountability," "responsibility," and "permanent 
change." That's a significant leap for any state welfare department. And if large numbers of the 
state's congregations take up the governor's challenge to labor among the poor, then Mississippi 
could redefine the welfare debate with other words -- such as faith, hope, and charity.

<h2>Graham Cracks the Racial Barrier</h2>
<p>
	Mississippi governors haven't always had such cordial relations with religious leaders. In 
1952, a fiery young Southern Baptist preacher named Billy Graham led an interracial crusade in 
Jackson, defying segregationist governor Hugh White's request that he hold entirely separate 
services for blacks.
<p>
	Graham wrestled with the segregation question just as he was beginning to attain national 
prominence as an evangelical preacher. Though he rejected separate services during his Jackson 
campaign, Graham accepted segregated seating. He seemed to have done so with reservations. 
Toward the close of the crusade, he said that God's love knows no racial barriers. Moreover, he 
identified Jackson's two greatest social problems as illegal liquor (Mississippi was still dry) and 
segregation.
<p>
	"There is no scriptural basis for segregation. It may be there are places where such is desirable 
to both races, but certainly not in the church," Graham told the crowd. "The ground at the foot of 
the cross is level. . . . [I]t touches my heart when I see whites stand shoulder to shoulder with 
blacks at the cross."
<p>
	Though Graham's statements were both risky and visionary -- he made them four years before 
Martin Luther King Jr. rose to national prominence -- he waffled on the segregation question 
when challenged by critics. He must have done some soul-searching over the next several 
months: In March 1953, a year before the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools, Graham 
told the sponsoring committee of his Chattanooga, Tennessee, crusade that he could not abide 
segregated seating. The committee balked. Graham didn't blink: Committee members watched in 
astonishment as he personally took down the ropes separating black and white sections.
<p>
	After the Court's <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> ruling, Graham never permitted any 
form of enforced segregation in his meetings, even in the Deep South.
<p.
	"The church should have been the pacesetter. The church should voluntarily be doing what the 
federal courts are doing by pressure and compulsion," the young preacher said. Graham soon 
became convinced -- as even many secularists now claim -- that "a great spiritual revival is 
needed to relieve the racial and political tensions of today."

<h2>Block (Grant) Party</h2> 
<P>

<B>by <a href="http://badger.state.wi.us:/agencies/gov/gov_home.html">Tommy Thompson</a></B>
<P>
 What will the states do differently once they have block grants?
The short and simple answer: We will put our ideas to work. Once
a block-grant system becomes operational, several key areas of
public assistance will be set loose from the dead weight of federal
oversight.<p>
 For the most part, the block-grant system frees states
from the shackles of a waiver system that has inhibited innovation
and stymied true reform. Prior to recent congressional action,
if a state passed an innovative welfare reform initiative, it
would have to go to Washington on bended knee and kiss somebody's
ring in order to get a waiver to implement the program.<p>
 In Wisconsin,
we know the waiver system all too well. We have sought and received
227 different waivers to implement our innovative welfare programs.
And we know that you never get everything you ask for in a waiver
request, either. If your waiver asks for 10 items, you are lucky
if Washington grants you three.<p>
 In Wisconsin, the block-grant
system means we will be able to implement the most ambitious change
in the welfare system that this country has ever seen.  <p>
The changes
we expect to enact are called W-2, or Wisconsin Works. This initiative
would end the automatic welfare check. It would end AFDC. And
once implemented, W-2 will mark the greatest change in social
policy in this country in the past 50 years. <p>
In Wisconsin, we
will no longer have a welfare system; we will have a work system.
In fact, we have already transferred our welfare division from
our Department of Health and Human Services to our Department
of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations, and have made it a work
division. The reason: We are replacing the automatic welfare check
with a comprehensive package of work options, job training, health-care
and child-care services, and even financial planning.  <p>
And we
know W-2 will succeed in moving people off welfare and into the
workforce. Wisconsin has been reforming the welfare system longer
than any other state by far, having begun when I took office in
1987. Since then, our AFDC caseload has dropped 30 percent, and
we're saving our taxpayers $17 million a month.  <p>
Imagine what
Wisconsin and other states could do with the freedom and flexibility
provided by the block-grant system. <p>
In a recent study, Princeton
University professor Lawrence Mead concluded that Wisconsin cut
its welfare dependency because it tied benefits to work. W-2 is
based on the philosophy that for those who can work, only work
should pay. We assume that everybody is able to work-or at least
is able to contribute to society through some work activity within
their abilities. The only way to escape welfare or to escape poverty
is to work. There is no other way. Therefore, W-2 helps the traditional
welfare recipient make the transition to employment and an independent
life as quickly as possible. When people seek economic assistance
(or what used to be known as AFDC) from the state, they will be
required to sign up for work immediately. And it is only by performing
some level of work that they will receive economic assistance.<p>

W-2 consists of a four-rung job ladder designed to help participants
climb out of poverty and government dependence and into a life
of independence and self-reliance. The top rung is unsubsidized
employment. Under this option, participants who are job-ready
will be matched up with the best available job. This is the ideal
option-the rung on the ladder that all participants should aspire
to reach. A W-2 participant directed into unsubsidized work is
also eligible for, depending on his income, food stamps, health
care, child care, and the earned-income tax credit. <p>
The second
rung on the ladder is subsidized employment, or trial jobs. This
rung is for people without a work history but with a willing attitude.
Employers who hire people on this rung get help in offsetting
some of the costs of training and trying out a new employee. The
wage subsidy is limited to between three and six months. A person
in a trial job can remain on this rung of the ladder for no more
than 24 months and is eligible for food stamps, child care, health
care, and the earned- income tax credit. <p>
Community-service jobs
constitute the third rung and are meant for people who need to
practice the work habits and skills necessary to be hired by a
private business. These jobs will pay 75 percent of the minimum
wage (more than the welfare grant) and may come with food stamps,
child care, and health care. A person can remain in a community-service
job for up to nine months before being required to move up the
ladder, and there is a lifetime limit of 24 months for this rung.<p>

The fourth option, and bottom rung of the ladder, is called W-2
Transitions. This rung is reserved for those who legitimately
are unable to perform self-sustaining work, even in a community-service
job. To receive cash benefits, participants will work in activities
consistent with their abilities. Work at this level pays 70 percent
of minimum wage, and the worker is eligible for food stamps, health
care, and day care. Although this option has a 24-month participation
limit, extensions are permitted on a case-by-case basis. <p>
The goal
of this program is to move those with little or no work histories
up the work ladder, gaining more work experience, until they are
in an unsubsidized job and caring for their families on their
own. Participation is limited to five years over a person's lifetime.<p>

The benchmark for W-2's fairness is a comparison with low-income
families that work for a living. With this in mind, the program
includes a system of copayments for health-care and child-care
benefits. Just as low-income families must pay for child care
and health care-either in full or in part-W-2 participants will
be required to pay what they can afford for these services, on
a sliding scale. W-2 also would make health care more accessible
to low-income working families by allowing them to buy into the
state health-care system. <p>
Finally, Wisconsin Works is designed
to address the problem of teen pregnancy. In the past, too many
long-time welfare recipients started on welfare as teen parents.
We have to break the cycle of dependency earlier. So under our
plan, teen parents who are minors and who cannot live at home
or with a legal guardian will not be allowed to set up their own
household with cash assistance from the state. For those who cannot
live at home, three options will be available: Live in a foster
home, live in a group home, or, as a last resort for older teens,
live in a supervised independent setting.  <p>
The Wisconsin Works
welfare package has received bipartisan support in our legislature,
which is expected to approve the program early next year; we plan
to implement it in 1997. Without block grants, however, we would
need a series of waivers and probably would be unable to adopt
half of the program's initiatives. <p>
Another area that holds tremendous
promise for innovation under a block-grant system is Medicaid.
No item affects state budgets more profoundly than Medicaid, so
states will be looking for the most efficient and effective way
to provide high-quality health care at a reasonable cost. <p>
In Wisconsin,
we started improving our Medicaid system some time ago, but again
had to rely on a waiver system that scuttled some of our plans.
Regardless, industry experts have recognized Wisconsin for running
the country's most efficient Medicaid system. <p>
We began our reform
efforts using a managed-care system, which has allowed us to provide
more Medicaid recipients with a higher quality of care at lower
cost. Indeed, by enrolling AFDC recipients in health-maintenance
organizations, the state became an active player in controlling
costs. Instead of serving as a blank check, the state could step
in and negotiate the highest quality care at the best price. Instead
of serving as a health-care &quot;payor,&quot; the state is now
a health-care &quot;buyer.&quot; <p>
What is most exciting about the
program is that HMOs are providing AFDC recipients with better
health care. They have a primary doctor, someone they can go to
on a regular basis. They also have greater access to important
preventive care, such as well-baby visits and immunizations. <p>
While
Wisconsin is not alone in utilizing a managed-care system for
Medicaid recipients, the block-grant system will make it easier
for all states to shift to such a system.  <p>
As major buyers of
managed care, states will be able to leverage their purchasing
power to control costs as well as improve access and quality.
With the financial flexibility of block grants, many states also
will be able to extend this formidable purchasing power to offer
low-cost coverage to uninsured working families. Though managed
care, particularly for the elderly and disabled, requires careful
planning and vigilant oversight, it will be an essential component
of every new Medicaid program. <p>
States throughout this country
have been extraordinarily successful in enrolling nearly one-third
of all Medicaid recipients in managed-care organizations. But
progress has been frustrated by lengthy, time-consuming waivers
for arcane federal rules designed to impede managed care. In effect,
the current waiver process gives states a Hobson's choice: Either
accept the costly and burdensome new strings often attached to
federal waivers, or forgo altogether the use of managed care and
other modern delivery systems now common in the private sector.<p>

Besides managed care, the Medicaid block-grant system would allow
states to pursue integrated solutions in providing health care,
particularly long-term care for the elderly. <p>
Comprehensive service
networks are being created by the private sector from the inevitable
integration of health-care suppliers, particularly health plans,
hospitals, and clinics. While the federal government has been
oblivious to these historic changes, employers and other buyers
of health care are adapting to take full advantage. The block-grant
system will allow state Medicaid programs to take advantage as
well. <p>
Under the old Medicaid system, states were forced to take
a fragmented approach to health-care problems, most notably long-term
care. An incomprehensible layer of federal restrictions forced
states to create disparate programs in order to work around federal
obstacles. In the provision of long-term care, the result was
a confusing, overly complex and costly mix of home, community,
and institutional care. <p>
The new Medigrant program, however, will
permit states to integrate their long-term care programs and promote
the purchase of private long-term care insurance. By combining
the array of home, community, and institutional programs into
more integrated solutions based on managed care, the elderly and
disabled will have more options and taxpayers' costs will be better
controlled. Integrated solutions also provide states with greater
leverage to improve access to health care as well as the quality
of care. <p>
A third advantage to the block-grant system is that it
would allow states to make Medicaid coverage more sensible. As
an entitlement under federal law, the scope of Medicaid coverage
is now determined by the courts and rule-making bureaucrats. Neither
the medical community nor the taxpayers have any real say in the
matter. This has led to such absurdities as the coverage of gourmet
cookies, soap, and household appliances. This has long frustrated
the states as they've struggled to manage their systems. <p>
Freed
from federal oversight, we'll likely see the end to Medicaid as
the Cadillac of health plans and the eventual adoption of coverage
more akin to that offered to workers in private industry. While
coverage for the elderly and disabled will continue to include
additional services, particularly long-term care, the end of the
legal entitlement will permit states to take into account true
medical needs and the cost-effectiveness of alternative services.<p>

Finally, the Medicaid block-grant system will lead to streamlined
administration, which will save taxpayer money. As a result of
an avalanche of federal mandates, Medicaid has become the most
complex social program ever devised. The Medicaid program is now
governed by more than 50,000 pages of federal-state agreements,
more than 2,000 pages of federal laws, and some 15,000 pages of
federal rules and instructions. This extraordinary level of complexity
makes the federal tax code look like a nursery rhyme. <p>
Furthermore,
states must collectively prepare more than 8,000 federally mandated
reports each year. Most of these are never read, much less used,
by a living soul. Because of the labyrinth of federal eligibility
rules, there are more than 200 different ways to qualify for Medicaid
in Wisconsin alone. Making matters worse, federal loopholes force
states to cover middle-class individuals and facilitate the hiding
of assets and income. <p>
Under the 170-page Medigrant bill, state
Medicaid plans could be vastly simplified, thousands of pages
of inane federal rules would be rescinded and those 8,000 reports
would be reduced to just 50-one for each state. States like Wisconsin
will be able to streamline eligibility determinations, close loopholes
and tie Medicaid coverage to participation in jobs programs like
W-2. And accountability will be enforced where it truly matters-in
the establishment of fiscal controls, independent audits and evaluations,
and public reporting of program performance. <p>
Medicaid will be
an area where states will clearly be able to demonstrate a greater
ability to manage an unwieldy program and provide services better
than Washington. And it will serve as an example of what can be
accomplished once Washington steps back and keeps its overregulating
fingers out of the mix. <p>
The block-grant system will provide states
with a remarkable opportunity to enact their best ideas and brightest
programs. The ultimate winner will be the taxpayer, who will receive
a higher quality product at a lower cost. Already, with the limited
amount of experimentation the federal government has allowed,
states have shown that they can manage complex programs like welfare
and Medicaid much better than the federal government. The very
concept of federal block grants shows that Congress is recognizing
the great work that is already being done by the states. <p>
In Wisconsin,
we can't wait to carry on that work and put our best ideas into
practice.

<h2>Humble Clovis Defies The Education Visigoths</h2>
<P>
<B>by Christopher Garcia</B>
<P>
 In 507 a.d., at Vouill&eacute; in present-day France, the King
of the Franks led a band of warriors against the Visigoths, the
marauding barbarians who had sacked Rome a century earlier. The
king, named Clovis, defeated the Visigoths and broke their hold
on Europe.<p>
 Today, a modern namesake-the Clovis Unified School
District (CUSD), in Fresno, California-is successfully defying
another ominous empire: the education establishment. Despite serving
a significant portion of Fresno's urban poor, Clovis is proving
that public schools can deliver a good education with a small
budget and minimal bureaucracy.<p>
 Clovis has long ignored the prevailing
cant about the need for high spending and huge bureaucratic machinery
to regulate public education. During the 1993-94 school year,
CUSD spent $3,892 per pupil; school districts nationwide averaged
$5,730. The district's student-to-administrator ratio is 520:1-nearly
twice the national average. And although similarly sized districts
(like those in Rochester, New York, and Madison, Wisconsin) typically
house 300 to 400 employees in their central offices, CUSD employs
just 167. With no teachers union or Parent Teachers Association
(PTA), CUSD is a rarity among public schools.  <p>
In this case, less
means more-more students performing above average across a broad
range of measures. The district's average score on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) is 52 points higher than the state average
and 42 points higher than the national average. CUSD's mean composite
score on the American College Test (ACT) stands respectably at
the 65th percentile. In 1995, with a senior cohort of 1,606, CUSD
students passed 720 Advanced Placement (AP) exams. <p>
Perhaps one
reason Clovis kids outperform their peers is that they show up
for class more often: The district's high-school attendance rate
is nearly 95 percent, and its drop-out rate is only 4 percent.
The district doesn't skimp on its extracurricular offerings, either.
More than 80 percent of Clovis students participate in one of
the most successful programs in California. Last year, the district
earned a championship at the National Future Farmers of America
Convention and sent its state-champion Odyssey of the Mind team
to compete in the world finals. <p>
Many Clovis children are among
the most disadvantaged in the region. Nearly 40 percent of the
district's students live in Fresno City. Six of CUSD's elementary
schools enroll enough AFDC children to qualify for direct financial
assistance from the federal government. And five schools have
student bodies with more than 50 percent minorities. In 1989,
the median household income of the community surrounding Pinedale
Elementary School was $10,000 below the national median of $28,906.
And yet Mexican-Americans, who make up the district's largest
minority (about 18 percent of all students), outperform their
state and national counterparts on the ACT by significant margins.<p>

Created in 1960 from the merger of seven rural, low-income school
districts, CUSD presented its first superintendent, Floyd V. Buchanan,
with a significant challenge: Barely more than one in three of
the district's 1,843 students performed at grade level. Buchanan
wanted to push this figure to 90 percent-but how? <p>
Put simply:
competition, control, and consequences. Buchanan reasoned that
schools would not be spurred to meet the goals that he and the
central administration set for them unless they competed against
one another in academic and extracurricular achievement. He established
goals for each of the system's 11 schools at the start of the
year, ranked them according to their performance at year's end,
and established a system of carrots and sticks (mostly carrots).<p>

Most importantly, administrators and teachers were allowed to
choose the teaching methods and curricula they felt suited their
objectives. This formula, in place for decades, has allowed the
district-now with 30 schools and 28,000 students-to place between
70 and 90 percent of its students at grade level. <p>
Competition
in the district exists at several levels. Earning a rating as
a top school is its own reward, but the district recognizes high
achievement in other ways. The top schools on the elementary,
intermediate, and high-school levels are recognized at an annual,
districtwide award ceremony. The district's best teachers and
administrators are honored at a dinner. And the school's achievements
are reported to parents and the community in the pages of the
district's publications.  <p>
The friendly, competitive culture at
Clovis clearly has helped drive achievement. Because a school's
performance at a districtwide choral competition or drama fair
influences its ratings, teachers, students, and administrators
work hard to give their routines the extra edge needed to push
ahead of their colleagues. Schools borrow the winning strategies
used elsewhere. Students at Clovis West High School, for example,
often score better on SATs and AP exams than those at Clovis High
School, so Clovis High has borrowed test-preparation tips from
Clovis West. Clovis High is also trying to improve discipline
by looking at successful techniques employed at Buchanan High.<p>

Competition, however, would produce little without local decision-making.
Anticipating trends that would revolutionize America's Fortune
500 companies, Buchanan made flexible, decentralized, site-based
management a fundamental feature of the school system in 1972.
The district office has been responsible for setting goals and
establishing guidelines, but schools have worked to meet these
goals in their own ways. &quot;They give us the what and we figure
out the how,&quot; says Kevin Peterson, the principal of Tarpey
Elementary School.<p>
When officials at Pinedale Elementary School
determined that parent participation there was lower than at other
schools, for example, they realized that immigrant parents felt
locked out by language barriers. So they created &quot;family
nights&quot; to help these parents take part in their children's
education. With their children present, the parents are taught
games and devices they can use at home to help their children
with their homework. The result: Immigrant parents now participate
more. Such innovation is easier in the absence of teacher unions.
For example, the district deploys teachers weekly to the homes
of about 100 recently arrived immigrants to provide them English-language
instruction and to help them build a bridge to their rapidly assimilating
children. Meredith Ekwall, a first-grade teacher at Weldon Elementary
School, teaches English at night to the parents of her ESL students
to encourage English use in the home. In districts where collective-bargaining
agreements stipulate precisely how much time teachers spend teaching,
micromanage the amount of time teachers can devote to activities
outside of the classroom, and dictate what a district can and
cannot ask its teachers to do, such flexibility and voluntarism
is rare.<p>
Along with teacher autonomy and greater parent access,
Clovis strives for accountability. All the teachers, without exception,
are expected to bring 90 percent of their students up to grade
level. If they do not, everyone knows about it. The district's
research and evaluation division notifies teachers, parents, and
administrators of school and student performance. And with curriculum
development and teacher hiring and firing in the schools' hands,
knowledge is power. The approach has &quot;made every teacher
accountable,&quot; says Redbank Elementary School Principal Susan
VanDoren. &quot;[I]t made me sit down and look at all those kids
[needing help] and ask, 'What can we do?'&quot; <p>
Parents seem more
likely to ask that question in Clovis than in other school districts.
Parents and other community members (including the clergy, senior
citizens, and businessmen) sit on advisory boards, where they
review individual school performance and formulate policy. Last
year, some parents were upset that children were required to read
feminist author Maya Angelou's <I>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</I>.
Parents forged an agreement with the district that allows them
to review books assigned to their children and help develop alternatives.
Other boards recently voted to institute a voluntary uniform and
a fee-based home-to-school transportation program. Teams of parents
issue critiques of schools on the basis of data culled from parent
surveys; these reviews are posted in every staff room in the district.<p>

These boards function the way PTAs are meant to, but without the
stifling hand of teacher-union influence. &quot;The reason for
the success of Clovis,&quot; says Superintendent Walter Buster,
&quot;is that these schools are truly governed by elected lay
people.&quot; <p>
Ultimately, it seems, success in CUSD is driven
by community expectations. &quot;There's a corporate culture that
has been established that requires more of people, expects of
people more, and gets of people more,&quot; says H.P. Spees, executive
director of Fresno-Madeira Youth for Christ and member of CUSD's
clergy advisory council. <p>
This culture of expectation is impressed
upon teachers even before they pick up a piece of chalk. A lengthy,
multi-tiered interview process incorporates parents, teachers,
community leaders, principals, and administrators and signals
to prospective teachers that the Clovis community demands much
of its teachers. According to Ginger Thomas, the principal of
Temprance-Kutner Elementary School, some teacher candidates quit
the interview process, saying &quot;you guys work too hard.&quot;
Assistant superintendent Jon Sharpe contends that Clovis sustains
&quot;a work ethic in the public sector that's almost unsurpassed.&quot;
He may be right: In 1992, CUSD teachers even voted down their
own pay raise to channel the money into books and supplies. <p>
In
an education system under assault for its academic failures, Clovis
has produced a winning formula. CUSD schools have won recognition
by the state of California 15 times and earned national blue ribbons
from the U.S. Department of Education 13 times. The prestigious
Phi Delta Kappa Center for Evaluation, Development, and Research
has featured Clovis in two works, <I>Clovis California Schools:
A Measure of Excellence</I> and <I>Total Quality Education</I>.
Even outspoken critics of public education recognize the district's
accomplishments. &quot;If we are going to limit ourselves to the
Prussian system of education, Clovis is the best we are going
to get in a tax-financed school,&quot; says Marshall Fritz, the
founder of the Fresno-based Separation of School and State Alliance
and the father of four Clovis students. <p>
Awards aside, the real
lesson of Clovis is that good education depends not on bloated
budgets but on creative and committed teachers and administrators
held accountable by engaged communities. Clovis's success also
suggests that quality in public education will not be the norm
until resources are channeled to classrooms rather than bureaucrats,
and parents wrest control over education from teachers unions.

Michigan had no public-school teacher strikes

Under legislation signed last March by Governor John Engler, school
teachers are now fined a day's pay for each day they strike and
school districts may no longer make up any losses by assigning
strikers additional teaching days at the end of the school year.

Montana earned $13 million from timber harvests on state-owned

down 12 times as many trees, the U.S. Forest Service lost $42
million in its Montana properties. Don Leal of the Political Economy

in better reforestation practices, spacing trees further apart
so that each tree receives more water and nutrients, and by using
less than one-third the staff to prepare timber sales. <p>
Since Cincinnati,

eligible, 97 have chosen them since their introduction last March.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The public is often told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. This is untrue.
<p><ul>
<li> The 4.7 million families currently receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare.
<p>
<li> When past and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families currently receiving benefits, is an astonishing 13 years.
<p>
<li> Among the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. More than three quarters will spend over five years on AFDC.
</ul><p>
The current liberal system is based on the assumption that higher welfare benefits and expanded welfare eligibility are good for children. According to this theory, "poverty" is harmful for children, and welfare, by allegedly reducing poverty, will increase children's lifetime well-being and attainment. This is untrue. Higher welfare payments do not assist children; they increase dependence and illegitimacy, which have a devastatingly negative effect on children's development. It is welfare dependence, rather than poverty, which has the most negative effect on children.
<P><ul>
<li> Recent research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. 
<p>
<li> Welfare receipt as a child has a negative effect on the earnings and employment capacity of young men. The more welfare income received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower will be the boy's earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical non-welfare income. 
<p>
<li> Receipt of welfare and living in a single-parent family during childhood are strongly associated with criminal activity among young men and having illegitimate children among young women.
</ul><p>	
Overall, welfare operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful will be the child as an adult. 
<p>
The House and Senate will soon pass welfare reform legislation based on three key principles: 
<p>
1)  Reducing the growth of illegitimacy; 
<p>
2)  Reducing dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and 
<p>
3)  Limiting the explosive growth of welfare spending. 
<p>
The public strongly supports the key provisions of the congressional reforms. According to recent polls:
<p><ul>
<li> By a margin of 84 percent to 13 percent, Americans support a "family cap."  Eighty-four percent "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out-of-wedlock."
<p>
<li> Three out of four Americans believe welfare encourages illegitimacy. By a ratio of two to one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important goal in welfare reform than attempting merely to make single mothers self-sufficient.
<p>
<li> Still, nine out of ten Americans feel that welfare recipients should have "to work for their benefits."  However, they feel overwhelmingly that work requirements should be imposed on welfare mothers with older children before they are imposed on mothers with pre-school children.
</ul><p>


<b>THE PATTERN OF DEPENDENCE: LENGTH OF TIME ON WELFARE</b>
<p>
The public is often told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. According to this picture, AFDC generally provides temporary aid, and very few recipients receive welfare for extended periods. This picture is inaccurate. 
<p>
Of the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, most will be dependent on welfare for very long periods of time. As Chart 1 shows, families receiving AFDC at the present time have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years enrolled in AFDC.<sup>1</sup>  When past receipt and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC among those families currently receiving AFDC benefits is an astounding 13 years.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, these figures actually underestimate the length of welfare dependence, since such families are very likely to receive other welfare benefits (such as food stamps, SSI, Medicaid, and housing) even after they leave the AFDC caseload.
<p>
As Chart 2 shows, among those families currently receiving AFDC, 72 percent have already spent over two years on AFDC, and nearly half have already spent over five years on AFDC. 
<p>
Looking into the future and making projections based on the historical patterns of AFDC receipt, it is clear that among the 4.7 million families currently on AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. And more than three quarters of current AFDC families will spend over five years on the AFDC caseload.
<p>
Long-term welfare dependence is most common among women who have children out of wedlock. Never-married mothers, in general, remain on AFDC twice as long as divorced mothers.
<p>

<b>DOES WELFARE BENEFIT CHILDREN?</b>
<p>
The current debate over welfare reform involves conflicting visions of society and the impact of welfare on human behavior. Real reform will not be achieved until specific core assumptions which form the foundation of the modern welfare state have been overturned and discarded. From its onset, the liberal welfare state has been founded on faulty logic. This flawed logic, embedded in nearly all liberal thinking about welfare, runs something like this:
<p>
<b>PREMISE #1:</b> Children in families with higher income seem to do better in life.
<p>
<b>PREMISE #2:</b> Welfare can easily raise family income.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION:</b> Therefore, welfare is good for kids.
<p>
From this logic has sprung a relentless thirty-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The current proposal from Congress to slow down the automatic growth of welfare spending violates these cardinal tenets of the liberal welfare system and thus has led to cries of alarm from the welfare establishment.
<p>
In fact, each of the central tenets of modern welfare is misleading and deeply flawed. Together they become a recipe for a disastrous system of aid which harms rather than helps, aggressively crushing the hopes and future of an increasing number of young Americans.
<p>
It is useful to examine each of these cardinal liberal tenets individually. The first is that raising incomes is crucial to the well-being and success of children. The common liberal corollary to this premise is that poverty "causes" such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, low work ethic and skills, and drug use. Hence, reducing poverty through greater welfare spending will reduce most social problems. History refutes this belief. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If the theory that "poverty" causes social problems were true, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods then we do today. But crime and most other social problems have increased rather than fallen since these earlier periods.
<p>
History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families, not family income, lead to children's success. Families with higher incomes tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education, and marriage which they pass on to their children. It is those values, rather than the family income, that are key to the children's attainment. Attempting to raise the family income artificially through welfare is very unlikely to do much to benefit the child, but it is likely to destroy the very values which are key to the child's success.
<p>
The second flawed liberal premise is that it is very easy to raise family income through welfare. This also is untrue. Because welfare reduces work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent families, it actually may cause an overall decrease in family incomes. Welfare is extremely efficient at replacing self-sufficiency with dependence, but relatively ineffective in raising incomes and eliminating poverty.
<p>
This is borne out by experimental evidence. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to examine the effect of welfare benefits on work effort. The longest running and most comprehensive of these experiments was conducted between 1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver, and became known as the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or "SIME/DIME."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME and similar experiments conducted in other cities would prove that generous welfare benefits did not affect "work effort" adversely. Instead, the SIME/DIME experiment found that each $1.00 of extra welfare given to low-income persons reduced labor and earnings by an average of $0.80.<sup>4</sup>  The significant anti-work effects of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including married women, single mothers, and husbands. The results of the SIME/DIME study are directly applicable to existing welfare programs:  Nearly all have strong anti-work effects like those studied in the SIME/DIME experiment.
<p>
The third liberal tenet is that higher welfare benefits and broadened eligibility will help children and improve their success in later life. In certain limited cases, such as when welfare is needed to eliminate serious malnutrition, welfare can help. But there is no evidence that enlarging benefits and expanding enrollments in most U.S. welfare programs will improve children's lives. While higher welfare payments and spending do not benefit children directly, they do increase dependence and illegitimacy, both of which have devastating negative effects on child well-being. Thus, overall, welfare operates as a system of organized, well-funded child abuse. 
<p>
The available scientific evidence clearly refutes the liberal hypothesis that attempting to raise family income through more generous welfare payments will benefit children. For example, the average monthly value of welfare benefits (AFDC and food stamps combined) varies between states. The conventional liberal assumption is that children on welfare in states with lower benefit levels will be markedly worse off than children in states with higher benefits. Children on AFDC in high benefit states, according to the theory, should have improved cognitive ability when compared to children without access to more generous welfare. However, recently published research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill and Anne Hill of Queens College, City University of New York, demonstrates that this theory is incorrect. O'Neill and Hill examined the IQs of young children who were long-term welfare dependents, having spent at least half of their lives on AFDC. Contrary to the expected theory, they found that the higher welfare benefit did not improve children's cognitive performance. The IQs of long-term welfare-dependent children in low-benefit states were not appreciably different from those in high benefit states.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
Moreover, this picture is overly optimistic. In restricting the sample to long-term dependent children, the analysis ignores the effects of higher welfare benefits in encouraging welfare enrollment and lengthening the time spent on welfare. O'Neill and Hill have shown that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will lead to a 75 percent increase in the number of mothers with children enrolling in AFDC and a 75 percent increase in the number of years spent on welfare.<sup>6</sup>  Once the effects of increased dependence are included, it becomes clear that higher welfare benefits have a decisively negative effect on children.
<p>
Comparing children who were identical in social and economic factors such as race, family structure, mothers' IQ and education, family income, and neighborhood residence, Hill and O'Neill found that the more years a child spent on welfare, the lower the child's IQ. The authors make it clear that it is not poverty but welfare itself which has a damaging effect on the child. Examining the young children (with an average age of five-and-a-half), the authors found that those who had spent at least two months of each year since birth on AFDC had cognitive abilities 20 percent below those who had received no welfare, even after holding family income, race, parental IQ, and other variables constant.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
O'Neill and Hill conclude:
<p><bq>
	Our findings of a negative impact of a welfare environment are particularly troubling. After controlling for the effects of a rich array of characteristics, a mother's long-term welfare participation is associated with a significant reduction in her child's [IQ] score and this effect is reinforced by the mother's having grown up in an underclass neighborhood, defined as one with a high proportion of welfare recipients. Although long-term welfare recipients are generally poor, persistent poverty does not seem to be the main reason for the poor performance of these children. Moreover, our analysis suggests that policies that would raise the income of children on welfare simply by increasing AFDC benefits are not likely to improve cognitive development. Children on welfare in high benefit states do not perform measurably better than their counterparts in low benefit states.<sup>8</sup>
</bq><p>
A similar study by Mary Corcoran and Roger Gordon of the University of Michigan shows that receipt of welfare income has negative effects on the long-term employment and earnings capacity of young boys. The study shows that, holding constant race, parental education, family structure, and a range of other social variables, higher <i>non-welfare income</i> obtained by the family during a boy's childhood was associated with higher earnings when the boy became an adult (over age 25).<sup>9</sup>  However, <i>welfare income</i> had the opposite effect:  The more welfare income received by a family while a boy was growing, up the lower the boy's earnings as an adult.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
Typically, liberals would dismiss this finding, arguing that families which receive a lot of welfare payments have lower total incomes than other families in society, and that it is the low overall family income, not welfare, which had a negative effect on the young boys. But the Corcoran and Gordon study compares families whose average non-welfare incomes were identical. In such cases, each extra dollar in welfare represents a net increase in overall financial resources available to the family. This extra income, according to conventional liberal welfare theory, should have positive effects on the well-being of the children. But the study shows that the extra welfare income, even though it produced a net increase in resources available to the family, had a negative impact on the development of young boys within the family. The higher the welfare income received by the family, the lower the earnings obtained by the boys upon reaching adulthood. The study suggests an increase of $1,000 per year in welfare received by a family decreased a boy's future earnings by as much as 10 percent.
<p>
A further refinement of the Corcoran and Gordon study adjusted for differences in years spent by a family in poverty. The study showed that, in general, if two families had the same level of non-welfare income and spent the same amount of time "in poverty," the more welfare income received by the family, the worse the consequences for a boy raised in the family. For example, if two boys were raised in families with identical non-welfare incomes and spent the same time "in poverty," the more welfare received by one of the families, the lower the earnings of the boy raised in that family when he becomes an adult.
<p>
Other studies have confirmed the negative effects of welfare on the development of children. For example, young women who are raised in families dependent on welfare are two to three times more likely to drop out and fail to graduate from high school than are young women of similar race and socioeconomic background not raised on welfare.<sup>11</sup>  Similarly, single mothers who were raised as children in families receiving welfare remain on AFDC longer as adult parents than do single mothers who were not raised in welfare families, even when all other social and economic variables are held constant.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
Boys raised in single-parent households receiving public housing aid are more than five times more likely to engage in criminal activity than are boys who are not raised in such conditions. Young girls raised in single-parent homes in public housing are roughly five times more likely to bear children out of wedlock themselves than are girls who are not raised in such conditions.<sup>13</sup>  In short, welfare usually operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful will be the child as an adult.
<p>
In attacking the welfare reform legislation passed by the House and Senate, the Clinton Administration has embraced the central erroneous tenets of liberal welfarism. The Administration's report on welfare makes clear its belief that rapid automatic increases in welfare spending are essential to the well-being of children and that any attempts to slow the growth of future welfare spending will significantly harm children.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
The Administration report is founded unequivocally on the failed hypothesis that combating "poverty" through more generous welfare spending is crucial to children's future. This thinking is simply wrong. An expanded and more expensive welfare system will not benefit children. Instead, expansion of welfare leads to greater dependence and illegitimacy which, in turn, have devastatingly negative consequences on children. Those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed, not (as the Clinton Administration does) at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependence and illegitimacy. That is the core of Congress's plan.
<p>

<b>PUBLIC SUPPORTS CONGRESSIONAL WELFARE REFORM</b>
<p>
By overwhelming margins, the public supports the principal elements of the welfare reform passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, according to a poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, a Bethesda-based polling firm, for the Family Research Council in mid-October 1995.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
For example, by a margin of 84 percent to 13 percent Americans support the family cap. Nearly nine out of ten Americans "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock."
<p>
In contrast to proposals by President Clinton, the welfare reforms agreed to in the House/Senate conference will contain modest but real steps to reduce illegitimacy. Three out of four of those polled agreed that the current welfare system makes it easier for women to choose to have children out of wedlock. By a ratio of two to one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important goal in welfare reform than attempting merely to make single mothers self-sufficient.
<p>
However, the public still believes overwhelmingly that welfare recipients should be required to work. Ninety percent of those polled stated that "recipients of government welfare programs should have to work for their benefits."
<p>
Since it would be difficult to require all welfare recipients to work immediately, the reform bills passed in the House and Senate urge states to impose work requirements on the most employable recipients first. Specifically, the bills urge states to focus work requirements on fathers in two-parent families and single mothers without pre-school children before requiring work of single mothers with pre-school children. (Roughly half of AFDC families have no children under age five in the household.) The public agrees overwhelmingly with these work priorities. Eighty-eight percent of the public feels that work should be required of fathers and mothers of school-age children before it is required of mothers caring for pre-school children.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The welfare reform legislation which will be approved by the House/Senate conference proposes a reform of the current welfare system based on three central themes:
<p>
<b>Reducing the growth of illegitimacy;
<p>
Reducing dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and
<p>
Limiting the explosive growth of welfare spending.</b>
<p>
Among the many elements of reform in the legislation, seven are crucial:
<p>
1) The bill will end the automatic entitlement nature of AFDC spending. Under the legislation, states which increase their welfare caseloads will no longer be rewarded by an automatic increase in federal funding. This change imposes a fundamental fiscal discipline at the state level which is essential to real reform.
<p>
2) The bill establishes a family cap. Under the bill, mothers already enrolled in AFDC will not receive an automatic increase in federal welfare benefits if they give birth to an additional child while on welfare. (However, states will be permitted to enact legislation to "opt out" of this requirement.)
<p>
3) The bill provides a funding mechanism to reward states which reduce out-of-wedlock births without increasing abortions.
<p>
4) The bill provides $75 million per year in funding for a new block grant for abstinence education.
<p>
5) For the first time in the history of AFDC, the bill establishes serious work requirements for welfare recipients. Under the bill, up to 40 percent of the AFDC caseload will be required to work or become self-sufficient by the year 2002.
<p>
6) In contrast to all previous "work" requirements, in the AFDC program, the work requirements in the proposed legislation are real. Recipients who do not obtain private-sector jobs will be required to perform community service in exchange for benefits according to a "pay after performance" rule. Recipients will not receive benefits until the required work has been performed satisfactorily. If the recipient fails to perform the required hours of work, benefits will be reduced pro-rata.
<p>
7) The bill properly recognizes that the goal of "workfare" is to reduce welfare dependence and welfare caseloads, not to maximize the number of welfare recipients in "make work" public service jobs. It recognizes that the best road to self-sufficiency is to reduce the number of persons who become dependent and get "hooked" on welfare in the first place. In contrast to President Clinton's plan, which rewards states for expanding "welfare addiction," the approach in Congress for the first time focuses on rewarding states that reduce the number of individuals who get "hooked" on welfare in the first place.
<p>
Overall, the proposed legislation represents a significant and badly needed first step in overhauling a bloated and destructive welfare system. The proposed reforms will be of great benefit to society, the taxpayers, and, most important, welfare recipients themselves.

<title>Time To Enact Real Enterprise Zones -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>TIME TO ENACT REAL ENTERPRISE ZONES</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 438<br>

<p>
There is a genuine and urgent desire in Washington to trigger an economic rebirth of America's inner cities. But two rival proposals to help achieve that goal are the products of two profoundly different visions of how to generate economic development within inner-city America. One vision, which is the basis for an initiative being prepared by the Clinton Administration, assumes that progress can be achieved only if government leads the process of development and primes the economic pump. It calls, in effect, for an urban industrial policy managed from Washington. The other vision, which forms the core of bipartisan legislation intended as an amendment to the budget reconciliation bill, recognizes that the wise approach is not to try to pick winners and losers, but instead to provide the best possible climate of incentives and simplified regulation to foster local enterprises.
<p>
The White House view is that depressed neighborhoods can best be helped by steering more government programs into them. The Clinton Administration is readying a plan to do this by giving preferential treatment in awarding government contracts to firms operating in troubled neighborhoods. This initiative flows from the Administration's "Enterprise Zone" program, enacted in the last Congress, which centered on channeling government programs into targeted areas. The name given to that government-led program was particularly ironic since the original enterprise zone idea, developed in the 1980s, explicitly rejected the notion that government could trigger an economic recovery in the inner cities and called instead for a sharp reduction in regulation and taxes to spur business formation. That earlier version was not enacted.
<p>
A very different view of urban economic development is enshrined in bipartisan legislation introduced in the Senate recently. The sponsors intend it as an amendment to the upcoming reconciliation bill.
<p>
The Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act (S. 1252) is sponsored by Senators Spencer Abraham (R-MI) and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT). Cosponsors include Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA), Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL), John Breaux (D-LA), and Michael DeWine (R-OH.) The legislation would refocus and strengthen the Administration's enterprise zone program, based on a view of how to stimulate economic development in depressed neighborhoods that is very different from that held by the White House. Rather than have the government try to pick firms for preference in federal contracts, the Abraham-Lieberman bill seeks to make existing enterprise zones much more attractive to private investors. It would do this by eliminating the capital gains tax on investments in stock, business property, or a partnership in the zones, as well as by providing other tax incentives for direct investments and business redevelopment within the zones. The government would not limit these incentives to selected private investors or firms.
<p>
This approach understands that private investors are more likely than government officials to identify the entrepreneurs that can be the engines of economic development in depressed neighborhoods. It also recognizes that one of the main obstacles to business creation in these areas, particularly for small new firms, is the difficulty of attracting start-up and working capital. For small new enterprises, capital typically is obtained from  personal savings or private investors, not from the government--or even banks. That is why the capital gains tax exemption and other investor incentives in the Abraham-Lieberman bill are so important. As Senator Lieberman put it in a 1993 floor statement criticizing the lack of such incentives in the Clinton enterprise zone legislation, "Capital incentives are important because they are the one way... in which the government, with a small  expenditure, by reducing taxes, can draw in a large amount of private capital."
<p>
Stimulating a flow of private investor capital also recognizes that the firms most likely to succeed in a blighted area probably will not attract the attention of government. Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise for several years has been drawing public attention to the remarkable economic successes of locally generated inner-city enterprises in the most unlikely situations. Most of these enterprises would not qualify for a government contract or grant even if they sought it. But with the incentives of the Abraham-Lieberman bill, they are exactly the kind of innovative, upstart firms that would be sought out by risk-taking small investors.
<p>
These firms in the inner city also would be helped by another feature of the bill intended to remove some of the obstacles that add to the cost and frustrations of starting an enterprise. Within the enhanced enterprise zones, local governments could request waivers from federal regulations (other than civil rights, public safety, and similar rules) that hinder economic development. This is important because federal rules often unintentionally stymie economic and social improvement in depressed areas. For instance, restrictions on business activity in public housing projects in the past have blocked the creation of tenant businesses to provide child care, transportation, or other services that would make it easier for residents to become employed. Realizing the barriers posed by well-intentioned regulations that ignore practicality, many state and local governments have taken steps to simplify or pare back their own rules. The Abraham-Lieberman bill would require the federal government to do likewise in the zones.
<p>
The Abraham-Lieberman legislation would take the first steps to help stabilize depressed areas in two other crucial ways. First, it would foster home ownership within enterprise zones. Based on proposals first developed by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, the legislation would provide incentives and grants to encourage resident management and ownership of public housing and the ownership of vacant property. Experience has shown that resident management and home ownership encourage the sense of long-term commitment among the residents of a neighborhood that is so crucial to establishing a favorable climate for enterprise.
<p>
Second, the bill would give some financial help to low-income parents wishing to obtain a better education for their children by choosing an alternative public or private school. Though the provision is modest, it indicates that the sponsors appreciate that improving the climate for education, as well as for business and home ownership, is crucial to achieving the economic turnaround of inner-city America.
<p>
The Abraham-Lieberman legislation brings together a surprising group of bipartisan co-sponsors. They are united behind an approach to urban improvement that recognizes the failures of government-led economic development and the need instead to create a positive climate for investing in small local enterprises. If Congress is to play its proper role in reviving the inner cities, and the hopes of those who live there, the first step would be to include the Abraham-Lieberman legislation in the budget reconciliation bill.

<title>Legal Disservices Corp.: There Are Better Ways To Provide Legal Aid to the Poor -- Heritage </title>

<h2>Legal Disservices Corp.: There Are Better Ways To Provide Legal Aid to the Poor</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>Kenneth F. Boehm and Peter T. Flaherty </b></center><p>
Subscribe to <a href="/heritage/p_review/subscribe.html">Policy Review</a><br>Send a <a href="mailto:moffettk@heritage.org">Letter to the Editor</a><p>
	The Legal Services Corp. (LSC) exists ostensibly to provide legal counsel in civil matters to people who cannot afford it. Since it was set up as a quasi-independent government corporation in 1974, it has weathered accusations that it promotes an activist, ideological agenda at the expense of its poor clients, and it has survived numerous attempts at abolition or reform.<p>
	Now the House Budget Committee, under the leadership of its chairman, Congressman John Kasich of Ohio, has proposed to phase out its annual appropriation, currently at $400 million, over the next two years. American Bar Association President George Bushnell has defended the program and has called LSC critics "reptilian bastards." Numerous defenders of the LSC have taken to the floor of Congress to denounce proposals to trim funding for the agency on the grounds that without it, America's poor will be deprived of civil legal representation.<p>
	We offer a twofold answer. First, Americans should realize that the LSC is not the noble bulwark of the rights of the poor that its supporters claim. Its effectiveness at serving the poor has always been marred by its pursuit of a political agenda that wastes effort and money and at times works to the long-term detriment of the poor. <p>
	Second, alternatives to the LSC do exist. Private legal-aid societies predated federally-funded legal services by almost 90 years, and would be thriving today had the lure of federal money not ensnared many of them. Other alternatives flourish in spite of the hostility of groups such as LSC grantees and the organized bar.<p>
	On a political level, the legal-services "movement," as it styles itself, is a 30-year success story. Since its founding as part of Lyndon Johnson's "War on Poverty," it has pursued its agenda virtually unimpeded. It has withstood budget cuts and a challenge to its existence in the Reagan years, when it waged an extensive "survival campaign." During the 1990s, it has enjoyed increasing appropriations. Its grantees receive an additional $255 million per year (as of 1993) from state and local governments, money from interest on many accounts that lawyers hold in trust for their clients (known as IOLTA funds), and private sources. Its biggest achievement, however, has been securing astronomical amounts of money for recipients of government programs. The movement, however, must face up to a crisis even greater than Republican opposition in Congress: The entire rationale for its existence is flawed:<p>
	<b>Misunderstood needs.</b> The LSC was created to provide help in civil cases. Most legal problems that poor people face fall into several basic categories: family law, including divorce, custody, guardianship, and child-support issues; housing, including disputes between landlords and tenants; financial issues, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and credit problems; employment law; public benefits; prisoner rights; and immigration.<p>
  LSC supporters say that if it were not for the LSC, the 1.6 million poor people it assisted last year would be without any legal recourse whatsoever. The LSC itself proclaims its inadequacy to meet the needs of the poor by asserting that demand for its services vastly outstrips the $400 million provided by the federal government. The agency pleads for ever-increasing amounts of money on the basis of studies conducted by the American Bar Association (ABA) and in several states. These studies purport to show that only a minority of the legal needs of the poor are being met. The state studies asserted that the range was 14 to 23 percent of need.<p>
	Their methodology appears defective, however, because they fail to distinguish between "unmet" and "unrecognized" legal needs. Poor people were contacted randomly by phone, mail, or in person and asked whether they had problems in various areas, such as housing. If they responded that they had a problem with roaches, for instance, it was counted as an unmet legal need, even if the person had no intention of involving a lawyer in solving the problem. Under the consumer category, the most frequent problem cited was "turned down for credit." Many people are denied credit, but very few hire a lawyer. Yet, these responses were considered unmet legal needs.<p>
	<b>Misdirected agenda.</b> Even if we took these claims at face value, it's not hard to see why LSC resources don't go very far, because many LSC grantees have other plans for their money. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers" provide virtually no direct legal services to the poor. They are organized to address specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food. National in scope, the support centers often initiate litigation far from their offices. In 1993, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas to expand its child welfare system, and won $314,107 in legal fees for itself in the process. <p>	The real agenda of the federal legal-services program is "law reform." It is not to serve the needs of poor individuals, but to "rescue" the poor as a class from poverty through litigated increases in transfer payments. However well-intentioned, this mission suffers from the same contradiction as the "War on Poverty" itself. The welfare state has not led men and women out of poverty but instead created dependency and a permanent underclass. As long as the LSC dedicates itself to bolstering and expanding the welfare state, it will fail to "meet the needs" even as it defines them itself.<p>	Nevertheless, federally-funded legal services pursues its goal of law reform to effect a redistribution of income. Through class-action suits and lawsuits against local, state, and federal governments, LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions of dollars in expanded rights to welfare, Medicaid, and food-stamp benefits. In recent years, LSC grantees have sought to protect earlier gains by filing suits to obstruct or stop welfare reform in nearly every state in which it has been attempted. Yet a consensus seems to exist among political parties that the current welfare system has been eroding the family and fostering dependency for more than a generation. Expansion of benefits under the current system hardly seems like a compassionate cause on behalf of the poor.<p>	After year
s of abetting dependency by winning more social welfare benefits for more classes of people, LSC grantees have turned to pursuits overtly destructive of the poor. In dozens of cities, the legal-services movement has prevented local public-housing authorities from evicting drug dealers. LSC grantees have signed up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. They have also litigated to protect aggressive panhandling and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets. Some legal-services litigation has undermined parental rights and family cohesion. For example, some LSC grantees have sued to force housing authorities to lease apartments to unmarried minors.<p>	
<b>Bureaucratic structure.</b> The LSC is wedded to providing services by the so-called "staff attorney" model, which is essentially a bureaucratic model. A legal-services office is manned by lawyers who are employed by the program. An indigent person walks in the door, describes his or her problem, and a legal-services attorney decides whether to take the case. The LSC grantee is under no obligation to render assistance, and often does not. Instead of setting priorities in response to individual needs, LSC grantees may select cases according to their potential for advancing a social agenda.<p><b>A Prime Alternative </b><p>	In evaluating how the LSC is doing, it is worthwhile to look at two groups in Indianapolis that provide legal help to the poor. The Indianapolis Legal Aid Society (ILAS) was founded in 1941 and last year received all of its $458,000 budget from private sources, primarily the United Way. The Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI), on the other hand, was founded in 1966 as part of the federal legal-services program. Last year it received 84 percent of its $4.5 million budget in grants from the LSC, and another 12 percent from other government sources.<p>
	One might think that the group with the larger budget does a more effective job serving the poor. Unfortunately, it does not. In 1994, ILAS handled 6,079 cases while LSOI says that it handled 12,347. (A LSOI brochure complains that it was forced to reject over 6,000 additional cases "due to budgetary restraints.") The private group handled one-half as many cases on one-tenth of the LSC grantee's budget. That works out to an expenditure of $75 per case for ILAS and $367 for LSOI.<p>
	A closer look at these figures, however, may point to an even greater disparity. The ILAS figure of 6,079 includes only those cases that were actually contested, whether they went to trial or not. It does not include consultations and referrals. On the other hand, the LSOI figure of 12,347 appears to include brief consultations and the like. It reported to the LSC that it closed only 1,273 litigated cases in 1994! <P>
	ILAS materials state that it is "non-partisan and non-ideological" and does not engage in class-action suits. On the other hand, LSOI employs a full-time lobbyist and has, for example, filed a class action suit to stop implementation of Indiana governor Evan Bayh's welfare-reform plan.<p>
	Another difference is that ILAS does not take cases on behalf of individuals seeking benefits under government welfare programs. Public-benefits cases are a significant part of the LSOI caseload, and they are sometimes zealously pursued. For instance, LSOI sued Indiana in 1993 to continue AFDC benefits to a parent even though her children had been removed from the home because she failed to exercise responsibility for their care. <p>
<b>Life after the LSC</b><p>	The most remarkable thing about the private ILAS is that it exists at all. Private legal-aid societies like ILAS numbered in the hundreds across the country until the 1960s, when the federal government began offering direct grants to legal aid organizations <a href="#destroy">(See sidebar)</a>. ILAS was in the minority that resisted. Since 1974, each LSC grantee has enjoyed automatic refunding. The money flows to the same agencies, often administered by the same personnel, year after year. The system has never employed competitive grant procedures. Only a handful of programs have been defunded, and the LSC has not even tried to defund one since 1986. Scant evidence exists of innovation or experimentation with different approaches to meeting the legal needs of the poor. Luckily, others within the legal profession are meeting the challenge.<p>
	 <b>Expanded "judicare."</b> A preferable alternative to the LSC's staff attorney model is "judicare," offering legal services based on the so-called British System. Under judicare, an indigent client employs the private attorney of his or her choice, who is reimbursed by the government in accordance with a set schedule of fees. The LSC has funded only a few judicare programs, presumably because they offer little opportunity to practice so-called law reform.
<p>	In 1983, long-time judicare advocate Samuel Jan Brakel made his case this way: "What point or purpose is there in having a separate legal-aid establishment for the poor, staffed overwhelmingly by young and inexperienced lawyers, armed with a socio-political agenda and a whole folklore about what poor clients want, need, or what is good for them? Why patronize low-income people in this way? Why deprive them of the diversity of views, practices, and talents that abound in the private sector? Why deny them the right to choose their own lawyers? In no other area of social or human service that I am aware of have we made such a concerted, almost perverse, effort to avoid using the resources already existent and available."<p>
	In South Carolina, the LSC funds a judicare program called Legal Services of the Fourth Judicial District. This is an excellent model for private legal aid to the poor. Covering six counties, the program contracts with fifty-two private attorneys who receive referrals from a staff member in each county. According to the South Carolina Bar Foundation, last year the other five LSC programs in the state budgeted between 42 percent and 50 percent of their resources to direct client services, whereas the Fourth Judicial District group budgeted 68 percent.<p>
	Executive Director Robert Adams claims that he offers better service, too. "By offering the services of 52 panel attorneys, we feel the clients have access to a diversity of legal expertise instead of limiting them to a few staff attorneys." Adams also points out that new attorneys starting practices in small communities have benefited and have seen clients return as paying clients. Adams also notes that "our program has never been involved in class action suits, abortions, or fee generating cases."<p>
	<b><i>Pro bono</i> legal work.</b> While overstating legal needs of the poor, LSC proponents understate services that are already available, particularly in the amount level of <i>pro bono</i> legal work. <i>Pro bono</i> is a shortening of <i>pro bono publico</i> which means "for public good." It refers to legal help rendered to a client by a private attorney for no fee or a reduced fee.
<p>	The LSC underplays the amount of free legal work that is done in order to aggrandize the agency's importance. In May 1995, LSC chairman Douglas Eakeley and LSC president Alex Forger testified in Congress that 130,000 attorneys do <i>pro bono</i> work. But this figure is the number of attorneys who are formally enrolled in organized pro bono programs affiliated with LSC grantees.<p>
	The actual number doing <i>pro bono</i> work, including work on an ad hoc basis, is much higher. Although no national study exists, studies in individual states provide some useful data. A 1991 study by the State Bar of California reported that 64 percent of its members engaged in some form of voluntary, uncompensated legal work. A 1994 New York State Bar Association report put the figure at 49 percent. The American Bar Foundation places the total number of attorneys in the United States in 1995 at 896,000. If one adopts a rather conservative assumption that at least 40 percent engage in <i>pro bono</i> work, the number is 358,400, between two and three times the number cited by Eakeley and Forger.
<p>	Eakeley and Forger went on to testify that "<i>pro bono</i> services from private attorneys are at an all-time high primarily because of the efforts of the organized bar, the LSC, and local programs to involve private attorneys in the delivery of legal services." They were correct in pointing out that <i>pro bono</i> is at an all time high, but wrong to award the LSC a central role. During the 1980s, the ABA put a new stress on attorneys' <i>pro bono</i> obligation. A 1988 ABA resolution asked all attorneys to devote at least 50 hours per a year. An ABA directory of <i>pro bono</i> programs published in 1984 had 300 entries. The 1993-94 edition contained over 900 programs and indicates that no more than 375 of the programs are substantially supported by LSC grantees. (Some grantees are involved with more than one program.) Thus, the majority of <i>pro bono</i> programs would exist without the LSC and they are today more numerous than all the programs existing in 1984.
<p>	The LSC's involvement with <i>pro bono</i> largely stems from a somewhat modest attempt in the 1980s by the Reagan-appointed LSC board to provide competition to the staff-attorney system. Grantees were required to establish a "private-attorney involvement program," on which they must spend 12.5 percent of their annual federal grant. The attitude of the legal-services "movement" toward pro bono has often been hostile. Some LSC <i>pro bono</i> programs are notoriously inefficient. For instance, Legal Services Organization of Indiana managed to spend $408,867 in 1994 on a program that supposedly relied on voluntary help. It closed just 668 cases at an average cost of $612 per case.
<p>	Legal-services groups can only assist clients whose annual income is within 125 percent of the poverty level. Often, individuals cannot afford a lawyer, but have incomes which exceed this level. For example, Bay Area Legal Services, the LSC grantee in Tampa, Florida, was turning away a hundred legitimate cases a week because the clients earned too much. In response, 35-year-old real-estate attorney Mike Bedke sought to address the problem by launching the Courthouse Assistance Project. Except for office space provided by the Clerk of the Hillsborough County Court, the program receives no government support. It is staffed by volunteer attorneys who help 300 individuals per month right in the Courthouse on a first-come, first-served basis. Attorneys answer questions, help people fill out forms, and tell them what to expect in court. According to Bedke, "A lot of times we don't even have to help them file a lawsuit. It's a matter of resolving a dispute over the phone, writing a letter for them, or directing them to a particular agency."<p>
	Bedke, a board member of Bay Area Legal Services, says that Bay Area directors worried that the new program would compete for resources, but that he has found a "new class" of volunteers to staff the project. Bedke explains that many attorneys felt that Bay Area represented "welfare queens" and that they are much more willing to help clients who have jobs and are trying to get ahead. Through his position as chairman of the ABA's Young Lawyers Division, Bedke has been seeking to spread the program to other cities; so far 14 have emulated the Tampa project. Another two dozen have expressed interest.
<P>	Bedke says part of his inspiration came from a six-year-old Richmond, Virginia, project aimed specifically at the working poor. Hunton & Williams, the largest law firm in southeastern United States, opened an office in a basement in a distressed Richmond neighborhood.<p>
	Last year, the office handled about 600 client representations for a flat $50 fee, plus out-of-pocket expenses. For every reduced-fee client representation, the office handled two to three more consultations free of charge, usually resulting in some resolution short of legal action or a referral to another agency. Clients may earn up to twice the LSC eligibility level, although eligibility is not strenuously investigated, freeing time for the staff to work on actual cases. According to George H. Hettrick, a partner in the firm, "We believe the $50 fee is a good thing for the client. That person feels like a real client and not the recipient of charity. When people are given dignity, it fosters a more successful lawyer-client relationship."
<p>	The Hunton & Williams office in Church Hill receives no government support whatsoever. It is staffed by 60 of the firm's lawyers, who put in an average of 40 to 60 hours per year. The office handles housing, family, and guardianship cases, three types of cases shunned by private attorneys. In the housing category, the office not only handles landlord/tenant disputes, but also closings for first time home buyers, and the closings for the new owners of homes built or rehabilitated by Habitat for Humanity and other housing programs.
<p>
	<b>Alternative dispute resolution.</b> More and more poor people are avoiding legal services altogether by turning to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Informal ADR procedures like conciliation, arbitration, and mediation have enjoyed explosive growth in recent years. <p>
	The programs run the gamut from taxpayer-supported programs affiliated with state court systems to private, neighborhood programs. In New York, all 62 counties now have a Community Dispute Resolution Center. Each center is a private, nonprofit agency with a contract with the state court system. The program was established in 1981 with the support of both liberals and conservatives in the state legislature. By 1988, every county had one. Each currently receives up to 50 percent of its budget from the state. The balance is raised from local governments and private sources, like the United Way. New York will provide a total of $3.1 million for fiscal year 1995. 
<p>	Administered by a staff of four in Albany, the program depends on 2,254 trained volunteer mediators from all walks of life, including housewives and retirees. Most are nonlawyers. By any measure, the statistics quoted by the program's statewide office are impressive. In fiscal year 1994, the centers conducted 25,015 conciliations, mediations, and arbitrations involving 63,210 people. The first step is conciliation, where an attempt is made to work out the problem by phone or mail. If that doesn't work, the parties actually meet face-to-face with a mediator present. In 79 percent of the matters that reached the mediation stage, a voluntary agreement was reached. If there is still no resolution, the parties go to arbitration. <P>
	In fiscal year 1994, it took 16 days from the intake to final disposition for the average single-hearing case and 41 days for the average multi-hearing case. There were 13,609 cases involving a single hearing and just 623 requiring more than one. The average time per mediation or arbitration was one hour and 11 minutes. The average cost to the state for each case screened as appropriate for dispute resolution was $68. The average state cost per conciliation, mediation, and arbitration was $121. The centers reported $2,919,276 awarded in fiscal year 1994 in restitution and through mutual agreements. The average award per case was $788.
<p>	The centers are open to anyone. State courts make both voluntary and mandatory referrals, accounting for about half of the caseload. Clients may seek advice from lawyers, but very few disputants use them. A review of the disputes handled shows that they include those common to the poor. Thirty-four percent involved allegations of harassment, 24 percent alleged breach of contract, 7 percent housing, 7 percent interpersonal disputes, 7 percent assault, 4 percent personal or real property, and 4 percent custody, support, or visitation.<p>
	Interestingly, many dispute-resolution programs handle minor criminal cases. Thus, the approach to dispute resolution is comprehensive. Its goal is to prevent the escalation of problems, especially among people who know each other. A mutually acceptable resolution of a simple trespass case can prevent an assault later on. Sixteen percent of the disputes were between neighbors, 15 percent between acquaintances, 13 percent between tenants and landlords, 9 percent between consumers and merchants, 6 percent between family members, 4 percent between former boyfriends and girlfriends, and 4 percent between strangers. <p>
	According to the National Institute for Dispute Resolution, 27 states have formally incorporated various ADR methods into their court systems, up from just 10 in 1980. The National Center for State Courts reports that at least 1,200 programs around the nation are receiving referrals from state courts.
<p>	 One doesn't have to live in New York to take advantage of ADR. "Neighborhood justice centers" now exist in many urban areas around the country. Some receive support from local governments and some are privately funded. Some receive referrals from local courts and some do not. What they have in common is a minimum of bureaucracy and a reliance on volunteers to serve as third-party referees. The federal role in the development of these institutions is instructive. In 1978, the Justice Department dispensed 18-month seed grants to three neighborhood justice programs in Kansas City, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Smaller grants were also provided for another year of operation. But in contrast to the automatic refunding enjoyed by LSC grantees, the programs were on their own in the third year. The programs survived and centers in other cities blossomed with no federal seed money at all. Today, there are several hundred community and neighborhood justice centers. The National Association for Community Mediation has 150 programs in 37 states.<p>
<b>	Services by nonlawyers.</b> Along with ADR, nonlawyer practice (NLP) is growing rapidly. Independent paralegals and other specialists are performing tasks previously reserved for licensed attorneys. Nonlawyer practitioners handle such matters as uncontested divorces, wills, estates, bankruptcies, real estate closings, child custody and support, and immigration problems. They appear before 38 federal agencies. Many LSC-eligible clients take advantage of these services. Help Abolish Legal Tyranny (HALT), a Washington-based legal reform advocacy group, estimates that 5,000 independent paralegals (paralegals not employed by an attorney) are currently working in private practice. 
<p>	There would be more if not for the bitter opposition of state bar associations. These powerful groups lobby for "unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) statutes, which are on the books in every state except Arizona. The vast majority of UPL complaints are not filed by dissatisfied consumers, but by members of the bar. Not only has for-profit NLP been targeted for formal complaints, but also individuals and non-profit organizations that have been helping the poor. The most celebrated case is that of Rosemary Furman, a legal secretary who escaped going to jail in the mid-1980s. Her crime was to charge a small fee for helping battered women fill out civil protection orders and divorce forms. HALT says that it gets an average of two calls per week from nonlawyers being investigated or charged under UPL.<p>
	The LSC has fought competition from nonlawyers. In Jacksonville, Florida, nonlawyer Susan Longley operated American Legal Clinic, Inc., now known as American Documents Clinic, Inc. Among other things, Longley assisted people in the preparation of Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings. She handled a filing for Sandra Samuels for $215, saving her home from foreclosure. Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, Inc., an LSC grantee, soon after launched a successful UPL action against Longley, and in December 1994 was awarded $5,316.20 in legal fees even though the judge found that the client had not been harmed in any way.<p>
	In response to the NLP phenomena, the ABA formed a Commission on Nonlawyer Practice scheduled to make a report in 1996, but most state bar association officials remain deadset against any increased role for NLP. Most argue that clients are put at risk by nonlawyers handling legal problems. But former New Jersey Bar President Thomas Curtin was quoted in the July 3, 1995, <i>Lawyers Weekly</i>, "I have no difficulty saying my position is protecting the interests of lawyers. Why is the ABA, an organization that is supposed to working for lawyers, trying to find work for nonlawyers? That is not the business of the ABA. This is the American Bar Association, not the American Paralegal Association."
<p>	<b>Do-it-yourself.</b> In her unsuccessful fight to offer legal services, Longley was also enjoined from using any computer program or legal form designed for use by attorneys. It is easy to see why lawyers are concerned about these tools. Self-help legal publications and computer programs are enjoying expanded sales. Ralph Warner, the editor of NOLO Press of Berkeley, California, estimates that how-to legal publications are now a $50 million business. One of NOLO's most popular titles is "How to File for Bankruptcy." Another is "Plan Your Estate." Its most popular software package, allowing individuals to create their own wills, sold 60,000 last year. <p><b>What to Do?</b>
<p>	The best thing the government can do for the poor is to do away with the LSC. The agency won't go willingly, so Congress should abolish it. Additionally, care should be exercised in replacing it with something else. The potential of unintended consequences is a central lesson of the last 30 years. A number of ideas have been proposed, but should be discarded: <p><ul>	<li>"Reform" of the Legal Services Corp. No new regulations or restrictions can reform a program founded on a flawed premise <a href="#reform">(see sidebar)</a>. <li>A federal judicare program. The last thing the country needs is Medicare for lawyers. State and locally-funded judicare programs are worthy of support, particularly in rural areas.<li>Block grants to the states. Preferable to the present LSC-grant system, they may be useful during a phase out of federal funding. Block grants pose the danger, however, of preserving a federal role in legal services.<li>Mandatory <i>pro bono. Pro bono</i> should not result from coercion. It is a violation of attorneys' free association rights and undercuts the voluntary spirit necessary for successful <i>pro bono</i> work.</ul><p>
	How then should the legal needs of the poor be met? First, it should be recognized that there are certain needs the poor don't have. Without deep pockets, they seldom get sued. When injured or harmed due to the negligence of others, there is no need for a taxpayer-provided lawyer. All a victim has to do is to call the number on the television screen. Plenty of private lawyers await with open arms to take contingency cases.<p>
	Second, it should also be recognized that many of the present legal problems of the poor do not require lawyers. Deregulation of the legal profession will provide disproportionate relief to the poor. ADR and NLP are well suited for many of the kinds of problems the poor encounter.<p>
	Third, legal needs which actually require a lawyer should not be established on the basis of self-serving and nonsensical studies sponsored by federal grant recipients. It may be impossible to quantify legal needs in the first place. In our lawyer-rich society, legal problems are whatever clever lawyers decide to bring forth. Actual needs can only be established by poor people themselves exercising free choice. A federal income-tax deduction for <i>Pro bono</i> work would help make the system client-based, rather than attorney-based. Such an incentive was proposed by GOP Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois in the early 1980s with a monetary cap on the total deduction. 
<p>	The good news is that an expansion of <i>pro bono</i> work is already underway and the legal profession has been aggressively promoting it, notwithstanding ABA support for the LSC. Ending the federal legal-services program would further oblige attorneys to assist the poor. The existence of a federal program has undoubtedly provided some attorneys with the rationale to shirk responsibilities in their own communities. A federal income tax deduction is not a panacea, however. The success of <i>pro bono</i> should not be dependent on the availability of a tax deduction, but on a renewal of the voluntary spirit of members of the bar.<p>
	 Many attorneys will be more likely to engage in <i>pro bono</i> in a structured program, and there are many areas where a storefront, walk-in office would a tremendous convenience for the poor and working poor. As is being demonstrated in Indianapolis, a private institution can serve the poor better than a public one. We should work to restore the ethos of the private legal-aid society that not dependent on government funds.<p>
	Indeed, the private legal-aid society can serve as a useful model for LSC grantees if they should lose federal funding. The transition to a nonfederal system will not be tumultuous. As noted, LSC grantees already receive $255 million from non-LSC sources. Unlike other federal programs, LSC grantees may carry over surpluses each year, and some programs have significant reserves socked away. A simple policy decision to stop doing class-action suits, public-benefits cases, advocacy, and lobbying would allow most grantees to help more poor individuals, even on a reduced budget. If programs are truly providing a valuable service, they should be able to raise money locally.<p>
	Ultimately, legal services for the poor cannot be separated from legal services for everyone. Problems of affordability and accessibility are not limited to the poor or working poor. Our society threatens to become "overrun by hordes of lawyers, hungry as locusts," as Warren Burger, the late chief justice of the Supreme Court, put it. Reducing litigation and lowering its cost through tort reform and other measures would benefit everyone. Getting lawyers out of lives of Americans, including the poor, is the real point.

<blockquote>
<a name="destroy"><b>The Destruction of Legal-Aid Societies </b></a><br>
	The Legal Aid Society of New York was the nation's first, opening its doors with one part-time attorney in 1876. Private societies numbered more than 200 by the mid-1960s and, except in a few municipalities, received no government support. Overall, about 60 percent of their financial support came from community chests, 15 percent from bar associations, and the rest from individuals and businesses.
<p>	An 89-year-old tradition of private legal aid ended in 1965 when the federal government began making direct grants to legal-aid organizations through the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a cornerstone of Lyndon Baines Johnson's "War on Poverty." The previously private societies constituted 60 percent of the grantees of the new  federal program. 
<P>	With federal funding came dramatic change. Sargent Shriver's OEO spearheaded a shift in emphasis to "law reform," the expansion of poverty benefits through litigation. The directors and staffs of many programs resented Washington setting local priorities, but were quickly overwhelmed. The law gave the OEO powers to award grants to antipoverty agencies on any basis. <p>
	The introduction of federal funds provided huge power to the small but highly ideological OEO staff to set priorities and demand changes in local organizations. Few local aid societies and bar organizations could resist the allure of new federal funds. The annual budgets of the private legal-aid societies totaled about $4 million in 1964. The federal program initially promised an annual expenditure 10 times that amount to groups administered or heavily influenced by local bar groups. In cases where the existing legal-aid operation refused to remake itself to the OEO's liking, a competing organization was founded and funded instead. By 1967, the OEO was distributing $42 million to 300 organizations. The OEO's crash campaign resulted in a network of law offices and attorneys equal in size to the U.S. Department of Justice and all its U.S. Attorney offices.  <p>
	The OEO placed its own personnel in programs it funded through something called the Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship Program. Beginning in 1967, young attorneys were recruited and trained in the principles and tactics of "poverty law." Sent out to local grantees, the "Reggies" remained employees of the Smith program.<p>
	By 1971, 25 percent of all LSC lawyers were graduates of the program. Fred Speaker, an OEO official at the time, expressed the OEO attitude to the formerly private groups: "We are a program that six years ago rose out of the sloth of token, tired, 19th-century legal-aid societies." Private institutions were not just crowded out by public ones, but were actively undermined and infiltrated in a campaign akin to a corporate takeover.<p>	 "Law reform" proceeded at a furious pace. By 1972, some 219 cases had been brought all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court by LSC attorneys. Under the former private system, not one case had ever gone that far. Through the end of 1972, some $290 million in federal funds had been spent on legal services, but the cost to the taxpayer was actually more than $2 billion. 
<P>	In 1973, President Nixon proposed to dismantle the OEO, and appointed as its director Howard Phillips, who promptly canceled "law reform" as a goal. Congressional supporters of legal services moved to "insulate" the program from "political pressure" and sought to establish an independent Legal Service Corp. (LSC), along the lines of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Richard Nixon signed the Legal Services Corp. Act on July 25, 1974the last legislation he signed before resigning. During congressional hearings this year, LSC officials pointed out that Nixon created the LSC, but they did not mention that liberal senators were holding up funds for his Watergate defense at the time.<p>
	The new LSC has dispensed funds in much the same way as the OEO did. According to Indiana University Law Professor William F. Harvey, a director of the Indianapolis Legal Aid Society and chairman of the LSC during the 1980s, "The effort to undermine the private legal-aid societies continued under the LSC, particularly during the chairmanship of Hillary Rodham Clinton [1978-80]. The Washington-based LSC ideologues cannibalized the standards, criteria, the concepts, even the esprit de corps of America's legal-aid societies."
</blockquote><hr length=70%><P>
<hr length=70%> <blockquote>
<a name="reform"><b>Why the LSC Cannot Be Reformed (sidebar)</b></a><br>
	Responding to criticism of the Legal Services Corp. (LSC), the agency's defenders in Washington favor reform over elimination. But the LSC is not reformable. The Legal Services Corp. Act of 1974, which created the corporation, allows it to take public funds$400 million this yearand transforms them into private funds, immune from the checks that apply to other types of federal spending.
<p>	The law also established a unique, hybrid structure for the corporation that guarantees it can never be accountable. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation that makes grants to 323 separately incorporated private nonprofit grantees. The LSC's 11-member board is appointed by the president, subject to Senate confirmation, but the board has little actual influence over the grantees and how they spend their grants. Nor does the executive branch have much influence over the LSC budget. By law, it goes straight from the LSC to Congress, and the Office of Management and Budget may only review it.<p>
	The LSC's status as a private corporation exempts it from many federal criminal laws pertaining to government officials, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act. Although it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act frustrates operation of that law by declaring that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>
	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought in vain to exercise oversight. Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, Congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy have been ignored or circumvented, primarily through the nonfederal funds "dodge." Since most grantees receive some funding from IOLTA and state and local governments, they are able to claim that any restricted activities are not done with their LSC funds.<p>
	There is no way to verify this because legal-services attorneys do not keep time sheets, thereby eliminating the only means of federal oversight. Furthermore, legal-services lawyers do not report the cases on which they work to anyone beyond their offices, and all case records are off limits. This secrecy, shielded by an invocation of the attorney-client privilege, prevents Congress from evaluating the effectiveness of any legal-services program. There are no provisions for the privilege to be waived for purposes of oversight, even though the overseers have paid for the services. <p>
	As a result of these factors, we have little information on expenditures by case or by category or service. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, the LSC has continued to ask for funding increases without offering any detailed evidence that previous funding has been used well.<p>
	The LSC can track the use of its grants through a monitoring program that includes on-site visits by Washington-based staff. During the Bush administration, about 125 visits took place annually, meaning the average program could expect a visit once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, only six monitoring visits took place last year.<p>
	The LSC structure is ripe for abuse, and abuses will be rampant as long as it exists. It makes little difference who is in the White House, the Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as funds flow through the 323 LSC grantees, public funds will continue to be spent by private citizens pursuing a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman, a legal theorist who helped draft the 1974 Act, wrote in 1984, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."

It's a pleasure to be back at Heritage. I've enjoyed your hospitality many times before.
Your willingness to hear from the nation's governors is just one bit of evidence that this institution has the wisdom-- all too rare in this town -- to know that Washington doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas.  
<P>  
The American people are fed up with an arrogant and out-of-touch federal government. That's what fueled  
the ballot box rebellion of 1994. 

Yet, despite the enormous success of the House Republicans in delivering on the Contract with America,  
voters remain deeply cynical about Washington's ability to make change. 
  
In fact, a poll done last week by <i>USA Today</i> showed voters' faith in Congress at an historic low. 

Why? Well, I can't think of a better example of what fuels voter cynicism about Washington than the status  
of welfare reform. 
<P>  
The American people are justifiably outraged by a federal welfare system that contradicts their values. It  
penalizes work, discourages marriage, and encourages illegitimacy. 

A foreign power bent on ruining America couldn't have designed a more destructive system than the one  
Washington has imposed on the American people. 

That's why in 1992, a candidate who promised to "end welfare as we know it" held such appeal for many  
voters. But what we've seen since has only deepened their contempt for D.C. 
<P>  
Bill Clinton has been President for almost a thousand days, three quarters of it with heavy Democratic  
majorities in Congress. 

And how far has he gotten on his pledge? 

Well he spent $33 billion of the taxpayers money on "welfare as we know it." 

Nearly a million more people have enrolled in "welfare as we know it." 

And today, 600,000 more children are living on "welfare as we know it." 
 <P> 
But Bill Clinton hasn't changed one word of federal law to "end welfare as we know it." Not one. 

Cal Ripken isn't the only guy with a streak still going strong. 

Every day Bill Clinton sits on the Oval Office, he's still not ending welfare as we know it.  He's extending  
welfare, and he knows it. 
<P>  
Voters understand that it is possible to change welfare. 

Millions of them -- in states as diverse as Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and California --  
have seen their governors do it, often with bipartisan support, often with limited resources, and often  
despite lawsuits from the welfare defenders. 

In California, I've reduced welfare grants by 20 percent, saved the taxpayers $9 billion, doubled the  
number of welfare recipients at work, and insisted that teenage parents on welfare live in their parents'  
home, that parents get the check, and the girl stay in school to learn the skills that will let her and her child  
escape welfare. 
<P>  
By contrast, the federal model of welfare simply provides a welfare check to an unwed child-mother -- who  
is too young to get a driver's license -- so she can move out to her own apartment.  How utterly  
irresponsible. 

Then she is given even more accessible prey to the next man seeking a junior-high school one-night stand  
romance. 

It doesn't have to be that way.  People can escape welfare.  But it takes work, and it happens one person at  
a time. 

A great example is Trish Molina. 
<P>  
I met Trish in California's Riverside County after she graduated from our successful welfare work program  
known as GAIN. 
 
She got an entry-level job at a small wireless cable company.  She's since been promoted three times.  
  
Today, she's the assistant to the head of the company.  She's happy. She loves her career.  She just needed  
the skills and discipline to take a job and stick with it. 

Most important, the job isn't just helping her, it's helping her children. 

They now have the example of a mother who gets up every morning and goes to work, teaching them what  
it means to accept responsibility for yourself and contribute to your community. 
 <P>
The young mother says that now that she's working she respects herself and her children respect her too. 

That's why we need welfare reform that demands personal responsibility, encourages work and discourages  
irresponsible behavior. 

Yet, President Clinton has not only failed to make significant welfare reform in Washington, he's actually  
blocked state like mine that are trying to make that change. 
<p>
At a meeting of the nation's governors, he promised to approve welfare waivers in 90 days or less, whether  
he agreed with the changes or not. 
 
In California, we sought a federal waiver for one reform we wanted to make to reduce welfare grants...and  
to make work more attractive than welfare. 
 
That was over a year ago. 

And the Clinton Administration continues to delay it at a cost to traxpayers of $3 million a week. 
<P>  
We've sought another waiver since November. 

This one would allow us to end the practice of giving larger and larger welfare checks to women who have  
more and more children while already on welfare. 

We think it's simply wrong to reward that kind of irresponsible behavior.  Working families don't get an  
automatic pay raise when they have more children, so why should women on welfare? 

And why should a young couple working and saving to have a child be taxed to subsidize that welfare  
mother's irresponsibility? 
<P>
It seems simple enough to me, but it took the Clinton Administration months to respond to our request. 
 

Then, in twisted logic that could only make sense to Washington, the Clinton Administration decided we 
could stop rewarding adults for having more and more children on welfare...but they insisted we had to 
continue rewarding teenagers for the same irresponsible behavior. 
<P>
Well, I've got news for them: Having more and more children on welfare is wrong whether you're and adult 
or a teenager. 

That's why I refuse to accept this absurd condition from President Clinton. 

Today, I'm rejecting President Clinton's half-baked waiver and insisting that he live up to his promise.

Mr. President, grant this waiver and every other waiver California has requested as you promised you 
would...with no strings attached. 
 
It's what you promised the American people.  Have the guts to keep your word. 
<P>  
Unfortunately, like a lot of voters, I'm skeptical he will. 
<P>
And his continued failure to reform welfare is why action in the Congress is so important.  Congress is our 
last best hope for real reform. 

When the House passed welfare reform in less than 100 days, a skeptical public were given a glimmer of 
hope that things might really be changing in Washington.  

But then, welfare reform landed in the Senate. 
<P>  
More and more, the Senate looks like the graveyard for the Contract with America. 

0n the balanced budget amendment.  On tax cuts.  On the crime bill.  And now, on welfare reform.

The Senate's continued delay holds states hostage to the whims of Bill Clinton's welfare bureaucrats.  We 
are compelled to wrench reform from hostile guardians of the status quo. 
 <P>
Worse yet, the compromises being cut in the Senate raise serious doubts as to whether the Senate 
Republican Leader really understands the mandate voters gave us last November to make drastic change.

There's been plenty of hot rhetoric on the Senate floor about freeing states from federal mandates.

But under the Dole welfare compromise, states would be denied the chance to make even the most basic 
decisions. 

In many cases, Senator Dole would simply leave us with watered-down version of current law. 
<P>  
For example, Senator Dole's compromise would continue to set the minimum level a state must spend on 
welfare. 

A similar, so-called "maintenance of effort requirement" in current law is what's preventing me from 
saving taxpayers $3 million a week. 

Why would a Republican committed to fundamental change support a federal mandate like that?

Congress has no business dictating terms like that to the states. 

California is a proud and sovereign state, not a colony of the federal government. 
<P>
In another concession to Senate liberals, Senator Dole has agreed to extend federal disability benefits to 
individuals whose only disability is self-inflicting drug and alcohol abuse.

Today, nearly 100,000 individuals collect such benefits.  And the number grew nearly six-fold in five years.

But why should that surprise us?

What alcoholic would pass up a chance to have the taxpayers pick up their bar tab?
<P>
That's why the House welfare bill ended this absurd practice next month.

The budget I just signed would end these benefits on the same day.  But Senator Dole's bill would force us 
to continue paying these benefits for more than a year. In California alone, that would cost taxpayers more 
than $1 million a week.

That's not only an insult to taxpayers, it's an outrage for the federal government to be subsidizing 
someone's addiction.  As the head of one homeless shelter described it, it's "suicide on the installment 
plan."
<p>
It's wrong and it's got to stop.
<P>
Yet, even as Senator Dole is imposing these indefensible mandates on the states, he's ignoring the one 
crisis that deserves national attention -- the epidemic of out-of-wedlock teen births.

Today, one in tree children is born out of wedlock. In some of America's largest cities, more children are 
born to unmarried women than into two-parent families.

And the 14-year-old girl who becomes an unwed mother is all too likely to give birth to a girl who will 
become a 14-year-old unwed mother herself, or a boy who will become a 14-year-old triggerman for a 
drug gang.
<P> 
If Senator Dole is truly concerned about the crisis of values in America, he should not be content with 
talking about the perverse values promoted by our popular media.  He should start doing something about 
the perverse values promoted by the federal welfare system.

The Contract with America included many reforms we've made in California to stem this crisis of 
illegitimacy.

It stops rewarding women with bigger welfare checks for having more and more children out-of-wedlock.

Yet, Senator Dole excluded this important change from the Senate version of the bill.  He was unwilling to 
include this fundamental reform.
<P>
It is not leadership to settle for less than the fundamental change we need by cutting deals which 
compromise our values.

We must demand nothing less than the courage and conviction to make fundamental change in policy...if 
we're to have any hope of changing a tragically permissive culture.

America deserves better, and must demand it.
<P>
If we make these changes, we'll free millions of Americans from the chains of dependency that stifle 
opportunity.

We'll renew the dream of a nation where work is respected and rewarded and where rights are balanced by 
responsibility.
<P>
The biggest mistake we can make is to be too timid in our reforms.  The task we face is great, but we dare 
not miss this opportunity.  It may not come again soon.

Thank you, very much.  Now, I'd be happy to take your questions.

But beginning in parochial school I was taught that He could use  natural processes to produce life. Contrary to conventional wisdom, religion  has made room for science for a long time. But as biology uncovers startling  complexity in life, the question becomes, can science make room for religion?  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>In his statement, the Pope was careful to point out that  it is better to talk about &quot;theories of evolution&quot; rather than  a single theory. The distinction is crucial. Indeed, until I completed  my doctoral studies in biochemistry, I believed that Darwin's mechanism  -- random mutation paired with natural selection -- was the correct explanation  for the diversity of life. Yet I now find that theory incomplete. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, the complex design of the cell has provoked me  to stake out a distinctly minority view among scientists on the question  of what caused evolution. I believe that Darwin's mechanism for evolution  doesn't explain much of what is seen under a microscope. Cells are simply  too complex to have evolved randomly; intelligence was required to produce  them. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>I want to be explicit about what I am, and am not, questioning.  The word &quot;evolution&quot; carries many associations. Usually it means  common descent -- the idea that all organisms living and dead are related  by common ancestry. I have no quarrel with the idea of common descent,  and continue to think it explains similarities among species. By itself,  however, common descent doesn't explain the vast differences among species.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's where Darwin's mechanism comes in. &quot;Evolution&quot;  also sometimes implies that random mutation and natural selection powered  the changes in life. The idea is that just by chance an animal was born  that was slightly faster or stronger than its siblings. Its descendants  inherited the change and eventually won the contest of survival over the  descendants of other members of the species. Over time, repetition of the  process resulted in great changes -- and, indeed, wholly different animals.    That's the theory. A practical difficulty, however, is that one can't  test the theory from fossils. To really test the theory, one has to observe  contemporary change in the wild, in the laboratory or at least reconstruct  a detailed pathway that might have led to a certain adaptation. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Darwinian theory successfully accounts for a variety of  modern changes. Scientists have shown that the average beak size of Galapagos  finches changed in response to altered weather patterns. Likewise, the  ratio of dark- to light-colored moths in England shifted when pollution  made light-colored moths more visible to predators. Mutant bacteria survive  when they become resistant to antibiotics. These are all clear examples  of natural selection in action. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>But these examples involve only one or a few mutations,  and the mutant organism is not much different from its ancestor. Yet to  account for all of life, a series of mutations would have to produce very  different types of creatures. That has not yet been demonstrated. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Darwin's theory encounters its greatest difficulties when  it comes to explaining the development of the cell. Many cellular systems  are what I term &quot;irreducibly complex.&quot; That means the system  needs several components before it can work properly. An everyday example  of irreducible complexity is a mousetrap, built of several pieces (platform,  hammer, spring and so on). Such a system probably cannot be put together  in a Darwinian manner, gradually improving its function. You can't catch  a mouse with just the platform and then catch a few more by adding the  spring. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>All the pieces have to be in place before you catch any  mice. An example of an irreducibly complex cellular system is the bacterial  flagellum: a rotary propeller, powered by a flow of acid, that bacteria  use to swim. The flagellum requires a number of parts before it works --  a rotor, stator and motor. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, genetic studies have shown that about 40  different kinds of proteins are needed to produce a working flagellum.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The intracellular transport system is also quite complex.  Plant and animal cells are divided into many discrete compartments; supplies,  including enzymes and proteins, have to be shipped between these compartments.  Some supplies are packaged into molecular trucks, and each truck has a  key that will fit only the lock of its particular cellular destination.  Other proteins act as loading docks, opening the truck and letting the  contents into the destination compartment. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many other examples could be cited. The bottom line is  that the cell -- the very basis of life -- is staggeringly complex. But  doesn't science already have answers, or partial answers, for how these  systems originated? No. As James Shapiro, a biochemist at the University  of Chicago, wrote, &quot;There are no detailed Darwinian accounts for the  evolution of any fundamental biochemical or cellular system, only a variety  of wishful speculations.&quot;   A few scientists have suggested non-Darwinian  theories to account for the cell, but I don't find them persuasive. Instead,  I think that the complex systems were designed - purposely arranged by  an intelligent agent. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whenever we see interactive systems (such as a mousetrap)  in the everyday world, we assume that they are the products of intelligent  activity. We should extend the reasoning to cellular systems. We know of  no other mechanism, including Darwin's, which produces such complexity.  Only intelligence does. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Of course, I could be proved wrong. If someone demonstrated  that, say, a type of bacteria without a flagellum could gradually produce  such a system, or produce any new, comparably complex structure, my idea  would be neatly disproved. But I don't expect that to happen. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Intelligent design may mean that the ultimate explanation  for life is beyond scientific explanation. That assessment is premature.  But even if it is true, I would not be troubled. I don't want the best  scientific explanation for the origins of life; I want the correct explanation.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pope John Paul II spoke of &quot;theories of evolution.&quot;  Right now it looks as if one of those theories involves intelligent design.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+1>Michael Behe is a Professor  at Lehigh University and the author of the critically acclaimed <I>Darwin's  Black Box</I>.</FONT></B></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

<H3>A Review of Michael Behe's <I>Darwin's Black Box</I><BR>
(The Free Press, 1996, 307 pages, $25)<BR>
<I>By Nancy Pearcy</I></H3>
<IMG SRC="newbar.gif" WIDTH="406" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM">&quot;When light strikes the retina, a photon is absorbed by a
molecule<BR>
called cis-retinal, which causes it to change to trans-retinal.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Such scientific jargon was unfamiliar terrain for a Washington, D.C., think<BR>
tank, and the audience grew hushed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The change in retinal forces a corresponding change in the protein<BR>
rhodopsin, which allows it to interact with another protein called<BR>
transducin.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Glances shot around the room, as members of the audience furtively sought
out<BR>
others who were equally mystified.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Transducin dissociates from a small molecule called GDP and binds<BR>
to a different molecule called GTP, and this complex binds to a<BR>
protein called phosphodiesterase. . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For several minutes the polysyllabic mysteries piled up, until finally<BR>
embarrassed laughter broke out. But <A HREF="behe.html">Michael Behe</A>
had made his point: Speaking<BR>
to a group of educated non scientists, he had walked them through the complex<BR>
molecular interactions required for vision in way they will never forget.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's book <I>Darwin's Black Box</I> does the same thing for readers, painting
a<BR>
vivid picture of the cell's complexity. But his purpose is not simply to
give a<BR>
charming exposition of popular science, it is to challenge the Darwinist<BR>
hegemony in biology. Behe's thesis is that life depends on a host of molecular<BR>
systems that are irreducibly complex, a phrase he coins to mean that such<BR>
systems consist of several interlocking parts that must be in place before
they<BR>
can function. And since Darwinian processes kick in only _after_ there is<BR>
minimal function, the origin of an irreducibly complex system is out of
reach of<BR>
standard Darwinian explanations.<BR>
<BR>
As an analogy, Behe invokes the humble mousetrap: You can not start with
a<BR>
wooden platform and catch a few mice, add a spring and catch a few more
mice,<BR>
add a hammer, and so on, with gradual improvement of function. To function
at<BR>
all, a mousetrap requires a minimum number of interacting parts assembled
from<BR>
the outset. By the same token, an irreducibly complex organic system like<BR>
vision must come together all at once. It cannot appear gradually, piece
by<BR>
piece.<BR>
<BR>
But the heart of Darwinism is precisely such a gradualist scenario. Darwin<BR>
obligingly offered a way to falsify his own theory, writing: &quot;If it
could be<BR>
demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have
been<BR>
formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely<BR>
break down.&quot; Behe's point is that the cell is chock full of molecular
systems<BR>
that could not possibly have formed by successive, slight modifications.
Ergo,<BR>
Darwinism has broken down.<BR>
<BR>
To be fair to Darwin, he proposed his theory when scientists knew next to<BR>
nothing about biochemistry. Living things were &quot;black boxes,&quot;
their inside<BR>
workings a mystery. The cell itself was thought to be nothing more than
a blob<BR>
of jelly like protoplasm. It was easy to draw large scale scenarios about
fins<BR>
gradually turning into legs, or legs into wings, since no one had a clue
how<BR>
limbs and organs work from the inside. As Behe writes, it's as though someone<BR>
asked how a stereo system is made and we answered, &quot;by plugging a set
of<BR>
speakers into an amplifier and adding a CD player, radio receiver, and tape<BR>
deck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Today that kind of answer won't cut it, Behe insists. The &quot;black box&quot;
of the<BR>
cell has been opened and biologists are intimately familiar with its inside<BR>
workings--its nuts and bolts. Any successful explanation of the origin of<BR>
living things must deal with molecular systems.<BR>
<BR>
Consider the origin of vision, a problem Darwin said made him shudder. Richard<BR>
Dawkins, a contemporary Darwinist, brushes it off as no problem whatsoever:
We<BR>
merely begin with a light sensitive spot, Dawkins writes, move to a group
of<BR>
cells cupped to focus light better, and continue through a graded series
of<BR>
infinitesimal improvements to a true lens.<BR>
<BR>
The sequence is quite persuasive on the surface. But what about _under_
the<BR>
surface? To function, Behe argues, even Dawkins's initial light sensitive
spot<BR>
requires a cascade of factors, starting with cis-retinal and rhodopsin.
About<BR>
these complex molecular systems Dawkins is silent. As for those cupped cells,<BR>
dozens of proteins are involved in controlling shape and structure. About
these<BR>
complex proteins Dawkins says nary a word. It's the old strategy of telling
us<BR>
that stereos are made by plugging in speakers and a CD player.<BR>
<BR>
What we really want to know is whether Darwinism can explain how the speakers<BR>
and CD players themselves were assembled. Behe argues that it cannot, and<BR>
offers two types of arguments. On one hand, Behe has combed the scientific<BR>
literature and announces that there are virtually no professional papers<BR>
proposing detailed, testable hypotheses about the evolution of complex molecular<BR>
structures. Explanations simply do not exist.<BR>
<BR>
And the reason they are non-existent, Behe says, delivering his second punch,
is<BR>
that a Darwinian explanation of an irreducibly complex system is logically<BR>
impossible. At the heart of the book are five chapters that drive the point<BR>
home by describing different types of irreducible complexity. Some systems<BR>
consist of interdependent parts that must be assembled all at once, like
a<BR>
mousetrap. An example is the hair-like cilium, which functions like an oar
and<BR>
requires the interplay of more than 200 different proteins. Other systems
are<BR>
sequential, like a Rube Goldberg machine. An example is the blood-clotting<BR>
mechanism, in which numerous steps are exquisitely timed by a series of<BR>
catalysts to ensure that blood clots at the site of a wound and at no other<BR>
place or time. Still other systems depend on delicate recognition signals.<BR>
Certain molecules in the cell act as transport vessels that must recognize
the<BR>
right &quot;pick-up&quot; and &quot;drop-off&quot; zones, as well as the
right materials to carry.<BR>
<BR>
These examples are described in lively prose, sprinkled with vivid<BR>
illustrations. Any reader who follows Behe's descriptions will find it<BR>
difficult not to agree that the complexity of these molecular systems is
indeed<BR>
irreducible--that they could not arise by any step-by-step, Darwinian process.<BR>
<BR>
What alternative does Behe offer? Intelligent design theory. Structures
that<BR>
consist of interacting, co-adapted parts, he argues, are evidence of a<BR>
purposeful, intelligent agent. At this point, many readers may balk, objecting<BR>
that science is not equipped to deal with anything outside nature. To which<BR>
Behe replies: Catch up with the late-twentieth century. It was sixty years
ago<BR>
that the Big Bang theory was proposed, and cosmologists had to confront
the idea<BR>
of an ultimate origin of the universe--no matter how philosophically &quot;repugnant&quot;<BR>
(Eddington's word) they found that idea because of its implication of a
personal<BR>
creator. Now it is biology's turn to recognize that its data may likewise
have<BR>
discomfiting implications.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe is careful to limit his own discussion to the data itself. Thus
he<BR>
denies that from design we can infer the existence of the Christian God.
All we<BR>
can say is that a natural object exhibits the characteristics of intelligent<BR>
manufacture. In Behe's words, &quot;inferences to design do not require
that we have<BR>
a candidate for the role of designer.&quot; We might select a candidate
based on<BR>
philosophical or theological grounds but not on scientific grounds.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's tight focus on scientific data means he treats historical and<BR>
philosophical issues only gingerly. Except for brief (though illuminating)<BR>
discussions of Paley and Socrates, we hear little about the history of the<BR>
concept of design. Apart from a quotation from St. George Mivart, we learn
next<BR>
to nothing about the history of the Darwinian controversy. No mention is
made<BR>
of Georges Cuvier, who in the nineteenth century developed a similar notion
of<BR>
irreducible complexity (calling it &quot;the correlation of parts&quot;).
Nor is any<BR>
acknowledgement made of contemporary proponents of design theory, such as<BR>
Michael Denton (_Evolution: A Theory in Crisis_) or Thaxton, Bradley, and
Olsen<BR>
(_The Mystery of Life's Origin_).<BR>
<BR>
This narrow lens may be frustrating to some readers, but adopting it was<BR>
probably good strategy. Behe is an associate professor of biochemistry at<BR>
Lehigh University, and he stays squarely within his own field of expertise.
He<BR>
crafts one basic argument, and crafts it well.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, a few points may leave readers puzzled. Is Behe acreationist?
He<BR>
explicitly eschews the term. Though a Roman Catholic, he accepted Darwinism
for<BR>
many years without sensing any contradiction with his faith, and still accepts<BR>
common descent. The conclusion of design is drawn from the data itself,
he<BR>
insists, and &quot;not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs.&quot; It
is significant<BR>
that his book came out from a major New York publisher, not a religious<BR>
publishing house.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe may protest a bit too much. He rejects the label creationist only
by<BR>
narrowly restricting the term to those who accept a young earth and flood<BR>
geology--disqualifying a host of people who describe themselves as creationists<BR>
but do not hold to those geological theories. Similarly, Behe accepts common<BR>
descent only by giving _that_ term a highly atypical definition. His idea
is<BR>
that an original one-celled organism contained the information for all<BR>
subsequent biological development, which advanced through multiple, coordinated<BR>
changes in sudden, large leaps (akin to Goldschmidt's &quot;hopeful monster&quot;
theory<BR>
except that the monsters appear not by luck but through the unfolding of
an<BR>
implicit design).<BR>
<BR>
It might have been better if Behe had simply said, Sure, I accept creation,
and<BR>
it's time to stretch that category to acknowledge that creationists come
in many<BR>
stripes. Be that as it may, Behe's book is a powerful contribution to the<BR>
literature on the Darwin controversy. The black box has been opened.<BR>
Biologists had better get ready to face the implications of what they find<BR>
there.

<H1><CENTER><FONT SIZE=2>A NOTE TO THE TEACHER</FONT SIZE=2></CENTER>
</H1>

<FONT SIZE=2>and Stephen C. Meyer, Ph.D</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=2>Biological origins can be one of the most captivating subjects
in the curriculum. As a biology teacher, you have probably already seen
how the topic excites your students. The allure of dinosaurs, trilobites,
fossilized plants, and ancient human remains is virtually irresistable to
many students. Indeed, many prominent scientists owe their interest in science
to an early exposure to this topic.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The subject of origins, however, is not only captivating. It's
also controversial. Because it touches on questions of enduring significance,
this topic has long been a focal point for vigorous debate &shyp;&shyp;legal
and political, as well as intellectual. Teachers often find themselves walking
a tightrope, trying to teach good science, while avoiding the censure of
parents or administrators.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To complicate things, the cultural conflict has been compounded
by controversies within the scientific community itself. Since the 1970s,
for example, scientific criticisms of the long&shyp;dominant neo&shyp;Darwinian
theory of evolution (which combines classical Darwinism with Mendelian genetics),
have surfaced with increasing regularity.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>In
fact, the situation is such that paleontologist Niles Eldredge was driven
to remark:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If it is true that an influx of doubt and uncertainty actually
marks periods of healthy growth in science, then evolutionary biology is
flourishing today as it seldom has in the past. For biologists are collectively
less agreed upon the details of evolutionary mechanics than they were a
scant decade ago.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Moreover, many scientists have advocated fundamental revisions
of orthodox evolutionary theory.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Similarly, the standard models explaining chemical evolution&shyp;&shyp;the
origin of the first living cell&shyp;&shyp;have taken severe scientific
criticism. These criticisms have sparked calls for a radically different
approach to explaining the origin of life on earth.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Though many defenders of the orthodox theories remain, some
observers now describe these theories as having entered paradigm breakdown&shyp;&shyp;a
state where a once&shyp;dominant theory can no longer explain many important
data. Science historians Earthy and Collingwood, for example, have described
neo&shyp;Darwinism as a paradigm that's lost its capacity to solve important
scientific problems. They note that both defenders and critics find it hard
to agree even about what data are relevant to deciding scientific disagreements.
Putting it more bluntly, in 1980 Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould
pronounced the &quot;neo&shyp;Darwinian synthesis&quot; to be &quot;effectively
dead, despite its persistence as textbook orthodoxy.&quot; <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In this intellectual and cultural climate, knowing how to teach
biological origins can be exceedingly difficult. When respected scientists
disagree about which theories are correct, teachers may be forgiven for
not knowing which ones to teach. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>An Opportunity<BR>
</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Controversy is not all bad, however. For it gives teachers
the opportunity to engage their students at a deeper level. Instead of filling
young minds with discrete facts and vocabulary lists, teachers can show
their students the rough&shyp;and&shyp;tumble of genuine scientific debate.
In this way, students begin to understand how science really works. When
they see scientists of equal stature disagreeing over the interpretation
of the same data, the students learn something about the human dimension
of science. They also learn about the distinction between fact and inference&shyp;&shyp;and
how background assumptions influence scientific judgement.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is against this backdrop of challenge and opportunity that
the publisher offers this supplementary text, <I>Of Pandas and People: The
Central Question of Biological Origins</I>. The purpose of this text is
to expose your students to the captivating and the controversial in the
origins debate &shyp;&shyp; to take them beyond the pat scenarios offered
in most basal texts and encourage them to grapple with ideas in a scientific
manner.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>does this in two ways. First,
if offers a clear, cogent discussion of the latest data relevant to biological
origins. In the process, it rectifies many serious errors found in several
basal biology texts.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Second, <I>Pandas</I> offers a different interpretation of
current biological evidence. As opposed to most textbooks, which present
the more&shyp;or&shyp;less orthodox neo-Darwinian accounts of how life originated
and diversified, <I>Pandas</I> also presents a clear alternative, which
the authors call &quot;intelligent design.&quot; Throughout, the text evaluates
how well these different views can accommodate anomalous data within their
respective interpretive frameworks. <I>Pandas</I> also makes the task of
organizing your lessons and researching the scientific issues much easier.
Pandas provides the scientific information you need, and provides it in
a way that coordinates well with your basal text.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the spirit of good, honest science, <I>Pandas</I> makes
no bones about being a text with a point of view. Because it was intended
to be a supplemental text, the authors saw no value in simply rehashing
the orthodox accounts covered by basal textbooks. Rather, its presentation
of a non&shyp;Darwinian perspective, in addition to the standard view, is
intended to stimulate discussion and encourage students to evaluate the
explanatory power of different theories &shyp;&shyp; which, after all, is
what science is all about.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By using this text in conjunction with your standard basal
text, you will help your students learn to grapple with multiple competing
hypotheses &shyp;&shyp; and to maintain an open but critical posture toward
scientific knowledge. As students learn to grapple with competing views,
and become active participants in the clash of ideas, you may be surprised
at the level of motivation and achievement displayed by your students.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Status of Evolution as a Fact</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Despite the great value of presenting opposing viewpoints,
the popular debate over origins has fostered several misconceptions about
evolution, design, and science itself. To get the most benefit from this
supplement, teachers should understand these misconceptions and be prepared
to face them in an open and fair&shyp;minded manner when they arise.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>One misconception concerns the status of evolution as a fact.
In the origins debate, it is common to hear the assertion that evolution
is not merely a theory, but an indisputable fact. Educators who take this
view argue that it is futile and misleading to present non&shyp;Darwinian
views as serious alternatives to Darwinian evolution.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The factual status of evolution, however, depends critically
on what the word &quot;evolution&quot; means. Yale biologist Keith Stewart
Thomson points out that scientists have used the term in at least three
different ways.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The first meaning he identifies is &quot;change over time.&quot;
In this sense, to say that evolution has taken place is to say that change
has occurred and that things are different now than they were in the past.
The fossil evidence, for example, reveals different organisms from one geological
period to the next.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>When the word is used in this sense, it is hard to disagree
that &quot;evolution&quot; is a fact. The authors of this volume certainly
have no dispute with that notion. <I>Pandas </I>clearly teaches that life
has a history and that the kinds of organisms present on earth have changed
over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The second meaning that Thomson identifies is descent with
modification &shyp;&shyp; the idea that all organisms are &quot;related
by common ancestry.&quot; Evolution in this sense is a theory about the
history of life. In Darwin's view, that history can best be depicted as
a single branching tree &shyp;&shyp; a geneaological tree &shyp;&shyp; in
which life diversifies over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Many people assert that evolution in this second sense is a
fact, just as gravity is a fact. But the two situations are hardly analogous.
The fact of gravity can be verified simply by dropping a pencil &shyp;&shyp;
an experiment anyone can perform. The &quot;fact&quot; of common anscestry,
however, is on an entirely different level. We can no more &quot;see&quot;
evolution in the fossil record than paleontologists of Darwin's day could
&quot;see&quot; creation events. The best we can do is infer what might
have happened by piecing together circumstantial evidence from many different
fields.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin, for example, sought to establish common descent by
examining evidence from several different areas: paleontology, biogeography,
comparative anatomy, and embryology. Others have relied, in addition, on
evidence from genetics, molecular biology, and other disciplines.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The problem with this kind of historical detective work, however,
is that it seldom produces a conclusion that forecloses other alternatives.
As philosopher of biology Elliot Sober points out, there may be any number
of plausible explanations&shyp;&shyp;or &quot;past histories&quot;&shyp;&shyp;that
can account for the same evidence. Sober's observation recalls the insightful
warning of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. &quot;Circumstantial evidence
is a very tricky thing,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It may seem to point very
straight to one thing, but if you shift your point of view a little, you
may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something different.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To use another analogy, consider the picture in Figure X. What
do you see? A tired old woman or an attractive young lady? Depending on
what you're looking for, you can probably see either one. The drawing hasn't
changed. The only thing that's different is the way you look at it.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The point is, unless we can eliminate plausible competing explanations,
it's presumptuous to call descent with modification a fact. As most people
understand the term, a fact &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">is supposed
to be distinguished from transient theories as something definite, permanent,
and independent of any subjective interpretation by the scientist.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
By this definition, descent with modification simply doesn't warrant the
status of a fact. Far from compelling a single conclusion, the evidence
may legitimately be interpreted different ways, leading to several possible
conclusions. None of those conclusions warrant the status of a &quot;fact.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>As zoologist Thomas Kemp warns:<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[A]ll attempts to understand the diversity of organisms rely
upon empirically untestable assumptions either about evolution or about
natural patterns. There is nothing wrong with making assumptions or seeking
to justify them of course. It is the very stuff of science. What is unforgivable
is to forget that they are assumptions and behave as if they were known
certainties when they are no such things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, calling descent with modification a fact only closes
off debate and blurs the distinction between fact and inference. That, in
turn, makes us particularly vulnerable to the illusion that we know more
than we really do. In the preface to his best selling volume, <I>The Discoverers</I>,
historian Daniel Boorstin tells the reader:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The obstacles to discovery&shyp;&shyp;the illusions of knowledge&shyp;&shyp;are
also part of our story. Only against the forgotten backdrop of the received
common sense and myths of their time can we begin to sense the courage,
the rashness, the heroic and imaginative thrusts of the great discoverers.
They had to battle against the current &quot;facts&quot; and dogmas of the
learned.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is precisely why a book that questions the Darwinian notion
of common descent is so necessary. By presenting a reasonable alternative
to evolution in this second sense, <I>Pandas</I> helps students learn to
work with multiple perspectives, to distinguish those perspectives from
facts, and to guard themselves against the illusion of knowledge.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The final meaning of evolution that Thomson identifies concerns
the mechanism of biological change &shyp;&shyp; the particular explanation
of how evolution in the first two senses occurred. Here the term &quot;evolution&quot;
refers to random variation and natural selection. In Thomson's words:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Although many biologists act as though [the mechanism] were
the whole meaning of evolution, it obviously is not. The first and second
meanings could be explained by several different theories, and both had
a serious intellectual history before 1859, while the third meaning is currently
confined to a particular explanatory hypothesis, Darwinism.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Evolution in this third sense asserts that the cause or mechanism
of biological change is purposeless, non&shyp;intelligent, and completely
naturalistic. Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins defended this view in his
best selling book, <I>The Blind Watchmaker</I>. Like Darwin himself, Dawkins
acknowledges that biological organisms appear to exhibit remarkable design.
Yet both men claim that this appearance is an illusion, produced entirely
by random variation and natural selection. Blind nature mimics intelligent
design.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This &quot;blind watchmaker&quot; thesis is often touted as
a fact, but it is not. For one thing, Darwinists have never demonstrated
empirically that natural processes can create the complex structures that
characterize living organisms. Like common descent, the blind watchmaker
thesis is based on indirect evidence. It accounts for hypothetical transformations
by extrapolating small observed changes over immense periods of time. Thus,
the blind watchmaker thesis is not a fact, but an inference. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, the blind watchmaker thesis &shyp;&shyp; at least
in its neo&shyp;Darwinian form &shyp;&shyp; may not even be a warranted
inference. As we mentioned at the beginning of this essay, neo&shyp;Darwinism
has come under increasing attack from scientists and philosophers alike.
Scientists have increasingly questioned the ability of mutation and natural
selection to generate new organs, limbs, or body plans. A host of other
problems have led biologists Mae-Wan Ho and Peter Saunders to say:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Until only a few years ago, the 'synthetic' or 'neo&shyp;Darwinist'
theory of evolution stood virtually unchallenged as the basis of our understanding
of the organic world....</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Today, however, the picture is entirely different. More and
more workers are showing signs of dissatisfaction with the synthetic theory.
Some are attacking its philosophical foundations....Others have deliberately
set out to work in just those areas in which neo&shyp;Darwinism is least
comfortable, like the problem of gaps in the fossil record or the mechanisms
of non&shyp;Mendelian inheritance....Perhaps most significantly of all,
there is now appearing a stream of articles and books defending the synthetic
theory. It is not so long ago that hardly anyone thought this was necessary.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> gives students a much&shyp;needed
opportunity to explore the evidence and arguments that have caused some
scientists to doubt contemporary Darwinism. It examines evidence from such
fields as biochemistry, genetics and paleontology--evidence that casts doubt
on the sufficiency of purposeless processes to explain the appearance of
new biological forms.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Going a step further, <I>Pandas</I> helps students understand
the positive case for intelligent design. Following a growing number of
scientists and philosophers, the authors argue that life not only <I>appears</I>
to have been intelligently designed, but that it actually was. Drawing on
recent developments in molecular biology, the authors show that even simple
organisms bear all the earmarks of designed systems.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The authors will also discuss what theorists have learned by
applying mathematics and information science to biology. Those insights
suggest that there are ways to distinguish natural systems from intelligently
designed ones--and have led some scientists to conclude that the &quot;coded
genetic information&quot; (or sequence specificity) of DNA, proteins, and
the like, reflects the activity of a pre-existent intelligence. While that
conclusion is still controversial, a growing minority of scientists see
it as a plausible alternative to the blind watchmaker thesis. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By presenting the case for intelligent design the authors demonstrate
that there are alternatives to the blind watchmaker thesis--and that evolution
as a purposeless process is neither an indisputable fact, nor the only inference
supported by biological data.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In sum, then, only in the most trivial sense&shyp;&shyp;change
over time&shyp;&shyp;can evolution be considered a fact. Far from being
a legitimate reason for avoiding alternative views, the alleged &quot;fact
of evolution&quot; underscores precisely why a book like <I>Pandas </I>is
so necessary. If students are to achieve true scientific literacy, they
must learn to distinguish fact from supposition. A curriculum that blurs
this distinction serves neither the students nor society.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Science and the Laws of Nature</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second misconception revolves around the question of what
makes a concept or explanation &quot;scientific.&quot; In particular, some
scientists and philosophers assert that the concept of intelligent design
is inherently non-scientific. According to this view, science must explain
things by using natural laws&shyp;&shyp;not by invoking an the special action
of an intelligent agent. Thus, we no longer explain the orbit of a planet
by saying that an angel pushes it through the heavens. We explain it with
Newton's law of universal gravitation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the same way, design is ruled out&shyp;of&shyp;court because
it invokes an intelligent agent, rather than natural laws. Philosopher of
science Michael Ruse, for example, has said:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Science attempts to understand this empirical world. What is
the basis for this understanding? Surveying science and the history of science
today, one thing stands out: Science involves the search for order. More
specifically, science looks for unbroken, blind, natural regularities (<I>laws</I>).
Things in the world do not happen in just any old way. They follow set paths,
and science tries to capture this fact. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>There are serious problems with this view, however. One problem
is that it ignores areas of scientific investigation where intelligent design
is a necessary explanatory concept. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence
(SETI) is one example. At the time of this writing, radio telescopes are
scanning the heavens, looking for artificial radio signals that differ from
the random signals generated by natural objects in space. If we were to
limit science to the search for &quot;unbroken, blind, natural regularities
(laws)&quot; we would have to say that SETI is unscientific&shyp;&shyp;by
definition.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Archaeology would meet the same fate. Archaeologists routinely
distinguish manufactured objects (e.g. arrowheads, potsherds) from natural
ones (e.g. stones), even when the differences between them are very subtle.
These manufactured objects then become important clues in reconstructing
past ways of life. But if we arbitrarily assert that science explains solely
by reference to natural laws, if archaeologists are prohibited from invoking
an intelligent manufacturer, the whole archaeological enterprise comes to
a grinding halt.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second problem with limiting science to blind, natural regularities
is that it confuses <I>laws </I>with <I>explanations</I>&shyp;&shyp;an error
that philosopher of science William Alston calls &quot;a 'category mistake'
of the most flagrant sort.&quot; Laws and explanations are often two different
things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Scientific explanations often invoke not only laws, but causal
events and actions. For example, consider the field of modern cosmology.
Most cosmologists explain the features of our universe not only by reference
to the laws of physics, but by reference to a single event: the Big Bang.
The Big Bang, for example, helps explain why galaxies throughout the universe
seem to be receding from each other. It also explains the presence of low
level radiation that seems to permeate space. These phenomena cannot be
explained solely by reference to physical laws, or natural regularities.
Rather, the critical explanatory feature is a one-time event that established
the conditions responsible for the phenomena that we now witness.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Taking this idea a bit farther, sometimes it seems that scientific
laws are hardly relevant to our explanations at all &shyp;&shyp; such as
when we try to explain why things turned out one way rather than another.
For instance, Newton's law of universal gravitation may tell us why the
earth has a Newtonian orbit rather than a non&shyp;Newtonian one. But it
doesn't explain why the earth follows it's present orbit, instead of some
other orbit that's equally compatible with Newton's law. That kind of explanation
requires something else &shyp;&shyp; namely, information about how the earth
attained its present position and velocity.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A similar example can be drawn from the field of historical
geology. If a historical geologist wanted to explain the unusual height
of the Himalayas, invoking natural laws would be of little use. Natural
laws alone cannot tell us why the Himalayas are higher than, say, the Rocky
Mountains. That would require discovering antecedent factors that were present
in building the Himilayas, but not in other mountain&shyp;building episodes.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Thus, scientific explanation not only involves laws, but may
also involve past causal events. If scientists could never invoke past events
and causes, they could not explain many important phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Why is this important? Because ignoring the role of causal
events in scientific explanation has created a false dichotomy between agency
&shyp;&shyp; or intelligent design &shyp;&shyp; and the laws of nature.
The fact that scientific explanations may invoke laws doesn't mean that
agency is somehow ruled out. Rather, intelligent agents can alter causal
events and other contributing factors. Although intervention may alter the
course of subsequent events &shyp;&shyp; sometimes in novel and unexpected
ways &shyp;&shyp; it does not violate natural laws.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, the actions of intelligent agents are themselves causal
events. Therefore, citing the action of agents may be necessary to explain
many present phenomena. Imagine trying to explain Mt. Rushmore without reference
to sculptors. Law-like explanations involving only natural processes would
completely miss this critical explanatory factor. That is why archaeologists,
forensic scientists and historians often find it impossible to avoid postulating
intelligent agency.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The notion that science explains solely by reference to natural
law suffers from yet a third problem. In addition to confusing laws with
explanations, it assumes a cookie&shyp;cutter view of science, in which
all disciplines ask similar questions and use the same &quot;scientific
method.&quot; This belies the rich diversity of methods that scientists
use to understand the natural world.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Several philosophers, for instance, have argued that a clear
distinction exists between the &quot;inductive sciences&quot; and the &quot;historical
sciences.&quot; These two broad categories ask different kinds of questions,
and use different kinds of methods. The inductive (or nomological) sciences,
on the one hand, ask questions about how the natural world operates. Hence,
a virologist may try to discover how a particular enzyme helps a virus infect
its host. Or a crystalographer may try to determine the effects of weightlessness
on crystal growth. In each case, scientists seek to uncover the regularities
that characterize natural phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The historical sciences, on the other hand, ask different kinds
of questions. Rather than trying to understand how the natural world operates,
the historical sciences seek to understand how things came to be. One example,
of course, would be the historical geologist who was seeking to explain
the unusual elevation of the Himalayas. Another would be an evolutionary
biologist seeking to explain the origin of giraffes. Still another would
be the archaeologist seeking to reconstruct an ancient culture. Note that
in each case, the goal is not to find new laws or regularities, but to reconstruct
past conditions and events.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The importance of this distinction to our present discussion
is that although postulating intelligent intervention is completely inappropriate
in the inductive sciences, the same is not true in the historical sciences.
In the inductive sciences, the whole point is to discover how the natural
world normally operates on it's own, i.e., <I>in the absence of intelligent
intervention</I>. Postulating an intelligent agent would thus be contrary
to the stated goal of research.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the historical sciences, however, the goal is to reconstruct
past events and conditions. Thus, there is no need to impose such restrictions.
Quite the reverse. As we have seen, the explanation of certain artifacts
or features may require reference to intelligence. Intelligent agents may
have left traces of their activity in the natural world. The historical
scientist need not turn a blind eye to them.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Hence, when investigating the origin of the living world, it
is perfectly acceptable to hypothesize an intelligent designer if the evidence
warrants.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Observability</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A third misunderstanding concerns the scientific status of
unobservable objects and events. Some philosophers and scientists claim
that intelligent design is not scientific because it invokes an unobservable
intelligent designer. To be scientific, they claim, a concept or idea must
be testable. Because an intelligent designer is unobservable it is not testable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence not scientific.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is by no means clear, however, that something is untestable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence unscientific&shyp;&shyp;simply because it is unobservable. If this
were the case, many accepted theories and concepts would have to be declared
unscientific as well. Chemist J.C. Walton observes:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The postulation of...external intervention [into nature by
a designer] indoubtedly restores order, harmony and simplification to the
data of physics and biology. [Yet] at present there is no unambiguous evidence...for
the existence of the external entity, but this should not be regarded as
a drawback. Many key scientific postulates such as atomic theory, kinetic
theory of the applicability of wave functions to describing molecular properties
were, and still are, equally conjectural. Their acceptance depended, and
still depends, on the comparison of their predictions with observables.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also falling in this category are almost all theories in the
historical sciences&shyp;&shyp;theories that postulate conditions and events
that occured in the unobservable past. The Big Bang is one such theory.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another, ironically, is Neo&shyp;Darwinism. Although Neo&shyp;Darwinism
explains many observable features of the living world, it postulates unobservable
objects and events. For example, the mutational events that allegedly produced
reptiles, birds, mammals, and even humans, have never been observed &shyp;&shyp;
nor will they ever be observed. Similarly, the transitional life forms that
occupy the branching&shyp;points on Darwin's tree of life are also unobservable.
Transitional forms exist now only as theoretical entities that make possible
a coherent Darwinian account of how present&shyp;day species originated.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The unobservable character of Darwinism becomes especially
plain when proponents try to reconcile the fossil evidence with their theory.
As paleontologists now admit, the fossil evidence looks a good deal less
&quot;Darwinian&quot; than they had previously acknowledged. Indeed, as
Harvard paleontologist Stephen Gould points out, the two outstanding features
of the fossil record are &quot;sudden appearance&quot; and &quot;stasis.&quot;
At any given location, species tend to appear &quot;suddenly,&quot; fully
formed, and exhibit no directional change during their stay on earth.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The standard neo&shyp;Darwinian explanation for these features
is the imperfection of the fossil record: Because fossilization occurs only
under special circumstances, fossils give us only a rough sketch of evolutionary
history. More recently, some have proposed that evolutionary change occurs
rapidly, and in small, isolated populations of organisms. Both explanations,
however, invoke unobserved circumstances (how can one observe a non&shyp;fossilization
event that happened 100 million years ago?) to explain unobserved fossil
organisms.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin himself realized that much of the evidence for his theory
was indirect. Indeed, he spent long hours defending his practice of inferring
the unobservable from the observable.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>I am actually weary of telling people that I do not pretend
to adduce direct evidence of one species changing into another, but that
I believe that this view in the main is correct because so many phenomena
can be thus grouped and explained.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If we accepted the principle that unobservable entities are
inadmissable in science, we would have to reject not only Darwin's theory,
but his entire approach to scientific investigation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To be fair, some opponents of intelligent design would argue
that the real problem is not unobervability, but flexibility. The concept
of an intelligent designer is simply too much of a &quot;wild card&quot;:
it can explain anything. Put another way, the concept of an intelligent
designer cannot be falsified.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the contrary, however, intelligent design is not so flexible
that it cannot be falsified. The concept of intelligent design entails a
strong prediction that is readily falsifiable. In particular, the concept
of intelligent design predicts that complex information, like that encoded
in a functioning genome, never arises from purely chemical or physical antecedents.
Experience will show that only intelligent agency gives rise to functional
information. All that is necessary to falsify the hypothesis of intelligent
design is to show confirmed instances of purely physical or chemical antecedents
producing such information.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, intelligent design is not unique in its flexibility.
We have already seen how Darwinists handle the problem of the fossil record
(i.e. in the way they account for unobserved fossil forms by invoking unobserved
geological processes). Indeed, the history of science shows that scientists
have often offered <I>ad hoc</I> explanations to save a cherished theory.
This problem is particularly pronounced in the historical sciences, where
investigators must draw conclusions from incomplete or sketchy evidence.
If flexibility is an issue, therefore, it should be an issue for every scientific
theory, not just intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religion and Intelligent Design</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A final misconception you may confront is that intelligent
design is simply sectarian religion. According to this view, intelligent
design is merely fundamentalism with a new twist &shyp;&shyp; and teaching
it in public schools violates the separation of church and state.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This view is wide of the mark. The idea that life had an intelligent
source is hardly unique to Christian fundamentalism. Advocates of design
have included not only Christians and other religious theists, but pantheists,
Greek and Enlightenment philosophers, and now include many modern scientists
who describe themselves as religiously agnostic. Moreover, the concept of
design implies absolutely nothing about beliefs normally associated with
Christian fundamentalism: such as a young earth, a global flood, or even
the existence of the Christian God. All it implies is that life had an intelligent
source. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, sectarianism is more a matter of form than content.
It is marked by a certain narrowness and exclusivity that entertains no
debate and tolerates no opposing viewpoints. Given the broad appeal of intelligent
design (even Richard Dawkins, a staunch Darwinist and author of <I>The Blind
Watchmaker</I>, acknowledges &quot;the appearance of design&quot; in the
living world), it is perhaps more accurate to conclude that the real sectarians
are those who villify design as &quot;fundamentalist religion.&quot; Such
name&shyp;calling is merely another way to avoid debate and keep the real
issues off the intellectual field of play.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even if the design hypothesis were religious, however, criticizing
it on that basis begs the question of whether it's scientifically warranted.
In science, the origin of an idea is supposed to be irrelevant to its validity.
What matters is not the source, but the whether the idea is logically consistent
and empirically supportable. If it is, what justification is there for excluding
it from the classroom?</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In its landmark ruling on the Louisiana Balanced Treatment
Act, the United States Supreme Court did not try to shield the classroom
from dissenting viewpoints. Indeed, it affirmed that teachers already had
the flexibility to teach non&shyp;evolutionary views and present scientific
evidence bearing on the question of origins:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Act does not grant teachers a flexibility that they did
not already possess to supplant the present science curriculum with the
presentation of theories besides evolution, about the origin of life. Indeed,
the Court of Appeals found that no law prohibited Louisiana public schoolteachers
from teaching any scientific theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Neither did the Supreme Court choose to limit that flexibility:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[T]eaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins
of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular
intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is not only consistent with good science, it's consistent
with the highest ideals of a democratic society. As John Scopes, who was
tried 1920s for teaching evolution, said at his own trial, &quot;Education,
you know, means broadening, advancing, and if you limit a teacher to only
one side of anything the whole country will eventually have only one thought,
be one individual. I believe in teaching every aspect of every problem or
theory.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
<DD>
<B>The Cost.</B> The rising cost of higher education is one of the major concerns facing American families today. The cost of public higher education has risen sharply over the past two decades compared with the average family income and general rate of inflation. Since 1980, average tuition costs at public universities have increased 234 percent, but the general rate of inflation and the average household income have increased only about 80 percent.<SUP>1</SUP>


<P>
<DD>
<B>The Reward.</B> A college education significantly increases an individual's earning power. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), "a graduated college student in 1980 earned about 43 percent more per hour than a person with a high school diploma. By 1994, this earnings advantage increased to 73 percent."<SUP>2</SUP> Thus, while families are finding it increasingly difficult to pay for college without incurring a tremendous amount of debt, the cost of not going to college makes these sacrifices difficult to avoid.


<P>
<DD>
<B>The Uncertainty.</B> The problem is not just that college costs a lot, but that the cost is uncertain, making it hard for families to know how much they must put aside or what debt they or their children will have to incur to pay for a college education. Over the past decade alone, increases in annual private college costs have fluctuated between 5 percent and 8.6 percent. Increases in tuition at public universities have fluctuated even more.

<P>
<DD>
To understand just how big a difference this fluctuation makes in a family's financial planning, consider a young couple saving for their newborn child's college costs. If tuition and fees at a private university keep rising at the same rate they have over the last few years, parents with a new child today will have to come up with just over $100,000 -- <I>in today's dollars</I> -- when that child heads off to college. If those costs rose two percentage points faster than today's pace, more like the average increase since 1980, the tab would be over $150,000. Two points less than today's rate of increase would mean about $75,000. This kind of financial uncertainty makes planning difficult, to say the least.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Federal plans.</B> To date, the federal government has responded to rising tuition costs by creating programs that 1) give cash grants to qualified students, 2) guarantee private student loans, or 3) lend money directly to students. For most families, this means the federal government makes it easier to get into debt. But the government does little to help families save for college and nothing to deal with the uncertainty of costs.

<P>
<DD>
<B>State prepaid plans.</B> Fortunately, several states and a handful of private firms have taken an innovative step forward in making saving for college easier and more certain. The most innovative of these plans -- prepaid tuition programs -- allow parents to purchase what amounts to a bond denominated in units of education (like one semester). These bonds typically can be purchased at today's tuition prices even if the buyer's children will not reach college age for many years. When the time for college arrives, parents redeem the pre-purchased bond for education credits regardless of the cost at that time. The only major drawback is that the bonds must be used in-state; otherwise, much of the interest is lost upon redemption.

<P>
<DD>
Typically, the accrued interest in the state savings program is not taxed at the state level. Last year, Congress and the President made the state savings plans even more attractive by deferring federal income taxes on the bond's interest until the student enters college and the bond is redeemed; the interest is taxed at the child's tax rate, which usually is lower than the rate that applies to parents. Since the measure was passed, several more states have begun to investigate the feasibility of establishing an education savings plan.

<P>
<DD>
<B>What's needed to boost savings for college.</B> Congress and the President should go even further in their support of both state and private plans which encourage family savings for higher education rather than debt. Specifically, Congress and the President should:
<P><UL>

<LI><B>Make</B> the buildup of earnings in state-sponsored tuition savings plans completely tax-free;
<LI><B>Extend</B> the tax-free status of earnings to investments with private firms that offer special higher education savings vehicles; and 
<LI><B>Direct</B> the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to sanction a private futures market for education savings bonds.
</UL>

<P>
<DD>
<B>Encouraging savings rather than debt.</B> These steps are significant because they help reduce uncertainty and will enable more American families to afford college education. But they also will achieve another long-term goal: Rather than shackle families and graduates with years of debt, as current methods have done, these plans will encourage families to finance their children's college education through savings.

<P>
<B>UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEMS</B>

<P>
<DD>
<B>The Rising Costs of Higher Education.</B> The cost of higher education has been rising sharply for the past 25 years. The General Accounting Office recently reported that average tuition costs at public universities have increased since 1980 by 234 percent, much faster than earnings and general inflation.<SUP>3</SUP>  Tuition expenses at private universities have increased even more rapidly over the same period (see <A HREF="bg1101c1.gif">Chart 1</A>). These increases have outstripped the general increase in prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which has increased by 85 percent since 1980, and the average family's ability to pay for college as measured by household income, which has increased only 82 percent since 1980.

<P>
<DD>
There are many important reasons for the explosion in college costs. These include:

<P>
<DD>
<B>The increasing value of a college degree.</B> The most important reason college costs have escalated is that the value of a college education has increased. The GAO reports that in 1980, the average college graduate earned about 43 percent more than the average high school graduate. Today, the difference in earnings between the same two workers is more than 70 percent.<SUP>4</SUP>  Therefore, more and more families are finding it necessary to send their children to college so they will have a better opportunity to succeed in the job market. The real value of a college education has increased. The increased demand for a college education has driven up the price of college just as increased demand for any commodity drives up prices if demand is not met with a sufficiently increased supply.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Increases in research activities at universities and colleges.</B> Another factor affecting tuition costs at many colleges and universities is an increased emphasis on research. The prestige of a college or university today is driven in large part by the publishing prowess of the institution's professors. Publishing requires research, which requires time. This means that professors are doing less teaching and more research; and less teaching on the part of each professor means either that course and class selection are reduced, which forces students to take longer to finish a degree, or that more professors are required on staff, which forces the institution to spend more for salaries.<SUP>5</SUP>  Either way, the result is higher fixed or overhead costs, which typically are passed on to students and parents through higher tuition and fees.<SUP>6</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>Reduced state funding.</B> In addition, the current era of fiscal austerity in government has meant slower growth in state budgets, which often has meant slower growth in financial support of public universities. Increased tuition has been the only recourse for public institutions faced with higher salaries and increased demand.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Federal programs that facilitate family debt.</B> Finally, federal programs meant to assist students facing steep college costs have themselves added to the rise in tuition.<SUP>7</SUP>  Starting with passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), the federal government has guaranteed student loans extended by private banks. The Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) was established in 1972 as a government-sponsored enterprise to establish a secondary market in student loans. In addition, a limited direct government loan program was established in 1993. These loan programs not only facilitate indebtedness, but also boost the scale of that indebtedness by encouraging steeper tuition increases. As Thomas Donlan recently wrote in <I>Barron's</I>, "The faculty and staff can vote themselves higher salaries and more resources if the only consequence is that students and parents just have to sign on the dotted line to borrow some more money."<SUP>8</SUP>  With federal debt assistance so readily available, schools have no incentive to control the costs of education.

<P>
<DD>
The increase in tuition costs because of increased demand and a rise in value is a natural market occurrence and should not be addressed by government involvement. Similarly, any overemphasis by universities on research will be corrected as students seek out schools focused on education. As for the fiscal restraint manifesting itself at the state level, it is the result of a decision by Americans who feel overtaxed. Therefore, federal policy should focus on correcting the remaining cause of escalating tuition: the effect of federal programs and their consequences for families.

<P>
<DD>
One side effect of any policy designed to make money more available to families to afford college will be to boost tuition somewhat. But the wisest approach would be to make it easier for families to save for college rather than to make it even easier for families and students to go deeply into debt.

<P>
<DD>
<B>The Uncertainty.</B> The second problem to address concerning the rising costs of higher education is not just that college costs a lot, but that the cost is uncertain, which makes it hard for families to know how much they must put aside, or what debt they or their children will have to incur to pay for a college education. Over the past decade alone, private college inflation, as measured by the Independent College 500 Index, has ranged from a low of 5.05 percent in 1996 to a high of 8.61 percent in 1989.<SUP>9</SUP>  Tuition at public universities has fluctuated just as much, from a high of 8.90 percent in 1986 to a low of 4.69 percent in 1994.<SUP>10</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
The uncertainty of college costs makes saving particularly difficult because parents can never be sure they are saving enough money to cover the full costs of tuition, fees, room, and board. Or families may save too much for higher education costs, in which case they will be sacrificing savings for other expenses such as retirement or a house. The uncertainty surrounding saving for college is like taking out a mortgage without knowing what the final price of the house will be when the closing date arrives.

<P>
<DD>
To understand how much fluctuations in tuition rates can mean when planning financially for college, consider again the young couple who want to save for their newborn child's education. If tuition and fees at a private university were to rise at the 1994 rate of 4.69 percent, the couple would have to save $47,320 in today's dollars. If tuition and fees at the same school were to rise at the 1986 rate of 8.90 percent, the couple would have to save $102,407 in today's dollars.<SUP>11</SUP>  It is impossible to plan efficiently for expected college costs under such uncertain conditions.

<P>
<B>EXAMINING SOME CURRENT ALTERNATIVES</B>

<P>
<DD>
<B>The beginning of a solution.</B> Several states and private interests have begun to address the problems of escalating tuition costs and the uncertainty of those costs by offering savings plans for parents with young children. Although details differ from plan to plan, the state plans generally have two core characteristics. First, parents can save money for their children's education without paying state income tax on the interest. And second, parents may purchase an amount of higher education at today's tuition rates to be redeemed in the future when their children enter college. As Peter Mezereas, Executive Director of the Massachusetts plan, explains, "These plans are a way to lock in tomorrow's tuition at today's rates."<SUP>12</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
The first of these state savings plans was established by Michigan in 1986. Florida and Ohio followed in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Today, 42 states either have implemented some form of tax-favored education savings plan or are studying the feasibility of such a program. These programs range from simple savings trust funds that allow parents to save whatever amount they wish, without having to pay state income taxes on the earnings, to complex pre-paid tuition plans that allow parents to purchase a semester of education at a school within the state at a specific date in the future. The accompanying <A HREF="bg1101m1.gif">map</A> and <A HREF="bg1101t1.gif">table</A> highlight the activities of the states.<SUP>13</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>The advent of private savings plans.</B> States are not the only entities creating innovative savings programs for parents and future students. Private savings instruments have developed as well. For example, the College Savings Bank of Princeton, New Jersey, offers the CollegeSure Certificate of Deposit (CD), a federally insured savings vehicle whose rate of return is tied to an index of the tuition inflation at 500 public and private colleges and universities. The CollegeSure CD is more flexible than the state plans because the savings can be used at any school in the United States and can be applied toward tuition, room, board, or any other cost associated with a student's education. If the beneficiary decides not to attend college, the money can be withdrawn without losing interest income.<SUP>14</SUP>  Because it is indexed, the purchaser knows the investment will cover average increases in college costs -- though it does not lock in a specific amount of education at any particular institution.

<P>
<DD>
The plan offered by the College Savings Bank does have drawbacks, however, largely due to state and federal law. Most important, interest earned on the CD is fully taxable at both the state and federal levels, and the profits of the bank are also taxed at both the state and federal levels. To cover these four taxes and plan for a semester of college costs ten years in the future, parents have to invest more than that semester actually costs in present dollars. For example, if a semester at a particular university currently costs $2,012, then an investor with the College Savings Bank must deposit $2,318 today to cover fully the expenses of a semester ten years from now as well as the taxes paid by the bank at the state and federal levels. In addition, the investing family must consider that they will be responsible for paying personal taxes on the interest they earn. In this example, the principal will increase from $2,318 to $3,848, thus earning $1,530 in interest. While the family is guranteed a rate of return tied to future tuition costs, it is at a premium to cover all the applicable taxes.<SUP>15</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>Recent action by Congress.</B> Last year, the 104th Congress and President Clinton made the state savings programs even more attractive by deferring federal income taxes on the interest earned by investors. This provision was passed as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (H.R. 3448, P.L. 104-188). It was proposed originally by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in S. 386 and was supported strongly by Senator Bob Graham (D-FL). Moreover, at the time the plan is cashed in, the accrued interest income is taxed at the child's tax rate, which is usually less than the tax rate faced by parents. Since passage of this special tax treatment, many more states have chosen to consider or implement tuition savings plans; more than 15 states have announced plans to study the feasibility of establishing such tuition plans.

<P>
<DD>
Unfortunately, Congress and the President did not extend this preferential tax treatment to similar private education savings plans such as those offered by the College Savings Bank. This has placed these private investments at a distinct disadvantage compared to state-sponsored plans, because investors in the private plans must continue to pay taxes on the annual earnings of their savings.

<P>
<B>TAKING EFFECTIVE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</B>

<P>
<DD>
Existing state savings programs have enabled thousands of families to overcome the high costs and uncertainty of college tuition. However, much remains to be done to extend these benefits to all families and all institutions of higher education -- public and private alike. Several additional reforms would make the state and private savings plans even more attractive to parents who are trying to save for their children's higher education and who are looking for predictability in tuition costs. Specifically, Congress and the President should adopt the following strategies:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Strategy #1: Make investments in all state savings programs completely tax-free.</B><SUP>16</SUP>  The legislation passed last year by Congress and signed by the President makes the state-based plans tax-advantaged compared to other savings options; however, there is still room for improvement. All earnings from the savings plans purchased with after-tax dollars should be completely tax-free. For plans that invest in equities and private bonds, this would eliminate the inequitable double taxation that currently exists.<SUP>17</SUP>  For the plans that are financed by a state's general obligation fund, tax-free status would place education savings bonds on a par with other general government bonds. Eliminating all federal income taxes on the imputed interest earned through the state programs also would create an additional incentive for savings which would help fuel greater economic growth.

<P>
<DD>
The most comprehensive way to eliminate all taxes on interest earned on the state prepaid tuition bonds would be to adopt the proposal of Senator William Roth (R-DE) for a super IRA. This proposal would allow parents to invest money in their individual retirement account (IRA) that can then be withdrawn tax-free for certain expenses, such as a first-time home purchase, major medical expenses, and higher education costs. Classifying the existing state-based prepaid tuition plans as qualified IRAs would preserve the unique characteristics of the various programs while extending fair tax treatment to all investors in education savings plans.

<P>
<DD>
Short of this, Congress should allow interest income earned from the existing private and state savings plans (and income earned from any higher education bonds that are issued by private investors or colleges) to be deductible from federal income taxes. This could be accomplished simply by deducting interest income from taxable income.
<P>
<B>Strategy #2: Extend tax-free status to private education savings programs.</B><SUP>18</SUP>  Many innovative private savings plans are available to parents who want to save for their children's education. However, none of these plans currently qualifies for any special tax treatment. Therefore, they are at a disadvantage compared with current state plans which are free of state taxes and tax-deferred at the federal level. This disadvantage should be corrected by allowing tax-free investment in private as well as state programs. The same rationale for tax-free status applies to private plans as well as state plans. Tax-free status would eliminate double taxation and provide incentives for personal saving.

<P>
<DD>
Private programs also offer several advantages to families when compared with state programs. They are not limited to schools within a specific state; therefore, parents can save for their children's education without locking themselves into a limited number of institutions. Private plans also offer the innovation of the private market. Although only a handful of private plans currently exist, there is no reason why more companies could not offer innovative products if they are given the same tax treatment as state-sponsored plans. Any increase in competition among providers can only benefit families by allowing them a greater selection of products with which to save for college.
<P>
<B>Strategy #3: Direct the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to sanction a private "futures" market for education savings bonds.</B> Although the federal government should not take an active role in the creation of a private futures market for education bonds, it also should not stand in the way of such a development. A futures market would be a valuable addition to "locked in" plans by introducing greater flexibility and sophistication.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Benefits to parents.</B> In a futures market, independent investors or schools would offer bonds denominated in educational units (semesters or credit hours, for example) at particular schools. Parents could purchase the bonds for the year in which their child was expected to enter college. But there would be an additional choice -- for a small price. A parent could buy a "call" option at a small price for the <I>right</I> to buy a bond at a later time at a fixed price. That time might be when the family could expect a higher income, or when the parents sold their house and became "empty nesters."  As with any other futures market, parents essentially would be locking in a future price without paying for the product today.

<P>
<DD>
Not only would this guarantee to parents that their savings would be sufficient to pay for the educational needs of their children at a particular college, but a family could trade one bond for another bond good at a different college if the family's means or desires changed. In other words, a market would develop in which investors who hold a bond for one school could trade the bond with other investors who hold bonds redeemable at another school. For example, if Mr. Jones has purchased a bond for one semester at Harvard University but his daughter decides to attend the University of Notre Dame, he could trade the Harvard bond on the futures market with Mr. Smith who previously purchased a bond redeemable at Notre Dame, and the difference in value would be made up in cash.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Benefits to bond issuers.</B> Private issuers of education bonds would benefit from a stronger market because they could reinvest the savings and earn a higher rate of return than would be necessary to cover the cost of tuition even in the future. Again, the principle is exactly the same as with any other futures market or mutual fund. The issuer of the bond guarantees to pay to the purchaser the cost of tuition in the future. Any income earned on investing the money above that level is reserved for the issuer. As long as the actual rate of return is higher than the future cost of education, the transaction is profitable for the investor and the purchaser of the bond is guaranteed to meet his goal of covering the expenses of higher education. To protect consumers against fraud, these private bonds would be covered by the same rules and regulations covering all other futures contracts.

<P>
<DD>
If schools themselves were the issuers of the education bonds, which is a likely development, they would also benefit. By issuing bonds, schools could raise money to build additional classrooms, upgrade computer systems, or pay for any number of other capital-intensive projects. Issuing bonds would be an attractive offer to schools that otherwise would have to borrow money from a bank or solicit private donations. The bondholders also would represent a pool of potential future students.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>HELPING FAMILIES WHO NEED IT</B>

<P>
<DD>
Historical participation patterns indicate that the primary beneficiaries of the state and private plans are working, middle-income American families. For example, the average annual income of families participating in the Florida higher education savings program -- the largest of the state-based prepaid tuition plans, with 316,000 active contracts -- is $50,000.

<P>
<DD>
Most of the state plans have options for families with limited incomes. The Florida program, for example, offers Community College contracts for as little as $11 per month. And a joint private-public program known as the Florida S.T.A.R.S. program offers free prepaid tuition contracts to exemplary students from low-income families. Kentucky has a lower limit of only $25 annually on the amount of money that can be saved by parents in their education savings fund. The average monthly savings in Kentucky is a mere $48 dollars per year. The private College Savings Bank requires a minimum investment of only $1,000 per year ($83 per month, payable in quarterly installments). The key to all of the programs is that they allow parents <I>of all income levels</I> to save at least a portion of their income for their children's education.

<P>
<DD>
A private bond and futures market would give families with modest incomes greater flexibility to finance the high cost of many private colleges. For example, young couples may purchase a "call option" on education bonds that would lock in current college tuition rates while deferring the actual purchase of the bond until such time as the couple's income has increased and they can afford to purchase the bond outright or begin to make installment payments.

<P>
<DD>
Alternatively, families would be able to purchase higher education for their children one piece at a time. This is one of the many advantages of the existing state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans: Parents can purchase one semester or any number of credit hours each year until they have accumulated a full education. However, the existing plans are limited to in-state schools, and more often to in-state <I>public</I> schools. A private bond market would allow families -- even those of limited means -- to purchase pieces of education at any institute of higher education in the country, including private universities. Moreover, because these bonds would be tradable, parents would not be restricted to a specific school or state school system. The uncertainty of tuition inflation would be eliminated because rates would be locked in; private schools would be more accessible for all families because private bonds would not be limited to in-state schools; and flexibility would be introduced because the bonds would be tradable.

<P>
<B>THE EFFECT ON FEDERAL GRANT AND LOAN PROGRAMS</B>

<P>
<DD>
The goal of all the education savings plans -- both state and privately operated plans -- is to increase savings for college. Since there are only three ways to pay for college (save, work, or borrow), any increase in savings will likely result in a decrease in work or borrowing. Therefore, a decrease in student loans and decreased participation in work/study programs would be expected. However, this is a desirable outcome. The more parents and students are paying in advance for their education and the less they get into debt, the better.

<P>
<DD>
Moreover, an increase in family savings would mean that existing federal grant programs can be better targeted to the truly needy. During the 1995-1996 school year, 46 percent of students from families with incomes between $30,000 and $39,999 received Pell Grants worth an average of $1,060 each. The state and private savings programs are most attractive to families in this income range. Thus, as middle-class families save more, federal grants could be redirected to those who are most in need (i.e., those who cannot afford to save even a small amount of money).

<P>
<DD>
It is true that, under current law, many families who save money for higher education costs are penalized in the federal grant process. This is because any money saved by the family is counted as income and can offset federal grant money dollar for dollar. This is also true of the tax credit and deduction proposed by President Clinton. In fact, Lawrence Gladieux and Robert Reischauer reported that "nearly 4 million low-income students would largely be excluded from the tax credit because they receive Pell Grants which, under the Clinton plan, would be subtracted from their tax-credit eligibility."<SUP>19</SUP>  However, this is a deficiency of the federal grant programs, not an argument against college savings programs. Federal grants that discourage independent saving promote dependency on the government and lead to all the correlated problems. These programs should be reevaluated this year during reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, not held up as a red herring to stop progress toward enactment of education savings plans.

<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>
<DD>
The return on a college education is sufficiently valuable that, given the opportunity, parents undoubtedly will save for their children's education. The question is whether they can. Today, families face steeper taxes than at any other time in history; since 1940, the total tax burden faced by the average family has increased from 5 cents to more than 40 cents for each dollar earned. Moreover, college tuition costs are higher than ever, and the rapid rate of tuition inflation has been fueled by federal government programs that are nothing more than a free pot of money at the end of the rainbow for colleges and universities.

<P>
<DD>Fortunately, several states and a handful of private companies have developed innovative programs that facilitate family saving for college. These efforts should be encouraged and expanded. Congress and the President can do this by taking steps to make all of the earnings from all of the state and private plans tax-free. This approach would eliminate the double taxation investors now face. It would encourage families to save for college rather than force them to strap themselves with debt and their children with years of student loan payments.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>American education continues to be in crisis. Government  spending on
education has skyrocketed even as school performance  and student achievement
have remained static, leaving young  Americans ill-equipped to function in
today's increasingly  competitive world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The liberal solution, as always, is more money, more  bureaucracy, more
regulation, more federal intrusion. Candidates need to  emphasize that America's
education crisis cannot be solved by  central government decree. Schools will
not be improved by letting  Washington run them. The crisis can be solved only
by taking  power away from centralized bureaucracies and empowering  parents,
teachers, principals, and local school boards to take charge  and make things
better for their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most important education goal of the 1990s is to put  parents and
teachers in charge of education  at the local level. In  the nation's large
cities in particular, public schools have  become faceless monopolies,
insensitive or indifferent to parental  and teacher concerns about quality,
standards, and discipline.  Public schools must be made fully accountable to the
parents and  children they are meant to serve. That means parents  especially 
low-in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  come parents  must be given the
power to transfer their  children to, and the public funds to educate their
children, in other public  or private schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>High academic standards lie at the heart of effective  education. But
standards must reflect America's tradition of local  control: They should be
locally adopted and adapted to local needs  and capacities. While education is a
national issue, it is a local  responsibility. Federal &quot;remedies&quot; are
barriers to needed innovation  and reform, not the solution. Indeed, the
original genius of the  federal system was that the states were &quot;laboratories
of democracy.&quot;   Each state, and each local school district, can learn from
the others.  The federal push to establish fashionable outcomes-based 
education, and the reaction it has precipitated, should remind us that the 
federal role should be minimal and non-interventionist.  Decisions need to be
made in local schools and the communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, since the time of the ancient Greeks, schools have had  a central
mission which embodies but goes beyond academics:  character formation. Students
should become better people by virtue  of attending school; habits of hard work,
honesty, self-respect,  and respect for others are essential to democratic
capitalism,  and schools should support their development as ardently as they 
support mastery of mathematics and English. The public school  in America once
proudly carried out that function  now  many schools undermine it. There is, as
well, a pressing practical  issue: Schools must be safe and secure learning
environments for  students, teachers, and other members of the education 
community. The lesson should be clear: Learning is important, self-discipline 
is important, and standards of behavior will be enforced, just as  academic
standards will.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Adopting institutional reforms centered around school choice  for parents,
autonomy for teachers and principals, and genuine  teacher professionalism can
change the system's fundamental  incentives. Today's government- and
union-controlled monopoly can be  replaced with a diverse and flexible system
controlled by  parents. The result will be freedom of choice for parents,
teachers, and  students, greatly improved school performance and student 
achievement, and a vastly improved working environment for teachers  and
principals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's public schools once provided citizens with a  common culture and a
sound basic education. In recent decades,  however, the public school system has
failed utterly to provide  Americans with these essentials.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>SAT scores have dropped nearly 60 points in the past three  decades  even
though the test has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  The  same answers in 1992 as
in 1960 score between 18 and 30 points  higher than three decades ago. Thus, the
real loss is somewhere  between 98 and 110 points.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In a classic example of denial, the Educational Testing Service  has
responded to this crisis by &quot;re-centering&quot; SAT scoring for  1995 and
beyond. To disguise the poor performances of American  students, all SAT scores
are now reported on a higher scale. The  test also has been renamed. No longer
the Scholastic Aptitude Test,  it is now the Scholastic Assessment Test: same
acronym, less utility.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But trying to make the picture look better by altering SAT  scores fools
nobody. The school system is failing. In 1969, Congress  created the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)  to survey student achievement
nationwide on a regular basis.  Over the years, these assessments have found
that:

<P>
</P>
<P>The latest results show that there has been little if any  improvement. The
1994 NAEP history assessment showed that more  than half of American high school
seniors lack a basic knowledge  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  U.S. history. The test, composed
of multiple choice and  essay questions, was given in early 1994 to a national
sample of  22,500 fourth, eighth, and 12th graders in both public and private 
schools. The results:

<P>
</P>
<P>The information gets worse. A 1995 NAEP study revealed that  the best
writing students produce as part of their classroom work is  not very good.
Writing samples collected from a nationally  representative sample of more than
3,000 4th and 8th graders showed that:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Only 1 percent of 4th graders and 12 percent of 8th

read. Only 55 percent were fluent in reading aloud a  portion of narrative text
that they had read silently twice before.  Only 13 percent consistently read
with appropriate phrasing and  expressiveness.

<P><B>States vary widely.</B> In its <I>Report Card on American  Education
1994</I>, a comprehensive state-by-state analysis of student  performance in all
50 states and the District of Columbia, the  American Legislative Exchange
Council (ALEC) found that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Nationwide, student performance did not improve 
significantly from 1992-1993 to 1993-1994. SAT scores remained  unchanged, 35

1.3 percent from 1980.  ACT<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#8">8</A> and

<P><B>*</B>     Ten states dominated the nation on all measures of high

rates): Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana,  Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Utah, Wisconsin, and  Wyoming (see Table 5).
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending at Record Levels</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While education performance has been mediocre at best,  education spending
is now at an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the 1994-1995 school year, total education spending in  the United
States was estimated to be $508.3 billion, up 178  percent from the 1980-1981
school year (see <a href="educ_t1.gif">Table 1</a>).This amounted  to about 7.5 percent of GDP for
1994-1995, almost double the  spending on national defense.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Total spending on public elementary and secondary schools for  the 1994-1995
school year was $283.9 billion, an increase of 173  percent from 1980-1981 in
nominal terms. From 1972 to 1992,  public school spending rose 490 percent in
nominal terms (see <a href="educ_t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Overall, the federal government spent $35.2 billion in  constant 1994
dollars on education in 1994-1995, up from $29.7 billion  in 1980 (see <a href="educ_t3.gif">Table 3</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending per pupil in the public schools has soared: $6,857  in 1994-1995,
up 150 percent from 1980-1981 in nominal terms  and 44 percent in 1994 dollars.
Since 1970, per-pupil spending  has risen 554 percent in nominal terms and 73
percent in  constant 1994 dollars (see Table TK).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>ALEC's report card clearly supports conservative arguments  that student
performance measures, compared with per-pupil  expenditures, average teacher
salaries, and other education spending  variables, indicate no direct or
systematic relationship between  spending and student performance. 
</P>
<P>None of the ten top-performing states in terms of student  achievement
ranked among the top ten in per-pupil education spending  in 1993-1994; most
spent less than the national average per pupil.  In addition, none of these
states ranked among the top ten in  average teacher salaries last year (eight
actually paid less than the  national average); nine held per-pupil spending
increases below the  national average during the last 11 years; and seven did so
during  the preceding 21 years as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="educ_t5.gif">Table 5</a> shows, Iowa scored first in SAT scores and tied  for 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  first on the NAEP test, yet its
spending per pupil was below  the national average; Utah spent the least per
pupil, yet scored  second on the SAT and eighth on the NAEP test; and North 
Dakota ranked 36th in spending but tied for first on the NAEP test  and scored
fourth on the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By contrast, New Jersey spent the highest amount per pupil  and scored 37th
on the SAT and 14th on the 1992 NAEP test; the  District of Columbia ranked
second in spending per pupil and  scored 49th on the SAT and 42nd out of 42
states on the NAEP test;  and ninth-ranked Rhode Island scored 43rd on the SAT
and 23rd  on the NAEP test.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     According to ALEC, report card, New Jersey spent
more per  student ($9,429) than any other state in the nation during the 
1993-1994 school year. New Jersey also held the same per-pupil  spending rank in
1992-1993 and still increased per-pupil spending  significantly more than the
national average. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Teacher salaries also increased nationwide last year, rising a
 modest 0.1 percent after inflation. Connecticut paid the highest  average
teacher salaries last year ($49,500); South Dakota, the  lowest ($25,199).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     By the year 2005, the total cost of public education will have
 increased substantially. Using Census Bureau population  projections, and
assuming per-pupil spending trends continue:

<P><B>*</B>     Total education spending will rise more than 47 percent 
(almost $125 billion in constant 1994 dollars), and per-pupil spending  will
increase almost 32 percent to $7,942. As a result, the  per-capita 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  education tax burden will rise by
one-third, and the typical  family of four will face an average annual education
tax increase  of $1,340.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>That there is no correlation between spending and performance  has been
demonstrated by a wide variety of studies, perhaps most  notably in the
exhaustive study of the performance of  America's schools for their landmark
1990 book, 
<I>Politics, Markets and America's Schools,</I> conducted by Brookings
Institution  Senior Fellows John Chubb and Terry Moe. The evidence showed 
clearly that increased spending and resources do not translate into  better
school or student performance. The relationship between  resources and
performance has been studied extensively by social  scientists, who agree that
financial resources are of less consequence  that other variables. Most
important is &quot;school climate,&quot; the extent  to which a school offers a
safe and disciplined learning  environment with staff and students motivated by
a shared commitment to  academic excellence. The performance problems of the
public  schools cannot be corrected solely by digging deeper into the  public
purse.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#9">9</A>  Many studies make this
point.

statistically significant relationship between student  achievement and any of
the school characteristics that are often  thought important: teacher-pupil
ratios, teacher education,  teacher salaries, and per pupil expenditures. This
should come as  no great surprise. Over the last two decades, as school 
performance has deteriorated and stagnated, per-pupil spending  in schools has
increased nearly 100 percent after inflation,  class sizes have shrunk more than
20 percent, and most  teachers have acquired master's degrees.<A

<P>International Comparisons
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the home front, there is some modest good news. Black  test scores have
made small gains, and women's have as well.  More students are taking more
demanding courses. The number of  them taking advanced placement courses and
tests continues to rise,  as does the number of higher scores. But these are
just a few  bright spots in a gloomy picture. The bottom line for conservative 
candidates is that all American children could be doing  significantly better,
as indeed all must if we are to have confidence in the  future. Academic
performance in America is not world-class,  and offers no promise of becoming
world-class by the year 2000  except in a few isolated schools and districts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The reasons for this huge discrepancy between America's  schools and our
international competitors are not hard to fathom.  American public schools are
not designed to succeed. Pony Express  institu
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  tions in the electronic age, they
are hopelessly out of date.  The issue is not money (see <a href="educ_2.gif"
>chart</a>), but standards,
organization,  and accountability. Too little is expected of American students;
as  a consequence, they give too little. There are few rewards for  success and
fewer penalties for failure. A system designed and  run without incentives and
rewards ineluctably panders to the  lowest common denominator, as American
education has done.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Where Teachers Send Their Children to School</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Public school teachers are sending their own children to  private schools
rather than allow them to become lost in a public  school system in disarray.
This was reported in a May 1995 study by The Heritage Foundation's Denis Doyle,
prepared under the  auspices of the Indiana-based Hudson Institute and published
and  distributed by the Washington-based Center for Education  Reform.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#13">13</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This study, drawn from the 5 percent household sample of  the 1990 Census,
shows that, taken together, public and private  school teachers nationwide are
only slightly more likely than the  general public to choose private schools
(17.1 percent to 13.1 percent).  In America's most troubled cities, however, the
results are quite  different:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In troubled cities, public school teachers are two to three  times more
likely than the general public to use private schools. For  example, in
Washington, D.C., 25.7 percent of public school  teachers who make less than
$35,000 send their children to private  school. This is more than double the
national average; among  public school teachers nationwide, 11.9 percent enroll
some or all of  their children in private school. The trend continues in cities
like  Boston 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  (24.4 percent), New York (21.4
percent), Miami (35.4  percent), and Los Angeles (18.9 percent). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In other words, &quot;in our nation's cities, where the schools are 
arguably the worst, a large number of teachers abandon the  institutions in
which they work and enroll their offspring in private schools.&quot;   This
includes teachers of all races.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Black public school teachers use private schools more than  white public
school teachers (12.9 percent to 11.9 percent), and  Hispanic public school
teachers use private schools more than  non-Hispanic public school teachers
(16.5 percent to 11.9 percent).  Meanwhile, white parents are somewhat more
likely than nonwhite parents  to send their children to a private school. In the
United States as  a whole, 13.1 percent of all parents, 14.2 percent of white 
parents, 8.1 percent of black parents, and 10.8 percent of parents of  other
races send their children to private schools. Some 13.4 percent  of Hispanic
parents send their children to private school, compared  to 10.1 percent of all
non-Hispanic parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Overall, then, black public school teachers are almost as likely  as the
public at large to use private schools (12.9 percent to 13.1  percent). This
means that &quot;black teachers who can afford a  choice exercise it: they are
50 percent more likely than black parents  in general to enroll their children
in private school. This might  explain the high support for publicly funded
school choice  programs among minorities  they are often in the worst school
districts  and are more inclined to put their children in private schools when 
they can afford it.&quot;  Across the United States, &quot;teachers  public  and
private, white and black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic, low  income, middle income,
and high income  know how to address  the

vote with their feet and their  pocket books. They choose private schools for
their children when  they think it serves their interests best.&quot;

<P><B>How Teacher Unions Obstruct Reform </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the larger  National Education
Association (NEA) have become the  bane<U> </U>of school reformers. They are
big and well funded, and they have  a major presence in Washington and most
state capitals.  Teachers are, in fact, the most heavily unionized segment of
the  American work force, and the NEA is particularly opposed to serious 
education reform. But teachers are not necessarily synonymous  with their
unions. They vote for Republicans as well as Democrats  and are concerned with
many of the same issues that concern  reformers. The tide could begin to turn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One sign that teachers recognize the need for reform, as  noted above and in
the following table, is the extent to which they  enroll their own children in
private schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another encouraging sign is the willingness of AFT  President Albert Shanker
to champion high academic standards and  school discipline.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#14">14</A>  At the same time, however,
Shanker's opposition  to innovations such as school choice remains implacable.
The  education establishment fears that public schools as we know them  will
disappear, but this is all the more reason to adopt a more  innovative approach
to public education. This fear of change is  narrow and self-serving. Preferring
the known to the unknown, the  education establishment reveals its limited
vision and how little it  actually cares about the welfare of children.

<P><B>The Federal Takeover</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The attempted federal takeover of American education,  launched with fanfare
and good will during the Great Society 30 years  ago, has been revealed for what
it is: a prolonged and serious  mistake. It is now abundantly clear that
Washington both  over-promised and overreached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Programs intended to improve the education of the poor and  dispossessed
have borne bitter fruit, emerging by and large as  self-serving employment
programs for educators. Student test  scores have remained largely static, and
the promise of public  education as a way out of the mire of social pathology
has not  materialized. Instead, inner-city public schools themselves have become
 trapped in the pathology of the inner city. Almost without exception,  the only
schools which have escaped, and whose students have  done well, are private
denominational schools.
</P>

languages  so  crucial to a future of sophisticated technology and international
 competition. America's children are not learning enough, they  are not learning

<P>Too many of America's public school teachers must perform  under combat

<P>If local and state officials really wish to improve the education  of our

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Vouchers Are Needed</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The main difficulty in addressing the sorry state of  America's schools lies
in the fact that those in charge have a vested interest  in resisting change.
The efforts of those most concerned about  falling test scores  usually parents,
but many teachers as well   usually meet with a discouraging combination of
bureaucratic lethargy  and outright resistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For this reason, the first order of business for reformers must be  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  wrest enough control from the
bureaucracy to effect  serious change. Several promising policy solutions have
been put  forward to accomplish this. One of the best is the concept of school 
choice, which would end the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to the public
 education system by opening up options for students to attend  higher-quality
private schools. The best way to make private  schools more accessible to the
parents of children currently enrolled  in public schools is also the simplest:
through government vouchers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>School choice vouchers are transfer payments from the  government to
families of school-age children which permit these  children to attend the
school of their choice, whether public or  private, secular or religious. The
practice is widely followed in the  developed democracies and is spreading
rapidly in the former Iron  Curtain countries. America is, in fact, the only
developed nation  that denies its children this form of assistance to help them
attend  non-public and denominational schools. It may well be that the  last
truly deprived minority in the United States is made up of  poor children whose
families prefer a religious education but  cannot afford to pay for it out of
pocket.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#28">28</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Numerous opinion polls show broad public support for  school choice,
especially among inner-city minorities and the poor,  who suffer the worst
schools under the current system with no  feasible alternatives. School choice
offers conservative candidates a  powerful opportunity to attract strong support
from this traditionally  liberal constituency.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The opposition, by contrast, comes from the education and  union
bureaucracies  the only people who gain from the current  monopoly. School
choice is a threat to them because it would  give 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  parents and teachers the power
and control enjoyed for decades  by a professional managerial elite increasingly
out of touch with  the communities they are supposed to be serving.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Role of Charter Schools</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Two other promising innovations are the charter school and a  related idea,
private contracting for school services. Charter  schools are public
institutions in terms of mission and funding, but are  run autonomously by the
signatories of a charter. They can be run  by an association of parents,
teachers, business leaders, or any  combination of these. While the charter
school movement is both  new and small, varying significantly from state to
state, the idea  is promising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The basic concept of charter schools is simple: &quot;Allow a group  of
teachers or other would be educators to apply for permission  to open a school.
Give them dollar for dollar what a public  school gets for each student but
without any strings attached. Free  them from the regulations that cripple
learning and stifle innovation  at so many public schools.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#29">29</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the four years since the first charter schools opened their  doors in
Minnesota, 18 other states have passed charter laws in  various forms, and 234
of these schools are up and running around  the country.<A

<P><B>Private school eligibility:</B> Yes, if  the school is nonsectarian, but

<P><B>Hiring:</B> Schools are not required to hire  certified teachers.

</P>
<P><B>MINNESOTA:</B> The state that pioneered the charter concept  revised its
law to strengthen it in 1993 and 1995. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cap:</B> Increased  to 40 schools in 1995 after being set
originally at eight and later at  12 schools. </P>
<P><B>Schools open:</B> 17. </P>
<P><B>Approval:</B> Only licensed teachers  can operate a school. Charters
must first be approved by a local  school board, community college, state
university, or technical  college, with the state board of education granting
final approval. Such  an approval process is more limiting than Arizona's, but
in 1993,  lawmakers amended the original law so that charter applicants 
rejected by the local school board can appeal to the state board  if two members
of the local board voted to approve the  charter.</P>
<P><B>State/local control:</B> Schools are exempt from state laws and local 
district policies except those regarding health, safety, civil rights, and 
children with disabilities or special needs. They also have  complete control of
the money they receive from the state.</P>

<P><B>Private school eligibility:</B> No.</P>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most thoroughly developed example is Yvonne Chan's  Next Century
Learning Center in Los Angeles, and the most  promising state legislation for
Charter Schools is Arizona's which is  wide-ranging and flexible. In most
jurisdictions, however,  charter schools are poorly developed and kept on a
short leash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The education establishment  notably the National  Education Association and
various school board associations at the state  and national levels  give lip
service to charter schools but offer  no real support. The reason: Charter
schools are a very real threat  to the status quo. Once in place, they could
revolutionize  American education. They combine the best aspects of a
functioning  public school system  public support, public access and
accountability   with much of the flexibility of private schools. They are an 
important and useful first step to freeing teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Contract Management.</B> Still in its infancy as a way of  operating
schools or school districts, contract management of various  aspects 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  of education is a
long-established practice. School cafeterias,  busing, business services,
textbook acquisition, purchase of  supplies and materials, janitorial services,
and the like have been  turned over to private contractors and run efficiently
in many districts  for many years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What remains is to begin trying the concept in curriculum  areas such as
reading, math, and foreign languages, as well as in  running whole schools or
school districts. There is no conceptual barrier  to contract management; it is
used in almost all other areas of  government services, from national park
concessions to military  training.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The idea behind contract management is simple: Pay an  independent
contractor to perform an assigned task and devise  measures that will determine
whether that task has been performed  successfully. Interestingly, one of the
most difficult tasks school  districts face in contract management is &quot;specifying&quot;
the terms of the  contract; since many schools do not have a clear sense of 
mission, they find it very difficult to specify what they want to  accomplish in
the language of a contract. The exercise, however, is useful,  and education
establishment opposition to such a straightforward  idea is both
anti-intellectual and inflammatory. The issue is subject  to analysis and
validation, and should be welcomed as another way  to improve education
performance.

also can play a critical role in  helping schools set priorities, identify
measurement tools,  improve communication with and between schools and the
larger  community, and help develop performance measures that will  rationalize
pay for teachers and administrators. Perhaps most important of  all, business
leaders can help school boards behave in a more  businesslike fashion. In
particular, business can help school boards  end &quot;micro-management&quot;
and support candidates for school  boards who are both responsible and
effective.

<P><B>State Reforms in 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 1995 legislative session once again brought school choice  to the
forefront of the education debate at the state level. State  legislatures
debated numerous voucher and charter school bills over  the 1995 session, and
several states have passed or improved  their charter school laws. In two
states, Ohio and Wisconsin,  first-in-the-nation school choice programs were put
into  place.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#33">33</A>  Several other
states debated the issues and some proposals cleared the  relevant committees.

<P>The main changes enacted into law:

<P><B>Charter Schools.</B> Both chambers of the Florida legislature  passed
charter school bills in 1995. Legislators are consolidating the  bills, and
Governor Lawton Chiles is expected to sign. The  Louisiana Senate passed a
charter school bill that is now being considered  in the House.

legislation. In Oregon, the House narrowly defeated a  charter school bill by a
vote of 31-29. The bill has been sent to  the Legislative Rules Committee, where
it could be amended and  returned to the full House for another vote in 1996.
Connecticut  is considering many education reforms, including both a  voucher
proposal and charter schools.

</P>
<P><B>Voucher Update.</B> According to Marquette University's Blum  Center for
Parental Freedom in Education, choice and voucher  initiatives were pursued in
the following states during 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*    Ohio.</B> Governor George Voinovich in June signed
into law a  two-year budget package creating a $5.25 million pilot voucher 
program in Cleveland, to become effective in September 1996.  With his
signature, Governor Voinovich enabled Ohio to become  the first state in the
nation to complete the enactment of school  choice that includes religious
schools. The proposal included in the  budget package was approved by the
House-Senate Conference  Committee on June 23, 1995, and will allow parents of
2,000  Cleveland students to redeem vouchers at private or religious schools. 
With this new legislation, Cleveland becomes only the second city in  the
country (the first being Milwaukee) to allow private school choice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Wisconsin.</B> In June, Wisconsin's legislature passed genuine 
school choice legislation, which, along with the rest of Governor  Tommy
Thompson's budget proposal, was signed into law on July  25, 1995. The
legislation called for the expansion of the  Milwaukee Parental Choice Program
to include religiously based  schools (MPCP currently allows students to attend
non-sectarian  private schools in Milwaukee).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Governor Thompson's earliest version of the choice proposal  had set the
voucher amount at $3,300 per pupil and raised the  number of eligible students
to 3,500 in the fall of 1996 and 5,500 in  the next year, after which the
enrollment limitation would have  been eliminated. Before the package was
approved by the Joint  Finance

have  been raised to offset the loss of public funding. Oral arguments  have
been set for February 27, 1996, and a final decision is not  expected from the

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton promised to do something to help improve  the education of
America's children. While his rhetoric has been  appealing, however, he has
failed to keep his promise. Instead  of &quot;revolutionizing, revitalizing and
reforming&quot; America's  schools, he actually has slowed the process of
change. While creating  new government bureaucracies, increasing federal
regulations,  and boosting the rate of spending at the federal level, the 
Administration also has resisted real efforts to reform America's  education
system. The President has chosen to ignore academic &quot;outputs&quot;   real
results  and has focused instead on spending more  taxpayer dollars on &quot;inputs.&quot;
 The Administration also has seriously  undermined the relationship of students
and their families to the  education process.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Federal Takeover of School Districts (Goals 2000).</B> The  Goals
2000 legislation, enacted in 1994 as President Clinton's most  important
education program, has been a failure. Instead of  &quot;revolutionizing,
revitalizing and reforming&quot; America's schools as  President Clinton
promised, Goals 2000 has proved a barrier  to change.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#34">34</A>  It has created new government
bureaucracy and  boosted federal spending. Worse still, it threatens to
undermine progress  to improve American education performance by encouraging 
schools to ignore real results and focus instead on obtaining federal  dollars
by showing Washington that more money is being spent on  &quot;inputs.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000 will only  strengthen the federal
government's power to control local reform efforts  and hamper grassroots
reform. It is time for Congress to terminate  the program and divert the money
to real reform.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two important ways:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Building Bureaucracies.</B> Under Goals 2000, three new  government
bureaucracies would have been created: the National  Education Goals Panel, the
National Education Standards and  Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National
Skills Board. While  NESIC will not be empaneled, the philosophy behind these 
bureaucracies continues the command-and-control approach that keeps control  of
schools in the hands of education bureaucrats rather than  parents, teachers,
and students.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Federalizing Education.</B> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to  local
control, it came dangerously close to mandating a  watered-down national
curriculum designed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying  national
history standards  a well-meaning attempt by  then-National Endowment for the
Humanities Chairman Lynne Cheney  to make educators teach real history again 
backfired last year  when the committee assigned to formulate them unveiled
standards  that were rife with political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The incident reveals one of the inherent dangers in the Goals  2000
approach. Had its members been appointed, NESIC would  have become a de facto
national school board whose 19 members  could have imposed a standard curriculum
of politically correct  revisionism on the entire nation. This central authority
would have  approved or disapproved all state-developed plans to meet goals  set
by the Education Goals Panel, another bureaucracy created  under Goals 2000.
Such attempts to federalize state and local  education discourage real
innovation and inhibit the most important  school 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  reform initiative of the decade,
the movement toward  privatization and school choice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The states, meanwhile, on their own initiative already have  begun to reject
federal interference in schooling. In particular,  outcomes based education, a
favorite idea of the education  establishment, has offended and alienated
thoughtful teachers and parents  across the country and has mobilized opposition
to the federal role.  Four states  Montana, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Alabama
  have turned down or returned Goals 2000 funding, refusing to  permit more
federal intrusion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Another Middle-Class Subsidy:</B> AmeriCorps. Hailed by the 
Administration as an innovative effort to expand education  opportunity through
volunteerism, AmeriCorps, President Clinton's  national service program, has
evolved into a big-government  pork barrel. Although supporters maintain
AmeriCorps  &quot;encourages Americans to do volunteer work, helps people go to
college  and disperses decision-making power from Washington to  the states,&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#35">35</A> the rhetoric contrasts sharply
with reality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The AmeriCorps program does little to help American  families pay for
college, destroys the spirit of volunteerism, removes  participants from local
communities where they are needed most  and uses them to enlarge the federal
bureaucracy, and  improperly funds partisan political activities. Most
important,  AmeriCorps costs the taxpayers too much.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>An August 1995 General Accounting Office report found  that AmeriCorps costs
$26,654 per participant to run, or more than  40 percent more than the
Administration's most recent  estimates. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  Some 93 percent of the funding
for the program comes out of  taxpayers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1993-1994, AmeriCorps employed about 20,000  &quot;volunteers&quot;
described as &quot;working all over America, helping people   person to person.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#36">36</A>  In reality, a significant number
of these highly  paid &quot;volunteers&quot; are working in federal or state
bureaucracies,  government-funded programs, or political action organizations.
Of  the 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot; currently participating in the program, 
2,053 are working in federal bureaucracies on programs funded by  the federal
government. <a href="educ_t8.gif">Table 8</a> presents a breakdown of  AmeriCorps participation within the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Student Loans.</B> While the Clinton Administration has portrayed  its
direct lending program for college students as essential to the  education
future of young Americans, the evidence suggests  otherwise. The program appears
to be bad for taxpayers, bad for  students, and bad for schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided  through
private institutions. But under the direct lending plan, the  federal government
borrows the money needed to provide capital for  the loans. This would require
the federal government to borrow  an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each
year. According to  Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK), a complete shift to
direct  loans could add as much as $348 billion to the national debt by the 
year 2014. The U.S. Department of Education is expanding to  handle the new
program, hiring 600 new employees to administer it  and anticipating need for
another 20,000 contract employees by  the time the program is fully operational.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are other worries about the direct lending program.  Currently, some
75 percent of all available college financial aid  comes from the federal
government. If the government takes  complete control of the loan program,
colleges and universities in effect  will become dependent on a single lender to
support their students.  The Education Department's power to control loan
revenue, along  with its expanded regulatory authority and enforcement power, 
will give the government vast influence over post-secondary  education. Such
financial power could enable the federal government to  influence or force
curriculum changes, or to mandate such things  as politically correct &quot;diversity
standards.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is little support for a government takeover of the  guaranteed lending
program. The solution is not to nationalize  the multibillion-dollar student
loan program. That would mean  new costs and bureaucracy. Moreover, Americans
believe strongly  that student loans should continue to be provided through
private  financial institutions, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The actions taken so far by the 104th Congress have  produced mixed results.
For the first time in 40 years, there was hope  for serious change in America's
education system. The Contract  With America, however, included little
discussion of education  reform or of countering President Clinton's hindering
of legislative  actions. After the first legislative year of the Republican 
majority, despite attempts to introduce far reaching reforms, liberal 
strangleholds and repeated filibusters have caused the 104th Congress  to fall
far short of implementing any serious reform. At the  same 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  time, however, conservative
actions within Congress have  helped make education one of the key issues in
1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming schools in the Nation's  Capital.</B> At the request of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), the Task Force on  D.C. Schools and Representative
Steve Gunderson (R-WI) developed  a plan that would have laid the foundation for
serious reform in  the District of Columbia public school system. Fundamental to
 these reforms was a scholarship proposal that would have put the  federal
government on record as supporting the concept of choice.  The proposal was
added as an amendment to the D.C. FY 1996  appropriations bill in the House.
Unfortunately, due to intense  objections by Democrats and liberal Republicans
in the  House-Senate Conference Committee, the entire set of education reforms 
remains in limbo as both sides refuse to budge.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Gunderson amendment authorized the establishment of  independent public
charter schools which would have used  existing D.C. public and private schools
as well as new schools  created with the help of the universities within the
District. It also  would have authorized many federal institutions within D.C., 
including the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Library of  Congress, and
the Smithsonian Institution, to help establish public  charter schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Gunderson legislation would have given scholarships of up  to $3,000 for
students whose family incomes were at or below  the poverty level and up to
$1,500 for students whose family  incomes were not more than 185 percent above
the poverty level.  These scholarships would have allowed low-income D.C.
families to  escape the failing D.C. public schools by giving them the 
resources 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  needed to send their children to
any private, independent,  religious or non-religious school located in the
District of Columbia or  the surrounding counties of Northern Virginia and
Maryland.  They would have covered the cost of fees and other expenses for 
tutoring and instructional services after school hours and the costs  of
transportation for a student enrolled in a District of Columbia  public school,
public charter school, or private school participating  in the tuition
scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also included in the legislation was language to expand local  literacy
programs for the District from two programs to 20 in  the third year of the
initiative. These programs are instrumental  in helping to build reading skills
for children and their parents.  The legislation also would have helped
establish a panel to develop  a high expectations, academically challenging
curriculum and  assessment system for the D.C. school system.
</P>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Title I.</B> For more than 30 years, since 1965, Washington
has  spent over $90.5 billion on the Title I program, which still cannot  show
any long-term academic gains for children, even after being  &quot;reformed&quot;
five times. The House offered to cut funding for this  remedial education
program by $1.1 billion, from its current level  of $6.6 billion to $5.554
billion. The President is seeking $7  billion. Funding for the program is tied
to the Departments of  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education
appropriations  bill, which passed the House but had not been brought to the
floor  of the Senate for a vote by the end of the 1995 session because  of
opposition by Senate Democrats.

<P><B>Head Start.</B> While it is clear from several studies that any  success
for disadvantaged preschoolers gained through the early stages  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  Head Start is eroded by the time
the children reach the  primary grades, over the past 30 years Washington has
spent over  $31.2 billion on the program. Unfortunately, Congress has decided 
to continue its funding. The House passed a $3.39 billion grant  for preschool
health and education for FY 1996, which returns  Head Start funding to slightly
more than was allocated in 1994.  Again, the Senate has yet to take up the
appropriations for the  program. President Clinton is seeking an increase in
program funding  in order to extend services to 50,000 or more children by the 
year 2002.

acted to  cut this program, a &quot;black hole&quot; in federal funding, by more
than  half, from $441 million to $200 million. The rationale is that  the
program's funds are spread too thin, with some districts  getting only a few
hundred dollars. This program has shown no  effectiveness in reducing drug usage
in high schools, and there have  been no specific performance-based evaluations
of it since its  inception. Furthermore, a program evaluation report has shown
that  training sessions are &quot;more likely to focus on providing information 
about the use of various drugs than teaching resistance and  decision-making
skills.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#37">37</A>  The President has

school autonomy must go hand in hand with parental choice.  This will give
schools the ability to change. School autonomy  means that the principal,

parents as representatives, would  be free to run their school as they choose:
to select their own  curriculum, textbooks, staff, and teachers (which means
that teacher  certification requirements must be relaxed or abolished 
outright). Regulation of private schools also must be relaxed to the  absolute
minimum. In this way, parental choice can create an effective  market that
controls and regulates schools in accordance with the  preferences of parents
rather than according to the whims of a  bureaucratic elite.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Created by Congress at the request of President Jimmy Carter  in 1979, not
yet two decades old, the U.S. Department of  Education is doing precisely what
its severest critics envisioned:  usurping local and state control by slowly and
steadily introducing  federal controls. Although it accounts for about six
percent of total  public funding of education, its influence is out of all
proportion to  its financial role. Indeed, the Department of Education inserts 
itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the  nation's
15,025 school districts. Bureaucratic, heavy-handed and  intrusive, it is a
metaphor for many of Washington's most wasteful  and meddlesome domestic
programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yet the most alarming aspect of the growing federal control  of education is
not administrative interference, but its adverse  impact on academic
performance, equally the product of sins of  omission and commission. The
increasing power of special interests,  the burgeoning size of school districts,
the refusal of the  public schools to submit to any market discipline, weakening
 community bonds, a pervasive anti-intellectualism in schools of  education,
general permissiveness, family dissolution  all have played  a role. At no time
in American history has academic  performance been more important. Yet as the
federal role increases,  education performance declines. The new federal role in
education  obviously was not intended to impair academic performance, but, 
steadily and almost without interruption, student academic  performance
nevertheless has fallen, and the Department of Education has  done nothing to
stop the downward spiral. While cause and effect  may be elusive, and the
department's supporters assert a variety  of causes to explain the decline in
student performance,  these changes occurred during, and as a part of, the
federal  ascendancy in American education.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't education choice mean the brightest and most  affluent
students will escape, leaving the poorest and most difficult to  educate trapped
in bad public schools?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The exodus of the brightest and richest students happens  under
the current system because only they have the ability to  choose. Comprehensive
school choice gives poor inner-city children  the same freedom to choose their
schools that wealthier children  already enjoy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>School choice improves all schools and benefits all children,  not just
those who change schools. The reason?  Competition forces  all schools to strive
to perform better in order to survive. This  has been the experience in East
Harlem, for instance, where  school choice proved especially beneficial to poor
minority  inner-city students.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Don't we need the public schools to teach all students a  common set
of basic values, beliefs, and democratic principles?   Doesn't choice leads to
diverse, fragmented philosophies  and views?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The public schools are not teaching a common set of  values,
beliefs, and principles. Many are teaching moral relativism  and
multiculturalism. Under comprehensive school choice,  schools must reflect the
values, beliefs, and principles common to  parents in order to attract students
and funds. The parents of each  child, not government bureaucrats and
politicians, should have the  final say over what that child is taught.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't school choice encourage extremists or fanatics to set  up
bizarre &quot;cult&quot; schools and possibly even lead to such abuses as  the
indoctrination of students in Satan worship or racial supremacy?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Under a program of school choice, schools would have to  meet
minimum certification requirements, just as private schools  do today. Such
requirements effectively preclude extremist or  cult schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. With vouchers, wouldn't private schools receive  government money,
and so private schools would face heavy regulatory  control?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No private school is required to participate in any school 
choice program. Private schools which receive no state funds today  would be
free to forego state funds under choice programs, leaving  them no worse off
than they are now. One of the fundamental  principles of comprehensive school
choice is autonomy, with each  school free to operate as it chooses. Choice
means reducing the  regulation of public schools to the minimum level now
applied to  private schools, not increasing regulation of private schools.

<a name="ISSUES">

<P><b>THE ISSUES</b>
<P>
<P>Immigration has re-emerged as one of the nation's more 
controversial political issues. In 1994, California's Proposition 187, 
designed to deny welfare benefits to illegal immigrants, received 
a resounding 59 percent of the vote, and a special Commission 
on Immigration Reform issued a report supporting a national 
computerized registration system for all workers to help enforce 
laws against the employment of illegal aliens. Legislation to 
strengthen law enforcement against illegal immigration and restrict the 
quota of legal immigrants is being considered in Congress. 
Candidates for public office in 1996 are very likely to be asked to take a 
position on immigration issues.
<P>
<P>One reason for this concern is the widespread impression that 
immigrants who come to America to take advantage of welfare 
contribute to the urban crime rate. Immigration has been 
increasing, and many people worry that recent immigrants are changing 
the face of America ethnically, culturally, and politically. 
Immigration from European countries is much smaller than in earlier 
years, while Hispanic and Asian immigration is much greater.
<P>
<P>Not only is the number of new immigrants under current law at 
an all-time high, but the concentration of these new Americans in 
five 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

states -- California, Florida, Illinois, Texas, and New York --  
significantly magnifies their impact on local government 
services, including schools, emergency medical care, and welfare.
<P>
<P>The changing skills of immigrants also raise concerns. The 
proportion of highly skilled immigrants has declined in the past decade 
as the proportion of immigrants sponsored by close family 
members has increased. Refugees from political repression or ethnic 
persecution often arrive in this country without skills or other 
 resources and automatically are placed on welfare.
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a particularly sensitive issue for 
many Americans, one that prompts them to worry about the price 
society pays for an &quot;open door&quot; policy. Illegal immigration involves 
not only people who sneak across the U.S. border, but also those 
who come as tourists or students and decide to stay. In 1986, legal 
sanctions were imposed on employers who hire unlawful 
immigrants, but they have been difficult to enforce because identification 
documents are easily forged. Legislation pending in Congress 
would create a national identification card for every 
American,<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#1">1</a> but this worries many who feel that a national identification card would 
be a dangerous intrusion by government.
<P>
<P>Opinions about the merits of America's current immigration 
policy are sharply divided. Those who believe immigrants should be 
welcomed argue that the cultural and economic contributions of 
immigrants are part of America's historical tradition and that the 
economic benefits from more workers and people who start 
businesses and pay taxes far exceed any social 
costs.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#2">2</a>  Those who think the demographic change is too great, on the other hand, note that 
current levels of immigration will cause Americans from the 
Euro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->

pean ethnic groups that dominated this country for most of its 
history to become a minority of the population the middle of the 
21st century.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#3">3</a>
<P>
<P>But this is not just a political numbers game. It is an intensely 
personal issue for millions of Americans whose close family ties 
or business interests are regulated by the immigration law. 
Reuniting families is a primary goal of U.S. immigration law, and 
businesses in the rapidly growing high technology sectors of the 
U.S. economy, as well as American corporations with a 
multinational workforce, want the freedom to bring foreign-born employees 
and their families into the United States without excessive red tape.
<P>
<P>Most current immigration to the United States cannot be 
justified as bringing some general economic benefit to other Americans, 
but neither can it be attacked as an economic drain. Though 
national statistics do not clearly show any particular economic costs or 
benefits to the country as a whole,<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#4">4</a> the family members and 
employers who sponsor immigrants believe very strongly in the 
economic contributions of the individuals they 
know.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#5">5</a>
<P>
<P>The abstract question  whether there is too much 
immigration today  tends to dominate the debate (along with the problem 
of illegal immigration). But the issue is hard to resolve. For 
those people directly affected, the concern is whether the 
government will permit a particular, valuable<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#6">6</a> person to live and work in 
the United States. For other Americans, the issues are less 
clear-cut. Candidates must be prepared to help their constituents 
resolve them.
<a name="FACTS"><P>
<P><B>THE FACTS

<P>
<P>Immigrants and Welfare</B>
<P>
<P>The generous welfare benefits provided by most states and 
the federal government are intended to help individuals and families 
in need. Many people take advantage of the this system to avoid 
assuming their family responsibilities and performing work. It 
certainly seems plausible that people from impoverished 
countries would want to come to the United States because of the 
higher standard of living, as well as to assume that many would come 
to be on welfare, since welfare benefits in the United States 
are higher than the incomes of most people in less developed 
countries. But there is no evidence that large numbers of working 
age immigrants come to America to go on the dole. 
<ul><P>
<li><P>The labor force participation rate among male immigrants is 
77 percent -- slightly higher than among native-born Americans 
(74 percent), according to the 1990 census. The highest labor 
force participation rate, 83 percent, is among Hispanic immigrants. 
<P>
<li>The median age for legal immigrants in 1993 was 28, 
slightly younger than the average American's age of 33. More than 80 
percent of immigrants arrive before age 45, and only about 
5 percent arrive after retirement age to join family 
members.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#7">7</a>
</ul><P>
<P>Newly arrived immigrants, &quot;legal permanent residents,&quot; 
generally are prevented from receiving welfare. They cannot receive 
most direct aid during their first three years<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#8">8</a> in the country 
because their sponsors' income is counted as their own during this 
period in determining eligibility. They also can be deported as a 
public 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->

charge if they use public benefits during their first five years in 
the country. Elderly immigrants, however, who typically are 
sponsored by their children, are able to take advantage of the 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program after five years. 
Their sponsors' financial responsibility ends, and SSI is an 
entitlement for those with a low income after age 65.
<P>
<P>The Immigration Reform Act of 1986, which established 
procedures to legalize immigrants, barred those taking advantage of 
the amnesty from receiving public benefits for five years. After 
that, they can receive welfare. Undocumented aliens are not eligible 
for most public assistance, except for emergency medical 
treatment under Medicaid and nutrition benefits under the Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The states were mandated by 
the 1986 immigration law to establish a computerized system, the 
Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE), to screen 
the immigration status of non-citizen applicants for Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and other federal benefit 
programs.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#9">9</a>
<P>
<P>A recent study of welfare participation over a whole lifetime 
by immigrant families, based on the years they arrived in the 
United States, shows a trend toward increasing use of welfare among 
immigrants in recent decades.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#10">10</a>

</table></center>
<P>This trend in lifetime welfare outlays for the foreign born is 
explained by the demographic pattern of recent immigration 
rather than by a growing tendency among immigrants in general, most 
of whom are young men, to go on welfare. More elderly 
immigrants have a higher lifetime dependence on welfare benefits for 
elderly people than the native born because they have fewer resources 
in the form of Social Security, private pensions, and 
accumulated savings. In addition, the number of refugees and political 
asylum seekers coming to the United States has increased since the 
1960s, and this category of immigrants is eligible for welfare 
immediately upon arrival.
<P>
<P>Still, it is important to keep this in proportion:
<P>
<P><B>Elderly Immigrants </B>
<ul><P>
<li><P>Elderly immigrants show up on the welfare rolls in greater 
numbers than younger immigrants, or the native born. But 
immigrants over age 65 who have lived in the U.S. for at least 20 years 
are only slightly more likely to receive welfare than elderly 
natives 

(8.7 percent versus 6.9 percent). 
<P>
<li><P>Most native born recipients receive other retirement income, 
including Social Security, that is not counted as welfare. But 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available when other sources 
of income are small. For most of the elderly immigrants on SSI, 
their monthly check is their only source of 
income.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#11">11</a> 
<P>
<li><P>In 1982, there were 127,900 non-citizens receiving SSI. In 
1992, this number had increased to 601,000, equal to about 11 percent 
of the total elderly poor. It continues to increase rapidly: By 1994, 
it had climbed to 738,000.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#12">12</a>  SSI recipients also qualify for 
Medicaid, food stamps, and local welfare services.
<P></ul>
<P>Most non-citizens on SSI have relatives able to support them. 
Support is a condition of sponsorship for immigration, but after 
five years is no longer mandatory. After five years as a legal 
permanent resident, an immigrant can become a naturalized citizen, and 
no restrictions on welfare eligibility apply. Significant changes in 
the federal means-tested welfare standards were included in the 
Balanced Budget Act of 1995.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#13">13</a>  Welfare benefits for refugees 
and other &quot;qualified aliens&quot; would have ended after five years. 
The income of a sponsor would have been used to calculate 
eligibility for SSI and other means-tested entitlements, without a three- 
or five-year limit. The legislation also would have required all 
non-citizens to reapply for benefits, with the incomes of their 
sponsors to be used in the recalculation of eligibility. But even this 
regulation ends if the elderly immigrant qualifies for citizenship.
<P>
<P><B>Immigrants and Crime
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->

</B>
<P>
<P>Ethnic communities with a high proportion of immigrants 
typically are located in the inner city, where higher crime rates are 
common. The issue: Do immigrants cause crime, or do they simply tend 
to live in high crime-areas?  The notion that higher immigration 
rates and higher crime rates are causally related cannot be dismissed 
out of hand. In every ethnic group, young males commit most of 
the crime, and immigrants are predominantly young males  
particularly illegal immigrants. In the United States, moreover, 
economic opportunity often depends on education and cultural 
advantages that immigrants from poor countries do not possess. 
<P>
<P>Many Americans assume this makes immigrants more inclined 
to commit crimes. But it is wrong to assume that educational 
disadvantages and other factors mean that immigrants are more likely 
to be involved in crime than native born Americans.
<P>
<ul>
<P><li>For the nation as a whole, the number of non-citizens in prison 
is approximately the same proportion as the number from the 
general population.

<P>The federal prison system has a much greater proportion of 
non-citizens (not necessarily immigrants) in custody than the state 
prisons, with approximately 25 percent. One reason for this is 
that federal law enforcement tends to concentrate on different kinds 
of crime, such as drug smuggling, in which foreigners on tourist 
or business visas are caught entering and leaving the United 
States. Federal prison statistics tell us nothing about criminality 
among immigrants. Among the non-citizens in federal prison, 80 
percent were convicted for crimes related to the war on drugs, 
including former Panama dictator Manuel Noriega.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#14">14</a> 
<P>
<P>The ethnic groups represented among non-citizen prisoners 
also have no significant correlation with the size of those 
immigrant groups in the general population. If immigration in general were 
a source of crime, we would expect to find a higher statistical 
correlation between members of specific ethnic groups in the 
prison population and their share of the general population.
<P>
<P><B>The Burden on State and Local Governments</B>
<P>
<P>Immigration policy, including the control of borders to halt 
illegal immigration, is a responsibility of the federal government. 
But state and local governments have to support public schools, 
hospitals, emergency rescue, police and fire departments, and other 
services for immigrant communities -- including many illegals 
who 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->

live and hide among the much larger legal foreign born 
population. Thus, if the federal government fails to secure America's 
borders, the states pick up the tab for illegals who receive services. 
The federal government clearly has failed to control the Mexican 
border. Moreover, the President and Congress annually set the 
quota for refugees, who are entitled to federal and local welfare 
benefits. The flood of political asylum seekers and foreign visitors 
who overstay their visa periods and melt into the population as 
illegal immigrants is entirely the result of Washington's failure to 
discharge its responsibility.
<P>
<P>Federal law requires state and local governments to provide 
public schooling<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#15">15</a> and emergency medical care for illegal 
immigrants. States have grown increasingly angry in recent years at what 
they see as an unfair financial burden placed on them by a federal 
government that is unwilling to enforce its immigration 
laws. California's Proposition 187 and other measures to deny state 
and local government services to illegal immigrants are prompted 
by the rising cost of services paid for by state 
taxpayers.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#16">16</a> 
<P>
<P>The governors of the most heavily affected states have 
demanded federal reimbursement of the estimated costs imposed by 
illegal immigration on their state and local governments. In 
Washington, this argument is made in support of legislation to strengthen 
federal immigration controls, particularly at the Mexican border, 
to stop illegal crossing.
<P>
<P>In the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress for the first 
time voted to eliminate one unfunded mandate (for emergency 
medical care, including childbirth, provided to illegal aliens) by 
authorizing a supplemental allotment of federal money to reimburse 
states. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->

The Act also explicitly disqualified payments for 
non-emergency medical care for illegal aliens under the Medicaid program. 
To comply with the rules and obtain federal money, medical 
providers would have had to determine the immigration status of 
patients, which they do not now do.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#17">17</a>  The legislation was vetoed by 
President Clinton.
<P>
<P><B>What is the cost of illegal immigration?</B> Illegal aliens are 
assumed to be a net cost to states. However, while they are 
among the poorest immigrants and pay fewer taxes than legal 
immigrants or the native born, many are employed and do not receive 
services paid for by taxpayers. Thus, figuring the costs that illegal 
immigrants impose on a community, and comparing this with 
benefits to that community from sales tax payments and other 
financial contributions, is no easy task. Illegal immigrants in general 
have more difficulty getting benefits from the welfare system than 
legal residents, and do not identify themselves as illegal if they do. 
As the RAND Corporation has observed, &quot;Congress, state, and 
local policymakers still have no reliable answers to basic 
questions about the costs and benefits of immigration for state and local 
governments, for the economy as a whole, and for the nature 
and speed of integration of new immigrants into U.S. 
society.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#18">18</a>
<P>
<P>A review of the econometric studies of the fiscal burden on 
state and local governments from immigration by the RAND 
Corporation found that &quot;there is general agreement that currently 
illegal immigrants contribute less than those who received amnesty, 
who, in turn, contribute less than legal immigrants, who contribute 
less than the native born. However, this finding merely reflects 
differences in the average incomes of these various groups rather 
than their immigration status per se.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#19">19</a>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->

<P>
<P>In nine different studies<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#20">20</a> examined by the RAND 
Corporation, the available data about the costs of immigration are 
conflicting and inconclusive. &quot;Existing studies of the costs of immigration 
do not provide a reliable or accurate estimate of the net costs and 
benefits of immigration  even wcosts/benefits are defined 
narrowly. Moreover, without reaching consensus on a host of conceptual 
and accounting issues, we doubt that additional studies will shed 
light on these important policy questions.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#21">21</a>  This is because they 
use different definitions for immigrants and public assistance, 
and even count tax revenues differently. Estimates of the per 
capita costs of providing federal, state, and local services to 
immigrants ranged from a low of $2,638 to a high of $4,476. The per 
capita revenue estimates varied from $1,051 to $3,644. When the 
costs and benefits were compared in each study, the conclusions were 
as widely apart as a surplus of $1,400 per immigrant to a net cost 
of $1,600.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#22">22</a>
<P>
<P>RAND's analysis of the six state and local government studies 
of the cost of immigrants found that the methods used to 
calculate costs and benefits tended to include a full list of outlays for 
public services but only a partial list of revenues, including transfer 
payments from higher levels of government. The flawed 
accounting methods showed that neither immigrants nor the native born 
pay their way at the state and local levels. Where estimates were 
made separately for immigrants and the native born, the studies 
found that the &quot;deficit&quot; for immigrants is larger. What the studies 
actually seem to find is only the higher average income, and 
higher taxes paid, by the native born.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#23">23</a>
<P>
<P>States and local communities with large immigrant 
populations 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->

probably have a disproportionate concentration among them 
of illegal aliens, who tend to be poorest. Mandates for social 
services and welfare, and lax enforcement by social workers of 
rules against aiding illegal aliens, probably impose a financial burden 
on those state and local governments. Because the federal 
government has failed to prevent the illegal immigration, the argument that 
the federal taxpayer should pay any imposed costs is sensible. But 
the size and nature of the costs of illegal immigration have not 
been clearly established. Moreover, the task of identifying the 
immigration status of almost all poor people in America's ethnic 
communities is one that state and local governments may not want to 
undertake.
<P>
<P><B>Are There Too Many Immigrants?</B>
<P>
<P>Many Americans are concerned that the higher rate of 
immigration to the United States in recent years may be too great for the 
cultural assimilation of so many people. Immigration has been 
increasing, and many commentators are concerned that this is 
changing the culture of America. 
<P>
<P>The assimilation of the foreign born could be a problem if 
their numbers were too great. The question is: Are they too great?
<ul><P>
<li><P>In 1993, more than 904,000 legal immigrants and as many 
as 300,000 illegal immigrants settled permanently in the 
United States. The decade 1981-1990 saw 7.4 million legal 
immigrants, which was almost double the 4.5 million who arrived in 
1971-1980. The decade of greatest immigration to the United States 
was 1901-1910, with 8.8 million new arrivals.

<P>
<li>In every decade between the Civil War and the Depression, 
e than 13 percent of the U.S. population; 
today, they are approximately 8 percent. 
</ul>
<P>The principal concern about legal immigration is that the rate 
is increasing every decade, and the current immigration rate plus 
the birth rate among the groups that are arriving in this country 
is higher than the birth rate for other Americans. 
<P>
<P>During the 1980s, immigration contributed 37.1 percent of 
the growth in the U.S. population. In the 1970s, it contributed 
32.6 percent.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#24">24</a>  In 1990, immigrant women aged 35 to 44 had 
given birth to an average of 2.2 children, compared with 1.9 
children among native born women in that age group. The fertility 
concern is amplified by the fact that a greater percentage of 
immigrants than of native-born Americans are of reproductive 
age.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#25">25</a>
<P>
<P>Although the proportion of immigrants in American society 
today is relatively low, and the numbers that come to the United 
States every year are well within historical levels, the demographic 
trend today will produce higher and higher proportions of immigrants 
in the general population. 
<P>
<P>By the year 2050, the proportion of immigrants in the 
general population will rise to approximately the same level as in the 
six decades following the Civil War (over 13 percent). But 
because the population of the United States has increased, and will 
continue to grow, the number of immigrants living in the 
United States by the middle of the next century will be about six 
times greater than in the earlier period.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->

<P>
<P>Another important demographic trend that concerns opponents 
of more immigration is the very significant increase in 
immigration from Asia and Latin America.
<P><ul>
<li><P>In 1981-1990, 37.3 percent of immigrants were from Asia, 
22.6 percent were from Mexico, and 18 percent were from other 
Latin American countries. The great wave of immigration to the 
United States after the Civil War was mostly from Europe and 
essentially Caucasian. But a large proportion of the late 19th century 
immigrants were from the very poor regions of southern and 
eastern Europe and were very different culturally from those who 
originally settled the United States.
<P>
<li>The demographic projection of population growth represented 
by immigrants and the children of immigrants shows that by 
the middle of the next century, Asian or Hispanic immigrants and 
their immediate children will account for roughly a quarter of 
the American population.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#26">26</a>  The population as a whole will 
change from today's proportions of 3 percent Asian, 9 percent 
Hispanic, 11 percent non-Hispanic black, and 77 percent non-Hispanic 
white to approximately 9 percent Asian, 13 percent non-Hispanic 
black, 19 percent Hispanic, and 59 percent non-Hispanic 
white.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#27">27</a>  These estimates do not account for changes that would result from 
intermarriage among members of these groups.
<P></ul>
<P>The concern that opponents of current immigration policy 
feel about too many immigrants in the next century is exacerbated 
by the tendency of immigrants to move into their own ethnically 
homogeneous communities. More than 90 percent of 
immigrants move into cities and live in highly visible ethnic enclaves. 
The increased visibility of Hispanic and Asian communities 
reinforces 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->

the issue, just as the ghettos of Irish and Jewish immigrants in 
the last century and black Americans from the rural South after 
World War I aroused concern. The immigrant population is much 
more concentrated in Southern California, Texas, New York, and 
Miami than in the rest of the country. 
<P>
<P> Just 12 metropolitan areas received 55 percent of new 
immigrants in 1993. One in every three new immigrants now settles in 
California. Of these, 3 in 5 choose to live in the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area. Los Angeles is now 40 percent foreign 
born.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#28">28</a>
<P>
<P>The question is whether the current U.S. trend is 
toward balkanization or a melting pot. Do large concentrations of 
immigrants living in their own communities, near others with 
similar backgrounds and cultural practices, resist Americanization 
and sustain a separate loyalty to a minority group?  It is easier for 
large ethnic community to use a non-English language outside the 
home, and public schools can be forced to offer bilingual education. 
Assimilation into a more uniform American culture would seem 
less likely to occur, but the evidence actually indicates that urban 
concentrations of immigrants, particularly from countries from 
which large numbers have come, are more likely to become 
naturalized citizens.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#29">29</a>
<P>
<P>For example, in the mid-18th century, Benjamin Franklin 
complained: &quot;Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, 
become a colony of <I>aliens</I>, who will shortly be so numerous as 
to Germanize us instead of Anglifying them, and will never adopt 
our Language or Customs any more than they can acquire our 
complexion.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#30">30</a>  But he was wrong. In New York and Chicago for 
example, the concentrations of Yiddish-speaking immigrants so 
char
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->

acteristic in the earlier period have disappeared.
<P>
<P>Opponents of current U.S. immigration policy maintain that 
assimilation of so many from the last great wave of 
immigration, which ended in the 1920s, was possible because (1) almost all 
immigrants came from Europe, and many from 
English-speaking countries; (2) the influx was stopped for a period of time to 
permit the assimilation of the immigrant minorities into the 
dominant American culture; and (3) the birth rate among the native 
born population was significantly higher than it is today. Only 27.8 
percent of the growth in the U.S. population came from 
immigration during the 1901-1910 peak period, compared with 37.1 percent 
in the 1980s.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#31">31</a>
<P><ul>
<li><P>But the current rate of assimilation is very rapid. Research on 
immigrants to Southern California that looks at the age cohorts 
of recent immigrants has found very rapid increases in English 
language proficiency, naturalization rates, occupational mobility, 
self-employment, and income, in addition to significantly reduced 
poverty rates.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#32">32</a>
<P>
<li>In Southern California, &quot;all immigrant children showed a 
tremendous rate of increase in English ability, though the trend was 
especially marked among Latinos.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#33">33</a>
<P>
<li>By looking at age cohorts of Latino immigrants who arrived 
in California in the 1970s, demographers can see that poverty 
actually declined from 25.7 percent to 15.7 percent as the 
15-to-25-year-old arrivals matured and became 
assimilated.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#34">34</a>
</ul><P>
<P><b>Should population patterns be changed?</b> Author Peter Brimelow, 
in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->

his recent book<I> Alien Nation</I>, points out that the 1965 
immigration law, which opened the doors to higher rates of immigration 
from Asia and Latin America, was passed by Congress with the 
understanding that it would <I>not</I> change America's historical 
population patterns.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#35">35</a>  Since the law has caused such a demographic 
change, however, particularly as the 1986 amnesty for illegal aliens 
has further shifted the family reunification preferences in favor of 
very recent immigrants from Asia and Latin America, he argues that 
the pattern of immigration must be corrected.
<P>
<P>This raises both political and non-political questions about 
what immigration policy the United States should adopt. From a 
political standpoint: 
<ul><P>
<li>The American people as a whole do not get to choose the 
nation's future demographic profile. But on their behalf, Congress does 
set immigration quotas, and these can be written to discriminate 
either for or against people. 
<P>
<li>The federal government has a constitutional responsibility to 
control the national borders, and the requirement that foreigners 
entering the country must have a visa and submit to customs 
inspection is important in maintaining that control. 
<P>
<li>The federal government sets requirements on individuals 
wishing to live permanently in the United States: extensive 
documentation of good character, sponsorship for immigration, and financial 
responsibility. Additional requirements involving financial 
responsibility, English language proficiency, or ethnicity could be 
added by Congress. 

<P>
<li>Both the size of immigration quotas and the categories of 
people who qualify were set in the 1990 Immigration Act and may 
be amended in 1996. But determining whether to increase or 
decrease immigration quotas will have a very small effect on the 
long-term demographic profile of the country.
</ul>
<P>The non-political considerations of immigration policy affect 
the nation's demographic patterns. Within the quota system, 
individual families and employers control the decisions over who 
can immigrate to America by virtue of their power to sponsor 
those individuals. Particular families or employers generally choose 
to sponsor immigrants for very personal or economic reasons, 
and there often is a long waiting period before an immigration visa 
is granted. The question is whether this choice should remain 
essentially personal or should be regarded as a significant public 
interest that requires more political control.
<P>
<P><B>The Immigration Law</B>
<P>
<P>The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes the rules 
and quotas for immigration to the United States.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#36">36</a>  The visas issued 
to immigrants allow them to become permanent residents. The 
law provides that after five years, and after fulfilling a requirement 
to show some knowledge of American history, permanent 
residents may become naturalized citizens of the United States. Prior 
to 1965, specific quotas favoring predominantly European 
countries were enforced. In 1965, Congress repealed this system of 
quotas and established a worldwide quota for immigration, with a 
limit per country. This major change in U.S. immigration law put 
the priority on family unification  individual Americans 
sponsoring relatives to come here.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#37">37</a>  The law fundamentally changed the 
em

phasis from specific nationalities and opened the process 
much more widely to immigrants from Asia. Spouses and most 
children of American citizens are exempt from the quota system, 
while other relatives are given priority over foreigners with no 
American relatives.
<P>
<P>The quota system, with its &quot;preference categories,&quot; is an 
extremely complex area of immigration law. Combined with the limits 
on immigration from individual countries, the preference system 
requires some immigrants to wait many years after applying for 
U.S. permission before receiving it. Immigrants from other 
countries, however, are not subjected to such prolonged delays. The 
quota preference system also includes categories for occupations 
and skills, but these have much smaller quotas and are ranked lower 
in the preference categories.
<P>
<P>The quota system and its preferences were revised by the 
1990 immigration law, but the family unification priority was 
not changed. Current law provides for up to 675,000 immigrants 
annually. Of these, 480,000 (71 percent) are sponsored by relatives 
in the United States, and another 140,000 (21 percent) are 
&quot;economic&quot; immigrants whose acceptance is determined on the 
basis of skills, education, or willingness to invest and create jobs. A 
special preference category was created for &quot;diversity&quot; 
immigration, allowing 55,000, or 8 percent of the total, from countries 
where immigration was lowest in prior years. This provision is 
intended to ease immigration from Ireland and other European countries.
<P>
<P><b>Refugees.</b> The Refugee Act of 1980<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#38">38</a> provides general 
authority for the admission of refugees, who were removed as a 
category under the quota preference system. The number that will come 
to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->

the United States annually is determined by the President in 
consultation with Congress, and there are procedures for 
admitting larger numbers in emergency situations, such as the Haitian 
and Cuban boatlifts. In 1993, 119,482 refugees were admitted.
<P>
<P>Political asylum is granted on a case-by-case basis to aliens 
who meet the definition of refugee but already are in the United 
States or at the border. The requirement for case-by-case 
determinations is a significant administrative burden for the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS). In 1993, there were 150,386 
applications for asylum, and the backlog of cases had reached 
333,000. While waiting for the INS to schedule a hearing for political 
asylum, these individuals generally are allowed free movement 
within the country, and a large number disappear and become 
illegal aliens.
<P>
<P><b>Illegal Immigrants.</b> The Immigration Reform and Control Act 
of 1986 (IRCA)<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#39">39</a> was enacted to control illegal immigration. 
The intent of the law was to focus on the motives of illegal 
immigrants, who come to the United States and get jobs that offer better 
wages and working conditions than they can find in their native 
lands. The principal change in the law prohibiting employment of 
illegal immigrants, however, was to make the employer guilty of 
breaking the immigration law as well. To cut off the job 
opportunities being sought by illegal immigrants, employers were made 
responsible for enforcement. All job applicants must prove their 
citizenship or legal residence to their potential employers by 
completing an INS form (I-9) before they can begin work. The employer 
must verify this information and keep the documents with other 
personnel records. IRCA imposed both civil fines as high as $10,000 
on employers who hire illegal aliens and criminal penalties for a 
re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->

peated pattern of violations.
<P>
<P>Because it was known that millions of illegal aliens already 
were living and working in this country, the Congress established 
procedures by which they could apply for legal resident status. By 
1988, more than 3 million people had applied for &quot;legalization&quot; 
under the 1986 law. These legalized immigrants in turn have provided 
a newly enlarged pool of families that are seeking to sponsor 
other relatives for immigration.
<P>
<P><b>Citizenship.</b> A legal permanent resident in the United States 
may apply for citizenship after five years. The Immigration and 
Nationality Act sets out a number of specific requirements for 
becoming a naturalized citizen: a test of the applicant's knowledge of 
U.S. history and the Constitution, proficiency in the English 
language, and an oath renouncing all allegiance to foreign governments 
and swearing loyalty to the United States and a willingness to 
defend it. Congress also could enact additional financial 
responsibility requirements.
<P>
<P><B>The Problem of Illegal Immigration</B>
<P>
<P>There were an estimated 3.2 million illegal aliens in the 
United States as of October 1992, according to the 
INS.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#40">40</a>  The number of illegal residents is estimated to be growing by 300,000 per year.

<P>
<ul>
<li>Fifty-five percent of the illegal immigrants in the United States 

are estimated to be Mexican. Another 22 percent come from 
Central America. 
<P>
<li>Although Mexicans comprise about 90 percent of those 
apprehended at the southern U.S. border, one survey found they 
were joined by representatives of 70 other 
nationalities.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#41">41</a>
</ul><P>In addition to crossing the border illegally, many violators of 
the law just stay in the United States after their non-immigrant 
visas expire. 
<P><UL>
<p><li>In 1993, there were 21 million visas issued to 
non-immigrants, including 17 million tourists and almost 3 million business 
visitors; 165,000 temporary foreign workers and 257,000 foreign 
students also were admitted. In addition, foreign journalists, 
foreign government officials, and the families of persons working for 
international organizations come to the United States freely. 
<P>
<li>During the 1986 fiscal year, the INS apprehended 1.8 million 
illegal entrants. Of these, 243,000 had overstayed their 
visas.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#42">42</a> 
</UL><P>
<P>These statistics do not provide a good picture of the extent of 
the problem, however, because most illegal immigrants who enter 
the United States with a valid tourist or student visa are not 
identified unless stopped by the police for some reason.
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a serious problem that law enforcement 
has not been able to control. The shortage of border patrol officers 
and adequate physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border has 
been widely cited as a large factor in the problem, and improved 
enforcement at key locations in California, Texas, Arizona, and 
New Mexico certainly should be undertaken to curb illegal 
crossings. But the larger problem would not be solved by those 
measures alone, because illegal entry is only one source of illegal 
immigration. The problem of individuals misusing tourist visas also 
must be addressed. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->

<P>
<P><B>Identification Cards</B>
<P>
<P>Employer sanctions under IRCA have failed to reduce illegal 
immigration and may have increased racial or ethnic 
discrimination in the workplace.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#43">43</a>  Employers who suspect a job applicant 
may not possess legitimate credentials for legal residence or 
citizenship face a difficult problem. In an effort to solve this problem, 
legislation now before Congress would set up a pilot program 
covering approximately 47 million workers, or almost 40 percent of 
the workforce, to test a computerized national worker 
identification system.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#44">44</a>  In theory, if an employer needed to verify the right of 
a job applicant to work, he could make a telephone call and obtain 
a verification number, just as businesses now do to verify 
credit cards and checks. This would be the employer's defense 
against any subsequent discovery that the new employee was in fact 
an illegal alien.
<P>
<P>Unfortunately, this idea is both impractical and potentially 
dangerous. It would solve a problem caused by less than 1.5 percent 
of the population that is here illegally by dramatically increasing 
government regulation of every American's life. Even the pilot 
program would require over 100 million names and numbers, 
since non-working spouses and children potentially are part of the 
labor force. What ought to be a private contractual arrangement 
between employers and job applicants would become an illegal 
relationship unless the employer first obtained government authorization. 
The danger that such a system would create an underground 
economy with crime and tax evasion is overwhelming. If the 
authorization were denied, for whatever reason  computer data errors, 
bureaucratic mistakes, or even sabotage by a criminal computer hacker 
 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->

the job applicant would be forcibly unemployed. As the 
logical implications of this system of legal sanctions against 
employers become clearer and more threatening to the civil rights of 
ordinary people, public opposition is likely to increase.
<P>
<P>Most advocates of a computer registry admit that it would 
work only with a secure national identification card. Without such 
positive identification, an employer would have no way to 
determine whether the Social Security number being used actually 
belonged to the job applicant. Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), sponsor 
of the immigration reform legislation pending in the Senate, has 
described the two functions the worker identification system 
would have: &quot;It must verify that a name corresponds to someone who 
is authorized to work. And then verifying the identity, that the 
person claiming the name and the number is not an impostor. The use of 
a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint, is needed if this 
function is to perform reliably.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#45">45</a>
<P>
<P>Before a national computer system to identify every 
American could be installed, there would have to be significant 
improvement in the data stored in the federal government's computers. 
With approximately 6.5 million Americans changing jobs every year, 
an error rate of just one percent would cause 650,000 innocent 
victims to be denied a job until bureaucrats in Washington could 
be persuaded to correct their mistakes. The Social Security 
Administration has estimated that a national computer registry would 
cost between $3 billion and $6 billion  about 10 to 20 times more 
than its advocates have claimed.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#46">46</a>
<P>
<P>The proposal for a national computerized worker registration 
system does not address the basic problem of illegal alien 
employ

ment. Since employers are required to verify the right of job 
applicants to work in the United States today, violations of the law 
may occur because some employers simply ignore it. Advocates of 
the plan are enthusiastic about increasing the number of work site 
inspections for labor law and OSHA violations, along with 
the worker verification. The proposed computer system is an 
expensive, new invasion of every American worker's privacy and 
a threat to law-abiding employers who would have to deal with 
federal inspectors. Employers who violate the law today could 
continue to do so simply by going further underground and 
evading the new computer system.
<P>
<P>Employer sanctions is a misguided concept. The assumption is 
that because an illegal immigrant has broken the law, any 
employer who provides a job is a criminal accomplice. But employers 
are more likely to be the victims of document fraud. A solution to 
the criminal problem of illegal immigration ought to involve less 
government regulation of business, not more. Criminal 
penalties should focus on deterring illegal immigration by punishing 
the criminal, not the rest of the nation.
<a name="RECORD"><P>
<P><B>THE RECORD</B>
<P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
<P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has emphasized toughening the 
sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens and increasing the 
number of inspections by the U.S. Department of 
Labor.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#47">47</a>  In addition, INS funding and personnel increased significantly in FY 1995 
and FY 1996: Increases of 26 percent in budget (to $2.6 billion) 
and 3,200 new full-time employees (to approximately 25,000) 
are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->

scheduled. This will include an increase of 1,000 Border 
Patrol agents &quot;on the front lines.&quot;  The budget for FY 1995 was 
increased by 25 percent over the prior year, mostly to finance 
improvements in the agency's computer technology. The INS will spend 
more this year on detention and removal of deportable aliens, 
including people who have been denied political asylum. A detention 
facility operated jointly with the U.S. Marshal Service is being built 
in Batavia, N.Y., and a &quot;triple fencing pilot project&quot; is being 
placed on the border south of San Diego.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#48">48</a>
<P>
<P>The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#49">49</a> released its 
interim report to Congress, which addressed illegal immigration, 
in 1994, and a report on legal immigration in 1995. A final 
report covering issues related to immigration will appear in 1997. In 
general, the Commission has supported increased personnel 
and spending to enforce immigration laws at U.S. land borders 
and ports of entry.
<P>
<P>The Commission recommended &quot;development and 
implementation of a simpler, more fraud-resistant system for verifying work 
authorization.&quot;  It endorsed &quot;a computerized registry using data 
provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the INS.&quot; 
 It also called for federal regulation of birth certificates and 
other documents issued by states that establish nationality, as well 
as increased penalties for fraud.
<P>
<P>The Commission supported &quot;in principle&quot; the authorization of 
impact aid to offset the fiscal burdens of unlawful immigration, but 
it wanted further investigation to determine the real costs 
imposed on state and local governments by being required to educate 
illegal immigrant children and provide emergency medical assistance.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->

<P>
<P>The Commission's report on legal immigration generally 
supported changing the family visa priorities and eliminating them 
for adult children and siblings of American citizens. It proposed 
a change in the classifications of labor skills, the elimination of 
Department of Labor certifications, and the establishment of a 
&quot;labor market test&quot; for workers with college degrees. Employers 
would pay a fee to bring in skilled workers, and the money would be 
used for private-sector education and training of American workers.
<P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
<P>
<P>During the 104th Congress, legislation to crack down on 
illegal immigration and further restrict legal immigration moved 
through committees in both the Senate and House of Representatives. 
At the end of the first session, nothing had been sent to the 
White House. The bills include:
<ul><P>
<li><b>S. 269</b>, the Immigrant Control and Financial Responsibility Act 
of 1995, sponsored by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY).
<P>
<li><b>S. 1394</b>, the Immigration Reform Act of 1995, sponsored by 
Senator Simpson.
<P>
<li><b>S. 1535</b>, the Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement 
Act, sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 2202</b>, the Immigration in the National Interest Act, 
sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 2898</b>, the One Strike and You're Out Illegal 
Immigration 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->

Act, sponsored by Representative Randy Tate (R-WA).
</ul><P>
<P>Although illegal immigration and the legal immigration quota 
system are distinct issues, they have been combined. There is 
widespread agreement on many of the reforms proposed to control 
illegal immigration, but strong differences about the proposals to 
reduce legal immigration quotas.
<P>
<P>Both the House and Senate bills increase border enforcement 
patrols and authorize expedited hearings for deportation and 
tougher penalties for document fraud. The legislation begins 
implementation of the national computer identification system to enforce 
employer sanctions. Enforcement powers and penalties are 
increased for smuggling of aliens, as are punishment for repeated 
offenses, detention of illegal immigrants pending removal, and 
criminal penalties for failure to depart.
<P>
<P>Both the House and Senate bills contain new restrictions on 
the receipt of public benefits by illegal immigrants and impose 
new requirements for income support on the sponsors of legal 
immigrants. Sponsors will have to demonstrate greater financial 
ability in order to assure that immigrants are less likely to end up on 
welfare. Both the House and Senate bills reduce the number of 
legal immigrants and eliminate whole categories, such as adult 
children, brothers, and sisters. Immigration of parents of U.S. citizens 
would be restricted, and increased financial support requirements 
would be imposed.
<P>
<P>Legislation also has been introduced to make English the 
official language of the federal government. Proficiency in 
understanding simple English is already a requirement for naturalization as a 
U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->

citizen, except for elderly, long-time residents. There is a 
growing concern that the United States in danger of becoming a 
multilingual society, with all the social tensions and political problems 
that have occurred in some other officially multilingual nations. 
Bills include:
<P><ul>
<li><b>S. 356</b>, the Language of Government Act, sponsored by 
Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 739</b>, sponsored by Representative Toby Roth (R-WI), 
and H.R. 1005, sponsored by Representative Peter King 
(R-NY), which provide for English to be the official language of the 
U.S. government and require the INS to apply more strictly the 
English proficiency requirement for naturalization. These bills also 
repeal the Bilingual Education Act. No hearings have been held in 
the House of Representatives.
<P>
</ul>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
<ul>
<P><li><b>Separate the specific issue of illegal immigration control from 
the more general issue of immigration quota reform.</b> 
<P>
<P>The legislation pending in Congress should be divided into 
separate bills dealing with each side of the question separately.
<P>
<li><b>Strengthen enforcement measures at the Mexican border and 
other entry points.</b>
<P>
More personnel, physical barriers, and detention facilities 
are needed, as is added enforcement authority to deter the 
smuggling and document fraud involved in illegal immigration. The 
INS 

should increase the scrutiny of applicants for political asylum 
and decide their cases more rapidly. Political asylees should be 
denied work permits until determined to be eligible for legal 
permanent residence. The political debate about immigration policy in 
the United States is inflamed primarily because of the highly 
publicized, inadequate enforcement along the Mexican border. But 
increased border enforcement may only shift the problem to 
other ports of entry. The equally serious problem of illegal 
immigration by aliens who arrive legally as tourists or on business and 
then decide to stay also has to be met with severe penalties. Other 
ports of entry also are heavily burdened by the abuse of political 
asylum by immigrants who have been advised on how to exploit it.
<P>
<li><B>Make illegal immigration a felony. </B>
<P>
<P>There should be brief but mandatory incarceration for the first 
offense after a deportation order has been granted. In addition, 
anyone convicted of illegal immigration should be denied all 
future admission to the United States after deportation, even as a 
tourist or on business. Illegal immigration to the United States is 
attempted because violators see the costs as low and the rewards 
as very attractive.
<P>
<li><B>Repeal employer sanctions. </B>
<P>
<P>Employers should not have to verify the citizenship or 
immigration status of a prospective employee. Instead, criminal 
penalties and deportation, along with an absolute prohibition against 
ever returning to the United States, should be imposed on those 
who break the U.S. immigration laws. The expensive and 
unworkable computer verification system that eventually would require 
all 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->

Americans to carry a national identification card and 
surrender personal privacy should not be started. The enforcement of 
laws against illegal immigration should focus on the law breakers, 
not on the entire American population and millions of innocent 
employers.
<P>
<P>The legitimate concern expressed by many business leaders 
that restrictions on legal immigration will seriously impair their 
ability to hire the people they want and maintain a worldwide labor 
force should be addressed with a uniform system of financial 
reassurance, which also could be used by immigrants who might come 
to the United States to establish new businesses or who seek 
employment without first obtaining a U.S. sponsor. The United 
States does not benefit from numerical quotas for the admission of 
immigrants who would come with the financial assets or skills that 
help guarantee their positive contributions to the national economy, 
to the tax base, and to the middle and upper strata of American 
society. 
<P>
<li><B>Place tough and real financial requirements on 
immigrants and their sponsors to reduce immigrant &quot;gaming&quot; of 
welfare, including a financial bond as security.</B>
<P>
<P>Sponsors of immigrants should be required to demonstrate 
sufficient financial ability to prevent any risk of welfare dependency 
by those who come to the United States. Sponsors' income or 
financial support should be deemed to apply to immigrants' 
income status for the entire term of their legal permanent residence in 
the United States. Posting a bond or purchasing other kinds of 
financial assurance to demonstrate that immigrants will not 
become dependent on welfare, particularly SSI and Medicaid, should 
be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->

made a formal part of the visa approval process. Applicants 
for naturalized citizenship should be required to demonstrate by 
the same means that they will not become dependent on welfare, 
particularly SSI and Medicaid, in future years.
<P>
<P>The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is 
expanding rapidly, and elderly immigrants are a growing proportion of 
the total welfare burden. U.S. immigration policy always has 
included the provision that no one, including the immigrant parents of 
U.S. citizens should be allowed to become a public charge. The 
obligation of a sponsor to guarantee that an immigrant does not become 
a burden to other American taxpayers should be enforced for as 
long as the immigrant is not an American citizen. The opportunity 
to become an American citizen is a privilege extended to the 
legal permanent resident, but it requires the applicant to undertake 
a significant number of duties and obligations. One of these 
obligations should be to prove financial responsibility. A bond or 
insurance policy or other financial indemnity could eliminate the 
attraction of welfare programs to those who might think about 
immigrating to exploit them; it also could recover part of the costs of 
publicly provided welfare and medical benefits if genuine 
misfortune should befall the new citizen or his family.
<P>
<P>Within the framework set by Congress, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service should be authorized to issue immigration 
visas to any person who meets stringent criteria of good character and 
is able to post a substantial bond or provide other financial 
assurance, subject to forfeiture if any welfare dependency should 
occur. Such a bond or other financial assurance could be remitted if 
the immigrant chose to depart permanently from the United States.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->

<P>
<li><B>Require proficiency in the English language for all 
immigrants and naturalized citizens. </B>
<P>
<P>The standard for naturalized citizens should be raised to fluency 
in English. Immigrants who are not initially proficient in the 
language should be required to practice and study English, and 
their progress should be tested periodically.
<P>
<P>The concept of American nationality is inextricably linked 
with English as the national language. Every other nation in the world 
is identified with its language, and immigration, to say nothing 
of citizenship, often is simply prohibited to outsiders. 
Americans founded a unique republican form of government in the 18th 
century, based on ideal principles of human rights and limited 
government, and invited immigrants to come and join the new civil 
society. But in 200 years, America has become more than simply 
a republic. It has become a people, and English is its language. 
This in no way precludes the right of Americans to converse in 
another language; nor should it discourage the media from providing 
services in another language. But in the courts, the public 
schools, and the political system, the language should be English. 
Becoming proficient in the language of America is a price that any 
immigrant should want to pay.
</ul><P><a name="Q&A">
<P><B>Q&amp;A</B>
<P>
<P><b>Q. What is the difference between legal and illegal 
immigration, and how big a problem is the whole immigration issue?
<P>
<P>A.</b> Legal immigration is a big part of the American tradition, 
and even though there is almost as much legal immigration now 
as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->

there was around the turn of the century, it is only a problem if 
you think there are too many new, legal immigrants. Most legal 
immigrants are family members of American families who want 
to sponsor them and bring them here. Family re-unification is a 
good thing. 
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a crime, and we must increase the 
penalties for committing this crime. No other remedy will work.
<P>
<P>People who come into the United States across the Mexican 
or Canadian border, or who come here as students or tourists and 
stay after their visas expire, are criminals. They should be 
tracked down, arrested, and put in jail for at least a year -- then 
deported. They should be forbidden ever to come back to the United 
States, even as tourists or businessmen. 
<P>
<P><b>Q. With generous welfare benefits in this country and 
poverty throughout the rest of the world, don't immigrants come 
to America primarily to go on the dole?
<P>
<P>A.</b> No. Statistics show that working-age immigrants actually 
use welfare benefits and food stamps less than native born 
Americans of working age. The real problem is the immigrant parents of 
U.S. citizens, who get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if they 
are poor. The laws need to be changed so that if they are sponsored 
to come here by their children, who are U.S. citizens, their 
children will be financially responsible. We have to change the SSI law, 
not the immigration law, to do that.
<P>
<P><b>Q. If legal immigrants to the United States are prevented from 
getting welfare, will they not just take jobs away from native 
born 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->

Americans?
<P>
<P>A.</b> The only immigrant welfare problem is caused by 
elderly people who, after their children bring them to America, then go 
on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if they are poor. Their 
children should support them, but they are not going to take any 
jobs away from anyone, because they are already retired.
<P>
<P>Working-age immigrants on average are harder working than 
native born Americans and tend to have a higher labor force 
participation rate than native born Americans.
<P>
<P>Immigrants don't take jobs away from American workers.  In 
addition to the dramatic increase in immigration we have seen in 
the past ten years, we have seen a tremendous increase in new 
jobs and a falling rate of unemployment.
<P>
<P>Everybody who gets a job or keeps a job does so as an 
individual, not as a member of some group. Employers hire individuals 
who can do the work. If an immigrant gets a job, it is because the 
employer has specific job needs that the immigrant is qualified to fill.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Would more Border Patrol officers and security fences 
across the Mexican border solve the problem of illegal immigration?
<P>
<P>A.</b> More Border Patrol officers and security fences are needed, 
and Congress is providing more money to do those things. But 
more than half of the illegal immigration problem comes from 
students and tourist visitors to the United States who simply decide to 
stay after their visas expire, and from people who falsely claim 
political asylum. Border patrols and fences won't keep them out.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->

<P>
<P>The only way to stop illegal immigration is to impose stiffer 
criminal penalties on those who break our immigration laws. We 
need to put them in jail for at least a year after we catch them, and 
deport them after that. And we need to make sure they will 
never again even be able to visit the United States as a tourist or a 
businessman. The word will get out to those violators, and they 
will stop treating the violation of U.S. immigration laws like a game.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Would a national identification card, reinforced with a 
government computer system to verify identification, solve the 
problem of illegal immigration?
<P>
<P>A.</b> A national identification card, with a Big Brother 
computer system in Washington, D.C., would not stop illegal immigrants 
or even stop some employers from hiring them. What it would do 
is deprive all other Americans of some degree of privacy and create 
a monster information database that eventually could be used to 
violate our liberties.
<P>
<P>The law today makes it a crime for employers to hire illegal 
immigrants, but employers are victims, not criminals. We 
shouldn't create a system that punishes the victims and every other 
innocent American worker. Advocates of the giant computer system 
really are trying to increase government regulations on employers 
and create a justification for an army of Labor Department 
inspectors to invade every workplace in America.
<P>
<P><b>Q. How much should the federal government pay to states that 
are forced to carry the costs of illegal immigration?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->

<P>
<P>A.</b> The federal government should be prepared to pay the 
entire costs of illegal immigration. Enforcing the immigration laws is 
a federal responsibility. If the federal government cannot do its 
job, it should pay the costs. The Balanced Budget Act Congress 
passed last year set up a way to pay the states for emergency 
medical treatment for illegal aliens.
<P>
<P>At the same time, the states should have to demonstrate the 
actual costs of illegal immigration. There have been a number of 
so-called studies of the costs of immigration, but none of them 
really proves that there is a significant cost or measures how great it 
may be. We need to get the real data and figure out how much the 
costs are; then the federal government should pay for the problem.
<P>
<P>But the most important things the federal government can do 
to stop illegal immigration are to hire more Border Patrol officers 
and stiffen the criminal penalties for breaking our immigration laws.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Should English be established officially as America's 
language and immigrants be required to read, write, and speak English?
<P>
<P>A.</b> Yes. Proficiency in the English language should be required 
of all immigrants and naturalized citizens. The standard for 
naturalized citizens should be raised to fluency in English. 
Immigrants not initially proficient in the language should be required to 
practice and study English, and their progress should be tested 
periodically.
<P>
<P>English as the national language is central to the concept 
of American nationality. Every other nation in the world is 
closely identified with its language. English is America's language.

<title>Key Changes Needed In the Governors' Medicaid Proposal - Heritage</title>

<h3>KEY CHANGES NEEDED IN THE GOVERNORS' MEDICAID PROPOSAL</h3>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 89<br>
March 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The congressional leadership is drafting comprehensive Medicaid reform legislation based on a recent outline proposal endorsed unanimously by the National Governors Association (NGA). But unless the legislation differs sharply from the governors' outline in some critical details, it will be a disaster rather than a reform, preserving some of the worst features of today's Medicaid program while opening the door to another state-led raid on the U.S. Treasury. To avoid this, the legislation must make two crucial changes in the governors' plan: It must limit the categories of Americans guaranteed benefits and, even more important, must not include an open-ended state entitlement to "umbrella" funds.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The outline preamble calls explicitly for an end to the entitlement status of Medicaid and for the establishment of a block grant system of financing. But a close reading of the fine print in the governors' plan shows that the reverse is true. The plan actually sets out a federally defined list of guaranteed benefits for a large "guaranteed population" that would have an entitlement to these benefits. Moreover, the plan does not simply transform Medicaid into a block grant program, with a specific determination of the maximum amount of federal funds each state will receive (at a higher percentage than is typical today); that capitated amount will be only part of the funds flowing to states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The plan also contains an "umbrella insurance" provision to provide guaranteed additional money to states in the event of unanticipated growth in the eligible population. It states explicitly that "[t]hese funds are an entitlement to states and are not subject to annual appropriations" by Congress. Thus, state officials, who have shown themselves adept in the past at squeezing huge amounts of federal money out of the fine print of federal Medicaid law, would have unencumbered power to raid the federal treasury. Even the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which strongly opposes devolution of control to the states, warns that the umbrella mechanism "may create incentives for states to 'game' the system and consequently may result in substantial, unintended federal cost."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Keeping the Status Quo.</b> As drafted, the governors' outline retains a comprehensive list of government benefits for Medicaid's "guaranteed" populations.<sup>2</sup>  The groups eligible for this entitlement include: 
<p><ul>
<li> Pregnant women, to 133 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Children to age 6, to 133 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Children ages 6 through 12, to 100 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Elderly who meet Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and resource standards; and
<p>
<li> Persons with disabilities as defined by the state in their state plan. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of the 33.4 million Medicaid recipients in 1993, pregnant women and children living on income up to 133 percent of the government's official poverty level accounted for 71 percent, or 23.7 million, of the eligible population. Generally, these recipients also get cash assistance under other major welfare programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supple- mental Security Income (SSI). By mandating states to continue coverage for these individuals, as well as those falling into the two other major categories (elderly and disabled), the governors simply retain the mandatory entitlement features of Medicaid for the vast majority of existing beneficiaries -- features that have contributed to the explosive financial pressures on the Medicaid system. Given the uncapped status of the insurance umbrella, the governors' plan is not an elimination, nor even a significant scaling back, of the current and costly entitlement feature of Medicaid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In maintaining a federal definition of which individuals will be guaranteed benefits, the governors seem also to have tied their own hands in reforming their own welfare programs. Since most welfare recipients are categorically entitled to Medicaid benefits, there would remain little incentive for individuals to seek employment with generally more limited insurance through the private sector. Worse, the governors will have neither true flexibility in administering Medicaid nor the ultimate authority in determining how best to provide quality care for their resident poor. It is to help meet the anticipated costs of maintaining federal eligibility and benefits requirements that the governors included an insurance umbrella provision, which will help them shift costs back to the federal taxpayers. That also is the flaw from the federal taxpayer's point of view.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Deficit Dangers.</b> The governors know that the current level of spending growth in Medicaid is unsustainable. While few consider the governors' proposal a step toward fiscal responsibility, the insurance umbrella described in their outline almost certainly would add to the federal deficit. The purpose of the umbrella is understandable: to protect individual states from unanticpated costs due to changes in the growth of their eligible populations. But it is crafted as an uncapped, open-ended entitlement "reserve" fund upon which the states can draw in emergencies, and the outline contains no measures to control federal spending once the provision is triggered. This directly contradicts both the principle and goal of a federal block grant program, and it would allow creative accountants in state government free rein to manipulate eligibility requirements and service levels to shift as much of their costs as possible to categories of people who would qualify for umbrella funds. Past experience with Medicaid shows that they would do so.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Rules and Mandates.</b> The nation's governors rightly criticize the red tape of Medicaid mandates with which states must comply in order to get federal matching funds. Moreover, these congressionally imposed requirements hamper state governments' ability to design and implement cost-efficient programs that target medically needy persons. Ironically, the governors' proposal still includes federally defined mandates; even though states would be given much more flexibility, these federally mandated eligibility and benefit requirements would supersede their own authority to decide how best to care for their poor residents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The costs associated with federal mandates have not gone unnoticed by this Congress, which has sought to tackle the growing financial burden of an unreformed Medicaid program (an effort vetoed by President Clinton). While the overall cost of the program is rising rapidly, the federal share alone is projected to reach approximately $100 billion in FY 1996. Similarly, states are dedicating a growing percentage of their budgets to providing their residents access to health services. According to an analysis prepared for The Heritage Foundation, if no reforms in the Medicaid program are enacted, the states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money between 1995 and 2002 just to maintain the system as it is today.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW TO FIX THE GOVERNORS' PLAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the governors' proposal calls for much-needed flexibility and a long-overdue block grant approach to financing Medicaid, the NGA's plan itself would not pare back the entitlement feature of Medicaid sufficiently, and the umbrella feature, as currently designed, almost certainly would lead to an uncontrolled hemorrhaging of federal funds. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the governors' plan is to be turned into legislation that actually reforms Medicaid and introduces sensible spending control at the federal level, two crucial changes are necessary. Without them, the plan should be unacceptable to lawmakers seeking a reform of the costly open-ended entitlement status of today's program. These two essential changes are:
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The guaranteed populations and benefits -- the entitlement -- should be sharply limited, and focused on politically weak groups traditionally ignored by the states, such as the homeless and those with severe mental illness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The umbrella should be a budgeted fund appropriated each year, not an entitlement to states. States do need protection from unanticipated changes that would make them vulnerable under a strict block grant, but this should be in the form of a fund voted on each year and distributed according to a formula devised by Congress to meet specific problems. It should not be a blank check to states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If Congress is to enact a federal balanced budget over the next seven years, then Medicaid, like other federal programs, will require more, not less, fiscal discipline. In reforming Medicaid, lawmakers must make sure that the precise legislative language does not create a legal loophole for state officials who have acquired expertise in "gaming" the Medicaid program at the expense of federal taxpayers.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much of the debate between 
Congress and the President on reforming Medicaid, the health care program 
serving the nation's poor, has transpired without adequate attention paid to the 
effect of the program on state finances. If significant reforms in Medicaid are 
not enacted, states will face a heavy increase in spending and a rise in the 
proportion of their projected revenues that must be dedicated to the program. 
And because the rate of growth in state Medicaid spending will exceed the 
rate for total state spending, the states will be forced either to increase taxes or 
to divert money from other programs, such as education and crime control.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Medicaid is a state-administered 
program that operates under federal guidelines. Federal and state governments 
jointly fund the program. Federal reimbursement to the states is based on a 
statutory formula designed to give a higher matching rate to states with lower 
per capita incomes. Matching rates for these services range from 50 percent to 
83 percent and are adjusted annually.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The cost of Medicaid to the federal 
government has been growing at double-digit rates in recent years. The 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that annual federal Medicaid 
costs will almost double by 2002.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the financial impact on the 
federal government of generally unrestrained Medicaid growth is alarming 
enough, the future impact on states could be even more severe:  a remorseless 
growth in the share of their own projected revenues going to Medicaid that 
forces them either to raise taxes in order to maintain spending for other 
programs or to reduce state expenditures for non-Medicaid programs. States 
can make some cost-saving reforms in the program, but only subject to federal 
rules requiring that certain levels of coverage (entitlements) be provided to 
certain populations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To examine the probable future 
budget impact on states, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the likely trend of 
total Medicaid spending using certain assumptions to forecast the state share 
of Medicaid payments for the period 1995 through 2002.<sup> 2</sup>  This 
analysis resulted in two sets of findings:  first, the additional costs to the states 
if no changes are made in the Medicaid program and, second, the additional 
costs stemming from President Clinton's proposed "per capita cap" reforms in 
Medicaid. Hence, the following charts and tables project the future state-level 
Medicaid burden if Congress either does nothing or adopts the President's 
proposal. These projections of state spending incorporate expected changes in 
state economic activity, in the size of the eligible population, and in the trend 
of federal Medicaid transfers to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These forecasts of future state 
Medicaid spending were prepared jointly by Heritage and Wharton 
Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA), a nationally recognized 
economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. For 
47 states, WEFA found a significant relationship between changes in 
historical Medicaid spending and fluctuations in the states' economic activity 
and Medicaid-eligible populations. In four cases, however, the relationship 
was sufficiently weak that WEFA simply projected the historical trend in 
spending; these states are North Dakota, South Carolina, Utah, and Wyoming. 
<a href="cb22t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows the additional state revenues or program cuts needed if the 
states are to meet their projected Medicaid expenditures.
<p>
<b>Estimated Additional Costs Without Reform</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Between 1995 and 2002, if no 
reforms are enacted that address the costs of entitlements and the composition 
of covered groups, states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money 
on Medicaid. Total state spending over this period is projected to be $1,700 
billion, of which $1,011 billion will be supplied by the federal government (if 
CBO's forecasts of federal spending prove correct). The difference between 
federal and state spending on Medicaid means that states will have to devote 
an average of 8 percent of their non-federal revenues to the program. Among 
the hardest hit states, Pennsylvania will have to devote 17 percent of its 
revenues to the health care program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As <a href="cb22c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the amount of 
state Medicaid payments alone steadily increases between 1995 and 2002. In 
1990, the states spent just $32 billion of their non-federal funds on Medicaid. 
These unfunded payments are projected by our analysis to grow to $69 billion 
by 1995 and $104 billion by 2002. In other words, the Medicaid amount paid 
by the states will have increased by 225 percent over the 12-year period 
between 1990 and 2002. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some individual states will be 
particularly hard hit. For example, California will need to raise $18 billion in 
new revenues or in budget cuts to pay its part of Medicaid growth between 
1996 and 2002. Similarly, New York will need to raise $17.3 billion; Florida, 
$12.9 billion; Pennsylvania, $11.6 billion; and Texas, $7.2 billion. If these 
states choose to raise taxes to meet their Medicaid obligations, then California 
will have to increase the average taxpayer's bill by $246 per year; New York, 
by $370; Florida, by $374; Pennsylvania, by $362; and Texas, by $177.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This rapid growth in the states' 
Medicaid share is reflected in the annual percentage change in state-level 
Medicaid spending as compared with total state spending, which includes 
support of such things as education, crime control, and transportation 
infrastructure (see <a href="cb22c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). The Heritage analysis anticipates 1995 state 
Medicaid spending to grow at a rate of 7.5 percent, while total state spending 
should grow at a 6.4 percent rate. This higher rate of change for Medicaid 
means that states either must raise taxes or must take funds away from other 
state programs. The forecast suggests that state spending on Medicaid will 
continue to keep pace with total spending. Over the forecast period (1995-
2002), Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an 8.4 percent rate, while 
total state expenditures are expected to grow by an average of 5.8 percent.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Effects of the "Blue Dog" Democrat Plan</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Democratic "Blue Dog" plan to 
reform the federal Medicaid program, the principal elements of which have 
been advanced by the Clinton Administration in its seven-year budget 
proposal, would increase the federal fiscal burden on the states by an 
estimated $47.4 billion over the next seven years. This new fiscal burden has 
been described as "one of the biggest and most expensive unfunded [federal] 
mandates ever"<sup> 3</sup> and, over the seven-year period 1996-2002, 
would amount to $4.4 billion in California, $3.7 billion in Florida, $3.4 billion 
in New York, $3.2 billion in Pennsylvania, and over $2.9 billion in Texas. 
Overall, this unfunded federal mandate would exceed $1 billion in 16 states. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First proposed by a group of 
Democratic House members earlier this year,<sup>4 </sup> this plan would 
further challenge the fiscal resources of the states by maintaining all the 
existing program mandates which the federal government imposes on the 
states<sup> 5</sup> while simultaneously reducing the federal government's 
contribution through the mechanism of a "per capita cap" on the federal share 
of the program. Under the "Blue Dog" plan, the per capita cap limits the 
amount of federal medical assistance that states would receive for each 
Medicaid recipient. Any expenses that exceed this limit would be the sole 
responsibility of state and local taxpayers. Because the full array of federal 
Medicaid mandates would remain in effect, states would not be able to offer 
innovative, and less expensive, health care options to Medicaid recipients. 
Overall, the per capita cap would shift an estimated $47.4 billion of mandated 
Medicaid spending from the federal to state governments over the next seven 
years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States would probably respond to 
this shift in one of three ways:  1) enact dramatic tax increases; 2) reduce state 
spending on education, infrastructure, law enforcement, and other important 
state functions; or 3) some combination of the above. Indeed, the proliferation 
of Medicaid mandates during the late 1980s and early 1990s has already 
forced the states to reallocate their resources to Medicaid. According to the 
National Association of State Budget Officers, Medicaid spending has 
doubled from approximately 10 percent to 20 percent as a share of overall 
state spending since 1987.<sup> 6</sup>
<p>

<b>Technical Assumptions</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Heritage Foundation and 
Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates used state models of economic 
activity to develop state-by-state estimates of Medicaid spending and the 
additional funds states would need to meet their future Medicaid obligations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Our baseline estimates assume no 
change in current Medicaid eligibility rules and allowed federal Medicaid 
transfers to the states to grow at the rates implied by the history of this 
program. Total Medicaid program spending in each state is a function of the 
state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and 
economic change. We used this as the basic structure for future Medicaid 
spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These baseline forecasts of state 
Medicaid spending were adjusted upwards by Heritage to reflect the higher 
federal expenditures on Medicaid projected by the Congressional Budget 
Office. The difference between our initial baseline for total (federal and state) 
spending and the CBO adjusted estimates is $58 billion over the period 1996 
to 2002. We distributed the state portion of this additional amount by each 
state's annual percentage of total national Medicaid spending for each of the 
seven forecast years following 1995. Estimates of additional taxes that would 
be raised to meet each state's additional funding requirement were calculated 
by dividing the additional funding requirement by the estimated number of 
taxable individual federal income tax returns in 1995.

<h3>UPDATED ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS TO THE STATES OF NOT REFORMING MEDICAID AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF ADOPTING PER CAPITA CAPS</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 81<br>
December 18, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

The Congressional Budget Office revised its seven-year projections of federal Medicaid outlays on December 12, 1995. CBO made these revisions in order to reflect how the effect of lower forecasted inflation will reduce the federal government's Medicaid obligations. These lower inflation numbers also reduce the additional revenues the states must find over the next seven years (1996 through 2002) in order to meet their Medicaid obligations. The accompanying <a href="fyi81.gif">table</a> shows The Heritage Foundation's revised estimates of these additional state Medicaid obligations.<sup>1</sup><p>
1) If no changes are made to current law, the states and the District of Columbia probably will need to raise taxes or cut other spending by $146 billion over seven years in order to meet their mandated obligations. This estimate is $27.8 billion less than the earlier Heritage estimate of $174.2 billion.
<p>
2) If the Congress and the Administration adopt the "per capita cap" proposal advanced by a group of moderate Democrats, the preliminary Heritage analysis indicates that states may need to raise an additional $47.4 billion in new revenues or spending cuts on top of the $146 billion increase. 
<p>
3) The total cost to the states of the current law plus "reforms" made on a per capita cap basis is likely to be $193.8 billion.
<p>
The projections of additional state obligations under current law were prepared jointly by Heritage and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, a nationally known economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. In these state-by-state Medicaid models, total Medicaid program spending is a function of that state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and economic change. The baseline models were then adjusted to reflect CBO's forecasts of federal Medicaid outlays. Heritage's estimates of additional per capita cap costs are preliminary results of adaptations made to the baseline state models.

<h3>GETTING THE FEDERAL BUDGET PROCESS BACK ON TRACK</h3>

By Ronald D. Utt, Ph.D.<br>
Visiting Fellow<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1073<br>
March 18, 1996<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the congressional budget process is notorious for missed deadlines, this fiscal year's effort to craft a budget for the federal government has set records for delay. At a time when both Congress and the President should be well along in developing a budget for FY 1997, they have yet to agree on spending for FY 1996. Nearly halfway through the current fiscal year, in other words, Congress and the White House must try to complete two budgets in a time frame that has proved inadequate for one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last year, the congressional budget process, with its complicated procedures, proved to be woefully ineffective in securing enactment of the ambitious agenda of the 104th Congress. But it did prove to be a highly effective weapon in the hands of a President determined to protect the status quo. Observers and participants concede a first-round victory to President Clinton, who has attempted to postpone the second round by arguing, along with some of his allies in Congress, that a national debate on last year's budget issues should be deferred until the upcoming presidential campaign, which should serve as a referendum on Congress's agenda.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should ignore this suggestion that it relinquish its constitutionally mandated fiscal responsibilities. Instead, it should rejoin the budget struggle with a strategy that takes advantage of the impressive legislative accomplishments of the first session and the original intentions of the congressional budget process. This means focusing more intensely on timely completion of the appropriations and authorization process, and any necessary enabling legislation, as the primary mechanisms for crafting and enacting the budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By doing this, Congress could divide its far-reaching agenda into functional components, debating each issue on its individual merits rather than as part of a larger package in which important reform issues are lost in controversy over out-year deficit targets. This approach also would allow Members to separate components of the budget that are controversial from those that are not, thereby limiting the President's ability to hold government hostage to his own political agenda. In addition, recognizing that Congress must complete both the FY 1996 and FY 1997 budgets in a very limited period of time, Congress should adopt a biennial budget that embodies the key reforms developed during the last session. 

<p>
<b>A SIX-POINT PLAN FOR BUDGET VICTORY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following six point strategy would allow Congress both to adopt two-year budgets and to enact its reform agenda in the limited time available.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1.) </b>Adopt a biennial budget strategy during this session. This would allow Congress to complete both the FY 1996 and FY 1997 budgets, meet dual spending targets in those authorization and appropriation bills either vetoed or not yet signed by the President, and pass the legislation needed to change entitlements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2.)</b> Place greater reliance on individual authorization and appropriations bills and other necessary legislation, completed on schedule, as the primary vehicles for fiscal and legislative reform. This contrasts with the current strategy of depending on continuing resolutions or omnibus reconciliation bills. By constructing a budget using authorization and appropriation bills, and if necessary segmenting the 13 individual appropriations bills into an even greater number of functional accounts, Congress would focus the debate more sharply on the profound policy differences involved and prevent the President from using these disagreements to block reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>3.)</b> Build upon last year's considerable legislative accomplishments in such areas as welfare, Medicare and Medicaid reform, and discretionary programs. Last year, Congress enacted major reforms in several policy areas to improve the operation of federal programs. When folded together in giant budget bills, these accomplishments were blocked by President Clinton. These same bills should be split into separate bills. Along with existing but unsigned appropriations bills and related legislation, they should be amended to extend spending authority and program changes over a second year and sent separately to the President.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>4.)</b> Use the breathing room available under this budget strategy to remedy deficiencies in budget-related House and Senate bills either now being considered or already passed but not signed into law. Congress should use the current impasse as a second chance to reconsider its performance in such areas as transportation, housing, privatization, and devolution -- areas in which last year's authorization and appropriation bills often fell short of promised reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>5.)</b> Lawmakers must keep focusing on why they were elected -- to cut the budget and reform government. Talk of "CBO scoring" for "front-loaded glide paths," "growth from baseline," and "reconciliation" is the language of staff, not leadership. Americans want the budget cut because they know their hard-earned money is financing waste, redundancy, and obsolescence.  Lawmakers must take every opportunity to explain their programs and accomplishments in the same vivid terms that convinced voters to entrust them with the job.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>6.)</b> Adopt an appropriate division of labor within the leadership. This is needed to ensure that individual committee work products are timely and conform to overall congressional objectives. It is needed also to make sure that leadership is not so thinly spread over every issue. 
<p>
<b>The Need to be Better Prepared</b>
<p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Heady with success from passing key elements in the <a href="http://www.berkeleyic.com:80/conservative/contract.html">Contract With America</a> and adopting a balanced budget while fundamentally reforming welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare, Congress was caught unprepared by the President's veto strategy to defend the status quo. Congress relied too heavily on an omnibus reconciliation process and on comprehensive continuing resolutions as substitutes for a set of separate authorization and appropriations bills. Congress presented the President with an all-or nothing package covering so many significant issues that it was devoid of meaningful policy content. The President accepted the challenge by holding the government hostage, thereby allowing the news media to reduce the debate to sound-bite-friendly statements about Yellowstone sleigh rides and tickets to the Statue of Liberty. Lost was any serious discussion of the need to restore the viability of Medicare, reform the destructive welfare system, and boost the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The three-time failure to achieve success with the all-or-nothing strategy has left many in Congress demoralized and confused, with lawmakers assuming they can achieve little this year. But this need not be the case. A different approach to budget process could allow Congress to turn its impressive collection of legislative initiatives last year into law this year.
<p>
<b>Building on Last Year's Accomplishments</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The key to restarting the process is to recognize that the first session of the 104th Congress was remarkably successful in passing legislation that would fundamentally reform many of the government's most troubled programs. After decades of empty promises, it was this Congress that finally confronted the welfare and Medicaid mess, passed the necessary legislative remedies, and sent them to the President. Similarly, the financially collapsing Medicare program was overhauled to give seniors far more choices than any previous Congress or President had even considered. These reforms did not become law. The only reason: because President Clinton refused to sign them. Likewise, in many of the discretionary accounts, scores of wasteful and obsolete programs were terminated or cut back substantially, and some of these terminations were signed into law by the President.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This agenda should be pursued aggressively during the second session of the 104th Congress in a debate which sets out clearly the choices that must be made -- a focus lacking during the latter part of 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To do this, Congress should move immediately to construct a biennial budget resolution for the combined 1996 and 1997 fiscal years, using last year's resolution as the base and including whatever corrections might be needed to reflect spending, taxing, and economic patterns already underway. With this accomplished, Congress should move swiftly to complete the drafting (mostly by refining earlier bills) and passage of the authorization and appropriation bills and other legislation needed to turn the hundreds of decisions embodied in the budget resolution into law. Most of these authorization and appropriations bills, like the budget resolution, should cover at least two years.
<P>
<b>Speed Up the Process</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should stop using omnibus reconciliation bills and continuing resolutions as its primary vehicles in advancing fiscal and policy objectives. Instead, as intended by the Budget Act, it should rely on the timely completion of authorization and appropriations bills and other necessary legislation to implement spending decisions contained in the budget resolution. Under the Budget Act (as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990), the House Appropriations Committee must report out all of its bills by June 10, and the House must complete action on them by June 30. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Last year, however, the House passed only two of 13 appropriations bills by the June 30 deadline. Eight more were passed in July, and the remainder in August and September. Similar delays occurred in the Senate, and the first appropriations bill was not sent to the President until eight days before the start of the new fiscal year. By the time the new fiscal year had begun, only two appropriations bills had been cleared for the President's signature. Legislation to reform major entitlements also was not completed until after the fiscal year began.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When passage of spending bills is delayed until after the start of the fiscal year, the need to avoid a government shutdown forces Congress to rely on a single omnibus reconciliation bill or comprehensive continuing resolution to enact its agenda. This, in turn, allows the President to hold the entire government hostage to his own plans and avoid an open debate on the issues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the recent past, the reconciliation process and related legislation often were used as a substitute for the appropriations process, partly because it is easier to deal with a single omnibus bill than with 13 or more separate pieces of legislation. While this approach may work when Congress and the President are in general agreement on key issues, however, the process tends to exacerbate differences when they are not. Reliance on premature reconciliation bills also is a factor in keeping Congress from completing action on appropriations bills in advance of the relevant fiscal year, forcing it to pass continuing resolutions or some other form of omnibus legislation to keep government open while budgets await approval. Indeed, persistent delay in getting these bills completed before the start of the fiscal year was one of the many reasons Congress passed the Budget Control and Impoundment Act of 1974.
<P>
<b>Rely on the Appropriations and Authorization Process, As Improved and Intended</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By avoiding omnibus reconciliation bills and ambitious continuing resolutions, Congress places the burden of fiscal responsibility where it was intended to be placed and where it resided for nearly two centuries before enactment of the 1974 Budget Act:<sup>2</sup>  on the authorization and appropriations process. By relying on the timely completion of appropriations bills and necessary legislation within the schedule mandated by the Budget Act and avoiding dependence on a single bill to effect substantive policy and fiscal changes, Congress would follow more closely the original intent of the Act.3  But, as noted above, such bills seldom have been completed and signed into law by the start of the fiscal year. With just a month to go before reaching the mid-point of FY 1996, only eight of the 13 bills have been signed by the President, and the one covering the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services has not even been completed, thanks to a threatened Senate filibuster.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House and Senate leadership promise that this year's appropriation committee performance will be swift and timely. Such promises have been made at the start of every session in living memory, but with little result. This year, they actually could mean something. Paradoxically, one reason for optimism is that with so few of last year's appropriations bills and related legislation signed into law, subcommittees of the appropriations and authorizing committees need only rewrite and edit the bills that already have been completed, adding an additional year of spending so that they cover two years instead of just one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To accelerate the process, out-year spending projections in the FY 1996 budget resolution could serve as a preliminary basis for the FY 1997 portions of the appropriations bills until the new FY 1996/FY 1997 budget resolution is passed on or before the April 15 deadline. This process also would include all of the authorization bills and companion legislation needed to accomplish fundamental reform of the entitlement programs. The bills covering Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform are just as necessary and as valid today as they were last year when rejected by the President as parts of a single omnibus bill or as separate pieces of legislation. They should be separated into individual bills, then modified as appropriate and resubmitted to the President in a process designed to draw clear distinctions between Congress's reforms and the President's embrace of the status quo.
<p>
<b>Conduct a National Debate on Separate Issues</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The main advantage of swiftly following the budget resolution with separate authorization and appropriations bills and legislation to alter entitlements is that Congress and the President then could conduct a clear debate in each policy area. When everything is lumped into a reconciliation bill or continuing resolution, issues of fundamental change, and the reasons for them, get lost in an angry debate over lines on a chart and out-year deficits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By separating the budget into 13 or more appropriations bills and any number of other bills needed to reform program operations, Congress can engage the President directly in a debate over differences in policy on a program-by-program basis and challenge the President more effectively in his defense of the status quo. Instead of creating an environment where the President can talk about hungry children while rejecting a reform of Medicare, separating bills into their functional components would permit Congress to compare what it wants to achieve through welfare reform with existing inner-city squalor in federally funded public housing projects. Further, separating bills in this way would allow lawmakers to talk about the reforms themselves, rather than about back-loaded baselines and seven-year CBO projections. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 This strategy would allow lawmakers to draw vivid and clear distinctions between abuses that exist and the reforms they know the nation both wants and needs. The successful strategy used in the House last January to pass comprehensive regulatory reform can serve as a model to involve the public in a debate that otherwise might become obtuse and technical. Medicare, Medicaid, federal job training programs, deplorable conditions in public housing projects, and obsolete agencies are just some of the costly targets of opportunity that should be brought to the attention of a public still eager for reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 In implementing this strategy, there is no reason why Congress has to limit itself to its traditional 13 appropriations bills. Without challenging any committee's current jurisdiction, appropriations bills could be subdivided more finely into functional areas that lead to clearer debates on policy differences, at the same time denying the President and a minority in Congress the opportunity to hold one program hostage to another. For example, the National Park Service, the Naval Petroleum Reserves, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, and any other programs likely to trigger intense debate could be brought forward as separate bills rather than as subsections of a single "Department of Interior and Related Agencies" bill. Likewise, the single appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, and State could be sliced easily into three or more components, while separate bills covering each of the major entitlement reform initiatives could be brought forward and debated on their merits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Added to this agenda should be similarly comprehensive reform legislation for areas of government which last year were not subject to nearly the degree of reform that many of the social welfare programs and independent agencies experienced, leaving the majority in Congress vulnerable to charges, for example, of ignoring costly "corporate welfare" programs. Only limited changes were imposed on the troubled public housing industry or on the transportation, public power, and agriculture interests, to name just a few. These costly deficiencies should be remedied during the second session and within the combined FY 1996/FY 1997 resolution and related authorization/appropriations process.
<p>
<b>Managing the Process</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By promising to complete the appropriations/authorization process in a timely fashion, Congress has set for itself an ambitious goal -- one it has failed to fulfill during much of the recent past, including the last session of Congress when so much was at stake. Is Congress up to the task of performing this well?  It may be able to do so, but only if changes also are made in the management of the budget process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Specifically, the House and Senate leadership should stick with issues more appropriate to leaders and leave the complicated technical details to others. By defining duties and responsibilities more clearly, the leadership could take full advantage of the efficiencies that arise from an effective division of labor by organizing members into issue teams, drawn from the relevant committees, and assigning to these teams the responsibility of advancing each of the key policies. These teams would focus on such cross-cutting issues as welfare reform or the termination of wasteful programs, championing them in debate on behalf of the majority. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, because it has yet to complete its work on many of the appropriations bills and most of the entitlement reforms for the FY 1996 budget, Congress also will need to produce and defend a series of interim continuing resolutions to keep government operating, at the same time advancing whatever incremental reforms can be brought along for the ride. Perhaps another task force, drawn from the leadership and the budget, tax, and appropriations committees, could be formed to fulfill this duty while the leadership and key committee chairmen develop and implement a comprehensive biennial budget with promised reforms.

<CITE>By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> </CITE></CENTER>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, he promised America  a different way
of doing business in Washington. He promised  an end to gridlock, saying that
now there would be a President  willing to work closely with Congress to deal
with the problems that  afflict the nation. He promised fiscal integrity in
Washington and  a reduction in taxes on overburdened working families. He 
promised to reinvent the federal government. And he promised to &quot;end 
welfare as we know it.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>He has done none of these things. Worse still, when a  Congress was elected
in 1994 prepared to send Clinton the  legislation needed to do the things he had
promised, he did not cooperate  with Capitol Hill to fashion a reasonable
compromise. Instead,  he worked actively against passage of the legislation and
then  vetoed most of the key bills he was sent. The result: the very gridlock 
he promised to end. The main reason for this impasse is that  while Congress
generally has been prepared to face up to the tough  decisions that must be made
to balance the budget, reform  entitlements, and restructure failing programs,
Bill Clinton has failed  to confront the constituencies that oppose change.
Moreover, he  has failed to exercise leadership by using his presidency to 
force Americans to recognize that hard decisions have to be made.  As veteran
journalist Robert Samuelson put it early in 1996:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     President Clinton no longer has a coherent agenda, if he 
ever did. Mainly, he favors everything that might make people  feel good and
opposes anything that might make them feel  bad. He (reluctantly) supports a
balanced budget while  denouncing congressional cuts in popular programs like
Medicare,  Medicaid and food stamps. Clinton exploits these issues  without
illuminating the practical choices government  faces. <TT><B><A

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Much like the citizens of many other Western  democracies, Americans have a
habit of trying to avoid major decisions  about the scope and finances of their
government until they cannot  escape such choices. The actions required then
typically are far  more extreme than would have been needed had prudent steps
had  been taken earlier. America today faces a number of issues on  which
well-conceived and decisive action now will avoid  panic-driven and drastic
action some years in the future. Correcting the  structural financial imbalance
in the Medicare program now, for  instance, can avoid collapse early in the next
decade. Action now,  in other words, will forestall the severe cutbacks or huge
tax  increases that will be needed to provide health coverage for  today's baby
boomers when they retire. Similarly, unless Congress and  the states tackle the
spiraling growth in illegitimacy within the  context of true welfare reform,
America is headed for a social  catastrophe. And taking steps now to reform
America's inefficient and  costly tax system will give the American economy the
incentive it  needs to boost entrepreneurship, productivity, and wages so that 
Americans are not scrambling in the next century to catch up with  other
nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, Congress was prepared to tackle these and similar  issues of
enormous consequence to the future of the country. But  time 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  and again, the new leadership was
thwarted, and  fundamental choices over policy were grossly caricatured by
opponents as  being &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot; children, or the
elderly, or even  allowing visits to the Grand Canyon. The 1996 election is
likely to be  the only opportunity for some years to force a real national 
discussion over the historic challenges facing the nation, and so to resolve 
the impasse in Washington. Conservative candidates must seize  the opportunity
to debate the real choices for dealing with these  challenges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are several particularly important domestic issues for  conservatives
to frame in the 1996 election. Among them:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><UL>
<li>     <B>Washington must balance its budget through real reductions
 in spending and reforms in the way government functions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Politicians in Washington promise to balance the budget  with about the same
eagerness as they pause to shake hands or kiss  babies. But only rarely are they
willing to take the serious  action needed to eliminate red ink. Congresses in
the past invariably  have passed budgets that use creative accounting to reach
balance  well into the future, but then have failed to make the changes in 
programs needed to achieve balance. On many such occasions,  Congresses have
combined phony spending controls with real  increases in taxes. But rather than
reach balance, the new tax  revenue merely reduced the political enthusiasm in
Washington  for making tough decisions on spending. This is why huge tax 
increases enacted under George Bush and Bill Clinton have  done virtually
nothing to bring the deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress elected in 1994 sought to break this pattern by  proposing a budget that would reach
balance within seven years  while repealing about one-third of the Bush-Clinton
tax increases.  Unlike most Washington budgets, this one focused much more on 
real changes in programs, much less on gimmicks. Thus, the  budget legislation
passed by Congress in 1995 included structural  changes in Medicare, Medicaid,
and welfare, as well as the termination  of programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed that legislation. Before and after that  budget
reached his desk, Clinton spent month after month  finding ways to avoid
offering a budget that would achieve the fiscal  responsibility he promised
during his election campaign.  Clinton's first set of budgets simply did not
even balance, and put off  policy decisions to achieve even modest spending
controls until into  the next century. As 1995 ended, the President seemed
content to  have no budget rather upset any constituency.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the 1996 election, conservatives must make the case that  the budget must
be balanced and that it can be balanced only by  reducing the growth in
spending, not by raising taxes.  Conservatives also must make the argument that
the way to reduce the growth  of spending is not to squeeze good and bad
programs alike, but  by such actions as making tough changes in entitlements and
 terminating obsolete and inefficient programs and departments,  shifting
functions to the private sector that should not be in the public  sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>There must be structural changes in Medicare if the
program is  to exist for the next generation of retirees.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most noticeable, and disturbing, trends in  federal 
spending in recent decades has
been the shift to entitlement  spending. According to the 1994 report of the
Bipartisan Commission  on Entitlement and Tax Reform, entitlement spending has 
consumed an increasing share of total federal spending, rising from 22.7 
percent of all spending in FY 1963 to over 47 percent in FY  1993. This means
that almost half of all federal spending is on  &quot;autopilot,&quot; driven by
statutory rights to certain services rather than  by budgets voted on each year.
Worse still, the largest  entitlements, including Medicare and Social Security,
are hopelessly out of  balance over the long haul. In particular, spending on
Medicare  is rising at such a clip that the program simply will have no money 
to pay any hospital benefits within six years. Already it is so out  of balance
that it is adding tens of billions of dollars each year to  the general budget
deficit, and this drain on the budget is projected  to rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress elected in 1994 was the first since the major  entitlements
were created to address the runaway growth of  entitlements and to restructure
the programs to achieve better value for  money. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995
contained historic reforms  of several entitlements. It ended the entitlement to
welfare  and shifted the design and operation of welfare to the states. It 
ended the entitlement to Medicaid, again moving control of the  program to the
states. And it restructured the Medicare program, curbing  its rate of growth
and increasing competition and consumer choice  to improve efficiency and
achieve savings.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clinton vetoed that legislation. According to the White House,  no decisive
action was necessary, and taking serious action  would hurt people. On Medicare,
the White House response was  merely to predict that Medicare growth would slow
down and to  offer tighter price controls on doctors and hospitals -- and to  denounce Congress's efforts as draconian and
anti-elderly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the election, conservative candidates need to point out that  most of
today's working-age voters will find literally nothing  in Medicare's hospital
trust fund with which to pay their  medical bills when they retire. So there is
a clear choice open to voters,  and candidates must press the public to make it:
Either voters can  send the message to Washington that they want to avoid doing 
anything, and let benefits be cut deeply and taxes raised sharply  sometime in
the future, or they can tell Washington they want  prudent steps taken now to
restore the finances of the system.  Candidates also must persuade voters to
face the fact that other  middle-class entitlements cannot be allowed to grow
unchecked if the  programs are to pay promised benefits to America's children
when  they reach retirement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>There must be an end to welfare as we know it and a
national  strategy to reduce illegitimacy.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America has spent over $5 trillion in today's dollars fighting the War on Poverty -- more than on defeating Germany and Japan  in World War II. But as every
taxpayer and welfare mother  knows, the War on Poverty has been a ghastly
failure. Not only has  the poverty rate, for many years, shown no sign of
falling  significantly, but -- even more ominous -- the rate of illegitimacy  has
risen remorselessly. In the black community, two out of  every three children
today are born out of wedlock, and for the  general population one-third of
babies are born to mothers with no  husband. Studies show clearly that being
brought up in a  female-headed household is potentially very damaging to a
child.  Even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  liberals no longer dispute the
findings. Such things as high  levels of teenage crime, poor school performance,
and low future  earnings can be traced to the lack of a father in the home.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress agreed with President Clinton that welfare  as we know it
had to be ended and that urgent action was needed  to curb the dramatic rise in
illegitimacy. So Congress passed  legislation that would have begun the
transformation of welfare,  ending the entitlement nature of many federal
benefits, allowing the  states to make major changes in the design of programs,
and laying  down modest goals on work and illegitimacy for the states to 
achieve. But rather than sign the legislation, Clinton first criticized and 
then denounced it. His own proposal: limited authority to states,  a larger
welfare bureaucracy to &quot;help&quot; people to leave welfare  rather than
strong incentives to do so, and no real action to back up  the talk about
stemming the tide of illegitimacy. Virtually any effort  to discourage
illegitimate births was attacked by Clinton as  tantamount to child abuse.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The utter failure of the liberal welfare state, including the  explosion of
illegitimacy, is shredding America's social fabric. In  the 1996 election,
conservative candidates must urge Americans  to make a clear choice. They can
accept the arguments of those  who say that the only problem with the welfare
state today is that we  do not spend enough on it. According to this line of
argument,  what Congress should do is commit huge amounts of additional 
resources to child care, training programs, and other services to  enable
welfare mothers to become employable. This argument  is advanced most
vociferously by those who would be paid to  deliver the services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other option, conservatives should point out, is to move in  the
direction that Congress charted but Clinton vetoed. This  means facing up to the
obvious fact that spending more money on  welfare harms children rather than
helping them and destroys  families rather than strengthening them. The
conservative option is to  concentrate on reducing the rate of illegitimacy  the
root cause  of America's social problems  by discouraging  out-of-wedlock births
and reducing the burdens on two-parent families. In  addition, the conservative
option would give wide authority to states  to redesign programs while insisting
on clear national goals to  reduce illegitimacy and require work, and would
implement real  evaluations of state efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Further, conservatives must make the case that if poor  Americans are to be
held responsible for their actions, as other Americans  are held accountable,
they also must be given the power to take  responsibility. That means giving
poor Americans the same right  to choose the school that is right for their
child, through vouchers,  as the President of the United States enjoys. And it
means  enabling these Americans, through housing vouchers and the right to 
manage or own their own homes, to escape the crushing and  dangerous environment
of many public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>It's time to reduce the tax burden on families with
children and  to introduce a flat tax.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans have grown increasingly frustrated with the tax  code. Quite
correctly, they see it as complex and unfair, full of  loopholes for those with
the means or sophistication to exploit them. That  is why a simple, flat tax is
so attractive to so many voters. But  besides its mind-numbing complexity,
today's tax code has two  other 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  severe deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One is that over the years the burden has shifted decisively  to families
with children. Because of the erosion, through  inflation, of exemptions and the
rise in Social Security tax rates,  families with children have faced an
increasing share of taxes when  compared with other groups. This has accentuated
the perverse  incentives of the welfare system and made it harder for 
middle-class families with children to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other deficiency is the treatment of savings and  investment. The tax
code almost seems designed to discourage investment  and risk-taking by
subjecting saved income to multiple taxation.  The result: Saving has been
discouraged, and those who have  saved find the nest egg they accumulated for
themselves and their  children eaten away by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress elected in 1994 tried to take the first steps to  correct these
problems. Concentrating on the most immediate problem -- the bias against
families with children  Congress enacted  legislation that would have given a
$500 credit per child to families  with children. This across-the-board credit
recognized that the  purpose of the original exemption for children was to
relieve all families  of taxation on income used to raise children. Congress
also  included in the legislation a reduction in the capital gains tax and the 
reduction of taxes on certain new forms of savings. Unfortunately,  despite
pledging a middle-class tax cut in 1992 and raising  taxes since then, President
Clinton vetoed the legislation, invoking  traditional class warfare arguments.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives need to use the 1996 election to frame the issue  of 
taxation. They need to argue that
the time for tinkering with  the tax code is over: What is needed is a new tax
system that is  simple and flat, taxes earnings only once, and redresses the
unfair tax  burden on families with children. Such a flat tax not only would 
bring back fairness and help ordinary working families, but it would  end the
tax penalties currently ranged against those Americans  who invest in the future
of their own children and that of the nation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>The American economy is the world's most powerful engine 
of jobs and wealth creation. Washington should stop slowing  down that engine.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While it is natural for people to be concerned about their  economic future,
conservative candidates must not allow these concerns  to be channeled into bad
policies based on a phony reading of  history. This means that candidates must
remind voters of the  real nature and strength of the U.S. economy. And they
must  remind voters, too, that government can do little to improve on the 
workings of the free enterprise system, but much to damage it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many politicians play to fears of economic insecurity and  suggest that
ordinary working Americans are somehow the victims of  Wall Street greed or
underpriced foreign competition. Some of  these politicians go on to argue,
surprisingly, that Americans should  turn to the federal government to assure
their security and  economic well-being. Yet the facts refute the premise behind
this line of  argument, and hard-learned experience indicates that a more 
active federal government is no answer to insecurity. In particular, 
conservatives need to remind Americans that constant change is  the key to
America's traditional economic strength. That is  why America has created 46
million jobs since 1970, while Europe  has 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  languished. And conservatives
must remind Americans that  the tough competition of international trade
sharpens efficiency  and brings prosperity to all Americans, while defeatist 
protectionism leads to long-run stagnation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the U.S. economy still has performed less well  than it could
for many years, and so has rewarded American  workers less well than it could.
There are three main reasons for this.  The first is that government has
increased the cost of hiring  Americans, through regulation and taxation, and
has taken more and more  out of each paycheck. This has meant fewer jobs than
otherwise  would have been created, especially for lower-skilled Americans. 
Over the last 20 years, for instance, regulation alone has probably  cost more
than three million jobs. The solution is deregulation and  reduced taxes on
labor  less government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second reason is that the shortcomings of the public  school system have
caused many Americans to lack the basic skills  they need to be productive, and
thus command good wages. This  government failure in basic education is not
corrected by  maintaining a public school monopoly, or by creating government
training  programs to try to correct the deficiencies of government schools. It 
is addressed by giving parents the power to demand better value  for money,
establishing real standards to enable parents to  evaluate schools, and ending
the public school monopoly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The third reason is that the tax code's bias against saving and  investment
has slowed down the introduction of the new tools  and equipment in the economy
that workers need to be more  productive and earn higher wages. The solution to
this problem is to  reduce taxes on capital.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This Congress has attempted to reduce these government  sources of long-term
drag on the U.S. economy. It has sought to  reduce capital gains taxes and taxes
on working Americans. It has tried  to eliminate regulations whose meager
benefits do not justify  the heavy cost in jobs. And it has encouraged states to
take the lead,  as they should, in overhauling the education system. 
Unfortunately, President Clinton has obstructed or vetoed all of these  efforts.
Meanwhile, he has fostered the enticing but false notion that  government can
provide an economic security blanket for all  Americans. To his credit, however,
Clinton has worked with the  new congressional leadership to resist
protectionism and reduce  worldwide barriers to trade.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives need to draw sharp lines in the debate over  the economy
during the election cycle. They must point out that  there are those who would
maintain  even increase  the current  burden on taxation and regulation on the
economy, and then seek  to expand government programs and protections to &quot;correct&quot;
the  apparent shortcomings of the economy. But this is the road to  stagnation,
not jobs and wealth. They must argue instead that the  only way to create jobs,
prosperity, and long-term security is to end  tax and regulatory policies that
hamper job creation and wage growth.
</UL>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other issues also must be raised in the 1996 election.  Americans need to be
presented with the clear choices that exist on such  issues as health care, the
environment, crime, education, and  congressional reform. In all these policy
areas, critical choices have  to be made  indeed, should have been made many
years ago.  Since the last election, the country has had a Congress willing to 
confront the choices and to take action, and a White House trying  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  persuade the nation to cling to
the cozy illusion that no  hard choices need to be made. It is up to
conservatives during this  election season to make sure that Americans
understand this, and  that they are presented with the clear decisions that no
longer can  be avoided.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's tax system is a disgrace. It severely penalizes  productive
economic behavior, especially by savers and investors  whose capital income is
subjected to as many as four layers of taxation.  It is so bewildering that
complying with its increasingly  complex forms, regulations, and other documents
consumes billions  of hours each year. And it imposes staggering economic damage
 reducing economic output by hundreds of billions of dollars  each year. The
real cost, however, is measured in lost jobs,  foregone income, lower living
standards, and reduced economic security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But lost prosperity is only part of the story. For many  Americans the most
reprehensible aspect of the current system is the way  it allows special
interests to manipulate the tax code for their  own advantage. Lobbyists with
enough money and access tilt the  playing field, creating special preferences
for the politically  well-connected. With the tax burden at record levels, many
taxpayers  understandably want to protect their earnings, but today's system  of
loopholes, credits, exemptions, and deductions fosters a  pervasive sense of
unfairness and encourages lawmakers to impose  even higher tax rates on income
which does not enjoy special status.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to solve America's tax problem is to adopt a flat  tax. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  No tax system is good for the
economy, but a flat tax would  allow significantly stronger economic growth by
replacing the  current tax code with a low rate, simple tax that removes the
bias  against savings and investment. Perhaps equally important, it would 
restore integrity to a tax system that has become synonymous  with
special-interest corruption. Under the flat tax, every taxpayer  plays by the
same rules. The multitude of forms required by today's  arcane tax law are
replaced by two simple postcards, one for  individuals' labor income and the
other for business and capital  income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the new Congress took a significant step in the right  direction by
delivering on its promise to pass badly needed  family tax relief to spur
economic growth. Taxpayers were  disappointed, however, when  just two years
after signing the largest tax  hike in U.S. history  President Clinton vetoed
the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995, which included about $220 billion in tax
relief over  a seven-year period. This relatively small package  which  amounts
to returning to the taxpayer just 2 cents of every dollar from  the $11.5
trillion in tax revenues the government expects to  collect over the next seven
years  included a $500-per-child tax credit,  a reduction in the capital gains
tax, and a modest expansion of  Individual Retirement Accounts. This legislation
marked the first  time since 1981 that Congress had voted to ease the tax
burden, but  it still did not come close to offsetting the negative impact of 
tax increases imposed by Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton  in 1990 and
1993; the 1995 tax cut was less than one-third the  combined size of these two
tax increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>As important as Congress's proposed tax cuts were to  taxpayers 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  and economic growth, they amounted
to using a Band-Aid  when what the situation really required was radical
surgery.  Serious, fundamental reform must be based on a recognition of two 
essential realities: Excessive taxation harms the economy, and the  liberal
notion that any problem can be solved by taxing the rich  is self-defeating.
Higher tax rates simply encourage wealthy  taxpayers, who already are
over-taxed, to hide, shelter, underreport,  and reduce their income. A much
better way to get the rich to  pay more, and one that will help lower - and
middle-income  workers by boosting savings and investment, is to cut tax rates.
The  attached <a href="tax_1.gif">chart</a> illustrates how lower tax rates in the 1980s  dramatically
increased the percentage of the income tax burden borne  by the rich. Even more
important, however, these reductions  triggered the longest peacetime economic
expansion in U.S. history and  led to the creation of 21 million new jobs.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The conclusion is obvious: The tax system today is so  fundamentally flawed
that the only realistic solution is to scrap it and  begin again.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These flaws in the current tax code can be communicated by  emphasizing
three main themes:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Excessive tax rates.</B> The federal income tax has a top rate  of
39.6 percent. This means that successful entrepreneurs and  others with high
incomes receive barely 60 cents of benefit for every  dollar they contribute to
the nation's economy. The result is less  incentive to engage in productive
behavior, which leads in turn  to lower levels of work, saving, investment,
risk-taking, and  entrepreneurship. Added to this are state and local taxes,
which can  increase the total burden by as much as 11 percent, and the  Medicare
payroll tax, which adds another 2.9 percent. Moreover, while  those with lower
incomes may seem to be penalized less, usually  facing income tax rates of 15
percent and 28 percent, they also are  subjected to the full 15.3 percent
payroll tax, <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#1">1</A></B></TT> in
addition to state  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  local taxes. In other words,
almost all taxpayers are paying  about 40 percent of each additional dollar of
income they earn to  the government.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Tax Foundation, the average taxpayer in  1995 worked until
May 6 to satisfy the revenue demands of  federal, state, and local government.
This number could have dropped by  a day or two in 1996 if the President had
signed the legislation  approved by Congress in 1995. Nevertheless, the cost of
the tax  system remains the largest item in the average family's budget, 
exceeding the combined cost of food, clothing, shelter, and  transportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Complexity.</B> Americans spend too much time deciphering  IRS forms,
regulations, and rulings. Several years ago, an  IRS-commissioned study
estimated that taxpayers spend 5.4 billion hours  on their federal tax returns 
more than all the man-hours used in  the entire automotive industry in America.
According to the  Tax Foundation, our tax system imposes $192 billion in 
compliance costs on the economy: not money sent to Washington, not  foregone
economic growth, but the cost of the lawyers,  accountants, lobbyists, tax
preparers, and man-hours needed to comply with  the current tax code. Of this
amount, three-quarters is due to the  federal income tax alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Bias against savings and investment.</B> The current system 
discourages Americans from saving and investing. Perhaps the  most pernicious
feature of the tax code is the way it subjects capital  income to discriminatory
treatment. If a taxpayer earns a dollar,  he can choose (after paying tax on the
money) to consume that  income or use it for savings and investment. If he
consumes the  dol
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  lar, he will pay very little, if
any, additional federal tax. If  he chooses to invest his earnings, he is
treated like a criminal.  Depending on the type of investment, the government
may  subject any returns to as many as four additional layers of tax; needless 
to say, however, it does not share in any losses if the investment  does not
perform as expected. Not only is this policy unfair, but it  has profoundly
adverse consequences for the economy since all  economic theories agree that the
only way to generate higher  wages and rising living standards is through
savings and investment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How Taxes Slow the Economy and Cost Jobs </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The biggest long-term problem with the tax system is its impact  on income
and productivity. Although much has been made of a  supposed decline in
middle-class incomes over the last 20 years,  all income groups have seen their
incomes rise over time.  However, our current tax system has made this increase
smaller than it  could have been.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is almost universal agreement among economists   even Marxists  that
incomes depend on productivity. Workers are  paid on the basis of what they
produce. Put another way, for incomes  to rise, productivity must increase, but
productivity increases  are closely linked to savings and to investment in
capital and  labor. Thus, the ability of workers to produce more is a function
of  increases in the quantity and quality of the machinery, tools,  equipment,
and technology with which they work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only systematic way to increase living standards and  income over time
is through more savings and investment in capital  and labor; in other words, in
the language of economics,  increased 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  capital formation boosts the
productivity of labor. Capital and  labor are what economists call complementary
goods, because  the value of each increases when they are linked together. A 
citizen who invests money in a pension fund will get a good return on  that
money if it is put to work producing goods. Labor, conversely,  will receive
higher wages as a result of the new investment made  possible by those
retirement savings.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>This link between labor and capital explains why farmers  in America earn
more than farmers in Bangladesh. American  farmers do not work harder. They are
not smarter. They earn more  because they produce more, and they produce more
because they work  with sophisticated machinery, equipment, tools, technology,
and  production processes. This is also why factory workers in  America,
Germany, and Japan earn more than factory workers in  Brazil, Nigeria, and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, our tax code imposes particularly harsh penalties  on
so-called capital income. Consider, for example, a family that  decides to
sacrifice by setting aside 10 percent of its income in  order to build up a
retirement nest egg. It invests the money in a  new company, exposing itself to
the possible loss of all its savings.  One would assume the government would
want to reward this type  of entrepreneurial decision, but just the opposite is
the case. If  the family's investment turns out to be a wise one, the 
government imposes at least three, and sometimes four, levels of tax. First, 
any income of the new company is subject to the corporate income  tax; second,
when the money is paid out as a dividend to the  shareholder, the income is
subject to the personal income tax; third,  if the family ever decides to sell
its stock, it must pay a tax on  capital gains; and fourth, if this family
invested very wisely and  helped 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  create tomorrow's Microsoft, the
government will tax the value  of its assets through the estate tax as its
members die. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As bad as all this sounds, it gets even worse. Policies such as  the
alternative minimum tax and depreciation often force  businesses and individuals
to overstate their income, making the real tax  rate even higher than the
statutory top rate. Our hypothetical  family could try to avoid some of these
taxes by simply putting money  in the bank, but even this has high costs. First,
the rate of return  on their savings will be lower because excessive taxes lower
the  demand for credit. Second, the government double taxes  savings. With the
exception of strictly limited IRAs and a handful of  other savings plans like
401(k)s, the money put into savings accounts  is taxed when it is deposited and
taxed on any interest it earns.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Needless to say, this pernicious anti-savings, anti-investment  bias in the
tax code sharply reduces the level of capital  formation. Many taxpayers look at
how the government punishes  success, decide that the financial sacrifice is not
worth it, and  consume their income rather than save and invest it. Ironically,
many  of these tax policies are designed to punish the &quot;rich,&quot; since 
they naturally have more money available for savings and  investment. The main
effect, however, is to reduce the wages and salaries  of people with lower and
middle incomes. Most wealthy people  can use tax shelters like municipal bonds
or hide their money  offshore to avoid taxes targeted at the so-called rich.
What these taxes  really do is discourage those on the lower rungs of the 
economic ladder from trying to become rich.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>By contrast, the tax cuts of the 1980s show what happens if  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  policy reduces the burden on
working, saving, and investing.  Once the economy received an unambiguous tax
cut, everything  President Reagan said would happen if tax rates were reduced
began  to happen. The economy began its longest period of growth in  peacetime
history. Incomes began to rise, with the increase benefiting  all groups  rich,
middle-class, and lower-income (see <a href="tax_3.gif">chart</a>). And,  of course, the miraculous job
creation machine began: 21 million  new jobs were created during the Reagan
boom.

<P><B>How Washington has Hiked Taxes on  Children  </B><TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal taxation of families with children has increased  dramatically over
the past four decades. In 1948, the typical family of  four paid just 3 percent
of its income to the federal government in  direct taxes. In 1994, the
equivalent family paid 24.5 percent of  its income to the federal government. As
the <a href="tax_2.gif">chart</a> below  shows, when state and local and indirect federal taxes are
included, the  tax burden on that family equals 37.6 percent of its income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal income taxes have risen much faster for families with  children than
for other groups of Americans in the last four  decades. The root cause of this
growing anti-family bias is the  eroding value of the personal exemption. The
personal exemption for  children was intended to offset part of the annual cost
of raising  a child by allowing families to deduct an amount of money  from
their taxable income. In 1948, the personal exemption was  $600. This was equal
to roughly 17 percent of the median income of  a family of four (then $3,468)
and shielded 68 percent of  that family's income from federal income tax.
Families could  protect most of the remaining 32 percent by itemizing deductions
or  by taking the standard deduction. The result: In the late 1940s  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  early 1950s, the average family
with children paid little or no  income tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the past four decades, however, increases in the personal  exemption have
lagged far behind the rise in incomes and  inflation. As the value of the
personal exemption has declined, the  income tax paid by families with children
has increased. For the  personal exemption today to have the same value relative
to family  income that it had in 1948, it would have to have risen to $7,000 in 
1992, and to $8,000 in 1996. Instead, it is worth only $2,250 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second blow to family finances has been the increase in  Social Security
taxes, technically known as &quot;payroll taxes.&quot;  In  1948, workers paid a
2 percent Social Security tax on annual wages of  up to $3,000; 1 percent was
paid directly by the employee and 1  percent indirectly by the employer through
the so-called  employer share.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#3">3</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By 1995, combined Social Security taxes have risen to 15.3  percent of wages
(7.65 percent each paid by employer and  employee) on incomes up to $61,200.
While all workers have suffered  from skyrocketing payroll taxes, the burden has
been most severe  for working families with children. Social Security taxes,
unlike  regular income taxes, are not adjusted for the number of dependents  in
the family, so a working parent trying to support a family of  four feels the
sting of this tax far more sharply than a single person  at the same wage level.
The effect of Social Security taxation is  particularly severe on lower-income
parents; a family with an  income of $25,000 per year, for instance, pays $3,825
in payroll taxes.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Government Assault on Family Income. Direct federal  taxes as a share of
median family income has increased  dramatically over the past four decades. In
1948, effective tax rates equaled  3 percent of income for the average family of
four. By 1970,  they had risen to 16 percent; by 1994, to 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The income loss due to increased taxation has seriously  strained American
family finances and profoundly affected American  family life. Chart 4 shows the
effects of increases in federal  income and Social Security taxes since 1948 on
the finances of the  average family. Total pre-tax income for the median family
of four in  1994 was $56,608. <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt2.htm">4</A></TT></B>
 After taxes, this family's income fell to $45,104.  If federal taxes as a
percentage of family income were restored  to 1948 levels, the family's post-tax
income would have  been $10,084 higher, or $55,188. In other words, the loss of
income  in 1992 because of the increase in federal taxes as a share of  family
income, due to the falling value of the personal exemption and  the rise in
Social Security taxes since the late 1940s, was $10,084.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This income loss severely affects the ability of families to  support
themselves. For example, the typical family of four has  monthly mortgage
payments of $664 and grocery bills of $332. Thus  the $10,084 in income lost to
this family due to the 45-year rise  in federal taxes costs this family 15
months worth of mortgage  payments, or 12 months mortgage combined with six
months worth  of groceries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Solution: Tax Credits for Children</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two practical ways to reduce the tax burden on  families with
children: by increasing the value of the personal exemption  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  by allowing for the use of tax
credits. Although many positive  arguments can be made for increasing the
personal exemption,  the tax credit is better in the long run because it is less
complex  and can be used more effectively to reduce the tax burden on 
lower-income working families.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With an income tax exemption, income equal to the amount of  the exemption
is excluded from tax. However, the actual tax savings  a family receives from
such an exemption will depend upon the  tax rate to which it is subject. Thus,
for a family in the 15 percent  income tax bracket, a $500 increase in the
dependent exemption  decreases income taxes by $75. A $1,000 increase in the 
exemption, as some have proposed, decreases a family's tax burden by  $150. But
for a family in the 28 percent tax bracket, a $1,000 increase  in the personal
exemption reduces the income tax burden by $280   86 percent more tax relief
than for families in the 15  percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By contrast, under a tax credit, the amount of the credit is  deducted from
taxes paid  below the line, so to speak  directly  reducing tax liability. Also,
unlike a tax exemption, a credit gives the  same amount of tax relief to every
taxpayer, regardless of income or  tax rate status. The two examples below, one
for a family of four  earning $30,000 per year and the other for the same family
 earning $75,000 per year, show clearly how the credit works.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Example #1:</B> Under current law, a family earning $30,000 per  year
(which puts it in the 15 percent income tax bracket) has an  income tax
liability of $1,988. Because this family has two children,  the $500 child tax
credit reduces the income tax bill by $1,000  leaving a net income tax bill of
$988. This is a 50 percent reduction in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  family's tax burden.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Example #2:</B> Under current law, a family earning $75,000 per  year
(which puts it in the 28 percent income tax bracket) has a tax  liability of
$8,114. Deducting $1,000  $500 for each child   leaves this family with a net
income tax bill of $7,114. This is a 11  percent reduction in the family's tax
burden.

<P><B>The Crushing Burden of Social Security</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Much of this chapter has focused on the crushing burden of  taxes in general
and the anti-growth features of the income tax in  particular. No treatment of
federal taxation would be complete,  however, without some discussion of the
interrelated problems of  the payroll tax and the Social Security retirement
system. The need  for reform is critical. The Bipartisan Entitlement Commission 
estimates that Social Security faces an unfunded liability of $7.3  trillion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The burden of financing Social
Security has reached crisis  proportions. First, the payroll tax rate has risen
dramatically over  time. As the attached chart illustrates, the payroll tax has
jumped from  2 percent in 1949 to 15.3 percent today (the government  promotes
the fiction that half is paid by the employer and half by the  employee; in
reality, of course, the full burden is borne by the  worker in the form of lower
take-home pay). Of the 15.3 percent  payroll tax, 12.4 percent is dedicated to
Social Security, and 2.9 percent  is used to finance Medicare spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The rapidly rising tax rate is only part of the
problem. When  Social Security was created in the 1930s, only the first $3,000
of  in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  come was subject to tax. As the
graph demonstrates, however,  the amount of income subject to tax has
skyrocketed to more  than $60,000. The combination of these two effects  higher
tax  rates and an increase in the amount of wages that can be taxed   has caused
the payroll tax to become the biggest tax burden for  the majority of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     In 1937, the maximum tax bill for the program
was $60.  Twenty years later, in 1957, the maximum tax bill was less than $170. 
By 1977, it had climbed to more than $1,600. Today, a worker's  Social Security
tax bill can reach more than $7,500. The 2.9  percent Medicare portion of the
payroll tax compounds the burden,  particularly because there is no limit on the
amount of income  subject to this additional levy. This spiraling tax bill has a
negative  economic impact. The payroll tax is an unambiguous hindrance to  job
creation, lowering take-home pay and reducing the level of  labor-force
participation.

</P>
<P>The other major flaw in the Social Security system is that it  is bankrupt.
Simply stated, the Social Security system has  promised benefits that cannot be
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the most recent report from the Social Security 
Administration, the system will begin running a deficit in about  15 years.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm">5</A></B></TT>  Politicians
claim that the Trust Fund will be able to  keep the system afloat for another 20

<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1993, with nary a vote to spare in either the House or the  Senate,
President Clinton managed to obtain approval for the  largest tax increase in
history. In his second year, 1994, he proposed   but ultimately failed to get
enacted  an even larger tax increase  to pay for his government-run health care
scheme. Then, on  December 16, 1994, shortly after the mid-term elections that
put a  Republican majority in the House for the first time in 40 years, the 
President reversed himself and proposed a &quot;Middle-Class Bill  of Rights&quot;
which included modest tax cuts for families with  children, tax deductions for
education expenses, and an expansion of  Individual Retirement Accounts. This
effort was short-lived,  however, because the Administration spent much of the
rest of 1995  opposing the tax cuts proposed by the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton's record tax increase was a complete failure.  Tax
revenues are rising slower than they did during the  tax-cutting Reagan years.
The Clinton tax hike also hindered deficit  reduction. The following chart shows
CBO projections of annual budget  deficits after the Clinton tax increase. After
a modest decline, due  primarily to the economy's slow climb out of the early
1990s  slow
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  down, projected budget deficits
begin to climb rapidly,  reaching more than $400 billion after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Higher taxes also slow income growth for American families.  The following
charts illustrate the strong relationship between  taxes and family incomes.
During the Reagan years, income rose,  reversing the dismal economic performance
of the Carter years  when payroll tax hikes and bracket creep resulted in major
tax  increases. Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan's pro-growth policies were 
reversed by the Bush and Clinton Administrations. The effect on  the economy was
both predictable and inevitable: Incomes again  began to fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the 1980s, Reagan's opponents charged that the rich  were getting
richer and the poor were getting poorer. As the  numbers clearly show, however,
all income classes benefited from  the economy's performance. For the most part,
conversely, all  income classes suffer when the economy falters. The only
exception to  this trend has been during the Clinton Administration when, for 
the first time, the rich actually have become richer as the poor  have grown
poorer. The lesson from these statistics is clear:  Higher taxes slow the
economy, but the rich usually can adjust their  affairs to limit the damage,
leaving the poor most vulnerable to  the downturn.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Reagan Years</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some Americans have been seduced into thinking that the tax  burden is too
low. They have been told, often by the  establishment media, that &quot;Reagan
era&quot; tax cuts starved the government of  revenue and that higher taxes are
needed simply to offset the effect  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  these the massive cuts. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As Chart 8 illustrates, however, there was no loss of tax  revenue during
the Reagan years. The effect is particularly  pronounced when one realizes that
the Reagan tax cuts were phased in, and  the economy did not actually receive a
net tax cut until January  1, 1983.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even using 1981 as the base year (and effectively blaming  Reagan for the
recession that began during Carter's last fiscal year),  tax revenues expanded
from $599 billion in 1981 to $991 billion  in 1989. Even after adjusting for
inflation, revenues grew by 20  percent. Compare this to the level of revenue
growth under the  high-tax regimes of Bush and Clinton. As the <a href="tax_8.gif">chart</a> shows, tax 
revenues grew faster under the Reagan tax cuts than they have in  recent years
under higher tax rates.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#7">7</A></B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics claim that the Reagan tax cuts caused the deficit to  climb, but
this accusation does not withstand scrutiny. As the  following graph shows, the
deficit began to increase two fiscal years  before Ronald Reagan became
President and continued to rise during  his first two years in office, until the
economy received a  significant net tax cut on January 1, 1983. From that point
on, the deficit  began to shrink, falling to about $150 billion by the time
Reagan  left office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps most important of all, the deficit would have continued  to fall had
Reagan's policies been left in place. In January 1989   the month Ronald Reagan
left office  the Democratically  controlled Congressional Budget Office
published estimates showing  what would happen to the deficit if Reagan's
policies were left in  place. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  As <a href=tax_10.gif">Chart 10</a> shows, the CBO
projected that the deficit would  continue to fall every year. Unfortunately,
both George Bush and  Bill Clinton raised taxes, causing economic growth to
falter and  discouraging taxpayers from earning and reporting more taxable 
income, and the deficit increased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The evidence is clear. Notwithstanding all the Washington  rhetoric, the tax
burden is too high. The deficit is the result of  excessive spending, not low
tax rates. The evidence of the past 20 years  confirms that high tax rates and
rising tax burdens mean higher  deficits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Abandoned Families</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clinton campaigned for President by promising to give tax cuts  to working
families with children, but he did little to honor  this promise until after the
electorate brought new leadership to  Congress in 1994. Almost one year after
introducing his  &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights,&quot; Clinton again
abandoned families when he  vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which had as
its centerpiece  a $500-per-child tax credit for working families. Clinton 
claimed, among other things, that proposed reforms in the earned  income tax
credit (EITC) included in the plan would raise taxes on  families earning less
than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yet a comparison of President Clinton's &quot;Middle-Class Bill  of Rights&quot;
(with its $300-per-child tax credit for dependent  children below age 13 in
families with annual incomes below  $75,0008) and the Balanced Budget Act vetoed
by Clinton (with its  $500-per-child tax cut forall children in families earning
up to  $110,0009) shows that the congressional plan would benefit 5.4 million 
more 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  low-income working families with
children than the Clinton  plan, even after accounting for changes in the EITC
in the  Balanced Budget Act. Many families with children and annual incomes 
below $24,000 would be denied the $300 child credit under  the Clinton plan
(receiving only the EITC) but would be eligible  for both the $500 child credit
and the EITC under the  congressional plan.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>Overall, Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would benefit  23 million more
children than the Administration's  $300-per-child credit. Congress would give
tax relief to 10.4 million families  with children who would receive no tax
relief under the Clinton plan.  In addition, there would be millions of families
under the  Clinton plan in which at least one sibling received tax relief but
others  did not. Taken together, the number of children not qualifying for  any
tax relief under Clinton would be 23 million less than under  the Balanced
Budget Act. These children would receive $15.4  billion in tax relief under the
BBA but nothing under the Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are three major reasons why the Clinton plan denies tax  relief to so
many families with children:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #1:</B> Clinton's tax cut benefits only families with  children
under age 13, denying tax relief to the families of at least 2.8  million other
children whose parents earn less than $30,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #2:</B> Clinton's tax cut phases out for families earning 
between $60,000 and $75,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #3:</B> The Clinton plan requires low-income families to  deduct
their EITC benefits from their income tax bill before  taking 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  the $300-per-child tax credit. By
contrast, the Balanced  Budget Act allows a low-income family to take the
$500-per-child  tax credit first, then receiving the full measure of the EITC on
top  of the child credit. <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#10">10</A></TT></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These three elements of the Clinton plan make it substantially  inferior to
Congress's $500-per-child tax credit, even considering  the reforms in the EITC.

<P>THE 104TH CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The centerpiece of the new Congress's Contract With  America was a
commitment to pass a plan that balances the budget by  2002, provides
substantial tax relief to families with children and  seniors, creates jobs, and
spurs economic growth. The new House  leadership rightly understood that tax
cuts must be included in any  credible balanced budget plan for both economic
and political  reasons. First, cutting taxes gives the economy a needed boost
while  Washington curbs spending in order to balance the budget.  Economic
models show that cutting taxes while balancing the budget  produces higher
economic growth than balancing the budget  without tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There also is a political element to cutting taxes while  balancing the
budget. Tax cuts  especially broad-based cuts such as  the $500-per-child tax
credit and capital gains reform  build  powerful constituencies to counter the
entrenched interests who  survive by exploiting government programs. In the
absence of tax  cuts, these pro-spending lobbies would be the only voices heard 
during any debate over balancing the budget. So, too, tax cuts  &quot;sugar-coat&quot;
the political pain of spending cuts. For example, families  in the typical
congressional district would receive some $54  million per year from the
$500-per-child tax credit. It is difficult to  imagine that any single federal
spending project of similar  magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the
same time. Thus, the  political advantages of tax cuts more than outweigh the
political  disadvantages of cutting spending.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The good news for hard-pressed families and businesses is that  tax cuts
were at the forefront of the agenda during the 1995-1996  budget debate and that
the new Congress fulfilled its promise to  deliver a balanced budget plan with
tax cuts to Bill Clinton. The  bad news is that Clinton vetoed the balanced
budget and tax cut plan   just two years after signing the largest tax increase
in history   and that the vision of taking taxpayers' money back from 
Washington became a victim of the &quot;green eyeshade&quot; negotiations over
how  to balance the budget.

<P><B>Tax Cuts in the House Plan</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On May 18, 1995, the House of Representatives passed, by a  vote of 238 to
193, its sweeping budget blueprint  formally known  as the budget resolution  to
balance the budget in seven years  while providing over $350 billion in tax cuts
to help families with  children and seniors and spur economic growth. Although 
many Washington insiders charged that the projected tax cut was  too large (some
$354 billion over seven years), it amounted to  returning to taxpayers only 3
percent of the $11.5 trillion in total  tax revenues the government expects to
collect over the same  seven-year period.

</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the Senate-passed budget resolution failed to  provide
explicit tax cuts. The Senate plan did allow for  unspecified tax cuts for
families and economic growth, but only if CBO  certified that the plan would
balance the budget in seven years.  Once this certification had been made, tax
cuts could be financed  with the $170 billion economic windfall, or &quot;fiscal
dividend,&quot; the  CBO estimated would accrue to the government from lower 
interest rates and the increased tax revenues generated by higher  economic
growth.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Tax Cuts in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>After considerable negotiation, the House and Senate agreed  that the
Balanced Budget Act of 1995 (BBA) should contain $245  billion in tax cuts to
help families and spur economic growth. The  net size of this tax cut package is
reduced to $218 billion after  deducting $27 billion in revenues generated from
closing special  tax breaks for certain corporations and industries. Though this
 plan has come under considerable criticism from the media and  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  Washington elite, it actually is
rather modest: Overall, it  promises to return to taxpayers roughly 2 percent of
the $11.5 trillion in  tax revenues the government expects to collect over the
next  seven years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A full 65 percent of the tax cut plan is targeted to families,  especially
families with children. The &quot;crown jewel&quot; is a  $500-per-child tax
credit benefiting 28 million families raising 51  million children. The
remaining 35 percent of the plan is dedicated to  tax cuts to spur new
investment, jobs, and economic growth. A  small portion of the plan includes two
important tax provisions to  help seniors with their health care costs.

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The centerpiece of the Republican Contract With America and  of
the House-passed plan is a $500-per-child tax credit benefiting  28 million
working families raising some 51 million children.  The $500-per-child credit is
&quot;non-refundable,&quot; meaning the total  value of the credit may not
exceed a family's income tax bill. But it  does provide uniform tax relief to
all families with incomes up  to $110,000 per year, thereby reducing a
low-income family's  tax burden by a much greater proportion than an 
upper-income family's. For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes  above
$110,000, the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000  in earnings
above the threshold (a range of $20,000), phasing  out fully at $130,000 in
income. For families with two children,  the two credits for which they are
eligible are phased out fully  at 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  $150,000 in income. For single
filers, the credit begins to  phase out at $75,000 in income.

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Families with children are overtaxed.</B> In 1948, the
average  American family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to 
Uncle Sam. Today, the same family pays 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent  to
giving that family one month's mortgage payment and  one month's groceries.</B>
The average family spends $644 per month  in mortgage payments and $332 per
month on groceries. Thus,  the $1,000 in tax relief the congressional plan would
give to a  family with two children would help this family pay one month's 
mortgage and groceries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Millions of families stand to benefit.</B> The families of 51  million
American children (28 million taxpaying families) are eligible  for the
$500-per-child tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Family tax relief helps families in every state.</B> The typical 
congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for  a
$500 tax credit. Thus, families in the typical district would  receive $54
million per year in tax relief. Tables showing the benefits  of family tax
relief by state and congressional district are included  in the appendix to this
chapter.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate the  entire income
tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring for 8.7  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  children.</B> These 3.5 million
families would receive over $2.2  billion per year in tax relief. Families with
two children earning up  to $24,000 per year would see their entire income tax
burden  eliminated by a $500-per-child tax credit, and families with three 
children and incomes as high as $26,000 also would have their  income tax bill
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Most families are middle-class</B>. The $500 child credit directs  89
percent of all benefits to families with adjusted gross incomes  below $75,000

incomes below $100,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cutting taxes for all families  regardless of income  is  fair.</B>
Congress's plan would cut the income tax burden of a family  of four earning
$30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income  tax burden of a family earning
$40,000 per year by 30 percent.  Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000
would see their tax  burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000
per  year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.

<P><B>2. Higher Standard Deduction to Reduce the Marriage Penalty.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current law, dual-income married couples who file a  joint return can
end up paying more taxes than two single  taxpayers filing individually. The BBA
takes a small step toward  reducing this &quot;marriage penalty&quot; by
increasing the value of the  standard deduction for these working couples
relative to the value of  the same deduction for singles. In 1996, for instance,
the ratio of  the standard deduction for married couples would be 1.68 of the 
value of the individual deduction. By 2005 and beyond, the ratio  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  be 2.00.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Tax Credit for Adoption.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The estimated two million families ready to adopt children  face huge
expenses during the adoption process, but current tax  law does not allow them
to deduct adoption costs from their tax  bill. The BBA plan makes a substantial
commitment to  encouraging adoption by giving adoptive families a tax credit of
$5,000 to  offset such expenses as adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, 
and other related expenses. This credit is available in full to  families
earning up to $75,000 per year and phased out gradually for  families earning up
to $115,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Tax Deduction for Dependent Parents.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The current tax code provides little relief for the care of  elderly parents
or grandparents. The standard personal exemption  of $2,500 is available, but,
as with the dependent child  exemption, the value of the credit is greater for
middle - and  upper-income families than for modest-income families in the 15
percent  income bracket. For example, while the standard deduction of $2,500 
allows a family in the 15 percent bracket to lower its income tax  by $375, the
same deduction allows a family in the 28 percent  bracket to lower its tax by
$700.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA plan offers additional tax relief for the care of  parents and
grandparents in the form of an &quot;above-the-line&quot; deduction  of $1,000
per family member. Such a credit could help many  families 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  that prefer to care for elderly
relatives at home but cannot  afford the expense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>5. Favorable Tax Treatment for Private Long-Term Care.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although medical expenses are deductible from federal taxes  when they
exceed a certain percentage of income, long-term care  expenses today generally
are not tax-deductible. Under the  BBA, starting in 1996, long-term care
insurance generally would  be treated the same as accident and health insurance,
and  employers would be allowed to provide their employees with tax-free 
long-term care insurance just as they now often provide medical  benefits.
Eligible long-term care premiums and expenses for  qualified long-term care
services would be treated the same as other  medical expenses, and benefits
received under a long-term care  insurance policy would be tax-free (up to $175
per day).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Placing long-term care benefits on the same basis as health  care and
financing them under tax provisions similar to those for  medical insurance
could lead to substantial savings for state and  federal programs supporting
nursing home care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>6. Accelerated Payment of Life Insurance Benefits for the  Terminally
Ill.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current law, life insurance benefits are not taxed, but  insured
individuals and their families have no way to obtain  benefits prior to death
without a severe income tax liability  even  though many insurance companies are
willing to offer such  &quot;accelerated 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  benefits.&quot;  The BBA tax cut
plan would facilitate the practice  by which some insurance providers pay
benefits prior to death if  the insured person is terminally or chronically ill.
The plan would  allow such payments to be excluded from a taxpayer's gross 
income, just as payments to a surviving beneficiary now are. In addition,  it
would allow similar tax-exempt treatment for amounts  received from the sale or
assignment of a life insurance contract to a  qualified settlement provider.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>7. Reduction in Capital Gains Tax.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. tax code punishes capital investment by taxing  investment income
more than once: twice by taxing corporate and  individual income, and then a
third time by taxing capital gains.  The current maximum tax rate on capital
gains is 28 percent for  individuals and 35 percent for corporations, and these
gains are  not indexed to the inflation rate. By contrast, most of America's 
major economic competitors, such as Japan or Germany, either  exempt capital
gains from taxation or tax them at a greatly reduced  rate, often indexing the
basis of the gains to inflation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA lessens this penalty in two ways. First, it lowers the  effective
maximum capital gains rate to 19.8 percent for  individuals and 28 percent for
corporations. Second, starting January 1,  2001, it permits individuals to index
the value of assets to ensure  that they are not being taxed on purely
inflationary gains. The bill  also includes a 14 percent maximum rate for the
sale of small  business stock by a taxpayer other than a corporation. A
qualifying  small business may not have gross assets of more than $50 million at
 the time the stock is issued. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As will be seen below, these measures would have a  substantial impact on
the long-term growth of the economy while the  budget is being balanced.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>8. New Individual Retirement Accounts.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), the bill  offers
another way for taxpayers to preserve the value of this  retirement savings by
creating a new American Dream IRA (AD  IRA). Contributions would be made from
post-tax income, but the  interest from such savings would not be taxed upon
withdrawal if  contributions have remained in the account for at least five
years  and the retiree has reached age 59 1/2. This is why the  American Dream
Savings account is sometimes known as a  &quot;back-ended&quot; IRA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Initially, contributions to the new ADS account would be  limited to $2,000
per taxpayer per year ($4,000 for a married couple),  but this amount would be
indexed to the rate of inflation in  subsequent years. The plan also allows
penalty-free withdrawals for a  first-time home purchase or to pay certain
educational or medical  expenses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>9. Alternative Minimum Tax. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Current tax law imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT)  on certain
individuals and corporations whose tax liability, after  deductions and credits,
falls below the level specified by the  alternative minimum tax rate. For
individuals, the minimum tax is  im
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  posed at graduated rates of 26
and 28 percent; for corporations,  it is imposed at 20 percent. In computing
their AMT, individuals  and corporations must adjust the annual amount they
deduct for  depreciated assets so that their tax liability does not fall below
the  AMT amount. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The bill modifies the AMT for both individual and corporate  taxpayers by
repealing the depreciation adjustment for  property placed in service after
1995, thereby conforming AMT  depreciation methods with the method used for
regular tax  purposes. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#11">11</A></B></TT>

<P>
</P>
<P><B>10. Estate and Gift Tax Reform
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA makes several important changes in the estate and  gift tax code to
reduce the punishing effects of this tax on estates,  especially the estates of
small businesses and farms. The bill  gradually increases the current effective
exemption of $600,000  to $750,000 in $25,000 increments through 2001, after
which  the effective exemption amount is indexed to inflation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the estates of small businesses, which do not have special  tax rules,
the bil effectively excludes an amount equal to $1.75  million of the business's
value from the decedent's  estate. <TT><B><A

<P><B>Economic Benefits of the Tax Cuts</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Washington insiders, especially those within the White House  and some in
Congress, argued throughout 1995 that cutting taxes  was inconsistent with the
goal of balancing the budget. They  claimed, for instance, that Washington &quot;could
not afford&quot; to reduce  taxes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  while so much spending was being
cut to balance the  budget. These criticisms ignore the economic benefits that
would be  realized from combining tax cuts with a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To demonstrate this point, economists at The Heritage  Foundation used one
of the principal econometric models of the U.S.  economy to project the economic
effects of the tax cut elements of the  Balanced Budget Act. This analysis
showed that:

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While balancing the budget is good for long-term  economic growth, even more
growth is generated by the tax cuts in the  Balanced Budget Act. The tax cuts on
family income  primarily  the $500-per-child tax credit  would allow more
households to  save or spend their hard-earned money instead of sending it to 
Wash
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  ington, and this increased
private savings and spending would  help offset reductions in government
spending. In the long run,  increased private-sector activity with less
government  spending means a more efficient economy, more well-paying jobs, and 
a lower rate of inflation.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>During the early years of any reduction in government  spending, the economy
must adjust to a lower level of government  intervention. Businesses that
previously produced goods and services  for the government now must produce for
the private sector,  and workers previously employed by the government must find
 new jobs in the private sector. Analogously, there must be a  transition in
savings and investment. Money that would have been  invested in United States
bonds must be re-directed toward  private-sector securities, bonds, or other
vehicles. The transition from  government spending to private savings and
spending is necessary  and valuable, but it also takes time. In the short term,
returning  money to the private sector by means of the $500-per-child tax credit
 will help to offset these negative effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax cuts on capital income  especially the capital gains  tax reductions
 are necessary to ensure a stronger economy.  There are two reasons for this:
First, reducing the tax on capital  gains lowers the cost of moving an
investment from an average  company to one that is exceptionally productive and
well-run. This  lowering of the &quot;switching&quot; costs means that investors
will play a larger  role in promoting well-run, productive companies. Thus, the 
economy as a whole is likely to be more efficient. Second, lower taxes  on
capital cause the cost of capital to fall. Lenders, for example,  do not need to
charge quite as much interest on capital loans to  recoup the taxes they paid
when making the capital available to a  bor
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  rower. Lower capital costs
usually mean more investment by  businesses in labor-saving equipment, which
commonly results in  increased labor productivity. This increased productivity 
translates into higher wages and, through the division of labor, more jobs.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Individual Benefits of the Tax Cuts</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the 1995-1996 budget debate wore on, the &quot;green  eyeshade&quot;
negotiations over how to balance the budget overshadowed  the benefits of tax
cuts to families and individual taxpayers.  President Clinton often charged that
the $245 billion tax cut package  was &quot;extreme,&quot; given how much
spending had to be reduced in order  to balance the budget. But the plan
actually is relatively modest:  It amounts to returning just 2 cents of every
dollar of the $11.5  trillion the federal government expects to collect in tax
revenues  over the next seven years. At the same time, the Washington elite 
often dismissed the $500-per-child tax cut as insignificant. For  most
hard-working American families, however, $500 is not only a  significant amount
of money, but could mean the difference  between paying and not paying the
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For instance, the $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate  100 percent of
the income tax liability for families of four earning  up to $24,000 a year and
more than 50 percent of the income tax  liability for a family of four earning
$30,000 a year.  Moreover, while $500 may buy only a hammer in Washington, it
would  buy much more for the average family with two children. For  example, the
$500-per-child tax credit would cover any of the  following expenses for an
average family with two children:

allowing families and retirees to keep and  spend their own money. It is the

<P>Americans are suffering from an income tax system that  punishes hard work,

</P>
<P>

<P>Each of the income tax code's many shortcomings can be  addressed by
targeted legislation, but a far better approach is  simply to replace the
existing system with a flat tax. Whether the goal  is to address the major flaws
outlined earlier in this chapter or to  fix 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  one of the current system's many
specific problems, the flat  tax does the job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There have been many flat tax proposals over the years, but  they all share
certain key features. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>One low tax rate -</B> All flat tax proposals have a single
tax rate  that applies to all income subject to tax. The actual rate imposed 
varies, but the upper limit would be about 20 percent. The  Armey/Shelby flat
tax legislation, for instance, begins with a 20 percent  rate which phases down
to 17 percent after a couple of years.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions -</B>
All pure  flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the tax code that bestow 
preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities.  Included in
this would be special tax breaks for businesses and  corporations and, for
individual taxpayers, the home mortgage interest  deduction, the charitable
contributions deduction, and the state and  local income and property tax
deductions. The combination of no  preferences, one low rate, and a generous
family allowance would  allow taxpayers to file their tax returns on a
postcard-size form.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>One-time taxation of income  -</B> Flat tax proposals are designed  to
eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by  ending the double
(and sometimes triple and quadruple) taxation of  income generated through
savings and investment. This is  achieved by ensuring that all income,
regardless of how it is earned or  how it is spent, is treated equally. Several
important tax policy  decisions flow from this principle, including repeal of
the estate  and gift tax, elimination of the double taxation of capital gains 
and dividend income, and neutral treatment of savings, either  through 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  an unlimited IRA or through
elimination of taxes on interest  income. <TT><B><A

<P><B>Benefits of a Flat Tax</B>

<P>
</P>
<P>By addressing so many problems in the existing tax code, the  flat tax would
have an immediate and dramatic impact.  Included among the many benefits are:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Faster economic growth -</B> A flat tax would spur
increased  work, saving, and investment. According to many economists, the rise 
in productive behavior would likely add one percentage point to  the annual rate
of economic growth. How significant is this?  An  increase in the growth rate of
just one-half of one percentage  point would boost an average family of four's
yearly income by  more than $5,000 after ten years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Instant wealth creation -</B> The value of financial assets is 
determined by the after-tax income they generate over time. By  eliminating the
second, third, and fourth layers of taxation on  capital income, a flat tax
therefore would significantly boost the value  of all income-producing assets.
According to Professor  Dale Jorgenson of the Harvard Economics Department,
enactment of  a flat tax would boost wealth immediately by some $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Simplicity -</B> 600-plus tax forms would be swept into the trash  and
replaced by two simple postcard-size forms. Wage, salary,  and pension income
would be reported on the individual form,  and business and capital income would
be reported on the  business form. Neither form would require more than a few
minutes  to compile, substantially reducing the 5.4 billion hour yearly  burden
of today's tax code.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fairness -</B> All taxpayers and all income would be treated  equally. A
taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his  neighbor would pay ten times
as much in taxes. Successful entrepreneurs  no longer would be penalized by
discriminatory tax rates, and  no longer would the politically well-connected by
able to benefit  from special loopholes and preferences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>An end to micromanagement and political favoritism -</B> All 
deductions, credits, exemptions, loopholes, and preferences would  be
eliminated. Politicians would lose their ability to pick winners  and losers,
reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax code  to impose their values
on the economy. Investment decisions  would be guided by economic forces rather
than tax considerations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased civil liberties -</B> The complexity of the tax code makes  it
nearly impossible for taxpayers or IRS agents to follow the law.  A greatly
simplified tax code would eliminate virtually all of  the conflicts and
controversies that make the IRS one of the  most feared agencies of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Help for families -</B> The flat tax does have one exemption: All 
taxpayers, based on family size, are allowed to protect a base  amount of income
from taxation. In the Armey/Shelby legislation, a  family of four would not pay
taxes on income of less than $33,300. As  the attached <a href="tax_13.gif">chart</a> illustrates, this
large &quot;tax-free&quot; amount results  in either zero or very low tax rates
for lower - and  middle-income taxpayers.

<P>In addition to rescuing Americans' retirement income, this  package also
would solve one of the major economic problems of  the current system  its
negative effect on savings. Because  taxpayers are under the illusion that the
government will take care of  their retirement, they have reduced their savings
significantly.  This means fewer resources with which to finance future 
economic growth. Lower levels of saving mean less money for consumers  to borrow
to buy cars and fewer funds available to families looking  to buy their first
home. Perhaps most important, a low level of  savings means that businesses and
entrepreneurs will not have  as much access to the capital they need to invest
in the future  productivity  and wages  of American workers.

<P><B>Q. How much faster will the economy grow with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Estimates vary, but reliable projections indicate the  economy's
growth rate will be somewhere between one-half of one  percent and one percent
higher for several years following the  enactment of a flat tax. What does this
mean?  If the economy grows just  one-half of one percent faster each year, the
average family of four  will enjoy more than $5,000 of additional income by the
tenth year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will the elimination of the home mortgage interest  deduction hurt
the housing industry?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> Washington lobbyists representing real estate agents paid a 
consulting group to do a study of the flat tax. Not surprisingly,  the
consulting group concluded that a flat tax would lower  housing values by 15
percent. Independent research, however, has  found 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  this result to be completely
unfounded. Indeed, if the itemized  deduction is so critical, why did the
housing market do so well in  the 1980s when lower tax rates increased the
after-tax cost of  home mortgage interest payments by as much as 135 percent? 
As  the above <a href="tax_14.gif">chart</a> illustrates, there appears to be no correlation  whatsoever
between the value of the itemized reduction and either  home sales or home
values. Instead, the key to strong real estate  markets is a growing economy.
This is why realtors, homebuilders,  and homeowners will benefit from a flat
tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would charities be harmed if the charitable contributions  deduction
was eliminated?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As is the case with housing, the evidence from the  1980s clearly
shows that charities have nothing to fear from a flat  tax. The graphs
demonstrate that charitable contributions more  than doubled during the 1980s
even though the tax benefit of giving  fell sharply. Likewise, the numbers show
that charitable giving  rises with income; thus, since a flat tax will boost
income, charities  will benefit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are there any groups that would pay more under a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The flat tax is not a free lunch. Aggressive users of tax 
shelters could face higher tax bills. Wealthy wage earners who create  business
losses to cancel out their tax liabilities will lose that  gimmick under a flat
tax. Many businesses could see their tax bills go up  as well. Needless to say,
the political prospects for a flat tax  increase to the extent that the number
of &quot;losers&quot; is minimized. This is  a strong argument for maximizing
the size of the tax cut that  accompanies tax reform.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do some opponents say dividends and interest would  not be taxed
with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Probably because they do not understand how the  proposal works.
Under the flat tax, capital income is taxed at the  business level. What changes
is that corporate profits are no longer  subject to a second layer of tax at the
individual level. In a flat tax  system, a dividend check becomes analogous to a
worker's paycheck   an amount of money left after taxes already have been paid. 
Similarly, interest income is taxed by making it non-deductible to  the
borrower. A company with $1 million in interest payments,  for instance, would
pay $170,000 in taxes on that amount. To tax  this income a second time by
including it in the taxable income of  the recipient would be double taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to the capital gains tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Like all other provisions which double or triple tax income,  the
capital gains tax disappears. Individual taxpayers who buy  assets have paid
taxes on that income already. Whether that asset goes  up or down in value after
the purchase does not matter, since the  tax already has been paid. Businesses,
because they are able to  deduct the cost of purchasing assets, would pay tax on
asset sales.  This taxes the capital gain (if any exists), but avoids double
taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will the estate tax disappear with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Estate and gift taxes are one of the clearest examples of  double
and triple taxation in the current tax code and will be  eliminated under the
flat tax. In addition to protecting the taxpayer from  hav
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  ing to pay additional taxes on
income that already has been  taxed, abolishing the estate tax prevents family
businesses and  farms from being sold off for tax purposes. Another argument for
 elimination is that the estate tax drains private capital from the  economy
that is needed to finance future economic growth.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to the IRS?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No tax reform proposal will eliminate the IRS. As long as  the
government intends to claim $1.4 trillion of tax revenue,  some level of tax
collection authority will be required. By radically  simplifying the tax code
and eliminating the provisions that cause  the most conflict (alternative
minimum tax, depreciation,  capital gains, itemized deductions, etc.), the flat
tax will significantly  reduce IRS abuses. For individual taxpayers, the only
things the  IRS will be able to question are total income and number of
children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will a flat tax encourage job creation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> A flat tax will encourage more jobs and higher wages by  boosting
incentives to work, save, and invest. In the long run, the  elimination of most
of the tax code's bias against savings and  investment will have the biggest
effect. As studies show, a flat tax  will encourage capital formation, leading
over time to higher levels  of productivity, increased wages, and more jobs. A
flat tax also  will have a more immediate impact on job creation, however, by 
making work more attractive. High tax rates drive a wedge  between what it costs
a business to employ a worker and how much  the worker receives in take-home
pay. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#15">15</A></B></TT>  By
increasing the cost  of labor, taxes lower the number of workers a company is
willing  to hire. Businesses do not exist to pay workers more than they  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  worth. They exist to make money
and will hire only as long as  the value of each new worker's additional output
exceeds the total  cost of employing that worker.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When politicians enact policies that raise the cost of  employment, the
total cost of some workers will rise above the value they  bring their
employers. In the long run, a business has only two  options when faced with
this predicament: close its doors or lay off  workers who are net money losers.
Even workers who retain their  jobs pay a price. Taxes on labor income, whether
paid by employee  or employer, dollar for dollar, unavoidably reduce the amount 
that finds its way into their paychecks. Politicians may pretend  otherwise, but
every time the tax burden climbs, workers' after-tax  income declines. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#16">16</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> This depends on which flat tax is implemented. More 
specifically, it depends on the tax rate and whether the proposal  includes
limits on government spending. Even though lower rates  generally stimulate
economic growth and expand the tax base, at some  point they translate into less
revenue. A flat tax of 20 percent, for  instance, almost certainly would raise
more money than a flat tax  of 10 percent. The size of the personal
exemption/family  allowance also plays a key role, since the decision to protect
a certain  amount of income ($36,800 for a family of four in last year's Armey 
bill) generally means the rate on taxable income must be higher.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to a Treasury Department analysis leaked to the  media before the
1994 elections, the Administration estimates that  the Armey flat tax would
result in a $244 billion revenue loss to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  federal government in 1995. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#17">17</A></B></TT>  But this study contained
a  $500 billion error, as the Department later  admitted, <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#18">18</A></B></TT> and used the 17 percent
rate to analyze 1995 revenues even though the Armey  bill calls explicitly for
an initial rate of 20 percent (which would  be phased down to 17 percent). The
Treasury Department now  claims that, once fully phased in, the Armey flat tax
would &quot;cost&quot;  the government as much as $186 billion per year. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#19">19</A></B></TT> Because it  is based on
static analysis, however, this figure assumes that  reduced tax rates and
simplification would have no positive effect on  the economy. Hence, it ignores
the additional revenues produced  by income growth (as well as the binding caps
on federal  spending that the Armey bill would impose). <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#20">20</A>
</B></TT></P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>A flat tax almost certainly would reduce long-term  government borrowing
since its reduced rates and lower taxes on savings  and investment would boost
economic growth. Each year, the  result would be an expanding tax base and at
least some reduction  in outlays for certain means-tested programs and the 
unemployment compensation system. According to one relatively modest  estimate
of supply-side impact, a flat tax would increase the  economy's long-run annual
growth rate by just 0.5 percent. By the tenth  year, national economic output
would be $578 billion higher than  it would have been without a flat tax. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#21">21</A>
</B></TT> Government's &quot;share&quot;  of this production of additional goods
and services would be $86  billion in tax revenue. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#22">22</A></B></TT>  By the twentieth year,
added growth of  0.5 percent would mean an increase of more than $2 trillion in 
GDP and additional tax revenues in excess of $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The revenue feedback from higher growth, however,  probably would not be
enough in the short term to offset the revenue  lost from lower tax rates and
elimination of the multiple taxation  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  capital income. Achieving a
deficit-neutral flat tax (at least  the Armey version) would require some
restraints on  government spending. And if lawmakers were forced to balance the
budget  by 2002, the limit on spending increases would have to be even  more
stringent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What would happen to the price of other assets?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> While the potentially negative impact on housing markets  and
charity appears negligible, the positive impact on  income-producing assets
would be large. Assets such as stocks, bonds, and  rental properties produce a
stream of income over time. Their  market price is determined by calculating how
much income an asset  will produce over time, after taxes, adjusted to reflect
the fact that  income today is worth more than the same amount of nominal 
income in the future. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#23">23</A></B></TT>
 By lowering tax rates and removing  the double and sometimes triple taxation of
capital income, a flat  tax can increase dramatically the after-tax income
stream an asset  will generate. Thus, a low-rate flat tax would be a boon to
asset  holders, offsetting any theoretical fall in housing prices, and  would
stimulate a surge of new investment in the economy. Harvard  professor and tax
economist Dale Jorgenson estimates that a flat  tax would increase national
wealth by $1  trillion. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#24">24</A></B></TT>
 While this may seem high, it should be remembered that the mere  announcement
in Israel that a capital gains tax was being imposed caused the  Israeli stock
market to drop by 10 percent in just one  day.<TT><B>
<A HREF="ftnt2.htm#25">25</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax benefit everybody?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> If the question is considered narrowly (will anyone's tax  bill
rise?) it depends on how a flat tax is structured. If it is designed  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  give the government as much money
as it receives under the  current system, and if there is no consideration of
the increased  revenue that would accrue from new job creation and higher 
economic growth, then it is impossible to avoid having winners  and losers. In
the long run, a flat tax presumably would generate  higher incomes and living
standards, raising after-tax income even  for those who suffered a short-term
tax increase. At the same time,  it doubtless would have an adverse impact on
the lawyers,  accountants, and lobbyists who profit from the current law's
complexity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many flat tax proposals are structured so that few taxpayers,  if any, would
have higher tax bills. This is because they are  designed to go beyond
simplification and rate reduction to include  significant tax cuts for the
American economy. The Armey plan is  a good example. Using static estimating
techniques, it  probably would save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars
over a  five-year period. While the combination of a 17 percent tax rate  and
generous family exemption would not necessarily guarantee  lower tax bills for
everyone, few would face higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is there a way to stop politicians from raising tax rates in  the
future?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is no guarantee that a future Congress would not turn  a
simple flat tax back into a complicated &quot;progressive&quot; tax. This  is
the Achilles' Heel of tax reform. The sweeping reform enacted  in 1986 expanded
the tax base by eliminating many deductions  while simultaneously reducing tax
rates to keep the total tax burden  from climbing. Skeptics warned that
politicians could not be trusted  to honor this arrangement and that eventually
they would raise  rates while failing to restore deductions. This is exactly
what  happened 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  under Presidents Bush and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Could this happen with a flat tax?  Using the promise of low  tax rates,
could politicians take away the home mortgage interest  deduction, the
charitable contributions deduction, and other tax  preferences but then raise
tax rates in the future?  It is to reduce  this danger that most proponents of a
flat tax include an ironclad  provision to make raising tax rates difficult or
impossible. One way  to accomplish this would be by amending the Constitution to
 require that no increase in tax rates can be approved without the votes  of at
least three-fifths or two-thirds (in other words, a  &quot;super-majority&quot;)
of both the House and  Senate. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#26">26</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the income tax be abolished instead?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Proponents of a flat tax note that the current &quot;progressive&quot;
 income tax penalizes growth, discourages savings and  investment, imposes heavy
compliance costs, destroys jobs, and  reduces America's international
competitiveness. It has been pointed  out, moreover, that a flat rate income tax
reduces but does not  eliminate these negative effects. Thus, the question for
some  becomes whether it would be better to replace the income tax with a sales 
or &quot;consumption&quot; tax. Proponents of this view, including  House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX)  and Senator Richard Lugar
(R-IN), usually suggest that the  foregone revenue could be offset by spending
cuts, consumption taxes,  or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most advocates of a flat tax recognize that this argument is  sound, at
least in theory. Abolishing the income tax, closing down  the Internal Revenue
Service, and repealing the 16th  Amendment 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  clearly would be in the national
interest. Eliminating the  income tax would lead to even more economic growth
and job  creation than would occur under a flat tax. The real question is how 
that goal can be achieved.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Supporters of the flat tax have decided that eliminating the  income tax is
unlikely, especially in the short run. Because so many  interest groups benefit
from the current tax system, enacting a flat  tax will be difficult by itself.
Moreover, there is some concern  that proposals to abolish the income tax could
play into the hands  of those who want a national sales tax, or value added tax
(VAT),  as an add-on tax. If implemented as a replacement for the income  tax,
either of these would be less destructive to the economy. The  experiences of
other countries, however, suggest that, while a  VAT would be implemented with
the promise to eliminate other  taxes, politicians would never take that second
step. The country  then would have the worst of both worlds: income and direct 
consumption taxes. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#27">27</A> 
</B></TT>In any event, enacting a flat tax is probably  necessary as an interim
measure for those who favor eliminating the  income tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Probably, but it depends on how the flat tax is structured.  The
marriage penalty refers to the increased tax faced by a  married couple compared
to two single people with similar incomes.  This penalty is most severe for
couples with similar earnings. A flat  tax automatically solves part of this
problem by making it no  longer possible for one spouse's income to push a
couple into a higher  tax bracket. But the marriage penalty also arises if the
personal  exemption for a married couple is not twice the size of the  exemption

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  for those filing singly. The
Armey proposal solves this part of  the problem by giving a married couple twice
the exemption of  a single filer. Nevertheless, a flat tax could be constructed
that  retains this penalty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How would a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It would be possible to reform the personal income tax 
dramatically while leaving the corporate income tax untouched. As  mentioned
earlier, many businesses file using the personal tax code,  so many of their
problems would be solved by a flat tax that left  the corporate tax code
untouched. All flat taxes based on the  Hall/Rabushka model, however, reform
both the personal and  corporate income tax codes. Under the Armey proposal, for
instance,  the business rate would fall to 17 percent, the same as the  personal
rate, and the code would be reformed to eliminate the excess  taxation of
capital.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A flat tax can be designed to include substantial reform of  Social Security
and Medicare payroll taxes. Under current law,  payroll taxes totaling 15.3
percent are levied on the first $61,600 of  income (7.65 percent each from
employer and employee,  though economists agree that the entire tax is borne by
the  worker). <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#28">28</A></B></TT>
 Although none has reached legislative form, some flat tax plans  incorporate
the payroll tax, making the total marginal tax rate a  fixed percentage
regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax help America compete?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> The historic tax rate reductions launched by Ronald Reagan  in
the 1980s caused a chain reaction around the world. Many  nations 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 53 -->  followed America's example and
have made similarly  dramatic reductions in marginal tax rates in recent years.
In large part,  this worldwide shift in tax policy was driven by competition as 
investors avoided nations with high tax rates. Unfortunately,  America seems to
be one of the few nations that have not learned from  the experience of the
1980s. While the rest of the world has been  cutting taxes, the United States
stands alone as the only major  nation to impose sharply higher tax rates in
recent years. Investors  have reacted accordingly, and the amount of new
investment in  American jobs and business from overseas has dropped from an 
average of $175 billion per year during the low tax years of the 1980s to  an
average of only $108 billion in 1990. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#29">29</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to capital gains taxes and estate taxes under a  flat
tax?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> They are all eliminated. One of the key principles of a flat tax 
is that income is taxed only once. A capital gain for a financial  asset is
simply a reflection that the market's expectation of the  after-tax streams of
income from that asset has risen. Under a flat tax,  that income is taxed at the
business level when it is realized. To tax  the capital gain is double taxation.
Similarly, the estate tax is a  second layer of tax on earning which, under the
current system,  already has been taxed at least once.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Bill Clinton has recommended that the United States give more money to institutions like the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/Welcome.html">World Bank</a>. The Clinton Administration has obligated the U.S. to contribute $800 million to one of the Bank's agencies, the International Development Agency.<sup>2</sup>  This is about $100 million more than was requested for the last fiscal year. Spending more on the World Bank ignores the overwhelming evidence that its programs have done little to promote economic growth in less developed countries. Moreover, it ignores the economic lessons of what really causes countries to develop.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since its founding in 1944, the World Bank has been involved in over 165 countries. The Bank argues that less developed countries stand little chance to prosper economically without substantial subsidized loans from the developed world. It further contends that it is uniquely positioned to meet this challenge and that it must continue to transfer capital to poor countries.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank is wrong. The data show that most long-term recipients of World Bank money are no better off today then they were when they received their first loan. Many are actually worse off. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 66 less developed countries receiving money from the World Bank for more than 25 years (most for more than 30 years), 37 are no better off today than they were before they received such loans.
<p>
<li>Of these 37 countries, most (20 in all) actually are poorer today than they were before receiving aid from the Bank.
</ul> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Former less developed countries that have prospered over the past 30 years did so by freeing up the productive forces of their economies. The best examples are Hong Kong and Singapore. Even though a country like Singapore received a small amount of money from the World Bank, the evidence shows that what most effected economic growth was not World Bank aid, but economic freedom.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress would do well to take a critical look at the World Bank's history and programs. If it does, it will find that the Bank's approach to economic development has not worked. Rather than let the Bank try to reform itself, as it claims it has tried repeatedly to do in the past, the U.S. should withdraw financial support altogether. Specifically, the U.S. Congress should:
<ul><li>
<b>Phase out financial support for the World Bank.</b> Last year the U.S. paid $1.2 billion to the World Bank. In addition, the U.S. has pledged some $28 billion to the World Bank that has not been disbursed. However, the Bank can call on the U.S. at any time to disburse funds up to this amount. While it would be best to end any future liabilities by terminating all World Bank funding immediately, at the very least Congress should begin to phase out funding for the Bank by cutting this year's budget request to no more than 50 percent of the current level. All funding should be terminated by 2002.
<p>
<li><b>Seek a General Accounting Office audit of World Bank lending practices.</b> The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) long has analyzed the effectiveness of such foreign aid programs. A new study should be commissioned to analyze the effectiveness of current World Bank lending practices.
<p>
<li><b>Make remaining funding contingent on public access to World Bank records and information.</b> The World Bank is a highly secretive organization, which blocks the ability of outsiders to monitor its effectiveness. Congress should make further funding contingent on the full release of World Bank records and information.
<p>
<li><b>Require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries.</b> Congress should require the U.S. Representative to the World Bank, Jan Piercy, to provide it with a report detailing the economic conditions that exist in countries that receive World Bank loans and grants.
</ul><p>
<b>WHAT IS THE WORLD BANK?</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Officially named the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the World Bank was founded in 1944 by the 44 nations that met at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to establish a new post-war international economic system. Today, the Bank has 178 members; only 12 nations are not members. The United States is the largest contributor, providing some $53 billion since 1944.<sup>3</sup>  Even though the U.S. has reduced its funding as a percentage of the Bank's total deposits from 29.3 percent in 1965 to 17.5 percent in 1995, it remains the Bank's largest donor and has pledged more money to the Bank than any other country.<sup>4</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
World Bank members provide contributions based on the size of their economies. The larger and wealthier the economy, the more the country is likely to give. A country's voting power is based on the amount of its contributions. Since the U.S. is the biggest donor, it therefore has the most voting power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank is governed by several bodies. These are:
<p><ol>
<b><li> The Board of Governors.</b> Overall authority resides with a president and a board of governors. The board includes one individual from each member country. It meets annually to receive a report on financial matters from the executive directors, an elected group of 25 representatives from the Bank's total membership. The board also reviews any other matters that the executive directors present to it.
<P>
<b><li> Executive Directors.</b> General operations are overseen by a 25-member group of executive directors: one representative from each of the five largest donors (the United States, Japan, Germany, France, and Britain) and 20 elected by the remaining 174 donor countries. This group reviews loan proposals submitted by the president of the Bank and has the final authority to approve or decline a loan.
<p>
<b><li> The President.</b> The president of the World Bank is appointed by the executive directors, typically for a five-year term. Though no written article requires it, traditionally the president is an American. The current president, James D. Wolfensohn, formerly an international investment banker, was appointed to a five-year term on June 1, 1995.
</ol> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Arms of the World Bank.</b> There are several institutions that make up the World Bank, each with a unique mission. Throughout its 50-year history, members of the Bank have created many arms, known collectively as "the World Bank Group."<sup>5</sup>  These are the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Each has its own mission and goals.
<p><ol>
<b><li> The International Finance Corporation (IFC).</b> The Bank established the IFC in 1956 to provide loan guarantees and subsidized loans to businesses in less developed countries. These loans, usually long-term, are focused on equity investment (like stock markets) and similar lending. Interest rates are supposed to be the going market rates, which vary between countries and with the proposed project. Maturity on the loans is generally 13 years, with a grace period of up to eight years. Some 80 percent of the funding is borrowed by the Bank from international financial markets and through public bond issues. The rest is borrowed from the IBRD. Each year, the IFC approves some $4 billion to $5 billion in new financing.<sup>6</sup>  In 1995, the U.S. contributed $36 million to the IFC.
<p>
<b><li>The International Development Association (IDA).</b> The Bank established the IDA in 1960 to provide assistance to poor countries that cannot afford to borrow money from the IBRD. The funds are provided separately by donor nations and through IBRD investment profits. Two types of loans have been offered through this branch of the Bank: IDA credits and Special Fund credits. The IDA no longer makes Special Fund credits, but many are still in effect. Special Fund credits were granted with a 50-year maturity and a 10-year grace period during which no interest was applied. The interest rate on these credits is merely 0.75 percent. IDA credits are now the IDA's sole lending vehicle. They have the same service charge as was applied to the Special Fund credits. They also have the same 10-year grace period, but a shorter maturity of 35 or 40 years.
<p>
The United States also is the largest shareholder in the IDA, holding some 15 percent of the total votes in 1995. The U.S. has contributed some $21 billion since 1960,<sup>7</sup> and contributed $1.1 billion in FY 1995 alone.
<p>
<b><li> The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).</b> The Bank established the ICSID in 1966 to promote an increased flow of international investment to areas of the world where foreign investors chose not to invest. The ICSID arbitrates disputes, helps put countries seeking investment in touch with investors, and provides advice, analysis, and studies on investment opportunities around the world.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<b><li> The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).</b> The Bank established MIGA in 1988 to remove some of the risk for investors investing in poor countries. MIGA provides investors with guarantees on many types of investments. It also provides governments with advice on improving their investment climate to attract more foreign investment. MIGA may insure up to 90 percent of an investment, with a current limit of $50 million per project. In 1995, it guaranteed some $672 million in investments and had another $210 million in outstanding credits.<sup>9</sup>  The U.S. contributed $22 million to MIGA in 1995.
</ol> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>How the World Bank Makes Loans and Grants.</b> Each year the Bank considers many loans. Though loan proposals officially are submitted by the president of the Bank to the executive directors, in reality the executive directors often work with the president's staff to develop proposals. Thus, the approval process is often merely a formality. The United States has no veto power over Bank loans, and the Bank frequently approves loans that the U.S. has opposed.<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Bank's funds are derived from country contributions and from investments the Bank makes in financial markets. The Bank sells bonds and other debt securities to pension funds, insurance companies, corporations, other banks, and individual investors. Its original source of income is contributions by member countries. Countries receiving loans are charged an interest rate, currently 7.27 percent. This rate is adjusted every six months. Maturity on the loans is generally from 15 to 20 years, with a five-year grace period.
<p>
<b>HISTORY OF THE WORLD BANK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank has undergone a major transformation since it started in 1944. The Bank claims it has kept up with change to deal with the new challenges facing less developed countries. This contention is debatable, but it is true that the fundamental mission today is substantially different from what it was in 1944.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Lender of Last Resort.</b> In the beginning, the Bank's primary mission was to loan money to the war-ravaged countries of Western Europe and Japan to help them get on their feet after World War II. These loans were intended to help rebuild roads, bridges, electrical plants, and other public facilities and enterprises.<sup>11</sup>  Japan and the European countries would use World Bank loans when private bank loans were not forthcoming. Many private commercial banks refused to lend these nations money because they were bad risks, some of them having defaulted on World War I and post-World War I debts.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From 1944 to the mid-1950s, most World Bank loans went to the developed countries in Europe that had suffered extensive damage in World War II. Therefore, even though the Bank loaned some $543 million for the reconstruction of Europe, the money was absorbed by countries that essentially were advanced developed economies with strong economic foundations in banking, property rights protection, the rule of law, functioning courts, and borders open to foreign investment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because these countries already had the basic building blocks of an advanced economy, they were able to put the World Bank loans to productive use. Yet U.S. private investment in post-war Europe played a larger role in reconstruction than the World Bank. The World Bank loaned Western European countries $543 million from 1945-1950, while U.S. private investment was $1.76 billion for the same period.<sup>12</sup>  Therein lies the real success story of Europe's recovery. While it is true that funding from the World Bank, other financial institutions, and the Marshall Plan helped rebuild war-torn Europe, the biggest impact on Europe's economic recovery came from private foreign investment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>An International Welfare Agency.</b> By the late 1950s, it became clear that the World Bank had served its purpose. Europe and Japan were well on their way to recovering from World War II. Private foreign investment was pouring into these regions to take advantage of their renewed economic strength. America realized its economic dominance in the world as U.S. investment flowed abroad to fuel economic development and growth. At this time, the Bank faced a fundamental choice: It could dissolve because its major goal had been met, or it could evolve into something not imagined by its creators.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Eventually, the World bank decided on the second course. By the mid-1960s, the Bank began to transform itself from a lender of last resort to an international welfare agency to assist the poor and less developed countries of the world. In 1960, for example, the Bank created the International Development Agency (IDA), which makes subsidized loans to poor countries either unable to afford private commercial loans or regarded as bad credit risks. Even though the original mission statement made casual reference to the "less developed" world, the Bank's founders largely had envisioned this as purely advisory. Yet the Bank began to give more than advice to less developed countries; in the 1960s, it began to give them substantial loans. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>McNamara's Brainchild.</b> The mastermind of this transformation was former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who took charge of the World Bank in 1968. To fund McNamara's new international welfare clearinghouse, the Bank had to seek ever-increasing levels of contributions from donor countries. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also under McNamara's watch, the Bank formulated a new concept, called "sustainable development," that became the IDA's principal mission. Stated simply, this means that less developed countries can achieve sustainable levels of economic development only if enough resources are transferred from wealthy countries to poor countries. If loans are any measure of success, McNamara was "successful" indeed. By 1981, when McNamara resigned as president of the World Bank, lending had grown more than tenfold, from $883 million to $12 billion. World Bank lending and grants continue to grow, today totaling over $20 billion.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The World Bank remains fully committed to this kind of thinking, with most of its bureaucrats dedicated to the McNamara dogma. A book published in 1995 by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to commemorate their 50-year anniversary claims that "This institutional evolution has been matched by a changing approach to development. The early focus on discrete projects has evolved into a broader emphasis on policies, strategies, and institutions, and a more holistic approach to development.... [The World Bank] Group's primary concern is to help borrowers reduce poverty and improve living standards by promoting sustainable growth and investment in people."<sup>14</sup>  In other words, the World Bank is not the institution created in 1944 by the Bretton Woods Agreement; it has changed from lender of last resort to international welfare agency.
<p>
<b>DECADES OF FAILED POLICIES</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While many of the Bank's economists are free to acknowledge the importance of macroeconomic reform in the recipe for economic growth, many of the Bank's officials continue to place too much emphasis on the importance of multilateral institutions to less developed countries. For example, former World Bank President Lewis T. Preston said in 1995: "Of fundamental importance, the Bank Group has evolved from being simply a financier of development to being also a trusted advisor on development, sharing its global experience of what does and does not work and helping its member countries to apply the lessons.... Fifty years of experience have validated the Bank Group's fundamental objective today: helping borrowers reduce poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people."<sup>15</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus, the Bank seems to claim not only that it has been successful at reducing poverty and improving living standards in less developed countries, but also that its continued existence is vital to the economic prospects of less developed countries in the future. Yet all the evidence shows that this is not true. Since its inception, the World Bank has provided over $356 billion to countries around the world, mostly to the less developed world.<sup>16</sup>  But most recipients are no better off today than they were before receiving such aid. In fact, many are worse off. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 66 less developed countries receiving money from the World Bank for more than 25 years (most for at least 30 years), 37 are no better off today than they were before they received such loans (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>);<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>Of these 37 countries, 20 actually are worse off today than they were before receiving aid from the World Bank (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>);<p>

<li>Of these 20, eight have economies that have shrunk by at least 20 percent since their first World Bank loan (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>); and<p>

<li>The remaining 17 countries have economies today that are essentially the same as when they first received aid from the World Bank (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While many countries are no better off today than before they received money from the World Bank, some have performed particularly poorly.
<ul>
<li>From 1965 to 1995, Nicaragua received over $637 million in World Bank aid. Its per capita gross domestic product in 1965, measured in constant 1987 U.S. dollars, was $1,752. Today it is only $875, some 50 percent less than before Nicaragua received any aid.
<p>
<li>The African country of Niger received over $589 million in World Bank aid from 1965 to 1995. Yet its per capita GDP has shrunk by 54 percent, from $605 in 1965 to $280 today.
The evidence shows that the World Bank has a poor track record. One might expect that at least half of its recipients would be better off economically today then before they started receiving such aid, but this is not the case. Many are actually worse off. After nearly three decades, it seems clear that most long-term recipients of World Bank loans still are not achieving "sustainable development."
</ul><p>
<b>WHY WORLD BANK PROGRAMS FAIL</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The main reason for a lack of economic growth in these countries is a corresponding lack of economic freedom. A lack of economic freedom prevents countries from creating wealth and prosperity, and a recent worldwide survey of economic freedom finds that many World Bank recipients have economies that are mostly not free or repressed. <I>The 1996 Index of Economic Freedom</I>, published by The Heritage Foundation, analyzes the level of economic freedom in 142 countries.<sup>18</sup>  The study considers ten economic factors -- trade, taxation, government consumption, monetary policy, banking, foreign investment, wage and price controls, private property rights, regulation, and black markets -- and categorizes each country as having a "free," "mostly free," "mostly not free," or "repressed" economy. The findings of the study demonstrate that a majority of World Bank loan and grant recipients do not have significant levels of economic freedom:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 60 long-term recipients of World Bank aid that were graded in <I>The 1996 Index of Economic Freedom</I>, 37 have economies that are "mostly not free" or "repressed" (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
<p>
<li>Only 23 long-term recipients of World Bank aid have economies that are "mostly free," and none have economies that are "free" (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus, most long-term recipients of World Bank loans and grants still do not have significant levels of economic freedom. Moreover, those recipients that have performed particularly poorly are the least economically free:
<p><ul>
<li>he 18 countries whose economies have shrunk since they have been World Bank recipients, 16 have either "mostly not free" or "repressed" economies (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Economic prosperity is not forthcoming in these countries because they do not have economic freedom. Rather, most have high taxes, barriers to trade, restrictions on foreign investment, banking systems in disarray, onerous government regulations, bad monetary policies, extensive wage and price controls, and large black markets. To be sure, 23 long-term recipients of World Bank aid do have mostly free economies, but most of these are in Latin America, an area which has benefited from several years of economic reform. Thus, their categorization as having mostly free economies is a recent phenomenon.<sup>19</sup>  It is good that they are making progress, but given the evidence elsewhere in the world, it would be difficult to attribute this progress to help from the World Bank.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE: MODELS OF GROWTH WITHOUT WORLD BANK AID</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The poor record of the World Bank in delivering on its promise of economic development can be demonstrated not only by listing its many failures, but also by examining some development successes that occurred without the Bank's help. Hong Kong and Singapore are the most successful of the so-called Asian Tigers, running up phenomenal economic growth rates that are the envy of the developed world. They did this largely without loans from the World Bank. Even though they were as poor 30 years ago as other countries that took World Bank aid, they eschewed World Bank loans and embarked instead on successful programs of economic liberalization. The evidence shows that there is a direct correlation between the economic freedom these countries enjoy and their tremendous economic growth over the past 30 years. Of one thing there can be absolutely no doubt: World Bank assistance was in no way responsible for creating the best development success stories the world has seen during this 30-year period.
<p>
<b>Hong Kong </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the 1960s, the U.S. foreign aid community and international lending institutions like the World Bank decided that the East Asian region was barren of economic promise and that they should focus their aid on Africa instead. Hong Kong received no aid from the World Bank and only a small amount in U.S. foreign aid -- $43 million, most of which was cut off after 1965. The World Bank admitted that many economists misjudged the economic prospect in Asia. In the commemorative volume marking the Bank's 50th anniversary, the authors state: "In the 1960s, many economists were more optimistic about sub-Saharan Africa than East Asia. Yet, East Asia proved to be the 'miracle' of the developing world -- and sub-Saharan Africa its most daunting challenge."<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While eschewing foreign aid after 1965, Hong Kong at the same time began a massive economic liberalization program. This included reforms in many sectors, including banking and financial services, government regulation of business, and foreign investment laws. Among the most important of these reforms was lowering barriers to international trade and making Hong Kong's trade laws consistent with international standards. The government eliminated virtually all tariffs, duties, licensing requirements, and other import barriers. It also set up export processing zones, or "free trade areas," that allowed manufacturers to cut through red tape to sell their products overseas.<sup>21</sup>  These reforms enabled Hong Kong to create a large export industry which provided much of the fuel for Hong Kong's economic growth.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another critically important reform took place when Hong Kong established a tax structure that allows individuals and businesses to keep most of the wealth they create. For example, Hong Kong has a flat tax of 20 percent on incomes over $155,000. The worker making the average income of about $22,500 is taxed only 2 percent. Hong Kong's corporate tax rate is a flat 16.5 percent, compared to 35 percent in the U.S.<sup>22</sup>  These and other economic reforms helped turn Hong Kong into the economic powerhouse it is today.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

After these economic reforms were in place, Hong Kong's economy indeed took off. GDP increased 9.2 percent a year from 1970 to 1980. From 1980 to 1993, it increased an additional 6.5 percent.<sup>23</sup>  Overall, over the past 35 years, Hong Kong's per capita GDP has grown an astonishing 530 percent, with most of this growth occurring since the beginning of economic liberalization.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
<b>Singapore </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Singapore also exhibited little economic promise in the early 1960s, according to the economic forecasts of the day. In fact, it was often referred to as "Asia's Cuba."<sup>25</sup>  The World Bank gave most of its loans to Singapore -- some $93 million -- before 1970. Singapore received its last World Bank loan in 1975.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As World Bank loans were drying up, Singapore, like Hong Kong, embarked on a course of economic liberalization -- with the same stunning results. Starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, Singapore instituted a series of economic reforms aimed at achieving two major goals. The first was to promote increased foreign investment and higher levels of exports. To this end, Singapore opened its market to foreign investors. By 1970, some 80 to 90 percent of all manufactured exports were derived from foreign investment.<sup>26</sup>  Why did foreign investment pour into Singapore?  There are many reasons. One surely was that Singapore's legal system, based in British common law, provided rule of law, an efficient legal system, and a way for investors to achieve protection of their investments through contracts. Equally important was the fact that Singapore established a foreign investment code, free of local content or production restrictions, that guaranteed equal treatment under the law for both domestic and foreign firms.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The second goal was to reform Singapore's tax system. Singapore adopted a tax system that reduced the burden on most of the people. For example, while the top tax rate is 30 percent, the tax on the average income level of $21,000 is little or none. In fact, the average Singapore worker must make almost $30,000 before paying taxes. For that first tax bracket, the rate is 19 percent.<sup>27</sup>  In addition, Singapore resisted the implementation of onerous business regulations; abolished trade restrictions on imports (the average tariff rate now is about 0.4 percent, compared to 3.3 percent in the U.S.); and has kept inflation below 3 percent a year since the mid-1970s.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These economic reforms helped increase Singapore's gross domestic product. From 1970 to 1980, GDP increased by 8.3 percent a year. From 1980 to 1993, it increased an additional 6.9 percent. Overall, Singapore's gross national product has increased by over 6 percent a year since 1965.<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hong Kong and Singapore have achieved the highest levels of economic prosperity to be found anywhere among the world's recently developed countries. In fact, they have achieved phenomenal economic growth rates that are the envy of the developed world. The evidence suggests that their policies of economic freedom are the principal reason for this success. There is a direct correlation between the economic freedom these countries have achieved and their tremendous economic growth over the past 30 years.<sup>29</sup>  There is also a direct correlation between this growth and a lack of aid from the World Bank. World Bank assistance was in no way responsible for creating the best development success stories the world has seen over the past 30 years (see <a href="bg1082c1.gif">Chart 1</a>):
<p>
<b>PHASING OUT SUPPORT FOR THE WORLD BANK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The facts show that the World Bank's approach to economic development is a failure. The facts also show that countries which adopt free market economic reforms can develop without aid from the World Bank or any other institution. Promises by the World Bank to reform have made little difference. The U.S. therefore should begin withdrawing its financial support. Specifically, Congress should:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Phase out financial support for the World Bank. </b>Ideally, the U.S. Congress would refuse immediately to appropriate any more money to the World Bank. But with current political realities, this approach seems unlikely. Therefore, the most workable approach would be for Congress to phase out U.S. funding over seven years. In the event the Clinton Administration refuses to sign onto a seven-year balanced budget, Congress then should seek to withdraw funding through the appropriations process.
<p>
<li><b>Seek a General Accounting Office audit of World Bank lending practices.</b> The General Accounting Office (GAO) long has performed intensive analyses of such programs as foreign aid. Many of these audits have concluded that much of the U.S. foreign aid program is fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse; in some cases, these audits have discovered that programs simply do not work. The last GAO report dealing specifically with the World Bank, published in 1994, found that most of the Bank's reforms have failed to make it more efficient and effective.<sup>30</sup>  Congress should call on the GAO to launch a new study of the effectiveness of World Bank lending, to focus on:
<p>
<b>1)</b> The economic performance of recipients of World Bank aid;
<p>
<b>2)</b> The effectiveness and efficiency of World Bank programs in meeting their stated goals;
<p>
<b>3)</b> The influence the World Bank has on encouraging recipient countries to adopt specific economic policies; and
<p>
<b>4)</b> Conducting an audit of the World Bank's financial records.
<p>
<li><b>Make remaining funding contingent on public access to World Bank records and information.</b> It is difficult to obtain detailed information on the recipients of World Bank loans, the conditions imposed on loan recipients, and the number and amount of loans in default. While the World Bank is an international organization, it is partly funded by the American taxpayer, who has a right to know how the money is being spent. The American public and Congress should have access to all of the Bank's financial records and information. As long as Congress continues to appropriate money for the World Bank, it should make that funding contingent on free and open access to World Bank information.
<p>
<li><b>Require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries.</b> While the World Bank continues to lend money to countries with little chance of growing economically, there is no accounting of the economic conditions in many of these countries. Congress should require the U.S. Representative to the World Bank, Jan Piercy, to provide Congress with a report detailing the economic conditions that exist in countries that receive World Bank funding. Specifically, the report should include information on the level of economic freedom that exists in the following areas: trade, taxation, government consumption, monetary policy, banking, foreign investment, regulation, wage and price controls, and property rights.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since 1944, the World Bank has spent $346 billion trying to advance economic development around the world, and not all of this money has been repaid. While it played an important role in getting Europe on its feet after World War II, the World Bank has drifted away from its original mission to become little more than a clearinghouse for international welfare. Most recipients of loans and grants are no better off today than when they first received them. In fact, many are worse off.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Clearly, the World Bank's approach to economic development is a failure. But while recipients of World Bank loans continue to wallow in poverty, countries like Hong Kong and Singapore continue to experience unprecedented growth. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While there is overwhelming evidence to show the futility of such aid, the U.S. continues to support this failed institution, providing over $50 billion to the Bank in 1995, including both monetary allocations and commitments. American policymakers should admit this failure and begin phasing out U.S. financial support for the World Bank over seven years. Not only will billions in U.S. taxpayer dollars be saved, but countries in the less developed world may be able finally to break the economic chains that have kept them impoverished.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year, Congress tried to cut the U.S.  foreign aid budget as part of its plan to reduce wasteful government spending and balance the federal budget deficit.  Moreover, both houses of Congress passed legislation that would have abolished the Agency for International Development, the U.S.  agency responsible for most of America's $13 billion foreign aid program, along with most of its functions.  Because the Clinton Administration fought these proposals, Congress was unable to make more significant cuts in foreign aid or eliminate these wasteful government functions.
The Clinton Administration says foreign aid supports America's interests overseas.  It claims, for example, that U.S.  aid helps America gain influence with countries around the world and that these countries generally support America's foreign policy goals.  A quick look at the facts, however, shows that these arguments are groundless.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One measurement of America's influence around the world is the voting records of U.S.  foreign aid recipients in the United Nations.  If a direct connection exists between foreign aid and winning friends overseas, as the Administration asserts, recipients should be voting with the U.S.  in the U.N.  most of the time.  In fact, they do not.  The data show that most recipients of foreign aid vote against the U.S.  most of the time.  Consider the following fact gathered from the 1995 U.N.  session:
<p><ul>
<li><b>64 percent of U.S.  foreign aid recipients</b> voted against the U.S.  a majority of the time.
<p>
<li><b>India,</b> the fifth-largest recipient with some $157 million in U.S.  foreign aid this year, voted against the U.S.  83 percent of the time.  That is as often as Cuba and more often than Iran.
<p>
<li><b>The ten countries</b> that voted against the U.S.  the most frequently will receive over $212 million in foreign aid in FY 1996 (see <a href="fyi101t1.gif">Table 1</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Seven of the ten largest recipients</b> of U.S.  foreign aid voted against the U.S.  a majority of the time (see <a href="fyi101t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Of the ten countries</b> that voted with the U.S.  the most often, nine are former Soviet bloc countries (see <a href="fyi101t3.gif">Table 3</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Egypt,</b> the second largest recipient of American foreign aid, voted against the U.S.  67 percent of the time.  This is worse than the 1994 session, when Egypt voted against the U.S.  65 percent of the time.  Egypt will receive some $2.2 billion in U.S.  foreign aid in FY 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Haiti,</b> where President Bill Clinton sent American troops to restore deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, voted against the U.S.  60 percent of the time during the1996 session.  Despite this, the U.S.  will send some $124 million in foreign aid to Haiti in FY 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Mexico,</b> where President Bill Clinton fought for a $40 billion international economic bailout, most of which will come from U.S.  taxpayers, voted against the U.S.  58 percent of the time.  In addition to its $40 billion economic bailout plan, the Clinton Administration has endorsed another $25 million in foreign aid for Mexico.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There may be many reasons why a country votes with or against the U.S.  at the U.N.  But it is clear from these data that foreign aid does not win friends where it counts:  in supporting U.S.  diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations.  Clearly, the U.S.  foreign aid program in general, and under the Clinton Administration in particular, has done little to justify public confidence that tax dollars are being used wisely by America's foreign aid bureaucracy.  President Clinton has defended two of his biggest foreign policy and economic initiatives -- "restoring" democracy in Haiti and the economic bailout of Mexico -- as in the U.S.  national interest.  Yet these countries seem to care little about Americas interests when it comes to supporting the U.S.  at the U.N.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should evaluate the extent to which U.S.  recipients of foreign aid support America's national interests.  U.N.  voting records clearly show that a majority of recipients of U.S.  foreign aid vote against the U.S.  most of the time.  In fact, the data show that some of these countries actually undermine U.S.  interests abroad.  For example, South Africa, America's sixth largest recipient of foreign aid is quickly extending relations to some of America's biggest enemies:  Cuba, Iran, and Libya.  This fiscal year, South Africa will receive some $132 million in U.S.  foreign aid.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why, then, is the U.S.  spending so much money on countries that obviously care little about America's interests abroad?  And why is the Clinton Administration fighting to save this program when most Americans are opposed to it?  This year, when the U.S.  foreign aid budget is scrutinized by Congress as a target for reaching a balanced budget, Congress would do well to cut the program further and seek to abolish the Agency for International Development.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans are increasingly anxious about the breakdown of the basic social
institutions of society.  Nowhere is this more visible than in the breakdown and
disappearance of neighborhoods. Many once-friendly  and peaceful neighborhoods
are now threatening and dangerous. Particularly alarming is the breakdown  of
marriage and the family. Marriage and the stable two-parent family form the
centerbeam of society,  but soaring rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock births
are destroying this crucial institution and weakening  the development of the
next generation. This means more welfare dependence, more crime, more health 
and behavioral problems, lower educational achievement, and the prospect of
daunting obstacles in later life  for millions of young Americans. Some 92
percent of children on welfare today are from broken  families. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm">1</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To a significant extent, government programs and policies have contributed
to this collapse. The  incentives within welfare programs over the last 30 years
have discouraged two-parent families among the poor.  These programs also have
discouraged work and responsible behavior.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Families also have come under assault from the tax system. Today the federal
income tax takes  one-fourth of the income of the average married family with
children  and state and local taxes increase the  total government take to 38
percent. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm">2</A></B></TT>  This
compares with just two percent in federal taxes paid by a  similar family just
after World War II. The rise in taxation is due in large part to the erosion,
through inflation, of  the personal exemption and the sharp rise in payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The next generation is already under assault from the present government's
spending habits. The  national debt is a $70,000 mortgage on the back of every
child under 18. Instead of allowing Americans to pass  a patrimony of wealth on
to their children, entitlement programs are eating their future earnings.
Children  have become not dependents, but providers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The collapse  almost extinction  of two-parent families in many
neighborhoods has contributed heavily  to the collapse of those neighborhoods.
The absence of fathers means there is no adult male financial  support, guiding
hand, or protection for children. The result: gangs of young men driven by a
destructive credo  in place of paternal guidance, young girls vulnerable to
abuse, children having children, and mindless,  violent crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, institutions in poor neighborhoods that once provided help and
guidance to those lacking it  at home have been crowded out by the burgeoning
welfare state. Caring and knowing local people have  been replaced by armies of
professional social workers and bureaucrats who emphasize rights and rules,  not
freedom and responsibility. Effective faith-based solutions to educational and
social deficiencies are  barred from receiving government funds to carry out
their work  and if they are able to receive support, it is  often only by giving
up their religious message.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain these elements in the decline of American
society, declines already well  ad
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  vanced in the inner cities and
growing in our suburbs, and they must warn electors that it will take  many
years to rebuild the social fabric because so much long-term damage has been
done. The key to  rebuilding society is rebuilding the family and unshackling
the institutions that complement the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Rebuilding society by rebuilding the family, however, requires reversing the
harmful effects of decades  of government social engineering. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The increase in illegitimacy.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, illegitimate births hovered at low rates. In recent decades,
however, this pattern has  changed radically. According to the most recent
statistics released by the Center for Health Statistics at the  U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, illegitimacy continues to rise rapidly and
marriage continues  to decline across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recently released HHS data show that out-of-wedlock births represented 31.0
percent of all births  in 1993, up from 30.1 percent just a year earlier. For
certain groups and parts of the country, the rates  are alarmingly high  as high
as 82 percent in one state. For all groups in all parts of the country, the
trend is  the same: steadily upwards at similar rates of increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among whites in 1993, 23.6 percent of births were out of wedlock, up from 11
percent in 1980.  Among blacks, 68.7 percent of births were out of wedlock in
1993, up from 58 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most useful tool in measuring the decline in marriage and the growth in
illegitimacy is the illegitimacy  rate (more formally called the illegitimacy
ratio). The illegitimacy rate or ratio measures the number of  out-of-wedlock
births in a given year as a percent of all births in that year. Thus, if there
were 100 births, and 30  of those births were out of wedlock, the illegitimacy
rate or ratio would be 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The illegitimacy rate is important because it measures the extent to which
illegitimacy is displacing  marriage in our society. Moreover, it is widely
recognized that illegitimacy is a profound underlying factor  contributing to
most other social problems. The illegitimacy rate is the best possible tool for
indicating the  potential magnitude of a wide array of future social problems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="soc_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the illegitimacy rate in the U.S. has increased rapidly
over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The continuing rise in the illegitimacy rate is propelled by three factors:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     A decline in the portion of women

<P>
</P>
<P>While the breakdown in family is occurring across the whole age spectrum, it
is most graphic in what  has happened among teenagers over the last 35 years, in
illegitimate births, in the flight from marriage, and in  the practice of
abortion.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Abortion and sex outside of marriage.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In terms of family breakdown and the threat to children not growing up in a
family once conceived,  the different rates of abortion within and outside of
marriage contribute to the severing of society's  former linking of children,
marriage, and sexual intercourse. There is only one large sample survey,
reported in  1989 by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which gives a snapshot of
the rates of abortion within and outside  of marriage. <TT><B><A

<P>
</P>
<P>If this ratio is applied (as the best approximation we have from research)
to the incidence of abortion  since 1973, then the following picture emerges:
The vast proportion of abortions occur among those  committed neither to the
child nor to a spouse  in other words, among the unattached. The best way to 
reduce abortion is to reduce sexual intercourse outside of marriage. This means
a cultural change that  depends primarily on the effectiveness of the family,
the church, and schools at their tasks; such a change is  not possible through
government action alone.

</P>
<P>If one adds the number of children entering broken families, either through
out-of-wedlock births or  through divorce, every year and plots them as a
proportion of the total entering life that year, one gets a fair  picture of the
proportion being affected by broken family life. This proportion has grown from
12 percent in  1950 to over 60 percent in 1992.

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Illegitimacy and divorce result in a disastrous emotional injury rate for
children, which means a  massively weakened future America. Even if the
illegitimacy rate declined sharply and permanently next year,  the effects on
children now being raised in broken families would be felt for generations to
come. Children  born out of wedlock or raised in a broken family suffer from:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;So substantial are the differentials associated with
illegitimacy,&quot; says Nicholas Eberstadt of Harvard  University and the
American Enterprise Institute, &quot;that an American baby born to a teenage
mother is less  likely to register low birth-weight if the mother is married and
black than if she is unmarried and white....  [I]nfant mortality rates for white
mothers over age twenty were higher for unmarried but college-educated  women
than for married high-school  or even grade school  dropouts. The same pattern
holds true among  black mothers.&quot; <TT><B><A

educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage  parents
themselves. All of these effects were greater for  boys. <TT><B><A

percent. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#28">28</A></B></TT>

<P>If one looks for the single biggest contributor to the rise in crime, two
factors stand out in the  research literature: the breakdown of the family and
the rise in illegitimacy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Five Stages in the Development of a Serious Criminal </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The five stages in the development of most serious criminals most frequently
have their beginnings in  the abandonment of the child by the father. Add abuse
and neglect in early childhood, and the child is on  his way to a serious life
of crime.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Stage One: Parental neglect and abandonment in early home
life</B> are characterized by different  combinations of the following:
fatherlessness, absence of a mother's love, parental fighting and domestic
violence, lack  of parental supervision and discipline, rejection of the child,
parental abuse and neglect, or criminal parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Two: The embryonic gang</B> emerges as young, unsocialized,
aggressive children, rejected by their  more normal peers, seek and find other
alienated children, fail at school, lose interest in education, and begin  to
run wild.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Three: The embryonic gang of grade school changes into a gang</B>
of tough, exploitative teenagers  who gradually become more and more expert in
crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Four: Violence emerges as a way of life</B> within the gang as the
more expert learn to do their  crime without getting caught.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Five: A new baby is born</B> to the now-criminal young father, who
stays with the child's mother for  a while before abandoning her and her child.
The mother comes from a background similar to the  young criminal father's.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The more single-parent families we put in place, the more likely it is that
increasing numbers of children  will experience this pathway to crime. Overall,
a 10 percent increase in illegitimacy leads to a 17  percent increase in serious
violent crime (see <a href="soc_8.gif">Chart 8</a>). With the continued rise in illegitimacy, we will
see more  and more violent criminals coming onto our streets as they reach their
mid-teenage years. And with the  appearance of these criminals, we will lose
more and more of our everyday freedoms, and will be forced to  pay other huge
social and economic costs.

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->

<P>Teenage drug use, particularly among 8th graders, is rising again as a
direct result of a change in  Administration policy.

<P>Dr. Lloyd Johnson, program director for the University of Michigan survey of
high school drug use,  &quot;Monitoring the Future,&quot; in recent testimony
before the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>There has been a sharp increase in the proportion of young
people using marijuana. These [increases]  are specific to American adolescence.
We are seeing a rate now that is two and a half times what it was  among the
eighth graders just four years ago; two times as high among the tenth graders
and half again as  high among the twelfth graders.... Certain attitudes and
beliefs and norms among our young people are critical  to the containment of use
of these drugs. And those are in erosion.... And the fact that a much larger
pool  of youngsters are now marijuana experienced creates a greater danger that
they will go on to use other drugs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This is a problem which we can deal with. We have been vastly more
successful at dealing with drug  use than we have with crime, for example....
This is a labile kind of behavior.... We can influence  it. <TT><B><A

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The number of Americans using illicit drugs plunged from a peak
of 24.7 million in 1979 to 11.4 million  in 1992. The so-called casual use of
cocaine fell by 79 percent between 1985 and 1992, while  monthly cocaine use
fell 55 percent between 1988 and 1992 alone, from 2.9 million to 1.3 million
users. Now  these reductions were dramatic and unprecedented and represented
nothing less than a cultural revolution  in attitudes towards drug use. Now
we're in danger of giving back all the ground we have won.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This is deadly serious business, since 12-17 year olds who use marijuana are
85 more times more likely  to graduate to cocaine than those who abstain from 
marijuana. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#45">45</A></B></TT>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Jim Burke, chairman of Partnership for a Drug-Free America, stated that
roughly one in thirteen of  those who take drugs become addicts: &quot;In 1962
less than 4 million Americans had ever tried an illegal drug in  their lifetime.
In 1992, one generation later, 80 million had tried illegal drugs.... Of the 80
million we now have  6 million addicts.... If you go back to 1962 we only had
300,000 addicts. The numbers are very clear:  twenty times more triers, twenty
times more addicts.... We know what works. Children are just as rational  as
adults. If they believe that the risk goes up in using drugs, their usage goes
down. Social disapproval  and perception of risk are the two drivers.&quot;

<P>

<P><B>-     Availability</B> of drugs has increased.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Coupled with this increase in the use of drugs is the &quot;baby-boomerang&quot;
increase in teenagers coming of  age. Dr. James Allen Fox, Dean of the College
of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston, stated  at the same
hearing: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Over the next ten years we will have a 23% increase in the

really concerned. I think this is the calm before the storm.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>I think it's a matter of supervision...one of the important elements that we
are not talking about....  For example at this point 57% of the children in this
country do not have full time parental supervision....  Almost 45% of the
juvenile violent crimes occur between 3:00 in the afternoon and dinnertime.

<P>
</P>
<P>Jim Burke also stated: &quot;If you go back to the epidemic before [1978]
when we normalized drugs,  the average age of trial [first use] in that period
was around 16. The average age of trial today is 13....  The current marijuana
is three to five times stronger.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The inevitable result to be expected from this worsening situation is a
sharp rise in addicts, in crime,  in AIDS, in health care costs, and in
unmeasurable family suffering.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How the Tax System Hurts Families</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to the cultural onslaught on family life, the tax burden on
families with children has raised the  cost of having children and forced many
couples to endure a trade-off between time at home and time spent  at work
earning money to support the family. More and more couples function like a tag
team, with one  at home with the children while the other works, or work
concurrent shifts while the children are at school or  in day care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the last few decades, the tax system has removed much of the help it
once gave to parents  raising young children. Rather than defend the family and
encourage marriage, the tax code now does almost  the opposite.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, the median-income family of four paid 2 percent of its gross annual
earnings to the federal  government in income and payroll taxes. Today, it pays
24 percent. In addition, state and local taxes on  average take another 14
percent from the family's gross  income. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#48">48</A></B></TT>  The main reasons this
burden has risen  so sharply, other than the general increase in taxes, are that
the personal exemption has been eroded  by inflation and payroll taxes have
risen.

</P>
<P>Families with children are overtaxed. In 1948, the average American family
with children paid only  3 percent of its income to Uncle Sam. Today, the same
family pays 24.5 percent. The average family  now loses $10,060 of income due to
the 45-year increase in federal taxes as a share of family  income.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#49">49</A></B></TT> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax code is riddled with other anti-family, or anti-marriage, or
anti-mother-at-home inequities.  For example, there is a child care allowance
for parents who work but not for those who stay at home with  their children. If
two fathers both earn $20,000, for example, and the mother in one family goes
out to work,  that family not only has her extra income, but also can deduct up
to $1,600 for child care expenses. But if  the mother in the other family
sacrifices the extra income to stay home to look after her children, that 
family receives no tax break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Moreover, the spouse who stays at home to look after the children is
penalized by the tax code in  her savings for old age. While a working mother is
allowed to invest $2,000 a year in a tax-deferred IRA,  a stay-at-home mother is
allowed to invest only $250 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The 1995 Congressional Tax Credit Proposal of $500 per Child </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the budget process of 1995, Congress passed a tax credit of $500 per
child to help alleviate  the financial stress on families with children.
President Clinton, by contrast, offered a $300 tax credit that  is phased in at
higher income levels, phased out at lower income levels, and does not apply to
children  over the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>The $500-per-child tax credit eliminates the entire income
tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring  for 8.7 million children.</B> These
3.5 million families would receive over $2.2 billion per year in tax relief. 
Families with two children earning up to $24,000 per year would see their entire
income tax burden eliminated by  a $500-per-child tax credit, and families with
three children earning up to $26,000 also would have  their income tax bill
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cutting taxes for all families regardless of income is fair.</B>
Congress's plan will cut the income tax burden of  a family of four earning
$30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income tax burden of a family  earning
$40,000 per year by 30 percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000
would see its tax  burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000
per year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent to
giving them one month's  mortgage payment.</B> The average family now loses
$10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase  in federal taxes as
a share of family income. This tax loss exceeds the annual mortgage payment on
the  average family home. The $1,000 in tax relief the congressional tax-cut
plan would give to a family with two  children would help this family meet one
month's mortgage payment.

<P><B>The Effect of Debt on America's Children</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The welfare state, with its ever-expanding appetite for taxes and
expenditures, has misdirected and  wasted a huge portion of the money in the
nation's economy. The deficit has soared as a direct result of this  unbridled
appetite, jeopardizing not only present income, but also the future incomes of
many generations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At present, America has 70,020,000 children under 18 and a deficit burden of
$4.887 trillion, or  $70,000 per child under 18. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#50">50</A></B></TT>  This means that even if
Congress balanced all future budgets and kept up with  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  interest payments, every child
under 18 still faces a future mortgage of $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> To appreciate the effect this has on the economy, consider the opposite:
Rather than a mortgage  of $70,000 on each child, assume an investment of
$70,000 in each child at birth. This investment would  yield huge benefits.
Indeed, $70,000 invested at birth would grow to over $11,000,000 (in future 
dollars) <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#51">51</A></B></TT> by

<P>The national debt, however, will have the opposite effects on our children:
correspondingly less money  for their education, less money for their insurance,
less money for their college education, and  instead  of capital to draw on to
build their families and futures  heavy taxes to pay off the debt.

<P>
</P>
<P>In solid families with good traditions, parents strive to add to the
patrimony (inheritance) they leave  their children, expecting them to do
likewise for the grandchildren. Parents who not only would leave nothing,  but
also would go so far as to mortgage the lives of their children by their own
profligate spending incur  appropriate scorn and are seen as economic pariahs.
The welfare state is doing this to our children.

<P>A Further Result of Federal Taxes: Family Time Famine. Getting adequate

<P><B>Themes for Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's often disparaged, traditional two-parent family is the principal
social institution by which the  work ethic, self-discipline, intellectual
motivation, and moral character are passed on to the next generation.  The
traditional family is the foundation of American society, and when it is
weakened, the nation is weakened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For decades, the government has pursued policies which help assure the
collapse of the family. To  change course, fundamental changes are required in a
wide range of policies. These changes embody five themes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 1: Reducing the government financial burden on working families. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The traditional family is the original department of health,
education, and welfare, but government  for decades has engaged in punitive
policies which discourage marriage and make it difficult for the  traditional
family to carry out its functions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, the median family of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the
federal government in  taxes. Today, that figure has risen to 24 percent; when
state and local taxes are thrown in, the typical family of  four now pays 38
percent of its income in taxes to the government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The extraordinary cost of financing the Great Society and the War on Poverty
has been borne in  large measure by the middle class, especially by parents with
children. In response to this crushing tax  burden, many in the middle class
have delayed marriage and, when they have married, have put off having  children
and reduced the number of children they raise.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ironically, even as its punitive tax policy discourages child rearing by
traditional middle-class families,  the government continues to subsidize child
rearing by never-married women who generally are ill-prepared  to act as
parents. The results of this disastrous policy are only too apparent. Current
government policy,  which places punitive and crippling financial burdens on
traditional two-parent families while subsidizing  illegitimacy, is a recipe for
eventual social collapse. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 2: Reforming welfare to control costs and require work to improve
the lot of the &quot;welfare family.&quot;  
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Today's welfare system crushes low-income families by placing
anti-family requirements on mothers as  the price of receiving welfare, as well
as by discouraging employment. The steps needed to change this  destructive
incentive system are outlined in the accompanying chapter on welfare reform.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 3: Reducing illegitimacy. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Societies through the ages have recognized that it takes the
efforts of at least two persons, a father and  a mother, to provide the economic
and psychological support needed to raise children. Women who  have children out
of wedlock invariably impose a heavy financial burden on the society around
them. A  father's absence also threatens the psychological well-being of his
children. Thus, societies historically have gone  to great lengths to encourage
marriage and, conversely, to discourage illegitimacy. In the recent past,  the
United States has experimented with reversing this common wisdom by aggressively
subsidizing  single parenthood and penalizing marriage. The results of this
experiment have been disastrous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the well-being of American children and the safety of society, a moral
sense of responsible  parenthood must be restored, based on the commonsense
principle that it is immoral to have children unless one is  fully prepared to
raise those children. To be fully prepared to raise children means three simple
things. First,  the mother and father must be married and committed to a life
together. Second, they must be mature  and psychologically ready for the
difficult task of raising the young. Third, they should be economically 
productive and self-sufficient, able to sustain a family without large amounts
of ongoing financial support from  the larger community.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 4: Reforming divorce law and strengthening marriage. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Over the past 40 years, government policy has made divorce
easily available, and welfare has  subsidized family breakup. The principal
victims have been children. These trends should be reversed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While divorce and marriage law should remain under the control of state
legislatures, it is clear that levels  of divorce and marital instability have
direct repercussions on the federal welfare system and on the  overall
well-being of America's children. Thus, the federal government should use the &quot;bully
pulpit&quot; to urge  reforms at the state level.

<P><B>THEME 5: Revitalizing civil society. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#58">58</A></B></TT></B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>While reforms in taxes, divorce law, and welfare are necessary
steps in dealing with the problems of  family disintegration and the underclass,
they are not sufficient in themselves. Welfare programs in particular,  by
subsidizing self-destructive behavior, have played a huge role in promoting
underclass problems. But  welfare is not the sole cause of these burgeoning
problems: Changing cultural values and norms concerning  sexual behavior,
marriage, work, respect for others, and self-control have played a heavy  role.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#59">59</A></B></TT>  Members of
Congress and others seeking a comprehensive solution must look beyond reforming
welfare programs  and into the broader culture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government leaders seeking to reestablish sound norms and virtuous behavior
within vulnerable  groups would do well to look to the past. Few people realize
that 19th century America fought several wars  on poverty which, in contrast to
the 20th century version, were quite successful. These historic  anti-poverty
efforts were headed by non-governmental institutions, primarily churches, which
saw poverty as  emanating from behavior and individual  character. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#60">60</A></B></TT>  They took as their
central task the molding of character and  self-discipline within vulnerable
low-income communities. For example:

<P>-     Catholic parochial education is a dramatic instance of long-lasting
private voluntary endeavor. In  founding Georgetown University in 1792, Bishop

<P>Dealing with social problems by placing greater reliance on non-governmental
social institutions is  therefore nothing new. It is a return to the fundamental
political philosophy upon which the American Republic  was established. The
Founders, because they understood the dangers inherent in looking to government
as  a cure for social ills, relied instead on civil institutions such as the
family and church.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This wisdom is reflected in the writings of one of the most astute observers
of American politics and  society, Alexis de Tocqueville. De Tocqueville
emphasized the crucial role in American society of such  &quot;private
associations&quot; as religious institutions, private philanthropies, clubs,
fellowships, voluntary civic  associations, and private moral and educational
institutions. According to de Tocqueville, these private associations  or civil
institutions were more important than America's political and economic
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the functions of private civil associations was to affirm, renew, and
sustain social virtues. It was  their task to inculcate into Americans the basic
virtues and norms which make civilized life possible.  Without these
value-affirming and renewing institutions, Americans would soon lose their
capacity to maintain  healthy families, to work honestly and diligently, to
educate and govern themselves, and even to live next to  one another without
murder and mayhem. In other words, civil institutions provided the moral
foundation  which made the political and economic superstructure possible, and
their ability to shape individual character  and to inculcate individuals with
the virtues and norms necessary for social life was essential to the 
continuance of society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the last hundred years, however, government has usurped much of the
role of civil associations.  One social function after another  education,
charity, and, increasingly, child-rearing  has passed from  civil institutions
into the hands of government bureaucrats. By arrogating to itself more and more
of those  functions, and by monopolizing an ever-larger share of the financial
resources needed for operation of  civil institutions, government decisively
undermines private civil associations. By diminishing and  shouldering aside
value-affirming institutions, government wages war on society's natural immune
system. The  growing underclass and the collapse of the family are only two of
the many problems which stem from this assault.

<P><B>The Crucial Role of Religion.</B> In grappling with the burgeoning

utilize all the vital resources within society. History, common sense,  and
research all show that there is one neglected institution ideally suited to lead
this struggle of moral renewal  in low-income communities and across the nation:
the church. Efforts to tackle underclass problems in the  19th century succeeded
largely because they were spearheaded by value-laden religious institutions. By 
contrast, efforts to fight urban poverty in the 20th century frequently have
failed because of their reliance on  value-free government programs.

wrong. It is the  poverty of growing up in the virtual absence of people who
teach morality by their own everyday example  and who insist that you follow

by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults in abusive, violence-ridden,

<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has said some very good things on the family and on the
breakdown of family and  marriage. However, he frequently contradicts himself,
and his actions have been very different from his  rhetoric. For instance, in
addressing the National Governors' Association, the President said that &quot;There
are  almost no poor children in families with two parents in the home.&quot; 
And on abstinence, he has said that &quot;we need  to send a strong signal that
it is essential for young people to delay sexual activity, as well as having 
children, until they are ready to accept the responsibilities and consequences
of these actions. It is critical that we  help all youth understand the rewards
of...deferring childbearing until they are  married.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#66">66</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala has been
vehement in her opposition  to such programs. Commenting on her elimination of
Title XX (abstinence) funds from the Clinton budget  in 1994, she said that &quot;abstinence
only messages provide no hope of protection at all against the risks  of
pregnancy and disease.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#67">67</A></B></TT>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President has never reinstated Title XX in his budget, not even since
announcing his Teen  Pregnancy Initiative in January 1996. Instead of standing
for marriage as the traditional place for sexual  expression, President Clinton
has pushed for the enshrinement in public policy of homosexual sex as equal to
sex  in heterosexual marriage.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On abortion the President has repeatedly said: &quot;I believe abortion
should be safe, legal and  rare.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#68">68</A></B></TT>  However, on January 22,
1993, two days after his inauguration, his first four executive orders were all
directed  at liberalizing American abortion regulations: To make foreign aid
money available for use in providing  abortions in other countries; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#69">69</A></B></TT> to speed up the granting
of FDA approval to RU-486, a drug designed to  make abortion a very easy form of

to permit the spending of Title X monies for abortion  counseling; <TT><B><A

practice of abortions at military  hospitals.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#72">72</A></B></TT>  While the
views of the President  were well known and an open part of the debate, even he,
aware of the need for delicate handling of this  issue, has stated: &quot;If
people in Washington spent less time in using abortion to divide the country for
their  own political ends....&quot; <TT><B><A

<P><B>Taxes and the Family</B>

<P>
</P>
<P>During his presidential campaign, candidate Bill Clinton promised a tax
credit of $800 per  child. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#74">74</A></B></TT>
 But in 1993, he gave families the biggest tax hike in history, which also means
he has taken more money  and parental time away from the family than anyone in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Congress included a $500-per-child tax credit in the Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1996,  President Clinton opposed it as giving money to the
rich even though almost 90 percent of the monies went to  middle-class and
poorer families. However, as Table 2 shows, the relief to the poor was higher at
every stage in  the congressional plan than in the Clinton proposal.
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>On Illegitimacy:</B> In the welfare reform package which passed the
House and Senate and which was part  of the budget reconciliation package sent
to the President in November 1993, Congress moved to reduce  the welfare rewards
and reinforcements for increased numbers of children out of wedlock. Congress 
forbade states to spend federal monies for increased welfare payments for new
children born out of wedlock  while the mother was on welfare. (States could
spend their own money for these increased payments.)  The President vetoed the
bill.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>On Abortion:</B> Congress outlawed the use of partial birth abortions, a
procedure involving cranial collapse  of the seven to nine month old fetus
followed by dismemberment and suction removal. The President  has promised to
veto it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fatherlessness:</B> Congress toughened the child support provisions in
the welfare bill which was part of  the reconciliation package vetoed by the
President in November 1995.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pro-family tax changes:</B> Historically mothers who stay at home to
care for young children have been  penalized in the regulations covering
individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Congress, in the budget  reconciliation
bill, removed the discrimination against these mothers. President Clinton vetoed
the bill.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The key to arresting America's moral decay is to restore the historic
balance between the state and  civil society  to revitalize those private
institutions which are society's natural immune system.  Destructive policy
influences must be reversed, and the beneficial effects of non-governmental
institutions must  be allowed once again to play their full role in rebuilding
civil society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These themes translate into the following policy prescriptions:

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $500-per-child tax credit passed by the present Congress but vetoed by
President Clinton is only a  first step in this regard. This tax credit should
be enacted now and followed by larger tax cuts for families  with children in
the near future.

mother and a working man. This  marriage penalty should be reduced through
creation of a tax credit for lower-income parents who are married  and working

to  low-income married couples who are living together and supporting dependent
children; the family should have  the equivalent of at least one adult working
full time. The credit should be refundable and should have a  maximum value of

working married couples  who never went on welfare in the first place. Moreover,
it would give low- and moderate-income parents a  huge 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  incentive to enroll in welfare,
at least briefly, to become eligible for the long-term continuing benefits. Such
 a system would degenerate inevitably into one in which the majority of low- and
moderate-income single-  and two-parent families received substantial welfare
payments, raising the overall cost of welfare by hundreds  of billions of
dollars per year. Realistic reformers must seek to alter welfare incentives in a
more  practical manner.

<P>

trouble, weapon use, and  theft; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#84">84</A></B></TT> they score higher on

 Adopted children do well at school. In 1988, only 7 percent of children adopted

<P>Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better then
unmarried teen mothers who  choose to become single parents. Unmarried teen
mothers who choose adoption have higher educational  aspirations and are more
likely to finish school than mothers who keep their children; are less likely to
live in  poverty and receive public assistance; are more likely to marry
eventually; are more likely to be employed  12 months after the birth and less

<P>Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
These barriers include  anti-adoption bias in pregnancy counseling, with most

overload and confusion of social  service roles, with the work of preserving
families sometimes in seeming conflict with that of rescuing children  in danger
(most social service agencies do not resolve this dilemma and leave the burden
to the child);  unsatisfactory protections of confidentiality, which inhibit the
adoption option; unknown, uninvolved, or  unmarried fathers who increasingly, at
local court levels are permitted to block adoption processes; and the race of 
the child and the adoptive parents, with many social workers against transracial
adoptions even if parents of  the same race as the child are not readily
available to adopt (which puts the burden on the child rather than  on the
community).

<P><B>Enforce statutory rape laws at the state level.

<P>
</P>
<P>Male accountability is needed. In many inner-city communities, when 16- or
17-year-old girls  become pregnant, the father is often four or five years older
than the girl. Such cases often involve statutory rape,  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  serious criminal offense.
Congress should hold hearings to emphasize the role of statutory rape in 
contributing to pregnancy among young girls, and the states should act
vigorously and visibly to enforce their  statutory rape laws in such cases as a
way to deter such predatory male behavior in the future.

<P><B>End &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce at the state level and require waiting

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In most states today, it is easier to terminate a marriage contract than a
contract to purchase a new  washing machine. Marriage is America's most
important social institution; steps must be taken to restore its  sanctity and
the seriousness of marital commitment. State governments immediately should
eliminate no-fault  divorce for couples with children. In the future, the major
share of the costs of divorce, as well as the future costs  of raising the
children, should be borne by the parent who is at fault (or by the party who
initiated the divorce  if no fault is found). Couples seeking a divorce who have
children should be required to undertake  counseling, and states should
establish a six-month waiting period for completion of any divorce action.
During  divorce proceedings, children should be represented by a separate
attorney tasked with representing their  interests (which often may be for the
parents to remain together).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Encourage pre-marriage counseling.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Marriage is a legal and social institution designed to enforce the binding
commitments of a man and  a woman to one another, and to provide the best
environment for the raising of children within society.  Society has an interest
and obligation (to children not yet born) to seek to ensure that marriages which
are  formed will have a good chance of not only enduring, but flourishing.
States should insist that individuals  receive some form of pre-marital
counseling as a condition of receiving a marriage license.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Part of counseling should be an evaluation to inform prospective spouses of
the probability that their  marriage will end in divorce. Modern evaluation
devices such as the PREPARE (Premarital Personal  and Relationship Evaluation)
questionnaire can predict with an accuracy of over 80 percent whether a 
marriage will end in divorce. PREPARE already is offered by thousands of
churches across the nation. It is in the  best interest of all concerned
(especially the children yet unborn) that the fiancees be informed of their 
prospects for marital success before they have embarked on what should be a
lifelong  commitment. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#90">90</A></B></TT></P>

</P>
<P><B>Fight moral decay through school choice at the federal and state levels.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The plight of the underclass is rooted in behavior; behavior in turn is
molded by the cultural values  and norms of low-income communities and the
larger society. For the problems of the underclass to be  solved, there must be
a dramatic change in behavior, which in turn will require an enormous shift in
underlying  norms and values. Policymakers must seek to reanimate within
low-income communities the ethical  principles which are the foundation of a
successful society. To combat the growing problem of the underclass,  Americans
need a multi-dimensional policy which harnesses all the vital forces in our
society. But in the war  against poverty and violence, the most effective social
weapon  the church  lies dormant.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The key to harnessing the church's untapped social strength is another
crucial public policy issue:  school choice. Poor parents should be given
vouchers equivalent to the sum which is spent educating their  children in the
public schools. These parents would be free to use the voucher to place their
children into a school  of their own choice, including private religious
schools. If voucher plans were put in place in large cities,  dozens of
high-quality private religious schools would spring up immediately in each city,
operating as adjuncts  of urban churches. Many low-income parents, struggling to
save their sons and daughters from the social  tide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  of violence, drugs, and sexual
promiscuity, would be overjoyed to place their children under the firm  moral
tutelage of such church-related schools, each one of which would function as a
focal point of moral  renewal emanating into the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unlike Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson (and many Members of 
Congress), <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#91">91</A></B></TT>
who are wealthy enough to send their children to private schools, poor parents
are left with the inert monopoly of the  public schools, institutions which no
longer can adequately teach simple reading, let alone serve as the focal  point
for moral transformation within underclass communities. In grappling with the
problems of dependence  and the underclass, education voucher programs for
low-income parents are an indispensable complement  to welfare reform.

<P>Liberals will argue that providing parents with vouchers which can be used
in religious schools violates  the First Amendment prohibition on establishment
of religion. This is untrue. The Supreme Court has  clearly ruled, in <I>Mueller
v. Allen</I> and <I>Witters v. Washington State Department of Services for the 
Blind</I>, that vouchers or tax credits can be spent for religious education
without creating constitutional problems. Just  as a widow can place her Social
Security check in the collection plate of a church or synagogue, or a  veteran
can use funds from the GI Bill to go to seminary without violating the
constitutional provisions against  state-established religion, a poor parent may
use education vouchers to place a child in a religious school. As  long as the
parent, not the government, decides where the voucher funds will be spent, the
government  has neither advanced nor hindered a particular religion, and there
is no violation of the religious  establishment clause of the First Amendment.

<P>The church is thus America's strongest weapon in the war against family
disintegration, crime, drugs,  and despair in low-income communities. Churches
can succeed in tackling these problems where  government has failed. Instead of
relegating the churches to the social periphery, policymakers must unleash their
 energy, permitting them to play a much greater role in molding the character of
youth and adults.  Specifically, Congress should redirect a substantial portion
of federal aid to primary and secondary education into  model voucher programs
for poor parents in inner cities.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What right does government have to tell people what their moral
values should be? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Government is not the fundamental moral teacher; that is the duty
of the church or synagogue and  the family itself, the first and most intimate
source of moral instruction. But government does have a  profound responsibility
to inform American taxpayers about the costs and consequences of personal 
behaviors, including violations of the marriage contract, child abuse, or the
dramatic growth in out-of-wedlock  birth, precisely because of their profoundly
negative social impact on the character and quality of American  life:
increasing numbers of psychologically damaged children, rising crime and
juvenile delinquency,  substance abuse and welfare dependency. Americans are
free to live by any moral code they wish, or none at all.  But they should not
expect taxpayers to pick up the tab, without imposing any conditions, for what 
traditionally has been understood to be immoral behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What right does government have to tell people what form of family
they are to have?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> From time immemorial, government in every civilized society has
recognized marriage and the family  as the basic and most venerable institutions
of the social order. Indeed, government has always had a  direct 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  interest in both the
establishment and maintenance of the traditional marriage contract and the
family,  the mutual obligations of a husband and wife and of parents to their
children. To that end, an entire body  of domestic law has been established,
governing everything from the state's issuance of marriage licenses to  the
preservation of family property and inheritance and the protection of children.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of course, Americans are free to experiment and to have any &quot;alternative
family arrangements&quot; they  wish. But the empirical evidence is overwhelming
that the intact, two-parent family is superior to any other  arrangement.
Children thrive and do better in stable married families than anywhere else.
Their health,  their learning, their income, their mental and emotional
well-being, and their avoidance of drugs, crime,  welfare dependency, and
illegitimacy are much lower than those of children in single-parent families.
America  is stronger because of married families and weaker when families are
broken or unformed. As a matter  of public policy, therefore, it is perfectly
reasonable to promote and preserve the traditional family. As a  matter of
public policy, it is perfectly unreasonable to do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What has been the record of federal drug treatment (as opposed to
enforcement) programs?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Poor. Federal drug treatment spending almost tripled between 1988
and 1994, but the number  of persons treated actually declined from 1.5 million
in 1989 to 1.4 million in  1994. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#93">93</A></B></TT>  Most addicts have been
through treatment more than once. As summed up by John Walters, deputy director
of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Bush
Administration, &quot;The harsh fact is that drug  addicts like taking drugs,
even though most of them also dislike some aspects and consequences of their
drug  use. They sometimes admit themselves to treatment programs, not to stop
using their drugs, but to regain  greater control over their drug use; but the
overwhelming majority of addicts entering treatment with the goal  of ending
their drug use are coerced to do so by the courts, family members, or employers.
That is why  the liberals who discuss treatment as if it were the opposite of
enforcement show a profound ignorance of  the reality of drug treatment.&quot;
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#94">94</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How would conservatives fashion a policy on drug treatment?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Congress should combine federal anti-drug support to states and
localities (estimated at $3.5 billion  in FY 1994) into anti-drug block grants
for states and local communities. In this way, states and local  communities can
use these funds for anti-drug treatment and rehabilitation programs that work
best. At the  same time, it is essential that Congress establish performance
standards so that organizations receiving  funds demonstrate that they are
effective in treating addicts. Interestingly, some of the best drug and  alcohol
treatment and rehabilitation programs in the nation are those that are connected
with religious or  faith-based institutions. They are successful precisely
because they are able to effect a deep internal or spiritual  commitment on the
part of addicts to resist the use of illegal drugs or the abuse of alcohol.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES 
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On October 15, 1995, Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD),  was mugged outside
her home in Baltimore. Robert Eugene  Perlie, charged with the crime, was on
probation for possession of  cocaine and resisting arrest. He also had been
convicted in the past  for other drug offenses, as well as for theft and
insurance fraud.  Moreover, at the time of the inceident, Perlie was scheduled
for  four separate trials on charges of illegal transportion of a handgun, 
violation of probation, drug possession, and malicious destruction  and theft.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#1">1</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Mikulski mugging represents in microcosm both the  problem and the
politics of crime in America: A relatively small,  hard-core group of repeat
offenders commit most crimes, especially  violent crimes. Federal lawmakers talk
about &quot;getting tough on crime&quot;  and then pass laws that affect only
the tiny minority of  hard-core criminals that come under federal jurisdiction,
leaving the  vast majority unaffected. Press releases tout federal efforts, 
even though career criminals remain on the streets. The public  becomes more
cynical and more alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should explain the short-term solution  to America's
crime problem: putting repeat offenders behind  bars 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  and keeping them there. This is
not the whole solution, but it is  the essential first step in ridding America
of the menace of  violent crime. And the evidence shows that it works. This
means,  however, that federal lawmakers must stop posturing for the  cameras and
recognize that, because most violent street crime is under  the jurisdiction of
state and local governments, most of the changes  in policy need to be made at
the state and local levels. The  President and Congress should review all
current federal laws,  determine which impinge upon or undermine the authority
of state and  local law enforcement, and repeal them.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#2">2</A>  The President and  Congress can and
should provide leadership and policy assistance, but  the real solution to the
problem of street crime lies at the state  and local levels.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the long term, lawmakers at all levels must recognize that  the real
reason for America's decades-long crime wave is not  poverty, as some have
believed. Nor is it race, as others have intimated. It  is family breakdown.
Nothing could be clearer from the social  research than that fatherless children
 from whatever  socioeconomic or racial background  are the most likely to
commit  violent crimes as teenagers and adults. The rising rate of  illegitimacy
means that teenage crime also will continue to rise. This  point must be driven
home, repeatedly, and long-range economic  and social policies that encourage
the formation of stable,  two-parent families must be developed. At the same
time, Americans  must face the fact that some existing government policies 
encourage illegitimacy and family breakup. To curb crime, these  anti-family
policies must be ended.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Public awareness and state and local efforts already are  affecting the
crime rate, which is dropping in many states and  localities. According to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's 
<I>Uniform Crime Reporting</I> figures, there was a 1 percent decrease in  &quot;serious
crime,&quot; a measure of violent crime and property crime, reported  by law
enforcement agencies for the first six months of  1995.3  It is important to
realize that the recent decline is a reduction from  a huge statistical base,
and that much violent crime is not even  reported to law enforcement agencies.
That is why America's  crime rates are still unacceptably high. For example,
according to  the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a crime occurs every 2 
seconds:<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#4">4</A>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While crime rates have declined somewhat this past year, they  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  still very high compared with
1960. In 1960, there were 160  violent crimes for every 100,000 Americans; by
1994, there were  715 for every 100,000 Americans, down slightly from 1993. 
Overall, there were 23,310 murders, 102,100 rapes, 618,820 robberies,  and
1,119,950 aggravated assaults in 1994. Since 1990, violent  and property crime
have declined by 2.2 percent and 8.5 percent  respectively, per 100,000
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While still devastating in its impact on American society, the  recent
downturn is both welcome and, according to John  DiIulio, Professor of Politics
and Public Affairs at Princeton  University, &quot;can be explained in part by
policy-driven law enforcement  efforts that capitalize on community
crime-fighting initiatives and  take the bad guys off the streets.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#5">5</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives therefore should welcome the debate over  crime. Liberals, on
the other hand, continue to look to social programs  to reduce crime even though
these programs have proved  ineffective. The fact is that recent success in
reducing crime is largely  attributable to conservative policies which emphasize
tougher and  more effective law enforcement and incarceration of violent 
criminals. Crime is still a politically powerful issue throughout the  nation,
and in few areas are the political lines clearer. The  American people have had
enough; they are demanding tough,  sweeping changes that will slash the crime
rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The effectiveness of good police work and extended  incarceration of
hardened criminals is beyond dispute. Crime rates would  drop even more
dramatically if more state and local officials  initiated tougher and more
effective law enforcement on America's  streets, as Professor DiIulio suggests,
and made violent criminals  serve 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  longer prison terms. Examples:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Jacksonville, Florida. State Attorney Harry L. Shorenstein  beefed up his
prosecutorial team in 1992, got tough with dangerous  juvenile offenders, and
started to prosecute them as adults and  send them to prison. The result: By
1994, Shorenstein's program  had sent hundreds of juveniles to jail. With fewer
young criminals  on the streets, arrests of juveniles declined 30 percent, and
the  number of juveniles arrested for weapons offenses fell by 41  percent.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#6">6</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Houston, Texas.</B> Police Chief Sam Nuchia started a &quot;citizens
 patrol program&quot; to beef up the city's increased police presence. The 
result: Thousands of citizen patrollers have reported criminal  activities to
the police, arrests have increased, and police response  to emergencies has
improved, increasing the productivity of the  police and the safety of Houston's
citizens.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#7">7</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Oxnard, California.</B> By using sophisticated crime analysis and  an
advanced gang-tracking computer data base, and by using  a telemarketing
computer system to issue crime alerts to residents  in high-crime areas, police
have helped to reduce violent crime by  38 percent, including a 60 percent drop
in the murder rate.  Oxnard has reduced crime to its lowest level since the 
1960s.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>New York City, New York.</B> Taking over the police department  in
January 1994, Commissioner William J. Bratton declared a  real war on crime,
promising in Churchillian fashion to &quot;fight for  every house in the city;
we will fight for every street; we will fight  for every block. And we will win.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#8">9</A>  Bratton took command of  the city's
demoralized 38,000-member police force, held the 76  precinct police commanders
directly accountable for their  perfor
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  mance in decreasing the crime rate
in their precincts,  computerized the precinct data system to track the crime
problem daily, and  dismissed high-level police officials who failed to get in
tune with  his tough new program.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#10">10</A>
 In 1994, while major felonies  nationwide fell by 2 percent, in New York City
they fell by 12 percent. In  the first nine months of 1995, they fell another 18
 percent.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#11">11</A>  Over the past two
years, declines in most major felonies, including an  almost 40 percent drop in
murder, have been dramatic.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>But first-rate police work should be combined with a serious  sentencing
policy for violent criminals. According to  Professor DiIulio, &quot;Not
surprisingly, therefore, studies show that from  1980 to 1992 the 10 states
where incarceration increased the most  saw violent crime decrease by 8 percent.
In the 10 states with the  lowest increases, violent crime soared 51  percent.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#12">12</A>  If more state and local officials
pursued such policies, more of America's streets  and homes would be much safer
places. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should encourage such efforts at  every opportunity,
and not just because it will do well at the polls.  While recent reductions in
crime rates are encouraging, the  statistical base of violence upon which those
rates are calculated from  year to year is huge. The tidal wave of crime, which
began in the  1960s, continues to roll across America. During the 1960s alone, 
crime rates more than doubled (see Tables <a href="crime_t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="crime_t2.gif">2</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's violent crime rate soared 47 percent from 1975 to  1994, rising
from 487.8 to 716.0 per 100,000  inhabitants.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#13">13</A>(see <a href="crime_1.gif">Chart 1</a>)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Council on Crime in America, a bipartisan  commission
chaired by former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  Heritage Foundation Distinguished
Fellow William J.  Bennett, over 400,000 Americans have been murdered since 1977
  almost seven times the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam  War.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#14">14</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The FBI's crime index rate, which includes the violent crimes  of murder and
non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape,  robbery, and aggravated assault and
the property crimes of burglary,  larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson,
rose 1.4 percent  (5,298 per 100,000 inhabitants to 5,374 per 100,000
inhabitants)  from 1975 to 1994.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#15">15</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>From 1985 to 1994, violent crimes rose 28.6 percent;  property crime, 0.2
percent; murder, 13.9 percent; rape, 5.7 percent;  robbery, 14.0 percent; and
aggravated assault, 42.0 percent.  However, as state and local communities
continued their efforts to  combat crime through tougher truth-in-sentencing
laws in 1993 and  1994, the overall crime rate decreased. The FBI crime index
fell 2.0  percent. Violent crime was down 4.1 percent; property crimes,  1.7
percent; murder, 5.3 percent; rape, 4.6 percent; robbery, 7.1  percent; and
aggravated assault, 2.3 percent.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Juvenile Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most ominously, if the present disintegration of family and  social life
continues, Americans will see an unprecedented  acceleration of the already
horrendous levels of juvenile criminal  violence. Current data trends clearly
indicate that: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Violent crime among juveniles has soared by about 300  percent since 1965.
From 1981 to 1990, juvenile arrests for murder  increased by 60 percent, while
adult arrests increased by just  5.2 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  percent. In 1990, juveniles
committed more than a third of all  murders in the country.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#16">16</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The sharp rise in juvenile crime presents a formidable  challenge for future

juvenile arrest rates (see <a href="crime_t3.gif">Table 3</a>), as well as  in the number of arrests for
such heinous crimes as murder (see <a href="crime_t4.gif">Table 4</a>). From 1985 to 1993, the number of
juveniles aged 13 and  14 arrested for murder increased 162 percent. The murder
arrest  rate increased 207 percent for 15-year-olds, 197 percent for 
16-year-olds, 146 percent for 17-year-olds and 119 percent for  juveniles aged
18 to 20.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#17">17</A>  The numbers of
juveniles involved in  aggravated assaults, rapes, and robberies also are rising

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The insufficiency or absence of government social programs  does not fuel
violent crime. The social science literature is  conclusive on one all-important
point: The real root cause of violent crime  is the breakdown of family and
community, especially in  America's inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The professional literature shows that the failure of fathers  and mothers
to care for the children they bring into the world is at  the heart of violent
crime. Absent fathers, absent mothers,  parental fighting and domestic violence,
lack of parental supervision  and discipline of children, patterns of parental
abuse, neglect or  rejection of the child, and criminality among the parents
themselves   all are conditions that contribute to the creation of a violent 
crimi

the social atmosphere created  by broken families and illegitimacy.<A

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Race and Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While serious crime is highest in socially disorganized,  largely urban
neighborhoods, however, its frequency is not a function  of race. The
determining factor is the absence of marriage.  Among broken families, with
their chaotic, &quot;dysfunctional&quot;  relationships, whether white or black,
the crime rate is very high; among  married, two-parent families, whether white
or black, the crime rate  is very low. The capacity and determination to
maintain stable  married relationships, not race, is the pivotal  factor.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#19">19</A>  The chaotic, broken community
stems from these chaotic, broken families.  The reason race appears to be an
important factor in crime is the  prevalence of wide differences in marriage
rates among ethnic  groups. A report from the state of Wisconsin further
illustrates this.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1980 and 1993, according to the latest available data,  the number
of black inmates rose from 46.5 percent to 50.8 percent  of the total prison
population, from 140,600 to 445,400. Justice  Department findings show that, at
the end of 1993, blacks were  seven times more likely than whites to have been
incarcerated in a  state or federal prison. An estimated 1,471 blacks per
100,000  black residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were 
incarcerated in the nation's prisons on December 31,  1993.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#20">20</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The fact that crime rates are much higher for blacks than  whites has
tempted some to cite race as a factor in overall crime. It  is therefore
important for candidates to explain that the  evidence does not support this
view. When social scientists control for  fam
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ily structure, the rates for
blacks and whites are not  significantly different. Broken families are most
closely correlated with  violent crime, regardless of race. In other words,
family structure,  not race, is the leading indicator of criminal behavior.
There is  a higher rate of crime among blacks only because black  communities
have higher rates of illegitimacy and family breakup.

injustice sent fewer criminals to prison for shorter terms. The  number of
offenders imprisoned for every 1,000 violent crime  arrests plummeted by almost
50 percent, from 299 in 1960 to 170  in 1970.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#31">31</A>  Tougher law-enforcement policies
began to return in  the 1970s, and the crime rate slowed as the rate of

policies were adopted. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->

<P>

<P>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, on December  31, 1994, the
number of sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S.  residents was 387  up from 139

increasing by 219  percent. In 1980, there were 329,821 federal and state
prisoners; by  1990, there were 773,919. By 1994, the total number of people

</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress and elsewhere often bemoan the fact  that there are
more than 5 million persons in the United States  under &quot;correctional
supervision.&quot;  While it is true that the U.S.  prison population is at an
all-time high, however, most of those  incarcerated are violent criminals or
repeat offenders. Moreover,  while approximately 1 million persons are
imprisoned, an  overwhelming majority of convicts  another 3.5 million, or 72
percent  are  not in prison, but on probation or parole,<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#33">33</A> and the disparity  between the
rate of imprisonment and the rate of release on probation  or parole has been
growing in recent years. Between 1980 and  1994, while the prison population
increased by 184 percent, the  parole and probation population increased by 204 
percent.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A large proportion of America's crime problem derives from  the fact that so
many criminals, including violent and repeat  offenders, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  are out on the streets. According
to Professor DiIulio, nearly  one-third of parolees imprisoned for violent
crimes, and nearly  one-fifth of those imprisoned for a crime against property,
are  re-arrested within three years of their release for committing a  violent
crime. Among convicted felons on probation alone, 54 percent  are arrested once,
24 percent are arrested twice, and 22 percent  are arrested three or more times.
<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#35">35</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Data from the bipartisan Council on Crime in America show  that &quot;On any
given day, seven offenders are on the street for  every three who are behind
bars. During 1994 about 4.2 million  cases were handled on probation and 1.1
million were processed on  parole. On any given day, there are about 1.5 times
more  convicted violent offenders out on the streets on probation or parole 
than behind bars.&quot;  <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#36">36</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Members of Congress and federal and state policymakers  should encourage
innovative leaders at the state and local levels,  like Governor George Allen of
Virginia, who are stopping the abuse  of probation and parole and eliminating
these options for violent  offenders. <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#37">37</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One major flaw in current criminal justice policies is the degree  to which
convicted criminals are sentenced to probation with  no prison time at all, or
to jail terms of one year or less. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that, in 1990, state  courts (where
95 percent of crimes are prosecuted) sentenced 29  percent of all criminal
offenders to probation without incarceration.  Another 25 percent were sentenced
to jail terms of one year or  less. Thus, over half (54 percent) of criminals
convicted in state  courts 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  received either no incarceration
or sentences of less than one  year in jail.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For violent offenses, 20 percent of convicted criminals  received probation
with no incarceration, while 21 percent received  jail terms of less than one
year, leaving 41 percent of all  convicted violent offenders in these two
categories. Even for the crime  of murder, 5 percent of convicted criminals
somehow received  only probation, and 4 percent received one year or less in 
jail<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#38">.38</A> For the crime of rape, 14
percent received probation, and 19 percent  were imprisoned for one year or
less, leaving one-third of  convicted rapists with little or no serious
incarceration (see <a href="crime_t5.gif">Table 5</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While on probation, hard-core repeat offenders continue to  commit crimes.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 43  percent of those on
probation between 1986 and 1989 were arrested  at least once on felony charges
within three years of being placed  on probation. During that same period, 46
percent had been  committed to prison or jail or had disappeared, skipping out
on their  probation.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#39">39</A>  Of those
receiving probation for murder, 5 percent  were re-arrested for murder, and 16
percent were re-arrested for  some felony within three years.<A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to another Bureau of Justice Statistics survey, 35  percent of
state prison inmates in 1991 were convicted of a new  offense committed while
they were on probation or parole.  Probation and parole violators comprised 30
percent of all offenders in  state prisons for a violent crime, 56 percent of
inmates incarcerated  for property offenses, 41 percent of those convicted of
drug  offenses, and 85 percent of those in prison for public-order offenses. 
Collectively, probation and parole violators committed 90,639  violent 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  crimes while being supervised
within the community (based  on reported convictions).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More than 25 percent of probation and parole violators were  in prison for a
violent crime. Fifty-five percent of probationers  and parolees reported that,
in the month before their current  offense, they were using drugs. An estimated
41 percent were using  drugs daily. Of probation and parolee violators
imprisoned for a  new offense, 21 percent reported using a firearm while under 
supervision. Of those possessing a firearm in the month prior to  arrest, almost
75 percent were armed when they committed their  current offense. Between 1975
and 1991, the number of parolee and  release violators entering state prisons
increased from 18,000  to 142,000  twice the rate of growth among offenders
newly  committed from the courts.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#41">41</A>

<P><B>How Light Prison Sentences and Parole Lead to Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another problem is that criminals generally serve only a  fraction of their
sentences, even as sentences themselves are often  too short. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because of parole and early release programs, sentences  handed down by
state courts do not indicate time actually served. <a href="crime_t5.gif">Table  5</a> shows the estimated
average time that will be served under  sentences imposed in state courts in
1990, given past trends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Data collected from the states by the Bureau of Justice  Statistics indicate
that for violent crimes, the average time served is  three years and seven
months (43 months) or 48 percent of the  original sentence (89 months). For
murder, the average is only five  years 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  and 11 months (71 months) or 48
percent of the original  sentence (149 months); for robbery, three years and
eight months  (44 months) or 46 percent of the original sentence (95 months);
and  for rape, five years and five months (65 months) or 56 percent of  the
original sentence (117 months).<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#42">42</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These short prison terms for violent repeat offenders do more  than trigger
a sense of injustice among victims. They also mean  more crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1985, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that  approximately 28
percent of all male convicts, and 46 percent of recidivist  convicts, still
would have been in prison for their first crimes at  the time of their admission
to prison for a second crime if, instead  of being paroled, they had been given
sentences in the  maximum range for their original convictions. These
percentages would  be substantially higher for those who committed another crime
 within their original sentence than they would be for those  apprehended,
prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned during that  time.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#43">43</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In another study released in 1987, the BJS estimated that 69  percent of
parolees 17 to 22 years old were re-arrested within  six years of their release
and that about 29 percent of new  arrest charges occurred before these parolees'
original sentences  would have ended.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#44">44</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the bipartisan Council on Crime in America,  &quot;In 1991, 45
percent of state prisoners were persons, who, at the  very time they committed
their latest crimes, were on probabtion  or parole. While free in the community,
they committed at  least 218,000 violent crimes, including 13,200 murders
and11,600  rapes

</P>
<P><B>Federal Courts Still Gutting Truth in Sentencing Laws</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recognizing the tendency of early-release prisoners to  commit crimes, more
and more states are adopting &quot;truth in  sentencing&quot; laws to keep
criminals incarcerated for as much of the full  sentence as possible. Under the
most common formulation, a  criminal convicted of a violent crime is required to
serve at least 85  percent of the full sentence. This is perhaps the most
effective  judicial remedy for violent crime devised so far, because it
eliminates  probation and parole for violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, liberal jurists, apparently more concerned with  protecting
the rights of prisoners than with protecting the rights  of law-abiding citizens
victimized by violent crime, are trying to  gut these laws. This is particularly
true of federal judges who, to  relieve prison overcrowding, often order that
even violent  criminals be released back to the streets. Few states and
localities can  avoid this federal intervention: Some 39 states and 300 of the 
nation's largest jails operate under some form of federal court  direction.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#46">46</A>  The 1994 crime bill inadequately
addressed the issue, and  the problem remains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ostensibly to eliminate &quot;overcrowding,&quot; tens of thousands of 
prisoners have been released onto the streets. But &quot;overcrowding&quot;  has
never been defined, so each judge is free to determine it on a  subjective
basis. Far from the popular image of groups of  prisoners crammed into single
cells, it has come to mean, as arbitrarily  defined by several judges, simply
more than one prisoner to a  cell. Some federal judges even refuse to allow
convicted felons to  be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  sent to prison, citing &quot;overcrowding,&quot;
and just release them   even violent criminals and repeat offenders. These
released felons  have been responsible for tens of thousands of additional
violent  crimes. For example:

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The dramatic performance of the New York City Police  Department in
combating violent crime and the innovative  community policing methods employed
in Houston, Texas, provide  ample models for effective police management.
Unfortunately,  however, a few men and women who should represent the best in
their  communities sometimes turn out to be the worst, as revealed in  press
accounts from around the nation detailing alleged police  brutality, corruption,
and incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the recruiting and staffing of state and local police forces is  done to
select the best in terms of professional competence,  personal courage, and
moral character, the value to society is beyond  calculation. When Americans are
threatened by violent criminals,  they want the very bravest and the very best
to rescue them and  their loved ones. They want police officers capable of
excellent  judgment, as well as physical courage, who can make  split-second,
life-and-death decisions without violating the parameters set  forth by the U.S.
Constitution. Moreover, they want police officers  and detectives who are
shrewd, intellectually capable of cracking  the most difficult cases, and able
to work with the prosecution team  to advance the best case against criminal
defendants in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most egregious failures in police effectiveness invariably  have been
failures of personnel management: the deliberate  imposition of lower
intellectual and physical standards in recruitment  and hiring, reduced
background screening, the substitution of  &quot;politically correct&quot;
racial or ethnic or gender &quot;diversity&quot; for strict  standards of
competence or merit, poor supervision of officers in  the field, and a lack of
attention to moral character in the selection  of police. For example:

<P>Americans need, want, and expect the best in their police  officers. While
no state or local jurisdiction should impose racial or  gender quotas on the
hiring of police, state and local officials should  realize that the best are
found in every sector of the  community, among every race and ethnic group.
There is nothing worse than  a bad cop and nothing better than a good one. Good
police  officers are those with outstanding character, firmly anchored in the 
community they are duty-bound to protect.

<P><B>The Huge Cost of Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Crime imposes high costs on individuals and families.  Victims suffer direct
economic damage in loss of funds and property.  They also experience pain,
suffering, cruelty, temporary or  permanent physical impairments and even loss
of life. Potential victims  suffer fear, inconvenience, and loss of freedom and
pay an economic  cost for extra locks, bars, guns, and other equipment in trying
to  avoid crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Crime also imposes huge costs on neighborhoods and  communities.
Neighborhood businesses lose sales when customers  fear crime while shopping.
Neighborhood workers lose jobs when  businesses and investors are scared away by
fear of crime.  Children lose the opportunity to learn when their schools are
dominated  by gangs and drug dealers who make it impossible to maintain  a
learning environment. Governments lose tax revenue when  sales, businesses,
jobs, and property values decline in crime-ridden areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Several studies have attempted to quantify these costs:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, crime victims  in 1992 lost
$17.6 billion in direct costs. These direct costs  include items such as losses
from cash, property theft or damage,  direct medical costs, or lost income from
loss of time at work. It does  not include indirect costs, including the costs
of long-term health  problems, higher insurance premiums resulting from changed 
health status, or the pain and suffering, the non-economic damage,  that
afflicts victims of violent crime, which would make the  economic costs of crime
signifcantly higher.

<P>One consequence of the disproportionate incidence of  crime against black
Americans is that black and other minority  neighborhoods face greater losses in
economic opportunity and growth  as small entrepreneurs are crippled and jobs
are destroyed. With  their schools so often undermined by crime, black and other
 minority children are often denied the basic educational opportunities  enjoyed
by white children in equivalent neighborhoods. Crime  and its associated costs
constitute a high extra tax on businesses  and households in low-income minority
communities. As discussed  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  Chapter 6, poverty is not the
root cause of crime in these  neighborhoods; crime is a root cause of poverty.
Until crime is  drastically reduced in America's inner cities and low-income and
 minority communities, social programs or other efforts to revive their 
economic fortunes cannot succeed.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While state and local officials have primary responsibility  for combatting
crime, there has been a noticeable weakening of  federal enforcement in areas
directly under federal jurisdiction.  Federal narcotics prosecutions dropped 25
percent from  1993-1994, for example, and prosecutions for firearms violations
dropped  20.5 percent. Since the enactment of President Clinton's Violent  Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (the 1994 crime  bill), the Clinton
Administration has initiated no significant  legislative efforts on the problem
of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $30 billion omnibus crime bill is itself a huge expansion  of federal
authority into functions traditionally performed by  state and local officials.
Key provisions include $8.8 billion worth  of funding for the hiring of police;
$9.7 billion for prisons and  other correctional initiatives; $6.9 billion for
crime &quot;prevention&quot;  activities, largely social programs; and $4.8
billion for several  other measures, including a 10-year ban on the sale,
manufacture,  and importation of 19 types of assault weapons, the creation of 
state registries for violent sex offenders, and the expansion of the  death
penalty to dozens of new federal crimes. Of course, 98 percent  of violent
crimes fall under state and local, not federal,  jurisdiction 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  and are subject to state and
local, rather than federal, policy  initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Funding for Local Police. </B>The Clinton Administration is  promising
to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America's  cities. The reality
is that the 1994 crime bill funds only $8.8  billion for police over six years,
far less than the full amount required  to put such a number on the streets on a
permanent basis. But  more important than the number of police is their
function, their  specific tasks, and where, precisely, they are assigned. To
fund police  to fight crime would seem to be simple: Send the money directly  to
state or local government according to a straightforward  formula that reflects
population, crime rates, or a combination of both.  That has not happened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Based on the level of violent crime, it is clear from <a href="crime_7.gif">Chart  7</a> <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#66">66</A> that high-crime cities were
underfunded and low-crime cities  were overfunded. Worse, police funding has
become yet another  extension of the Clinton Administration's politically
correct  &quot;diversity&quot; agenda, a classic liberal program of social
engineering in  which local police departments are required to establish racial
or  gender-based quotas under the guise of crime-fighting in order to get 
federal funding. Under the Clinton Administration formula, local  police
departments must submit analyses of &quot;underutilization&quot;  of women and
minorities in accordance with &quot;community labor  statistics&quot; (broken
down by race, sex, gender, and job category);  outline &quot;affirmative action&quot;
plans that include &quot;goals&quot; and  specific steps to achieve &quot;goals&quot;
for correcting the &quot;underutilization&quot;  of women; and transmit
quarterly reports, plus a copy, to  official Washington on their progress in
implementing these federally  approved plans. So onerous is compliance (within
30 days) of  these 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  bureaucratic requirements
unrelated to reducing violent crime  that Oklahoma City Chief of Police Sam
Gonzales recommended  that the city turn down the monies from the Department of

short of the goal of 100,000 cops on  the streets. Over 600 localities have
turned down the program,  largely because they could not afford the 25 percent
financial match  requirement for participation in the program. Moreover,
according  to an analysis by the General Accounting Office, 7000 local 
jurisdictions did not even apply for the Clinton Administration's  grant money
overwhelmingly because of the cost of participation,  but cited other factors as
well, including the absence of need,  restrictive regulations and excessively &quot;burdensome&quot;

Fourth  Amendment.

<P>
</P>
<P>In 1983, the Justice Department estimated that up to 55,000  serious
criminal cases were dropped every year because  exclusionary rule restrictions
eliminated the evidence needed for  prosecution. By 1992, an independent report
concluded that the number  had grown to 120,000, including 30,000 violent crimes
and  90,000 serious property crimes. This figure does not include the tens  of

<P>Congressional action on habeas corpus is long overdue. Under  an 1867

the death penalty until every  conceivable legal loophole has been exhausted.
Petitions in many  state courts are similarly abused.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What is really needed is for each state to adopt legislation  providing for
only one habeas petition, to be filed within a year of  the last appellate

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should:
</P>
<P><B>-     Restrict the ability of the federal judiciary to impose prison 
caps.</B> Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress  attempted
to bar federal judges from imposing prison caps   restrictions on the number of
prisoners that can be incarcerated at a  particular prison which result in many
violent criminals being  released long before their terms have been served. With
the  legal assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),  liberal
lawyers and federal judges quickly found ways to evade this  provision.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Therefore, the first major initiative of the new Congress should  be to
define clearly the scope of federal judicial authority over  state and local
prisons and &quot;abide by federal laws governing the  limited role of the
federal courts in conditions of  confinement.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#71">71</A>  New Members of Congress should
reassert their clear and  indisputable constitutional authority under Article
III, Section 2, and define  for the federal courts the &quot;exceptions&quot;
and &quot;regulations&quot; that  should 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  apply to federal judicial action
over state prisons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Reduce federal intrusion into state crime-fighting activities  and
help the states fight crime by letting them keep more of their  own money.</B>
Congress should affirm the division of authority  between the federal government
and the states in combating violent  crime. Federal officials have enough to do
in fighting the illegal  narcotics traffic and enforcing federal laws against
powerful  organized crime syndicates without trying to get involved in fighting 
street crime. Therefore, Congress should undertake a systematic  review of every
federal law dealing with violent crime, determine  which provisions interfere
with or undermine legitimate state and  local law enforcement authority, and
then repeal them. Congress  also should review Department of Justice advocacy
before the  Supreme Court to determine whether the department is adequately 
supporting state and local law enforcement officials in criminal cases,  and
should examine the impact of the Supreme Court's Miranda  rules governing
confessions to make sure that these restrictions do  not unreasonably limit the
ability of police officers to question  criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the meantime, if Congress wants to assist state and local  law
enforcement authorities, it should rebate up to two percent of  the federal
personal income tax taken from the residents of any  state on the condition that
the state raise an equivalent amount to  combat violent crime within its
territory. Representative  James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) in 1994 offered a similar
proposal  under which these rebates would have amounted to $55 billion in 
constant dollars over a five-year period, a reliable stream of  funding for
anti-crime initiatives.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Hold hearings on the real root causes of crime.</B> Given the 
disconnect between official Washington's thinking, embodied in the  social
spending in the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1994, and reality,  Congress should
conduct a series of hearings on the real root causes   the long term causes  of
crime, particularly on the importance  of family structure, including marriage
and religious practice, in  preventing violent crime. The professional
literature, the most  recent scholarship, and particularly the experience of
private  organizations involved in crime prevention, all are wide and deep on 
this point.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Conduct a serious review of all national social programs.</B> 
Congress should review all national social programs, particularly  those which
are supposed to help prevent or reduce crime, with the  director of each program
required to present both the evaluation  data on the program's effectiveness and
national trend data on the  problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Repeal federal restrictions on prison labor.</B> All federal
statutes  restricting prison work should be repealed. These include  the
Hawes-Cooper Act of 1929, which authorizes states to ban  commerce in
prison-made goods within their borders; the  Sumners-Ashurst Act of 1940, which
prohibits transportation of  prison-made goods within a state for private use;
and the  Walsh-Healey Act of 1936, which prohibits prison work on government 
contracts exceeding $10,000.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#72">72</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL) introduced a bill  (S. 930) to
accelerate the reform of prison operations. The bill  requires inmates in
federal prisons, and in the prisons of states  receiving federal money under the
1994 crime bill to help them  build

is that a  prisoner's life be similar to that of a hardworking young taxpayer

 dimension, most commonly a profound religious commitment  to living a good

<P>One thing is common to all these efforts: giving people a place  to belong.

like Big  Brothers and Big Sisters. Government cannot purchase these efforts. If

<P><B>-     Heed the recommendations of law enforcement organizations  on the
fitness of judicial nominees.</B> The American Bar  Association has become
highly politicized in recent years. Its leaders have  resorted to inflammatory
political rhetoric in attacking the  leadership of Congress, and its liberal
ideological bias has long since  compromised its integrity as an independent
reviewer of the  professional qualifications and fitness of candidates for
judicial office.  The President should dispense with the ABA's advice and seek
an  alternative source for measuring the professional fitness of  judicial
candidates. At the very least, he should give equal consideration  to the views
of constitutional experts selected by law  enforcement associations,
particularly with regard to the sensitivity of  judicial nominees to public
safety.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Order the Justice Department to issue an annual  state-by-state
report card on key indices of crime prevention and reduction.</B>  The key to
reducing crime is for state and local officials to  identify repeat offenders
and keep them in prison for long terms so  they cannot continue to prey upon the
public. In 1992, former  Attorney General William Barr produced a thorough
report detailing  the changes that need to be made to accomplish this  goal.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#73">73</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most of these changes need to be made at the state level, where  98 percent
of all crimes are prosecuted. The Attorney General  could issue an annual report
card based on reductions in violent  crime and the adoption of specific
crime-fighting remedies. Rankings  on crime reduction could be based on current
FBI and Bureau of  Justice Statistics data. Rankings on crime-fighting could be
based  on a state's adoption of specific remedies. Therefore, the  states
should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Sharply restrict pre-trial release for dangerous defendants.</B> 
States should enact legislation and, if necessary, amend their  constitutions to
allow for detention without bail pending trial for  defendants who pose a proven
threat to victims, witnesses, or the  community at large. Legislation to grant
judges this power in  federal courts was adopted in 1984. Under this law, a
judge who finds  that release will endanger the safety of any other person or
the  community, and that no combination of conditions on a release can 
reasonably assure such safety, may deny bail and order the  defendant detained
until trial. Any defendant convicted within the past  five years of a violent
crime committed on pre-trial release is  automatically presumed to be a danger
to the community. An  additional sentence of two to 10 years also applies to any
felony  committed while on pre-trial release.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This law has worked well at the federal level and provides a  model that
should be adopted by every state to prevent repeat  offenders from committing
crimes pending trial, which remains a  significant problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Sharply limit probation.</B> Probation should be prohibited for 
the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  following serious offenses:
murder, rape, armed robbery,  felonies involving the intentional or knowing
infliction of serious  physical injury, or a second conviction for any felony.
Probation  leaves these classes of criminals free to threaten law-abiding 
citizens. Limiting it is a commonsense way to keep serious repeat  offenders off
the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Adopt strict state sentencing guidelines.</B> A comprehensive  and
complex set of guidelines developed by the U.S. Sentencing  Commission has been
adopted to govern sentencing for federal  crimes. These guidelines specify a
narrow range of sentences for  each crime which vary according to the
seriousness of the crime,  the prior record of the defendant, whether a weapon
was used,  how much bodily injury or financial loss was caused, and other 
factors. Federal judges must impose sentences within this narrow  range, except
in cases where the judge believes special  circumstances warrant a departure.
The prosecution or defense may appeal a  sentence departing from the guidelines,
and such departure will not  be upheld without a strong and valid justification.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If states adopted such sentencing guidelines, liberal or  lenient judges
would be hard pressed to evade them. This is one of  the most important reforms
state officials could adopt to get  repeat offenders off the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Abolish parole for violent offenders.</B> Under federal 
sentencing guidelines, parole has been all but abolished. Early release is 
allowed only for &quot;good time credits,&quot; which may reduce the  imposed
sentence by no more than 15 percent. If states adopted  this standard, it could
be a powerful weapon in the fight to keep  violent repeat offenders in prison.
Virginia Governor George Allen  made 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  this reform a central theme in
his criminal justice reform program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Acquire adequate prison space.</B> No reform aimed at 
incarcerating repeat and violent criminals can succeed without sufficient 
prison space. In most jurisdictions, including the federal system,  this means
constructing or otherwise acquiring additional capacity.  As former Attorney
General Barr has said, &quot;The choice is clear:  More prison space or more
crime.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#74">74</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lawmakers can justify this expenditure by noting that the cost  of acquiring
additional prison space is offset not only by the  far larger savings to society
from reducing crime, but also by the  incalculable benefits derived from
protecting the lives and  property of American citizens. Costs also can be
reduced significantly  by contracting out the construction and operation of
prisons to  private firms which have a proved they can build and operate 
additional prison space at substantially less cost than government 
bureaucracies. With private owners and operators, government also need  not
provide full financing of construction costs up front  a  severe constraint in
most states. Financing could be obtained by  the owner in private capital
markets and recouped over time  through fees paid by the government for use of a
facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Private firms have proved they can construct and bring into  operation new
facilities much more quickly than the  government, thereby reducing capital
costs. Competitive market incentives  produce more cost-effective construction,
management, and  operation design on the part of private firms. Private
construction of  prisons is much more common than private operation, but there
still  are dozens of successful prisons operated privately with higher  quality
and at much lower cost.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#75">75</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Require prisoners to work.</B> State legislation should be enacted
 to require inmates to work full-time while in prison. Any net  earnings should
go first to the victim as restitution, after which at least  half should go to
the prison to finance incarceration costs. In  addition to generating funds for
these purposes, required work would  teach discipline, mold positive social
attitudes, and develop work  skills that enable the prisoner to obtain gainful
employment after  release. A 1991 federal study found that convicts who worked
in  prison were less likely to commit crimes after release and much  more likely
to be gainfully employed.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#76">76</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Requiring prisoners to work also can reduce operating costs  by using at
least part of the resulting products and services to  offset prison budgets (see
below). Texas A&amp;M economics  professor Morgan Reynolds points out that in
the past, many prisons  were self-financing thanks to required work by  inmates.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#77">77</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Require prisoners to study.</B> Training, education, and 
counseling sessions should be offered to prisoners in the evenings and  on
weekends  the same time non-criminal working adults  outside prison must attend
classes. Requiring such extra effort to  obtain the benefits of higher
achievement would teach better social  attitudes and build self-respect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     End furloughs and other temporary release programs.</B>Violent  or
repeat offenders should not be released from prison on  unsupervised furloughs,
work/education release, or other temporary  or conditional release programs.
Nearly 60 percent of prisoner  escapes in 1990 occurred during furlough or
work/education  releases,<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#78">78</A> and
many crimes are committed by prisoners during  such 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  furloughs or releases.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#79">79</A>  Violent or repeat offenders also
should  not be released pending appeal of a conviction, as this merely  allows
them the further opportunity to flee and commit additional crimes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Impose the death penalty for heinous crimes.</B> The death 
penalty should be imposed for several particularly serious offenses:  murder of
law enforcement officers, murder committed during  commission of a serious
felony, murder committed in prison, or  other murders in which the jury finds
aggravating factors that  outweigh any mitigating factors and result in a crime
sufficiently heinous  to justify death as the penalty. In fact, the death
penalty is used  sparingly in the United States. According to the Bureau of
Justice  Statistics, of the 4984 prisoners sentenced to death during the  period
1973 to 1993, 226, or 4.5 percent, were  executed.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#80">80</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The death penalty deters potential murderers, permanently  prevents repeat
offenders, and exacts appropriate justice for the  most heinous crimes.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#81">81</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Guarantee victims' rights.</B> State legislation should be enacted
 to establish clearly the following rights of victims: the right to  be present
and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial  proceedings parallel to the
rights of defendants, including bail and other  hearings, plea negotiations,
sentencing, and any other public  proceedings; the right to present a &quot;victim's
impact statement&quot; at the  time of sentencing, with surviving family members
exercising the  deceased victim's rights; the right to full restitution out of
any  assets or earnings of the defendant, including the full rights of 
collection as enjoyed by any other creditor, with exemption from discharge  if
the criminal files for bankruptcy; the right to be fully informed  of all
proceedings against the defendant, as well as the  defendant's 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  incarceration; and the right to
mandate HIV testing of  defendants in sexual offense cases before trial, and
periodic tests to catch  a latent HIV infection. In addition, every prosecutor's
office  should have a victim-witness coordinator to inform victims of their 
rights and help them exercise those rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each state also should establish in its criminal statutes a clear  right of
self-defense that allows the victim of a crime to use  deadly force to protect
himself from bodily harm and to protect his  home or business. The same right of
self-defense &quot;without  retreat&quot; should apply elsewhere when the victim
is not at fault in  causing an altercation. Innocent victims should not be
subject to legal  second-guessing of the snap  and usually frightened  
judgments they make under extreme distress in exercising their right to 
self-defense, though use of excessive force must remain illegal.  The law also
should exempt from civil liability any action  committed in self-defense that is
not a violation of criminal law, as well  as any other injury suffered by a
criminal while committing  a crime.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#82">82</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Reform the juvenile justice system.</B> While overall crime rates 
have declined, the major criminal threat to civil society is the rapid  increase
in juvenile crime. Yet juvenile criminals generally are  exempt from the
criminal justice system until they reach age 18;  instead, they are often
covered by juvenile delinquency systems  that impose little if any real
punishment, typically granting  probation for crime after crime or holding
offenders for relatively short  periods in ineffective juvenile detention
centers. Gaining control of  the crime problem therefore requires thorough
reform of the  juvenile justice system.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> states should enact legislation that allows adult charges 
for juveniles 14 or older who commit murder, rape, kidnapping,  armed robbery,
or assault with a firearm, or who intentionally inflict  serious physical
injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> all offenders who remain in juvenile delinquency  systems
should be required to pay restitution to their victims. For  every serious
offense, the juvenile also should be sentenced to  extended, mandatory
participation in a highly structured community  service or public works program
after school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> an extended sentence to an institutional boot camp  should be
required for repeat offenders, juvenile offenders who fail  to comply with
sentenced participation in community service or  public works programs, and
juveniles under the age of 14 who  commit violent crimes. Such boot camps should
be operated with  military-style regimentation and discipline, providing
education and  requiring work on a highly structured schedule. Young offenders 
generally come from single-parent families, with many of their  neighbors and
even parents involved in drugs, alcohol abuse,  prostitution, or other crimes.
Their moral development can be  achieved only by removing them from this
environment and keeping  them in one that requires moral responsibility for
several years.  Sentences to such boot camps until adulthood at 18 should be 
common for those whose crimes qualify them for such sentences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> records of juvenile convictions for crimes of  violence
should be carefully maintained and made available at  sentencing for any future
crimes of violence committed in juvenile years  or adulthood. Studies show that
juvenile crime records are one of  the strongest predictors of repeat adult
crime. Considering these  ear
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  lier convictions will lead to
stronger sentences for repeat  offenders at an earlier age, thereby further
reducing  crime.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#83">83</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Clean up the police departments and make greater use of  community
policing.</B> Most police officers are solid members of their  communities, but
the failure of the criminal justice system to  incarcerate repeat and violent
offenders demoralizes even the best of  them. Beyond this political failure, too
many cities have made  matters worse by deliberately lowering service standards
and  imposing racial and gender quotas on a job that should be filled only on 
the basis of individual merit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The absence of effective screening for criminal misconduct,  poor starting
salaries, poor supervision by commanders in the  field, atrocious personnel
management, failure to recruit personnel  of outstanding character as well as
ability  all these factors  have combined to encourage patterns of brutality,
corruption, and  demoralization in too many police departments in American 
cities. Charges and revelations of corruption, brutality, and  tampering with
evidence in Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Los  Angeles have undermined public
confidence in the police. There is no  substitute for character and moral
integrity in a police officer: A  bad person cannot be a good cop. From the
standpoint of  personnel management, recruiting, and hiring, the acquisition of
good  police officers should be the first order of business. And while  officers
should be recruited from every sector of the community, only  the best should be
hired  and only on merit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>State and local officials also should return to an older tradition  of
policing. The police in most communities operate by patrolling  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  police cars, waiting for calls
for help and then responding  as quickly as possible. An alternative strategy
now developing  is known as community policing. Under this approach, officers 
are assigned to small neighborhoods and are responsible for  getting out of
their cars and spending most of their time walking the  beat. By visiting local
businesses, talking to residents, attending  community meetings, and learning
first-hand what is going on  and what the citizens are concerned about, they
gain a far more  detailed understanding of the people and their neighborhoods. 
Police-citizen community activities include organizing citizen  crime-watch
patrols, canvassing local businesses and private  security guards to glean
information, and instructing all citizens on  what they must look for to assist
the police and avoid becoming  victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The community policing strategy has proven quite successful  in deterring
crime, apprehending criminals, and removing fear  from communities.84  State and
local governments should use this  approach more widely, substantially
increasing police personnel  and assigning them to high-crime areas where they
can provide  a strong police presence on the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are conservatives more interested in sending more  young men to
prison than in keeping them out?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The first task of government is to protect its citizens.  That
means putting more violent criminals in prison and keeping  them there.
Rehabilitation programs have not delivered on their  promise to reduce violent
crime, and citizens should not be asked to  put 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  their hopes in rehabilitation for
these kinds of criminals.  Innocent citizens are not protected by such hopes.
This is not to say  that long-term prevention strategies should be abandoned. To
the  contrary, conservatives affirm prevention strategies, including  many now
operating in the private sector, that work and are  solidly grounded in the
institutions that can best prevent crime: the  family, the church, and the
school. In the meantime, a sound  conservative social policy would aim to
strengthen these institutions. This is  the best way to keep young men out of
prison. <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#85">85</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't crime going down?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes; overall, violent crime is going down slightly. That is  the
good news. Nevertheless, it is still 350 percent higher than just  30 years ago.
Further bad news is that teenage violent crime is  going up and shows every sign
of continuing to rise for the next 16  years at least unless there is a major
cultural change in the United  States. This is so because the rise in violent
crime is directly related to  the breakdown in family and community, and
Americans have yet  to see an increasing number of out-of-wedlock children grow 
up without parental supervision, love, or discipline. If  Americans somehow
could turn the deteriorating family structure  around, strengthening the
nation's families and recording no more  out-of-wedlock births from today
onwards, we still would have to  wait for this psychologically damaged and
potentially violent group  of young offenders to work their way through the
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What is wrong with imposing uniform federal sentences?   Shouldn't a
crime receive the same penalty in any part of the US.?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We have state and local judges and juries to evaluate the  cir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  cumstances and the level of guilt
in each case. Judges ought  to have descretion to impose different sentences;
but, at the  same time, criminals should be required to serve at least 85
percent  of these sentences. Truth in sentencing is just that: If you do  the
crime, you do the time. Everybody is clear: the judge, the  jailer, the
criminal, and  last but not least  the citizen. But that is  a policy decision
best left to the states. Local communities can  best assess the effectiveness of
their local judges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives in Congress oppose federal assistance  to police
in the President's crime bill?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives in Congress don't oppose federal assistance  to
local law enforcement. Under the proposal enacted by the  House of
Representatives, Congress can continue to do the very best  that the Clinton
Administration program can do, but can do it  even better. With the
congressional block grant approach, passed by  the House of Representatives and
threatened with a veto by  President Clinton, local police can get even more
money, may be able to  hire even more personnel, and they will have even more
flexibility  to use these funds in a fashion that best suits local needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, the Clinton Administration funding for police is at  the
discretion of the President. There is solid evidence that  Administration
funding does not go to localities hit hardest by  violent crime. For example,
Portland, Oregon, which accounts for 56  percent of all violent crime committed
in the state of Oregon, got  less than one percent of the funding awarded to 
Oregon.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#86">86</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't America's prison population exploding because law  enforcement
is cracking down on minor drug offenses?  
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. As the bipartisan Council on Crime in America  reports, since
1974, over 90 percent of all inmates in state prisons  have been either violent
offenders or repeat felons. Between 1980  and 1993, the number of persons
imprisoned for violent crimes  grew by 221,000, or 1.3 times the growth of those
imprisoned as  &quot;drug offenders.&quot;  Furthermore, 80 percent of federal
and state drug  offenders are drug traffickers with a history of repeat
offenses.

	The  Project on Federalism and the States, formerly the Governors' Forum, was established in 1993 to enhance the role of the chief executives and legislators of the fifty states in the public debate on issues of national importance.  The broad purpose of the Project is to help increase the voice of the states in Washington to ensure that their interests command greater attention from officials in the federal government.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States is committed to restoring a balance between federal and state responsibilities through a reinvigoration of federalism.  The transfer of power from the states to Washington over the past decades has reached an unprecedented level, with virtually no area of public policy free from directives from Washington.  As the authority of state and local governments has declined, their ability to protect the interests of their constituents has continued to erode.  With decision-making on most major issues now firmly centered in Washington, state and local governments and their constituents are subjected to an ever-expanding list of mandates, regulations, and financial burdens which take little or no account of the differences between the states or of the wishes of their electorates.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States provides a platform in Washington for governors, state legislators, attorneys general, and other state and local officials to articulate directly to the Congress their positions on issues such as welfare reform, crime, education, and unfunded federal mandates on the states.   The Project highlights public policy innovations occurring outside Washington DC  through activities such as gubernatorial lectures, press conferences, position papers and editorials on key issues affecting the states, and extensive networking with national, state, and local media.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When President Clinton vetoed welfare reform last year, he also vetoed significant adoption reforms included in the package. Congress will soon take up the adoption issue again in the Adoption and Stability Act of 1996 (<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03286:">H.R. 3286</a>), sponsored by Representative Susan Molinari (R-NY).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The key component of this bill is a $5,000 tax credit to encourage adoption. This tax relief is phased out gradually for families with annual incomes between $75,000 and $110,000. Beyond ending inequities in interracial and Indian adoptions, the bill also permits employees to deduct from their taxes up to $5,000 in employer assistance for additional adoption expenses. These reforms are financed by changes in foreign trust law and in energy subsidies, both mechanisms also approved by the House and Senate last year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The $5,000 tax credit, which may be spread out over five years, defrays a significant portion of the costs of adopting a child and is a bargain to taxpayers who now pay an average of $13,000 per year to foster a child.<sup>2</sup>  But the bill still does not allow the credit to apply to payroll taxes, and thus prevents families who adopt but pay less than $1,000 in federal taxes each year<sup>3</sup> from benefiting from the adoption tax credit. These are precisely the families who need help the most.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Ending Discrimination.</b> H.R. 3286 removes obstacles to interracial adoption by penalizing, with a decrease in funding, any state that refuses to allow any person to adopt a child regardless of race or color. It also ends an unjust application of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Today, parents who are totally or partially Indian and have not maintained close contact with their tribe may have the adoption of their child by non-Indian parents blocked. This can be achieved by admitting the child or one of the parents to full membership in the tribe, even after the adoption has taken place. In the future, under H.R. 3286, unless one of the parents maintains a significant affiliation with the tribe, adoption by non-Indian parents may not be blocked.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Other reforms are needed in the adoption and foster care system if the rate of adoptions is to increase. Removing the barriers to adoption in the social service bureaucracy is the most significant of these remaining reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption rates have declined in recent decades as adoption has fallen out of favor with state governments and the social services establishment. In 1979, 598,000 babies were born out of wedlock; almost one in four was adopted. In 1991, of the 1,225,000 born out of wedlock, only one in 25 was adopted (see <a href="bg1080c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Yet public interest has increased: close to two million couples would like to adopt these children. Clearly, the problem is far more basic than any financial burden that may be involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the vast need for adoption and the large pool of parents willing to adopt, Congress not only should encourage adoptions through generous tax relief for adopting parents, but also must change the public social service ethos by eliminating all barriers to speedy and permanent adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The simplest and fastest way to bring about these improvements is to privatize all adoption services. Government agencies have institutional strengths in applying and enforcing the law, but private institutions can better harness the human qualities needed to nurture and develop children. To encourage adoption through private organizations, and to reduce barriers to adoption through government agencies, Congress, the Administration, and the states need to take several important actions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the federal government should do:
<P><ul>
<li>Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.
<p>
<li>Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of a very effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.
<P>
<li>Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.
<p>
<li>Require federally funded family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
<p>
<li>Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.
<p>
<li>Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit any use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.
<p>
<li>Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.
<P>
<li>Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the states should do:
<ul><p>
<li>Privatize adoption services.
<p>
<li>Change the way public welfare agencies are financed so that they are obliged to contract for all public adoptions.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments.
<p>
<li>Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children.
<p>
<li>Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li>Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.
<p>
<li>Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.
<p>
<li>Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.
<P>
<li>Enact legislation subjecting public social service agencies to the same licensing standards and requirements as those imposed on private adoption agencies.
<P>
<li>Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.
<p>
<li>Prohibit the removal of a child eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt, except when the child is being returned to his legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.
<p>
<li>Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption works. It increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the public. It brings much happiness, both to the adopting parents and to the adopted child. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add steadily to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. At the same time, up to two million couples waiting to adopt frequently find themselves hamstrung by government agencies and government practices.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past 25 years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of children born out of wedlock, children being raised by single parents, families on welfare, and children entering the foster care system because of abuse and neglect. Family disintegration is widespread. There also has been a sharp decrease in the number of children being adopted, with formal adoptions dropping by almost 50 percent: from 89,000 in 1970 to a fairly constant 50,000 annually throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Christine Bachrach, now Director of the Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), adoption has declined since the early 1970s primarily because of a drop in the proportion of white mothers who place their babies for adoption. Birth mothers who have continued to place their babies for adoption are more likely to have well educated mothers, are still at school,  have never worked, and are older. Also, they are more likely to place daughters for adoption than sons. Levels of adoption have remained low for blacks and are virtually non-existent for Hispanic women.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Women likely to adopt tend to be married, sterile,<sup>6</sup> and 30 years of age or older. Nearly half of all women with these characteristics have adopted.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Council for Adoption estimates that of the 50,000 children adopted annually, 25,000 are healthy children under age two, 10,000 are healthy children over age two, and 15,000 are children with "special needs" (the social work term of art for children considered difficult to place because of their age, physical or mental condition, race or ethnicity, or need to be placed with siblings).<sup>8</sup>  About one-third of these adoptions are arranged by government-funded and government-managed public agencies, some by contract with private agencies. Another one-third are arranged by private, mostly nonprofit agencies, and the rest are contracted outside of agency auspices, mostly through lawyers in private practice. International adoptions accounted for an additional 8,000 adoptions during 1994.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption fell out of favor among social workers during the 1970s, even as single parenthood and abortion became more widespread. Advocates of government-sponsored social programs argued that increases in welfare would make it possible for unmarried mothers to rear children without the assistance of a father.<sup>9</sup>  Yet, as is evident from the skyrocketing foster care numbers<sup>10</sup> and from the chronic problems associated with the absence of fathers, such as crime, poor school performance, poor health status, and low income,<sup>11</sup> that view has turned out to be a tragic mistake. By contrast, children adopted by two parents are doing as well as their peers raised in their own intact families.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>PATTERNS OF PARENTAL NEGLECT </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The rapid increase of illegitimacy and the staggering problems of children born out of wedlock and raised without fathers are well documented.<sup>13</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>In 1991, 29.5 percent of all births and 68 percent of minority births were out of wedlock.<sup>14</sup>  In 1970, 10.7 percent of all children and 37.6 percent of minority children were born to unmarried mothers.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1986, 66 percent of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion and 33 percent ended with a woman choosing to be a single parent. Only 1 percent ended in adoption.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1992, 659,000 children were in state-sponsored foster care and institutional care for all or part of the year. On any given day, half a million American children live in government-sponsored substitute care.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1982, 7,100 infants were in substitute care outside their homes; in 1988, there were over 17,000.
<p>
<li>In 1991, 2,000 children died from abuse or neglect. Some were murdered. Between 30-50 percent of children killed by their parents or caretakers were known to child protective services before their murders took place.<sup>18</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There has been a sharp increase in the number of infants abandoned by their frequently drug-addicted mothers. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 12,000 infants were abandoned in 1991.<sup>19</sup>  In response to this crisis, there has been a proliferation of "boarder baby"<sup>20</sup> homes to care for these children until their parents can be located and rehabilitated. A 1993 General Accounting Office report showed that 10,000 infants were being boarded in hospitals for no medical reason. Less than 40 percent of the boarder babies -- and none of the abandoned babies -- were expected to leave in the care of their parents.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The average total cost of caring for these babies in hospital after their medical treatment is almost $13,000.<sup>21</sup>  Nonetheless, only 2.5 percent of the boarder babies and 6 percent of the abandoned infants were expected to go into adoptive placements.<sup>22</sup>  The vast majority of these children will spend years in and out of the foster care system while the biological mother attempts to get her life together.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal efforts to deal with this have been small and swamped by the size of the problem.<sup>24</sup>  When Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) introduced the At-Birth Abandoned Infants Act (H.R. 2936) in 1994 to help move abandoned babies out of the system and into permanent adoptive homes, the child welfare establishment lobbied against it, arguing that creating a two-tiered system -- a fast track for new-born abandoned babies and a slower, less responsive one for older children -- was unfair.<sup>25</sup>  The bill was not enacted.
<p>
<b>WHY ADOPTION SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED</b>
<p>
<b>Benefits for Children</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adopted children do as well as or better than their non-adopted counterparts, according to a 1994 study by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based public policy research organization specializing in questions of concern to states and cities.<sup>26</sup>  This study, the largest examination of adopted adolescents yet undertaken, concludes that:
<p><ul>
<li>Teens who were adopted at birth are more likely than children born into intact families to live with two parents in a middle-class family.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children score higher than their middle-class counterparts on indicators of school performance, social competency, optimism, and volunteerism.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single parents and less involved in alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police trouble, weapon use, and theft.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents score higher than children of single parents on self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directedness, positive view of others, and feelings of security within their families.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
<li>On health measures, adopted children and children of intact families share similarly high scores, and both those groups score significantly higher than children raised by single parents.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children do well at school. In 1981, only 7 percent of children adopted in infancy repeated a grade, while 12 percent of children living with both biological parents repeated a grade.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>Compared with the general child population, children placed with adoptive couples are better off economically. Their parents are better educated and older than the parents of other children.<sup>33</sup>
<P>
<li>Adoptive parents are less likely to divorce.<sup>34</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Virtually all of these findings have been replicated by Nicholas Zill, Vice President and Director of Child and Family Studies at Westat Research Corporation of Maryland, in his analysis of data from the federal government's 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child Health.<sup>35</sup>  Results from the survey were compared across four groups: adopted children, children of unmarried mothers being raised by the mother, children of intact families, and children being raised by their grandparents. The data indicated that adopted children:
<p><ul>
<li>Enjoy a quality of home environment superior to all the other groups;<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li>Have superior access to health care compared to all the other groups;<sup>37</sup>
<p>
<li>Enjoy health similar to that of children of intact families and superior to that of the other two groups; and
<p>
<li>Do better in educational attainment than single-parent children and children raised by grandparents.<sup>38</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When compared with those adopted later, born outside of marriage and raised by the single mother, or raised in an intact family, children who are adopted in infancy:
<ul><p>
<li>Repeat grades less often than any other group;
<p>
<li>See mental health professionals less than all other groups, except children of intact families;
<p>
<li>Have better health status than all other groups;
<p>
<li>Have a better standing in their school classes than all other groups, except children raised in intact families; and
<p>
<li>Have fewer behavior problems than all other groups, except children raised in intact families.
</ul><P>
<b>Benefits for Mothers Who Give Up Children for Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better than mothers who choose to be single parents.
<ul><p>
<li>They have higher educational aspirations, are more likely to finish school, and less likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance than mothers who keep their children.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
<li>They delay marriage longer and are more likely to marry eventually.
<p>
<li>They are more likely to be employed 12 months after the birth and less likely to repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<p>
<li>They are no more likely to suffer negative psychological consequences, such as depression, than are mothers who rear children as single parents.<sup>40</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All the goals of liberal government programs like job training, supplemental education, and family planning are attained with greater ease, and at lower cost, through adoption.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW MANY POTENTIAL PARENTS ARE THERE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although growing numbers of children need adoption, there are more than enough families to meet the demand. The National Council for Adoption estimates that at least one million infertile couples and an additional one million fertile couples would like to adopt.<sup>42</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Christine Bachrach of NICHD concluded from the National Survey of Family Growth that over 2,000,000 women have sought to adopt at one time or another, and about 200,000 were actively seeking to adopt in 1988.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Couples who want to adopt are not looking just for healthy, Caucasian infants, despite assumptions to the contrary. The National Down's Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports a waiting list of over 100 couples who would like to adopt a child with Down's syndrome -- more than enough to accomodate parents who want Down's children given up for adoption. Nor is it difficult to find families for children with spina bifida and children who are HIV positive. For example, the National Council for Adoption is identifying children who will be orphaned when their parents die of AIDS, so that appropriate plans can be made before the parents' death. The response by individuals and families willing to adopt such children has been overwhelming.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans are also willing to help with children from overseas, especially because of the anti-adoption bias in the United States. When the communist regime in Romania fell, ABC-TV's "20/20" reported that thousands of children were warehoused in government orphanages. Pictures showed many children with health and developmental problems. ABC received over 25,000 self-addressed, stamped envelopes from people who wanted more information, and within six months 2,000 Romanian children were adopted by Americans,<sup>44</sup> many of whom had not considered adoption until this need became known. This suggests that the pool of parents willing to adopt could be expanded signficantly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, over 56 percent of the 7,348 children from other countries adopted by American parents were over the age of one. Of these, 9 percent were between the ages of five and nine, and 5 percent were over the age of ten.<sup>45</sup>  In addition, many of these foreign-born children have physical and emotional problems at the time of their adoption.<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the evident readiness and desire to adopt, many families report a lack of support or encouragement from the social services establishment. They report such things as unanswered phone calls, inadequate networking with other agencies which may have children ready for adoption, a disinclination to identify children with needs that correspond to the gifts of the family, and a general lack of support to bring couples successfully through the adoption process.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
<b>THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although adoption meets the interests of the needy child better than any other option, Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School concludes that "our adoption system has failed to live up to even its own limited vision.... Laws and policies that are supposed to protect children have created barriers to adoption that function effectively to prevent these children from getting the kind of protection they most need 'a loving, nurturing and permanent home.'"<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legal system often resolves cases in ways that trouble many Americans. In two widely publicized recent cases, for example, children were wrested from their adoptive parents on the basis of biological ties. Baby Jessica was given to her biological father, who had failed to support two previous children, and Baby Richard was given to his biological father, with whom he had never lived, instead of being allowed to remain with the adoptive family which had nurtured him from birth for three years. In both cases, the overriding "biological ties" of the fathers prevailed over the needs of their children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #1: Anti-Adoption Bias in Pregnancy Counseling</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only 1 percent of women who experience an "unwanted pregnancy" choose adoption for their children.<sup>49</sup>  A University of Illinois study explains some of the causes:
<ul><p>
<li>Some 40 percent of individuals in a variety of settings (health, family planning, social services, and adoption agencies) who identify themselves as "pregnancy counselors" do not even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients.
<p>
<li>An additional 40 percent provide inaccurate or incomplete information to clients.
<p>
<li>By contrast, 38 percent of the clients whose counselors offered adoption went on to choose adoption.<sup>50</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress's efforts to require adoption information and counseling in one federally funded program providing services to pregnant women have met with resistance from family planning professionals. For instance, the Adolescent Family Life Act<sup>51</sup> was passed in the early 1980s to provide a modest ($7.8 million), more "pro-life," adoption-friendly alternative to the pregnancy counseling provided by established Title X and Title XIX family planning services (typically over $300 million per year). The bias among professionals against adoption can be seen in the evaluation of the program's effectiveness. Some 7 percent of the grantees violated the most basic terms of their grants by not providing any information on adoption to their clients. Most grantees failed to provide either adequate adoption information or counseling.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
<b>BARRIER #2: Misuse of the Foster Care System</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1980, Congress enacted P.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. This legislation sought to provide permanent homes for children at risk of abuse and neglect by establishing a hierarchy of services for these children and for their families. In order of priority, these services were:
<p>
1. Family preservation;
<p>
2. Short-term foster care with a goal of family reunification; and
<p>
3. Long-term foster care or adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This legislation requires that each child's situation be reviewed every six months. Within 18 months of opening every case, a permanent plan for the child's future must be in place. This placement plan embodies a decision by the child welfare agency as to whether the child will be returned to the family or placed for adoption. Such decisions and plans must be in place before the work of clearing the child for adoption can be undertaken. Only after both steps have been taken can the search for adoptive parents begin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 1980s, these permanency planning guidelines evolved into the operating principle of "family preservation" -- keeping families intact through early, intense, comprehensive social services. The goal was to keep families united and thus avoid the high costs of foster care.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of their own high costs, however, family preservation services cannot be sustained for long periods; and because of high demand, caseworkers move quickly to take care of the next family in crisis. This approach did succeed in stopping the removal of children from the home, but not necessarily in preserving them from further abuse.<sup>53</sup>  In fact, there is evidence that children fare worse under these new practices. In New York City alone, during the 12 months of 1992, 21 children were killed by a parent or mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened.<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A study by John Schuerman and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found that the "Family First" program did not realize even its central goal: preventing the removal of children.<sup>55</sup>  Neither did it protect children from further abuse. There is evidence that some families continue to abuse their children even during the period of intensive state intervention.<sup>56</sup>  By contrast, there is strong evidence that children do better when left in foster care than when they are returned to abusive families.<sup>57</sup>  This evidence leads to a simple and commonsense conclusion: children need a permanent home to which they can belong. For children at serious risk, an adoptive home is their best chance for real permanence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some child advocates challenge the principle of applying the "family preservation" approach in all cases. At a 1994 conference sponsored by the National Council for Adoption at Boys Town, Nebraska, Dr. Richard Gelles of the University of Rhode Island, a pre-eminent child abuse researcher and an early and optimistic supporter of family preservation programs, presented the following paraphrased views on these practices in light of recent evaluation data:
<p><blockquote>

	There are a now a number of studies of children who were returned home only to be abused again or even killed. These studies show dramatically that some abusive parents cannot be rehabilitated.<sup>58</sup>  In these cases the appropriate care of such a child is to terminate the parents' rights as quickly as possible and place the child with a permanent caring adoptive family.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Boys Town conference highlighted the central problem of family preservation services. The first logical step should be to assess whether the child should be removed immediately and whether the parents are likely to benefit from support services. Instead, family preservation services are assumed to be the best first treatment. Though these services are activated because of abuse to the child -- sometimes very severe abuse -- they must fail before the child can be protected from the abusing family.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The foster care system is the aggregate network of parents who work for state and local social service agencies by taking abandoned, abused, or neglected children into their homes. They receive a set amount each month with which to feed, clothe, and nurture these children. Foster parents try to function as substitute parents. Prudently, they are admonished not to expect that placement will be permanent. However, from among the couples who take on this work come many who would like to adopt, particularly as they get to know these children and their lack of prospects for a happy and safe life in their families of origin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Government funding reinforces an anti-adoption bias by supporting "family preservation" programs with free technical assistance and generous grants while providing only restricted support for adoption. The National Council for Adoption and the Institute for Justice report that numerous families, including foster families, have had their attempts to adopt waiting children rebuffed by the social service agencies for whom they work.<sup>59</sup>  Conna Craig of the Institute for Children in Boston reports receiving hundreds of letters from foster parents who are willing and able to adopt their foster children, some of whom have been eligible for years.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #3: Overload and Confusion of Social Service Roles</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, the rising incidence of reported child abuse keeps local child welfare agencies extremely busy on policing activities, diverting time and resources from adoption.<sup>60</sup>  Often the same staff must investigate abuse reports, provide family preservation services, file for the termination of parental rights, and recruit and prepare adoptive families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The child welfare system typically does not separate the responsibility for terminating parental rights of parents who continue to abuse and neglect their children from the responsibility to help those parents who can be helped. Deaths of children result, as in the cases of the 21 who died in New York in 1992. By contrast, in Arizona and Oregon, separate professional units are used to make initial determinations and to justify the necessary court proceedings. Professionals are not trapped in the role confusion caused by simultaneous demands to reunite every family while also protecting the child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If units like those in Arizona and Oregon were in general use, a number of benefits would result:
<P><ul>
<li>Courts could separate those children more decisively and quickly from parents unlikely to reform or benefit from family preservation services.
<p>
<li>Children in danger of severe abuse would be separated more quickly and expertly from their families and made available for adoption.
<p>
<li>Social workers involved in helping the more tractable parents would be free to pursue that work with much less likelihood of endangering the child.
<p>
<li>Local government agencies could turn to the adoption services of nonprofit agencies much more quickly and frequently. Private agencies do not have the immense burden of child protective services and related policing requirements that public agencies have. Their mission is to recruit and prepare adoptive families, and they tend to have great expertise in this work.
</ul><p>
<b>BARRIER #4: Unsatisfactory Protection of Confidentiality</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
State adoption laws generally guarantee the confidentiality of the identity of the mother, the inviolability of the internal intimacy and harmony of the adoptive family, and the peaceful development of the adopted child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In adoption law and philosophy, there has arisen a view which parallels the modern revisionist view of marriage and parenthood embodied in "no-fault" divorce. New relationships between parent and child are imagined, and a new type of contract is forged between parents. Open adoption is akin to no-fault divorce, and the "birth parents" take on the role of the visiting parent who has not yielded up all his rights to the child, particularly rights of visitation and vacations together. The adoptive parents are bound not just to their adopted child, but also to the birth parents and must facilitate the continuing relationship between the child and his birth parents. This form of open adoption exists in Oregon from birth and in Indiana for children over two years of age.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Open adoption provides no seal of confidentiality regarding the identity of the birth parents, the adopting parents, and the child. It essentially blends birth families with adopting families, directly undermining the creation of a permanent new family for a child. The professional literature shows a frequent confusion of roles when the birth family continues a relationship with the child. This also interferes with parent and child bonding<sup>61</sup> in the adoptive family and inhibits the birth parents' grieving process.<sup>62</sup>  There are parallel experiences and research findings with respect to divorce and the increased risks of being raised in blended families.<sup>63</sup>
Confidentiality, especially in infant adoptions, helps minimize these risks.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Oregon is an example of a state in which open adoption allows birth parents to take adoptive parents to court to uphold visitation agreements. This policy undermines the rights of adoptive parents to make parenting decisions. It also changes the nature and dynamics of a close, intact, inviolably intimate adoptive family, exposing it to the disruptions, conflicts, and anxieties characteristic of divorced and blended families. The professional literature on childhood emotional and behavioral development shows that children of blended families do less well than children of single parents and intact families.<sup>64</sup>  If successful, the growing push for open adoption<sup>65</sup> could cause similar difficulties for adopted children, undermining the generally strong mental health reported by the Search Institute and Nicholas Zill.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of open adoption even recommend abolishing adoption in favor of "guardianship," which does not offer the same permanency of family for the child.<sup>67</sup>  Like any other government policy which treats the adoptive families differently from intact families, this undermines the very essence of adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Understandably, many children become interested in knowing about their birth parents as they reach early adulthood. Their desire may be fulfilled if everyone involved is prepared to cooperate in lifting the veil of confidentiality. Most states try to maintain confidentiality if there is not full agreement among all concerned. Others do not. Two, Alaska and Kansas, will release the original birth certificate with the names of the biological parents to the adopted person after the age of eighteen, regardless of the birth mother's desires.<sup>68</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of opening adoption records seek legislation at the federal level. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced various versions of a "national reunion registry" to help connect birth parents with persons who are adopted. The National Council for Adoption and many of its affiliated private adoption agencies have challenged the vagueness of the legislative proposals which do not assure confidentiality. They also have questioned the need to federalize a state issue.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #5: Unknown, Uninvolved, or Unmarried Fathers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another major barrier for unmarried women considering adoption for their children is the need to obtain the consent of uninvolved fathers. Fortunately the Supreme Court, in a series of opinions,<sup>69</sup> has clarified and restricted the rights of uninvolved, unmarried fathers. According to current federal law, these rights correspond to the effort the father has made to establish a relationship with his child. The unmarried father who is unknown, is uninvolved, or has otherwise demonstrated no responsibility or interest in the child may not be entitled to the same consideration as an involved and responsible unmarried father. Federal courts have ruled consistently<sup>70</sup> that ignorance of a pregnancy is no excuse for uninvolvement, because the father was present at conception and could have followed through to assure adequate care for the child. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A growing trend in state legislatures, upheld by the Supreme Court in <I>Lehr v. Robertson</I>,<sup>71</sup> is the establishment of father registries which make the father responsible for asserting his parental rights. The registry usually requires the father to file a paternity action within 30 days of the child's birth. This will result in his being notified of a pending adoption. He then will have an opportunity to demonstrate that he has tried to establish a relationship with the child and to take responsibility for the child's care. If he fails to meet any of these requirements, he forfeits his rights to contest the adoption of the child, and the adoption can proceed. While many conservatives think an absent unmarried father should never be an obstacle to adoption, this procedure at least frees the mothers to place children without registered fathers for adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House welfare bill requires paternity establishment at birth for all fathers. This is a major step in the right direction. Fears that efforts to locate unknown, unmarried fathers will slow down, and possibly stop, adoption are unfounded. If the mother is not seeking AFDC support (and she will not if she is placing her child for adoption), she will not need to identify the father. Simultaneously, the putative father registry protects the due process rights of all fathers. Those who do not register, however, cannot benefit from the protection it would have given them.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #6: Race of the Child and Adoptive Parents</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Two forms of racial discrimination take place within adoption: against adoptive parents and against children waiting to be adopted. Potential black parents lose the chance to give their love to needy children of their own race. Black children in foster care are deprived of new parents and a stronger foundation in life, in addition to being exposed to the risks of retarded social and intellectual development. Both forms of discrimination must be eliminated. Fortunately, the means to accomplish this already exist within the private sector. There is no need for coercive race-matching legislation.
<P>
<b>THE SPECIAL PLIGHT OF BLACK CHILDREN</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Interracial adoptions account for about 8 percent of adoptions and consist primarily of adoptions of black children by white parents.<sup>72</sup>  There are more black children waiting in foster care than there are prescreened black families ready to adopt them. With the need for permanent adoptive homes growing more acute and the exit rate from foster care slowing continually, the likelihood of multiple placements for black children increases.<sup>73</sup>  Indeed, some 24 percent of the children in foster care today have been in three or four different homes.<sup>74</sup>  According to Ira Schwartz of the University of Michigan, 53 percent of all children in Michigan who entered the foster care system as newborns are still in foster care at age four.<sup>75</sup>  A number of regional studies confirm this trend and demonstrate that black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes.<sup>76</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The length of stay in foster care is very important. The longer the newborn stays in foster care, the more at risk he is of approaching the "difficult to adopt" age and the greater the problems associated with long-term foster care become. If half the children who arrive in foster care at birth are still in it at age four, the system is not serving their needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This statistic highlights the need for termination units -- specialized units of social workers who work with the courts to determine whether the parental rights of an abusing or neglectful parent should be withdrawn so that the child may be placed for adoption. If the "best interest of the child" principle is used, this decision will be made quickly. If the "family preservation" principle is used, the decision will be delayed again and again, often until repeated neglect convinces the authorities that parental rights must be removed. At this point, in addition to having suffered even more, the child is older and more difficult to place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given these figures, public welfare agencies are a major source of neglect of young black children. The bias against adopting early, when the child is most adoptable, feeds the foster care system and ensures a larger clientele for public agencies. The present system of financing foster care and not financing adoptions perversely rewards this form of government neglect.
<p>
<b>Black Families and Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is some evidence that blacks adopt at a much higher rate than whites if one controls for family structure, income, and age of parents.<sup>77</sup>  A 1983 Department of Health and Human Services study78 put these comparable rates at:
<p><ul>
<li>7 adoptions per 10,000 black families for all black families;
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 white families for all white families; and
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families for all Hispanic families.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Controlling for age of parents (below 55), family income (above poverty level), and family structure (intact families), the rates change to:
<p><ul>
<li>18 adoptions per 10,000 black families within the range;
<p>
<li>4 adoptions per 10,000 white families within the range; and
<p>
<li>3 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families within the range.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These figures convey the reality of much higher adoption rates among blacks than among whites or Hispanics for children in public welfare agencies who are available for adoption.<sup>79</sup>  There is, however, conflicting evidence that white women were more likely to make adoption plans than black women.<sup>80</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To meet the needs of all children within their own racial communities by placing them in couple-headed families above poverty, the same study suggests that the response rate among black families would have to be far higher than it is. It would need to approach 44 per 10,000 families for blacks, compared with 6 per 10,000 families for whites and 6 per 10,000 families for Hispanics. This would require an enormous increase in the rates of adoption by blacks and Hispanics. Richard Barth of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley sums up the conclusions to which these data lead:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The growth of African-American adoptions have increased by 92% in the last 5 years and Hispanic adoptions by 80%. The growth of African American adoptions would have to grow four times faster than that during the next five years in order to give African American children parity of access to adoption. For Hispanic children, the growth rate would have to double for their opportunity to be adopted to reach parity with Caucasian children.<sup>81</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To achieve these levels of adoption will require a great community effort by black and Hispanic people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As well-run private agencies demonstrate, large pools of adoptive parents can be developed over time. Even pools of parents for "harder to place children" can be developed when the effort is made by a committed organization. For instance, Down's syndrome children are adopted quite quickly because there is a network of screened parents in place and ready to adopt. Similarly, a pool of parents ready to adopt HIV-positive babies has been developed by the National Council for Adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a 1980 study of black parents, sociology professor Robert Hill of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University estimated that three million black households are interested in adopting children. This translates into one hundred black families for every black child in foster care waiting for adoption.<sup>82</sup>  Given this potential, a pool of prescreened adoptive parents big enough to take care of the needs of black children represents an achievable goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The private sector can best develop this pool because private organizations are motivated to do so. Building pools of parents is not the strong suit of public agencies.<sup>83</sup>  Some private organizations in the black community have achieved remarkable results. Recently, for instance, in just one year, Detroit's Homes for Black Children placed 132 children in black homes -- more than all the other 13 child welfare agencies in the city.<sup>84</sup>  To increase the rate of adoption within black families, the leadership of the black community should commit itself strongly to using private organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the emphasis should be on making it easier for black families to adopt, blocking transracial adoptions just because the children are black and the parents are white discriminates against many needy black children because of race. Moreover, it does not increase the rate of in-race adoption. California, despite a law requiring a 90-day search for a same-race family before a child can be adopted across racial lines, still has twice as many black children as white children waiting for adoption, often for long periods.<sup>85</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Institute for Justice last year filed suit on behalf of a white foster couple who had cared for a black child since birth. When the child became eligible, they sought to adopt him but were blocked by the public welfare agency because they were not black. Even when black parents were not found, the agency persisted in blocking this adoption. No one can argue that this was in the best interest of the child.<sup>86</sup>  Similar racial discrimination prevented the adoption of a white child by a black couple who had fostered the child since birth. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1984, liberal black columnist Carl T. Rowan argued against the "abominable notion that race must be the dominant factor in deciding who can deliver loving care and protection to a child."  Rowan equated the position of black social workers who support only in-race adoption with a 1954 statement by a segregationist Mississippi editor that "every child has the right to be educated among children and by teachers of the same racial background."<sup>87</sup>  Furthermore, according to professor Rita Simon, sociologist at the American University and expert in transracial adoption, "The data in our studies and indeed in all the studies that have been done show that transracial adoptions serve the children's best interests."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, opposition to transracial adoption is strong. When former Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH) steered S. 1224 through Congress in 1993, he did so to outlaw obstacles similar to the above restrictions that exist in most states. But the Clinton Administration, which supports race matching, succeeded in changing the legislation so that lack of race matching could be used to deny or delay a placement.<sup>89</sup>  Instead of encouraging solutions, such as private adoption agencies that specialize in placing black children, the Administration's policy aggravates the problem.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Bunning Amendment, incorporated into the House-passed welfare bill, repeals the Clinton policy. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) had a similar amendment (S. 637) to the Senate version of the welfare reform bill. The Children's Defense Fund supported the Clinton Administration's approach,<sup>90</sup> despite the evidence of researchers such as Rita Simon, who shows that transracial adoption does not damage the child emotionally or developmentally and that transracially adopted children do just as well as those adopted by parents of their own race.<sup>91</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Race matching can be achieved easily if there are enough prescreened adoptive parents. The difficulty lies not in the lack of parents but in the poor track record of public agencies in building a pool of black adoptive parents.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR FEDERAL LEADERSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A child's needs are best served, and his potential fostered most effectively, by the love and sense of belonging provided by a stable family environment. As in other areas of social concern, however, the government's ability to increase love and dedication is limited. This competence resides primarily with the family, the church, and the school. However, through their power to enact wiser laws and provide leadership, lawmakers at the federal level can affect the rate of adoption. They can expound upon its benefits for the child, for the mother who gave birth, and for the parents who adopt.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption is one of those rare good solutions to many thorny problems. Political leaders should help the country realize that it is one of the most effective ways to alleviate the problems arising from illegitimacy, child abuse, and neglect.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lawmakers also must challenge the leaders of other major institutions, especially church leaders, to talk about the goodness of adoption. Educational leaders, particularly in social studies areas, ought to be challenged to develop good materials on adoption. Health insurance leaders ought to be challenged as well, for adoption is a less costly solution to infertility than is fertility treatment, which averages about $35,000 per course of treatment. Media leaders ought to harness their expertise in communications to promote adoption to the nation at large, instead of attacking it.<sup>92</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The more this is done, the more attractive adoption will be to growing numbers of families. America also needs to celebrate parents who adopt and parents who care for foster children -- especially those who both foster <I>and</I> adopt. They show a double generosity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption is a national resource that should be encouraged and expanded by government where possible. The federal government should undertake a public relations campaign, targeted to girls under the age of 18 who have conceived out of wedlock, on the benefits of adoption. In addition, Congress should:
<P>
<b>1)  Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress permits a tax deduction for the medical costs of fertility treatment (typically between $35,000 and $50,000 for testing, test tube conception, and deep freeze, development, and discard). The average revenue loss for such treatment is about $8,000. Some corporate health plans, the costs of which are fully excludable from employees' taxable income, also cover fertility treatment. By contrast, the Treasury would gain financially from a one-time $5,000 tax credit that encouraged parents to assume the total cost of caring for foster children -- each of whom now costs taxpayers over $13,000 each year.<sup>93</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tax credit should be fully refundable (including against Social Security taxes) so that poorer parents who adopt a child receive the same level of support as those who earn more and have larger tax liabilities. The object is to encourage and support those who want to adopt. Being less generous with poorer parents (and more black parents are poor compared to white parents) is unwise because it reduces the incentive to adopt.
<p>
<b>2)  Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of an effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers inflicts pain and damage on cocaine-addicted babies. With some 350,000 children affected each year, there is an obvious need for a change in federal law to permit the testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction. These babies are at high risk for foster care and for severe damage to their health and development.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

South Carolina Attorney General Charles Molony Condon ran a successful program of testing, mandated treatment, or a jail sentence if the mother refused treatment. The result was dramatic: the incidence of cocaine-addicted mothers fell from 24 per month in Charleston to five or six per month.<sup>94</sup>  The Clinton Administration, however, called the program punitive and racially discriminatory and threatened to cut off all federal reimbursements to the hospital involved, effectively threatening to shut down the program and discouraging other states interested in replicating the Charleston model.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should take steps to reverse this Administration policy. The use of cocaine by pregnant women is a major factor in the death or severe damaging of many thousands of cocaine-affected newborns.
<p>
<b>3) Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care, Congress should instruct the Department of Health and Human Services to issue comparative report cards on the performance of each state in a number of areas concerning the family condition of children, including:
<p><ul>
<li>The number and rate of out-of-wedlock births,
<P>
<li>The rate of adoption,
<p>
<li>The length of stay in foster care, including information on the longest stays,
<p>
<li>The typical period between the availability of a child for adoption and the child's adoption, and
<p>
<li>The typical period between the beginning of foster care and the agency's finalization of a placement plan (decision regarding the future of the child).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dissemination of such information will keep state residents better informed and help encourage agencies to find children good, permanent homes.
<p>
<b>4)  Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal funds for family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should require HHS to contract with pro-adoption experts for the writing and distribution of an appropriate brochure on the benefits of adoption for both mother and child. Congress then should require that this brochure be distributed in all hospitals which receive federal funding, either directly or indirectly, and in all federally funded family planning clinics, and that the staff of such hospitals and clinics draw attention to this material.
<p>
<b>5)  Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the best ways the federal government can help these churches is by providing an incentive for members to adopt more children waiting in foster care. The full refundability of the $5,000 tax credit will do much to effect this. Unless their members are able to pay most of the normal costs of adoption, there is little likelihood that black churches in poor neighborhoods will be involved. With the tax credit and with church involvement, however, the probability of an increase in adoption is significantly greater.
<P>
<b>6)  Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit clearly the use or consideration of race or ethnicity in denying or delaying the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fundamental principle behind all civil rights is equality of rights and equal treatment under law. A young child without a family cries out for as quick a placing as possible within a caring family, so that his long-term human potential may not be thwarted at critical early stages of development. The "personness" of that child is infinitely more important than his or her "blackness," "Indianness," "Hispanicness," or "Asianness."  In cases where parents of similar ethnic background are unavailable within, say, a 90-day period, then those who are available and willing to adopt should be united with the child, both for the child's benefit and for the good of society.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Those who are anxious to have the children of a community adopted within that community must ensure a sufficient supply of parents wanting to adopt. The onus is on the community and ought not to be placed on the waiting child. To help assure a pool of parents, Congress should work with states to streamline and simplify adoption procedures in minority communities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many opportunities for developing a pool of waiting parents are available. The network of minority churches is extensive. By linking with private adoption agencies, these churches can help respond to the needs of minority children awaiting adoption. Many other ethnic organizations can be harnessed to bring the pool of minority adopting parents up to the level needed. The press could carry public service announce-ments in minority communities. Minority fraternities and sororities also could play an important role. These and similar community efforts would raise public consciousness about adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While fully respecting the right of Indian nations to regulate adoptions within their territories, and while fully respecting the rights of all Indian parents giving up their children for adoption to request that the Indian nations take these children for adoption, Congress ought to change civil rights law so that the rights of Indian or part-Indian parents living outside the nations' territories are upheld.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Under current law, a child with as little as one sixty-fourth Indian ancestry may be under the control of that Indian tribe for adoption, no matter where the child lives. While the number may be modest, the principle of "personness" again is paramount. Just as a foreign-born American citizen is not subject to the adoption laws of his country of origin, an Indian who has chosen freely to leave the Indian nation and to marry someone outside it should no longer be subject to its laws. H.R. 3286 addresses this issue well.
<p>
<b>8)  Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This charter could preclude adoptions for millions of children over time and deny U.S. couples the option of adopting foreign children. The unsigned U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child may come before Congress in the near future for ratification. In the current draft, international adoption is declared to be a last option, after the home country has exhausted its search.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As in cases of transracial and race-matching adoption, each nation has a responsibility to assemble a pool of prescreened adoptive parents if it has children waiting to be adopted. If a nation does not have such a pool, and yet blocks couples from abroad from adopting, that nation is neglecting its children. The United States should be on the side of the child rather than on the side of governments that seek international acceptance of some specious "right" to neglect their nation's children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the language of the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child is accepted by Congress, it could mean an end to most international adoptions. The Hague Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, and which guides present policies, is superior though far from sufficient. Its guiding principle is that care in a family is better for a child than care in an institution.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE STATES SHOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because regulating adoption is a state function, most of the practical reforms must be enacted by state legislatures. And because of the particular need to address the transracial adoption issue in a just and caring fashion, the states must take special care to eliminate discrimination against black adoptive parents and black children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To increase the pool of available parents to fill the needs of all children, states should encourage the privatization of adoption. Specialized agencies can work constructively with those sections of the community that are willing to serve the many different needs of children: black children, older children, children with special medical problems, and children with other emotional or developmental difficulties. As different groups already have demonstrated, it is possible to line up a pool of screened and qualified parents more than willing to adopt children with even the most difficult needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One effort, started by Fr. George Clements in Chicago in the mid-1980s, had each church set about achieving the adoption of one child within the congregation.95  Though initially the program received wide publicity and had some impact, it has not become a sustained and organized national effort. However, in Florida, One Church, One Child of Florida has developed a successful partnership between church and state. Between March 1988 and September 1990, this organization placed 805 black children in adoption.<sup>96</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Phoebe Dawson, a social worker who heads New Beginnings, a licensed nonprofit adoption agency in Columbus, Georgia, has been very successful in this work. For instance, an agency in Cleveland, Ohio, was not able to find minority parents for a young minority child, leaving the child at serious risk of a protracted wait for adoption. One worker at the agency contacted New Beginnings, which was able to resolve the problem quickly because of its close ties to black Baptist churches across the country.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To encourage adoption, states should:
<p>
<b>1)   Privatize adoption services.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Private adoption services are more efficient and more effective than state agencies where adoption is concerned, as illustrated by the track record of Detroit's Homes for Black Children. They are accountable to a board of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations may be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve. By contrast, state agencies often cannot be sued. Furthermore, people are more inclined to donate money, time, services, and goods to a private adoption agency than to pay taxes for government agencies.
<p>
<b>2)  Change the way public welfare agencies are financed. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public welfare agencies dealing with children receive more money to keep children in foster care than they do to clear them for adoption. States should make the allocation of Title IVE monies to these agencies contingent on their record in making final determinations on the future status of children within 12 months of entering foster care. Those not returning to their families must be adopted within three months or handed over to a private agency for adoption.
<p>
<b>3)  Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These units should make the initial decision whether to terminate the rights of the parent and bring the process to court or return the child to his family. All babies under 12 months of age coming into the protective custody of a public welfare agency should be processed through the termination unit as a matter of course. A great many such children should be placed for adoption quickly. This in turn would prevent the buildup of a large number of children in foster care -- children who grow more and more difficult to place with each passing year, as the significant drop in the percentage of older children who get adopted clearly indicates.
<p>
<b>4)  Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This makes it possible for many middle and low-income families to adopt a sick child they would not be able to care for without Medicaid support. It makes sense for government to provide this support, for the special-needs child in foster care will cost the government even more.
<p>
<b>5)  Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While working to increase the pool of minority parents and to enhance the flow of prequalified and ready-to-adopt minority parents, states should continue the practice of transracial adoption when no same-race parents are available. When the child becomes ready for adoption, his need is immediate and acute. Minority community groups can monitor the pool of prescreened, qualified minority parents for all the relevant categories of children: older children, older male children, sibling groups of children, medically needy children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the issues involved in ending discrimination against black children waiting to be adopted and against black couples waiting to adopt, there is much else to be done by the states.
<p>
<b>6)  Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Governors and state legislatures should consider mounting campaigns to increase interest in adoption. With the prompting and advocacy of the Institute for Children in Cambridge Massachusetts, the State of Massachusetts, under Governor William Weld's direction, embarked upon Assignment Adoption, a series of government reforms to reduce the number of children in foster care and to increase the practice of adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the difficult duty of assessing the appropriateness of terminating parental rights is commingled with the mandate to preserve the family at all costs, the good of the abused child suffers. The long-term good of the child is helped by establishing separate units of social workers who help the court reach clear and speedy decisions regarding the parents' right to continue as parents. These workers can help the courts without the conflict of interest that is present when they also try therapeutically to help the family come together or stay together. It is best that such work be carried on by a different set of professionals. The best interests of the child remain paramount while the effort to help the parent is vigorously pursued.
<p>
<b>8)  Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A University of Chicago study finds that children who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent longer than other young children.<sup>97</sup>  Within a 12-month period, the court and the termination unit should decide whether a child should be returned to his parents or placed for adoption. Continuance in foster care beyond that time must be regarded by all as a failure to provide properly for the needs of the child. To be lax or negligent in this matter is to be guilty of serious child neglect.
<p>
<b>9)  Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to facilitate the practice of adoption and the reduction of foster care lengths of stay to the minimum time needed, the collection of accurate data is critical. At present it is poor and varies greatly in quality between states. National leaders, national and state campaigns to encourage adoptions, and the stimulation of executive action to initiate and maintain reforms all require an accurate picture of what is happening to children in adoption and foster care. The state Office of Vital Statistics or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all adoption information, and the state Office of Human Services or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all foster care data.
<p>
<b>10) Enact legislation requiring of public social service agencies the same licensing standards and requirements as those now imposed on private adoption agencies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just as Congress has passed a law (H.R. 1 and S. 2) to subject itself to the same regulations it imposes on the rest of the country, all state agencies involved in adoptions ought to be subject to the same reporting and regulatory oversight as adoption agencies are. This reform will likely have the speedy effect of reducing these regulations to the bare minimum needed for the good of the child.
<P>
<b>11) Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers, because of the pain and damage done to cocaine-addicted babies, and because this condition now affects 350,000 children a year, states should push for a federal law permitting the drug testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction so that hospitals may participate in such programs without being threatened with a cutoff of federal funds as happened in the South Carolina case discussed above.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Children born to drug-addicted mothers are at risk for a host of difficulties and abuses: lower birth weight, physical abuse, and not getting the affectionate nurturing critical for early attachment formation and its concomitant long-range benefits, among them the formation of a solid conscience and the ability to relate well with others. Given these risks to the child, the requirement of drug testing when cocaine or crack cocaine ingestion is suspected is an appropriate protection.
<p>
<b>12) Prohibit the removal of a child who is eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt the child, except when the child is being returned to the legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the parents are deemed by the agency as suitable for fostering the child, they should qualify automatically as suitable for adopting the child. Today, many foster parents are willing to adopt the children they have fostered once they become available for adoption. However, mainly because of the effective prohibition of transracial adoptions, these parents frequently are denied the chance to adopt the children who have become attached to them. These couples should have the right to adopt the child once the courts have decided he may be adopted. If child welfare agencies have not made this possible within six months of the court decision, foster parents ought to be granted the standing in law to sue the adoption agency and initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<b>13) Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This rule should apply for any child in out-of-home care for six months whose parent has not engaged in meaningful interaction with the child during that period. Due process in the courts will protect the rights of parents barred from contact with their children due to very unusual circumstances. However, a child left alone for six months is a child without a dedicated parent.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

More and more of the nation's children are at risk of child abuse and neglect as rates of illegitimacy rise. Their plight merits the generous response of dedicated people. Few responses can match the depth and devotion entailed in adopting a child. This dedication reduces a host of problems for the nation: the costs of extended foster care, the poorer health and slower development of children in foster care or in the home of neglectful and abusing parents, and the higher incidence of addiction, crime, and dependency.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption works.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By vetoing the adoption legislation passed last year, President Clinton defeated the most significant reform in the practice of adoption to be seen in decades. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. As this pool of needy children grows, all too often, up to two million couples waiting to adopt are frustrated in their efforts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The need is great and the solution is obvious: adoption. Yet government agencies and practices actively discourage this solution which, unlike present policies, could help solve a major national problem while also reducing both welfare dependency and long-range costs. The situation cries out for reform. The suffering of the children cries out for reform.

<li>    Most boarder babies are cases of neglect of a severity which easily would justify termination of the parental rights of the mother.  However, "family preservation" guidelines (as opposed to the best interests of the child) lead to prolonged and frequently futile efforts at maternal reform.<p>

<li>    The opponents, the Child Welfare League of America and the American Public Welfare Association, also argued that the child's first right is to his biological family, not to care and nurturance, and that family preservation services must first be attempted with the mother -- even if she had abandoned her baby.<p>

<li>    This finding illustrates the power of early adoption and the need to reform agency practices which keep children in prolonged foster care during their early infancy, when they are highly adoptable.<p>

An Attributional Analysis," <I>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</I>, Vol.  48, No.  4 (1985), pp.  1054-1066.  An interesting anomaly has emerged from an analysis of adoption studies.  Clinical studies traditionally have shown adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in psychiatric settings.  The same occurred here, but these adolescents were found not to have emotional or psychological problems at these rates.  Adopted adults are less likely to receive treatment than the general population.  This seeming contradiction occurs because adoptive parents are more likely to refer their adopted children for possible treatment.  Of all adopted children referred by parents for clinical treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis.  The remainder -- almost 75 percent -- received counseling for normal adolescent issues.<p>

<li>    "Actual numbers and percentages of substitute care exits among minority children did rise significantly during the 1980s, but any gains in the numbers of exits among black and Hispanic children were totally nullified by continued increases in the total numbers of these minority children in the substitute care population during the same period.... The fact that the exit numbers of minority children are smaller than those of white children will result in additional increases in the proportion of minority children in care.  If current trends continue, minority children will become the clear majority in the nation's substitute care population in the next few years.  There already are more minority children than white children in the substitute care systems of several large urban states today.  Social policy implications of minority children becoming the numerical majority in the U.S.  substitute care population are profound and complex and should be seriously examined."

The idea behind the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF)</CENTER>
</H1>
The idea for creating a legal analog to the <A HREF="http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html">Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF)</A> occured to Peter Harter while writing
an essay criticising Senator Exon's &quot;Communications Decency Act of
1995&quot; (S.314). <A HREF="harter.html">Click here</A> to see this unpublished
essay.) The following is a brief idea outline for the Internet Law Task
Force , written prior to the launch of the task force in October of 1995
at Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium 95. This idea was the genesis
for what has become The Forum for Internet Law and Policy with further revisions
coming from mebers and interested parties across the Interent community
and around the world.<BR>

<P><B>The Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) Project</B> <BR>
<BR>
The idea for an Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) came from a solution proposed
by Peter F. Harter in an essay he wrote and submitted to The New York Times
for publication in their Op-Ed page. Although this submission is, as of
the date of this presentation, still under consideration and despite the
youth of this ILTF idea (less than two weeks old), it has gained support.
The idea for an ILTF was unveiled publicly on 12 April 1995 at the Internet
Society Summit, in San Diego, California. In addition to the initial sponsors
listed in this memorandum, additional supporters have agreed to work together
as part of an ad hoc &quot;ILTF formation and steering committee&quot;:
Prof. Hank Perritt of the Villanova Center for Information Law and Policy;
David Johnson, Chairman, Electronic Frontier Foundation; Bob Collett and
Ron Plesser of the Commercial Internet Xchange; Jeffrey Ritter, Executive
Director of OARNet and founder of the Electronic Commerce, Law, and Information
Policy Strategies project; Jerry Berman, Executive Director, The Center
for Democracy and Technology; Lance Rose, Esq.; Jan Constantine, VP and
General Counsel, Delphi Internet Services; David Maher, Esq., and Co-Chair
of the Internet Task Force of the International Trademarks Association;
Prof. David Post. In addition, David Johnson has agreed to co-chair the
steering committee with Peter Harter in order to determine what shape ILTF
should take.

<BR>
A. Yes, if an ILTF exists. <BR>
<BR>
____________________________________________________________________ <BR>
<BR>
<B>I. Introduction.</B> <BR>
<BR>
An Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) can be the legal policy and norms forum
for the Internet. An ILTF must be a large, open, international body consisting
of practicing lawyers, in-house corporate counsel, legislative professionals,
academics, business professionals, technologists, researches, network operators,
publishers, system administrators, and other interested parties. All involved
should be concerned with the evolution and growth of the Internet as a global
electronic community that balances terrestrially bound and geographically
defined interests with the decentralized and transborder nature of internetworked
computer communications that is the Net. <BR>
<BR>
The ILTF shall be an analog to the IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force)
so that constituents of the Internet and its related industries and communities
can remain self-regulating by determining and promoting legal policies that
reduce risk and liability. If effective, an ILTF can reduce the need for
governmental entities to regulate the use and operation of the Internet.
Like the IETF, the ILTF can succeed by attracting the active and regular
participation of professionals from around the world and by reaching out
to as many cultures and nations in the world as possible in order to avert
conflicts of law and to attain comity amongst disparate electronic communities
and various computer networks rooted in different and distant countries.
<BR>
<BR>
An ILTF can be begun formally and publicly at the Internet Society's upcoming
Summit in San Diego, California, on April 12, during and or after the legal
panel presentation. At that time an acting advisory committee may be formed
so that an ILTF can be properly constructed. This memorandum is only a sketch
-- a starting point from which the idea for an ILTF can be launched. <BR>
<BR>
The National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN) wishes to work with other
organizations and individuals to promote and further develop self-regulation
and accountability within the collection of users and operators of the Internet.
The Internet Society has agreed to help launch this idea with NPTN and has
offered to form a secretariat and to seek funding. Ameritech Advanced Data
Services and America Online have agreed to be the initial sponsors of the
concept of an ILTF. Other organizations are invited to become initial sponsors.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>II. Why Create an ILTF?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Due to increasing scrutiny by mass media and by legislators and government
officials in the U.S., Canada, and other countries, as well as in states,
provinces, and other terrestrially based jurisdictions, the Internet is
at risk of being Balkanized by inconsistent and ill-thought attempts at
rule making and control. Recently, a Bill introduced in the U.S. Senate
known as the Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S.314) and now likely to
gain passage in that legislative chamber, threatens to impose liability
on those least able to control indecent communications; it ignores the fact
that users are held accountable for their actions already in varying formats
by their system administrators and or network service providers. Users self-regulate
their electronic communities and work with network operators to sustain
the vitality of their networks. S.314 is also embarrassing: It blindly attempts
to regulate a medium that is inherently international in design and destiny.
For S.314 to try and control communications on the Internet assumes that
the U.S. can impose its values on others from around the world and strips
citizens of electronic communities of their right by contract to define
what the acceptable uses of their communities shall be. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there are possible alternatives to S.314. On April 7, 1995,
Senator Leahy introduced the &quot;Child Protection, User Empowerment, and
Free Expression in Interactive Media Study Bill&quot; (S. 714). Leahy's
Bill directs the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Commerce
Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA), to conduct a study to address technical means for empowering users
to control information they receive over interactive communications systems
such as the Internet, commercial online services, independent BBSs, and
future interactive media. <BR>
<BR>
S.314, however, is not the first nor will be the last attempt at regulating
the Internet; however, it drove one Internet lawyer to start pamphleteering
about the issue. In an essay submitted on 29 March 1995 to The New York
Times for publication in their Op-Ed page, Peter Harter of NPTN reasoned
that if standardization and regulation of the Internet is to occur, it should
come from the bottom-up -- just as the technical standards for the Internet
evolve via the IETF. After some online consultation with Tony Rutkowski
of the Internet Society, it was agreed that an ILTF was an idea worth considering
-- a concept whose time has come. <BR>
<BR>
It is the desire of the creator and founding members of an ILTF that it
form not to impose rules as a super-legislature. Instead, an ILTF must endeavor
to educate elected officials and governmental entities so that they may
better understand the technical and cultural nature and diversity of the
networks that make up the Internet. ILTF must serve as a coordinator to
and communicator between existing Internet law and policy efforts; ILTF
must not aim to duplicate or displace such existing efforts. In doing so
the ILTF can look to the IETF for structure and lessons as the IETF has
had over thirty productive and substantive working meetings since 1986.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>III. Modeling the ILTF After the IETF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>A. Meetings.</B> The ILTF should meet at least twice a year initially
and perhaps more frequently (i.e., the IETF meets three times a year). It
is proposed that the first public meeting of the ILTF be held, perhaps,
on or near Bastille Day, and outside the U.S., so that the inaugural meeting
may be inspired by the relevant symbolism and history as well as the international
component that is integral to building an effective ILTF. By holding regular
meetings the ILTF shall provide an open arena for working groups (see below)
to coordinate development of legal and policy findings and, recommendations.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>B. Mission.</B> The ILTF mission includes but is not limited to: <BR>
<BR>
* Identifying and proposing solutions and or alternatives to legislative
initiatives arising from any terrestrially based and or electronic governing
body; <BR>
<BR>
* Specifying the development of alternative forms of rules that electronic
communities can opt to use in order to diffuse any conflicts; <BR>
<BR>
* Facilitating the exchange of information between professionals in different
countries so that there may be a better informed and more active legal and
policy community; <BR>
<BR>
* Providing a forum for the exchange of relevant information within the
Internet community between system administrators, users, network operators,
publishers, intellectual property holders, government agencies, businesses,
academics, educators, and concerned citizens; and, <BR>
<BR>
* Publishing online tools and information resources to be used by citizens
of electronic communities, governmental agencies, businesses, and other
interested parties. <BR>
<BR>
<B>C. Working Groups.</B> Leading up to the first meeting and in the time
between meetings thereafter, the actual substantive work of the ILTF shall
be done by working groups. Like the working groups that sustain the efforts
of the IETF, workings groups for the ILTF shall be organized by topic into
several areas. The following areas are suggested and additions and modifications
are requested: <BR>
<BR>
Suggested Area Suggested Contact Person(s) <BR>
<BR>
1. Content a. Copyright Lance Rose, Esq. b. Warning Labels David Johnson,
EFF; Howard Shapiro, Playboy Enterprises <BR>
<BR>
2. Trademarks &amp; Domain Names David Maher, Esq. <BR>

12. Mediation &amp; Arbitration Hank Perritt, VCILP <BR>
<BR>
13. Encryption ? <BR>
<BR>
14. Technical Matters IETF Representatives <BR>
<BR>
[Nota Bene: The foregoing list of lawyers is subject to change and non-exhaustive.
No contact has been made to any of the above with the exception of Ellen
Kirsh and George Clapp. It is recommended that the acting advisory committee
ask individuals to join the initial slate of working groups.] <BR>
<BR>
Each working group area would have a director that would be a member of
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG) (see below). Under each director
would be a collection of one or more working groups breaking out to tear
through various issues that make up the larger area. As necessary, each
working group within an area could have its own director who would be a
part of an area directorate which reports its findings to the area director
which are then to be communicated to the ILSG. While a very large pyramid
of people can be created here, it is important to have small and focused
efforts in order to cut through issues and not get bogged down in larger
and somewhat alienating meetings. Rough consensus and not strict voting
shall be the proactive rule. <BR>
<BR>
Also, it would be wise to have liaisons set up between ILTF and the IETF,
W3, the U.N. Internet Project, and other organizations and programs as deemed
necessary so that the ILTF may maintain open and interactive communications
links between other organizations to which the ILTF should work in concert
with either intermittently and or regularly. <BR>
<BR>
<B>D. Management.</B> Management of the ILTF shall be handled by individuals
who volunteer to lead a particular topic area and or who represent a particular
region or interest group at large. Together, these volunteers shall form
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG). The acting advisory committee to
be formed at the Internet Society Summit in San Diego after the unveiling
of the ILTF concept shall act as the ILSG until a proper ILSG can be formed.
This is likely to occur after the first successful meeting of the ILTF.
The operational management of the ILTF may be handled by the ILSG under
the auspices of NPTN and the Internet Society. In addition, the ILTF may
decide, at future time, to create an Internet Law Arbitration Board (ILAB)
for the specific purpose of having an independent body to adjudicate disputes
in the working processes of the ILTF. <BR>
<BR>
<B>IV. Policy Development </B>&amp; <B>Dissemination.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Neither the ILTF, nor any voluntary, international body can or should have
the right to somehow claim that its de facto rules can be imposed upon other
bodies. However, the ILTF can draft and adopt high quality policies and
then let the marketplace decide if they want to join in and support them
as norms. <BR>
<BR>
<B>V. International Outreach &amp; Character of ILTF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
To be successful the ILTF must focus on attracting active international
participants and directions. Those volunteers involved in the early stages
of the effort to build an ILTF must not be limited in their thinking; while
the &quot;likely suspects&quot; shall be integral, new and unusual members
must be sought out and asked to adopt the concept of an ILTF as their own
and become an ILTF evangelist. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VI. Path Forward.</B> <BR>
<BR>
First, a broad and internationally diverse endorsement of ILTF must be sought.
Second, a plan of action must be drawn up for those leading ILTF. Third,
input must be solicited and integrated. Fourth, a revised memorandum or
formal proposal green paper should be produced and released for comment
and revision. Fifth, plans for a first meeting should b made. Sixth, a formal
white paper should be produced and disseminated for consideration and if
possible adoption and endorsement. Seventh, the processes involved in the
Sixth stage should occur at a live meeting held some time in the summer
of 1995, perhaps around the time of Bastille Day. Eighth, a host for a second
meeting should be sought out in advance and be announced at the conclusion
of the first meeting. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VII. Appendix A: &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.</B> <BR>
<BR>
The following is an unordered, unpreferential, unrevised listing of those
individuals and organizations that should be contacted and asked to be involved
in the creation of an ILTF. They are in no particular order. This list is
not exhaustive. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Internet Law Task Force Organizing to Achieve Consensus on Internet
Legal Issues</CENTER>
</H1>
<B>OCTOBER 31, 1995</B> -- <B>Seattle,WA</B> -- The first international
conference on the law of the Internet served as the platform for the announcement
of an effort to establish the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) to facilitate
the progressive development of law and public policy in the global information
age.<BR>
<BR>
The ILTF will provide an international forum for issues related to the use
and growth of the Internet including: evolution of the business practices
and legal instruments to assure the validity and acceptance of digital transactions;
property rights; privacy; and the elimination of legal barriers to Internet
commerce and electronic transactions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need to accelerate at the global level the development of solutions
borne of consensus,&quot; stated Peter Harter, former executive director
and general counsel of <A HREF="http://www.nptn.org/">National Public Telecomputing
Network</A>, and now public policy counsel of <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape
Communications</A>, who first advanced the ILTF concept.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Developing standards and practices to protect digital information
and promote the integrity of electronic markets is essential for extending
the Internet to developing countries and nations in transition,&quot; said
Jeffrey Ritter, a legal advisor to the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/">United
Nations</A> on the automation of international trade. &quot;Quite simply,
without an established framework, the Internet faces a confusing, and potentially
disabling, assortment of national laws seeking to govern a global environment,&quot;
Ritter added.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle-based <A HREF="index.html">Discovery Institute</A>, will provide
organizatinal support for the ILTF. The organizing committee will be jointly
chaired by Albert Gidari, a partner with the Seattle-based law firm Perkins
Coie and senior fellow of Discover Institute; Harter; and Ritter, program
director for <A HREF="/Eclips/eclips.html">ECLIPS</A>, a research program
of the Ohio Supercomputer Center.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our goal is to mature the ILTF into an operating non-governmental
organization as soon as practicable, but ILTF must be a collaborative operation.
We look forward to seeking and obtaining broad-based support for moving
ahead.&quot; the organizers said.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet Law Symposium '95, hosted by the Discovery Institute, was the
first conference devoted to analyzing the legal aspects of an evolving global
space. Bruce Chapman, President of Discovery Institute, announced that most
of those attending added their names to the global listserv--an electronic
discussion group--established for continuing dialogue on the structure and
direction of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
The concept has attracted widespread interest from industry, which has grown
increasingly concerned by the growing efforts of governments to attempt
to regulate the Internet. According to Harter, since the early dialogue
on the need for an ILTF, over one hundred interested organizations and professionals
from four continents have urged establishment of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For commerce to succeed in cyberspace greater certainty, not inconsistent
regulatory regimes around the globe, is needed,&quot; Gidari said.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On January 20, 1993, Bill Clinton raised his right hand and took an oath before God and the American people that he would "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." Now, as the next presidential election approaches, the American people are entitled to know whether he has kept his vow. Specifically, they are entitled to know something about the records being compiled in office by the men and women to whom President Clinton has granted lifetime appointments on the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. Are Bill Clinton's judges mostly effective defenders of the Constitution, or are they legal realists who feel free to rewrite the Constitution? Are they moderate New Democrats committed to enforcing the law, or are they left-wing "political hangers-on" with a radical and unpopular agenda for social change?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To ask these questions is <i>not</i> to challenge judicial independence nor even the fundamental decency, on a personal level, of many of the Clinton judicial appointees. The decision that faces the American people is not whether Bill Clinton's judges should be impeached, or whether he should call on some of them to resign, or whether they should have been confirmed in the first place, or whether they are nice people or smart lawyers. The question is, "Given the president's record so far, can we expect a federal judiciary shaped by Bill Clinton to respect the Constitution and honor its role as the interpreter, and not the maker, of our laws?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are two major problems with Bill Clinton's judges. First, they have been unwilling to follow the Constitution in a number of very important cases. And, second, when they choose not to follow the Constitution, they have all too often replaced it with radical and unpopular left-wing social policy. In area after area, Bill Clinton's justices and judges are compiling a public "policy" record that is far to the left of the president's own public statements on similar issues. Bill Clinton may present himself to the public as a mainstream moderate, but his likable justices and judges are working quietly to impose a radical McGovernite legislative agenda on the country.

</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton's judicial appointments have had their biggest impact to date on the U.S. Supreme Court. With only two appointees, he has succeeded in transforming a moderately conservative Court into one that is (at best) one vote away from being an engine of radical left-wing social change. His justices are the political heirs of William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, and they have gotten the better of the lightweight Republican justices imposed on Presidents Reagan and Bush by a Democratic Senate (and by liberal Republicans) after the 1987 nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork was viciously defeated. Many conservatives don't realize just how liberal Bill Clinton's two affable Ivy League justices really are. In part, this is because Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are exceptionally bright and likable people. Nevertheless, in case after case they have voted for Big Government, against federalism, for a radical secular humanism that hates religion, against traditional social values, for the "rights" of pornographers and drug dealers, against private property, for racial quotas and preferences, and against the creation of a truly colorblind America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The two Clinton justices depart from the William J. Brennan model of liberal judicial activism in only two significant ways: first, they write (or join) opinions that are more cagey and politically astute than blunderbuss opinions such as <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. As a result, the public is unaware of the extent to which radical left-wing policy ideas are seeping into our court opinions. Second, they do not oppose the death penalty across the board, although to some extent they resist its implementation. In every other important respect, the two Clinton justices are the children of the Warren Court, far-left ACLU judicial activists intent on writing their own radical and elite prejudices into the Constitution.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of Bill Clinton's lower-court judges (though not all) are equally or even more left-wing, but they have been unable so far to have much of an impact, both because they remain outnumbered and because the Reagan-Bush judges on the lower courts have turned out better in most parts of the country than have their brethren on the Supreme Court. If Bill Clinton wins a second term, however, this will change. In less than four years, he has filled about 25 percent of the seats on the federal judiciary. If re-elected to another term, he will have a chance to replace hundreds more retiring judges, and many of the federal courts of appeals will flip from Reagan-Bush to Clinton-Carter majorities. And depending on how lucky he gets, he will almost certainly name another one to three left-wing Supreme Court justices. This means that the few 5 to 4 wins that conservatives have managed recently will all become losses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's look at what Bill Clinton's America will then be like, and contrast it with the America he claims to want. A good way to do this is to compare the specific policies Bill Clinton says he favors with the left-wing social policies that his judges are legislating from the bench. In doing this, we should remember that not all the Reagan-Bush appointments have turned out well, nor have all of Bill Clinton's judges turned out badly. Nonetheless, the overall pattern is quite clear.<p><b>Limited Government</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"The era of big government is over" (January 23, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address. Unfortunately, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer certainly have not yet been let in on the secret. Both have voted in favor of every single claim of national governmental power yet to come before them. Only a year ago, in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1456.ZO.filt"><i>U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton</i></a>, both Clinton justices were members of a 5 to 4 majority on the Court that struck down state-imposed term limits on Members of the U.S. Congress. As a result, the term-limit laws of 22 states, 21 of which had been adopted by the voters directly in initiatives or referenda, were declared invalid. The Clinton Justice Department filed an unusual "friend of the Court" brief to encourage this result. The fact of the matter is that Bill Clinton's Supreme Court justices killed the term-limits movement: had <i>either</i> of the two Clinton justices joined Justice Clarence Thomas's elegant and brilliant dissent, we would have term limits in most of the United States today.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These votes were not anomalies. In <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1260.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Lopez</i></a>, both Clinton justices again voted for the position that the national government has unlimited power to regulate <i>all</i> aspects of the nation's economic, social, and cultural life. Justice Breyer wrote the main dissent for four of the nine justices and was joined by Justice Ginsburg. He paid only lip service to the idea that the U.S. Constitution limits the power of the national government in any way whatsoever. Under Justice Breyer's interpretation of the Commerce Clause, the federal government could nationalize education curricula, local law enforcement, family law, and everything else under the sun, so long as Congress could rationally think that doing so would in some attenuated way be connected to interstate commerce. Justices Breyer and Ginsburg clearly believe that the Big Government of the Great Society and the New Deal can do anything it wants to, so long as it does not violate the Bill of Rights or its "emanations and penumbras."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This past March, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were again on the wrong side of an important federalism case. In <i>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida</i>, they joined a strident dissent written by Justice David Souter that argued for overturning a 200-year-old understanding that state governments are protected from lawsuits in federal court by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Casting aside years of settled understanding, Justice Souter argued that Congress should be able to authorize citizens to sue state governments without their consent -- a theory that reduces the states from a position of co-sovereignty to one of abject subordination. Chief Justice William Rehnquist won the 5 to 4 vote in <i>Seminole Tribe</i> with no margin to spare, and the dissenters promised in their opinions to try to overrule the case at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Big Government activism of the Clinton justices also manifests itself in "separation of powers" cases since that doctrine, like the doctrine of federalism, is for them an inconvenient restraint on the unlimited power of the national government. Justice Ginsburg was one of only two dissenters in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1121.ZO.filt"><i>Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</i></a>, an important case that limited Congress's power to retroactively command the federal courts to reopen final judgments in private civil actions already decided. Justice Breyer weighed in with a tepid separate concurrence in the case rather than join Justice Antonin Scalia's forceful majority opinion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton justices are completely unwilling to enforce the Framers' written Constitution of limited powers, federalism, and checks and balances. Their idea of constitutional law begins and largely ends with a judicially dictated jurisprudence of unenumerated rights. Even the constitutionally enumerated right that protects private property from being taken without just compensation is given short shrift: Justice Ginsburg, for example, joined three other justices in dissenting from Chief Justice Rehnquist's important opinion in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-518.ZO.filt"><i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i></a>, which protected private property from confiscation by regulation. In that case, a municipal government was ultimately rebuffed in its attempt to force a shop owner to set aside 15 percent of her land as a public easement as a condition of receiving a building permit. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also dissented in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1823.ZO.filt"><i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i></a>, the Kansas City school-desegregation case. In that case, they joined an opinion that took the extraordinary position that federal judges can require local governments to raise taxes in order to fund remedial education and magnet schools.<p><b>Religious Freedoms</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"[The First Amendment] does not convert our schools into religion-free zones. . . . I am deeply troubled that so many Americans feel that their faith is threatened. . . . When the First Amendment is invoked as an obstacle to private expression of religion, it is being misused. . . . Religion has a proper place in private and a proper place in public, because the public square belongs to all Americans" (July 12, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so said Bill Clinton in a widely reported speech at a suburban Washington, D.C.-area high school. It went unremarked at the time, however, that his two Supreme Court appointees had recently voted in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-329.ZO.filt"><i>Rosenberger v. University of Virginia</i></a> to maintain our schools as religion-free zones. The issue in <i>Rosenberger</i> was whether a student activities fund, which was used to support various publications by student groups, could also be used to pay for the printing costs of <i>Wide Awake</i>, a Christian student newspaper. By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court said yes, over the dissenting votes of Justices Breyer and Ginsburg.
<p>
<center><hr width=85% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>Justices Breyer and Ginsburg joined a militantly secular <br>tirade against any role for religion in any public institution</EM></font>
<hr width=85% size=3></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The opinion that they joined was a militantly secular tirade against any role for religion in any public institution. It reasoned that not a penny of public money can ever be spent on anything religious, even though public money is routinely spent in huge quantities on educational programs hostile to religion or to religiously inspired moral values. Under the ahistorical rhetoric of the dissenters in <i>Rosenberger</i>, it is hard to see how the courts could ever uphold government chaplains, Thanksgiving Day holidays, mottoes on our currency, school vouchers, or even tax deductions for religious organizations. The <i>Rosenberger</i> dissent theorizes that no government aid can ever go to any religious organization, even if the aid is equally available to comparable secular organizations.<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"I personally did not believe that it was coercive to have a prayer at an outdoor sporting event or at a graduation event because I don't believe that it is coercive to people who don't participate in it" (November 14, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A nice sentiment, but one that is unfortunately not shared by Judges Theodore McKee and H. Lee Sarokin, Bill Clinton's two appointees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In fact, Judge McKee wrote the <i>en banc</i> opinion for the Third Circuit in <i>ACLU and Edward Ross v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board of Education</i>, a decision that banned student-led graduation prayers throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Judge McKee's radical opinion went further than the U.S. Supreme Court has ever gone in this area by outlawing student-led graduation prayers as well as prayers organized directly by a school principal. In order to do this, Judge McKee had to reject a directly "on point" holding of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had upheld student-led graduation prayers in <i>Jones v. Clear Creek Independent School District</i>. Four Reagan-Bush judges dissented from Judge McKee's opinion, while every Democratic appointee on the Third Circuit joined it. Judge McKee's pro-ACLU advocacy was so effective with his colleagues that he even brought a number of the feebler Reagan-Bush appointees along with him. Bill Clinton's hopes that we could have graduation prayer were dashed by his own appointee. Now, to determine what our national policy will be on this issue, an increasingly anti-religious Supreme Court will soon be obliged to hear and resolve the conflict that Judge McKee has created between the Third and Fifth Circuits on this issue.<p><b>Racial Quotas and Preferences</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<i>"I say to you, I'm against quotas. I'm against discrimination" (September 21, 1995). "Today, I am directing all our agencies to comply with the Supreme Court's Adarand decision, and also to apply the four standards of fairness to all our affirmative-action programs that I have already articulated--no quotas in theory or practice; no illegal discrimination of any kind, including reverse discrimination; no preference for people who are not qualified for any job or opportunity; and as soon as a program has succeeded, it must be retired. Any program that doesn't meet these four principles must be eliminated or reformed to meet them" (July 19, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Great rhetoric but, unfortunately, there are two Clinton appointees who will not be complying with the Supreme Court's 5 to 4 decision in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1841.ZO.filt"><i>Adarand</i></a> outlawing quotas in federal programs. Yes, that's right -- Justices Breyer and Ginsburg both dissented in that case, and Justice Ginsburg actually wrote one of the dissenting opinions. She tried to put a pro-racial-preference spin on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's plurality opinion, and said she saw "today's opinion as one that allows our precedent to evolve, still to be informed by and responsive to changing conditions." Translated into everyday English, Justice Ginsburg hopes to distinguish or overrule <i>Adarand</i> at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And what, you may wonder, ws the "moderate" federal affirmative-action program in <i>Adarand</i> that Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were so eager to uphold? It was an explicit racial-preference program for government highway subcontractors, a preference so blatant that even many who support affirmative-action recruitment efforts in universities have condemned programs like this one. Justice Ginsburg was so enthusiastic about this particular program that she not only authored a dissenting opinion herself but also joined <i>two</i> other dissenting opinions: one by Justice Souter and another, even more radical, opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Ginsburg was the only other member of the Court to join Justice Stevens's opinion, which would appear to uphold all federal racial-preference programs of any kind that are, in his opinion, well motivated.
<p>
<center>
<hr width=80% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>Justices Breyer and Ginsburg have voted to uphold every <br>racial preference or quota that has come before them</EM></font><hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's votes on the racial preference/quota issue in <i>Adarand</i> were not at all idiosyncratic. Rather, they form part of a pattern in which both justices have voted to uphold every racial preference or quota that has ever come before them. In particular, they have dissented in every voting-rights case involving challenges to political redistricting, decisions in which race played the predominant role. This past year, they joined the minority in the 5 to 4 decisions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-923.ZO.filt"><i>Shaw v. Hunt</i></a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-805.ZO.filt"><i>Bush v. Vera</i></a>, in which the Court threw out racially gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas. Last year, Justice Ginsburg wrote the dissent for four justices (including Justice Breyer) in the companion cases of <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-631.ZO.filt"><i>Miller v. Johnson</i></a> and <i>United States v. Hayes</i>, in which the Court invalidated racial gerrymanders in Louisiana and Georgia.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The issue in these cases is whether it is unconstitutional to create wildly odd-shaped legislative districts for the purpose of maximizing the proportion of voters of a particular race, when such districts violate traditional districting standards of compactness and affinity of community interests. The purpose of this whole enterprise is to use federal voting-rights law to allocate congressional seats by race, so that every racial and ethnic group in the nation is proportionately represented according to their numbers in the population at large. While greater minority representation in public life is to be desired, this particular quota regime is in fact a stealthy imposition of the system of proportional representation used in places like Israel, Japan, Russia, and Germany (under the Weimar Republic). Everyone familiar with the unstable politics of those countries knows that this kind of rigid proportional representation is disastrous for social peace, because it rewards extremists and penalizes consensus building. For this reason, many have long thought that the Anglo-American tradition of allocating electoral districts geographically is better than the Continental European tradition of proportional representation. <p>
<center><hr width=80% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>The Ginsburg-Breyer view of racial gerrymandering<br> would
authorize a racial quota system for Congress</EM></font>
<hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Ginsburg-Breyer view of racial gerrymandering would authorize nothing less than a racial quota system for Congress. By enshrining a system of racial and ethnic proportional representation, it would also codify a political system of racial spoils and push us toward the unstable electoral system that has been the bane of Continental European democracies. 

<p><b>Crime</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <i>	"The United States cannot tolerate the rates of crime and violence which have come to be almost commonplace in the last several years. We have to intensify our efforts to reduce crime" (July 28, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few issues are of greater concern to most Americans than the fight against violent street crime and illegal drugs, and, as is well-known, Bill Clinton loves to boast that his administration has been tough on crime and on punishing criminals. Once again, however, his judicial appointees often seem to be seriously "off message" when criminal-law cases are before the courts. In its most recent term, the Supreme Court decided <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1511.ZO.filt"><i>Lewis v. Casey</i></a>, a major case bearing on the right of prisoners to enjoy free prison libraries and legal assistance. The case involved how broadly to read an activist opinion from the 1970s by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, which requires state taxpayers to subsidize frivolous prison litigation by providing free legal help and library facilities. In this particular case, a federal court in Arizona issued sweeping orders to state prison officials to address the complaints of state prisoners about the quality of their legal research materials.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Scalia, writing for five Reagan-Bush justices, seized on the case as a chance to cut back on Thurgood Marshall's requirement that state governments subsidize prisoner lawsuits. Scalia argued that the federal courts had no business trying to run state prisons, and he set some common-sense limits on the bad precedent by making it inapplicable when prisoners' claims were frivolous or when prisoners were trying to bring legal action irrelevant to sentences and terms of confinement. Justice Thomas, in a brilliant concurrence, even called on the Court to overrule its offensive and nonsensical precedent. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, chose to dissent from most of Justice Scalia's opinion. They joined a handwringing, meandering dissent that complained that Scalia was going too far and too fast in protecting state prison authorities and taxpayers from the desire of prisoners for good libraries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This same term, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also joined a sweeping opinion by Justice Stevens in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-266.ZO.filt"><i>Jaffee v. Redmond</i></a> that recognized a disturbing new rule that could keep vital evidence of wrong behavior from being used in federal court for either civil or criminal trials. In that case, the Court held that conversations between a patient and her psychiatrist <i>or social worker</i> are protected from compelled disclosure during the course of a federal criminal or civil trial. The Court's decision to exclude a sweeping new category of evidence in this case is disturbingly reminiscent of the Warren Court's great exclusionary-rule blunders in the 1960s. Every time evidence is excluded from the courtroom, the task of proving the guilt (or innocence) of the culpable becomes more difficult. To impose this burden upon prosecutors in order to protect communications not only with psychiatrists but also with social workers is sheer folly. As Justice Scalia noted in his dissent, we don't allow a testimonial privilege in federal court for conversations with parents, siblings, children, or bartenders. Why on earth would we carve out such a privilege for social workers? Sadly, the case was lost by a vote of 7 to 2.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Breyer cast two other noteworthy votes in criminal cases this term. First, he joined two separate opinions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-8836.ZO.filt"><i>Felker v. Turpin</i></a> that sought to water down the new federal law for expediting the application of the death penalty. Second, he joined the dissent in an important 5 to 4 decision on whether police can apply a property seizure law designed to discourage prostitution. Had the dissenters' view prevailed, the customers of prostitutes would have been able to protect their cars from confiscation by co-registering them with the very wives they were betraying.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are countless lower-court criminal-law opinions by Clinton appointees that are deeply disturbing. To mention just one example, consider <i>United States v. Hamrick</i>, decided by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where Clinton appointee M. Blane Michael joined a dissent that would have exonerated a defendant who had mailed a bomb to the U.S. Attorney who had prosecuted him. Judge Michael was of the view that the bomb was not a "deadly weapon" within the meaning of the federal criminal law, because it was badly made and didn't cause too much damage when it exploded!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As these examples illustrate, this administration is appointing some disturbingly fuzzy minds to the federal bench. Once again Bill Clinton's tough talk on crime is revealed to be nothing more than talk. His judges are rapidly bringing us back to the bad old days of 1960s Warren Court liberalism.<p><b>Mainstream Values</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"When I sought the presidency, I said that I wanted . . . to put mainstream values back at the heart of social policy. . . . [W]e're moving in the right direction to reassert and reinsert into American life mainstream values. And, I believe the initiatives of our Administration have played a role in that" (October 13, 1995). "I know not everybody's going to be in a stable, traditional family like you see in one of those 1950s sitcoms, but we'd be better off if more people were" (September 9, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Mainstream values? Stable traditional families? So far, Bill Clinton's justices and judges have voted to: strike down his own liberalized policy on "gays in the military" as unconstitutional; require that gays be given special rights under certain state and local civil rights laws, thus forcing private landlords, elementary-school boards, and employers to associate with militant gays even if they don't want to; oppose an important Utah statute that regulates abortions <i>after 20 weeks</i>; and, incorporate a particularly strident and unreasonable version of the failed Equal Rights Amendment into the federal Constitution. And, they have managed to do all of this in just the last two years!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's take these "mainstream values" judicial opinions one at a time. As is well known, Bill Clinton shot himself in the foot shortly after he was elected by attempting to change the U.S. military's long-standing policy of refusing to allow homosexuals to serve in the military. After an enormous public uproar, he was forced to back down by moderate liberals like Senator Sam Nunn and Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In November 1993, he signed a statute creating a new "don't ask, don't tell" compromise policy; it was designed to quell public outrage by keeping outspoken gay individuals out of the armed forces, while making clear that the military should not pursue the expulsion of gays who did not commit homosexual acts and who did not discuss their private sexual activities and inclinations.<p>
<p>
<center><hr width=90% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>A constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt <br>children, or teach in grade school may be just around the corner</EM></font><hr width=90% size=3></center> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Since then two federal courts of appeal have heard cases on this issue. In <i>Stefan v. Perry</i>, the D.C. Circuit voted 6 to 4 that the long-standing pre-1993 policy of excluding homosexuals from the military did not violate the Constitution. Bill Clinton's sole appointee, Judge Judith Rogers, voted to invalidate the policy, as did all the Carter appointees. All of the Reagan-Bush appointees voted to uphold the policy. On April 5, 1996, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit voted 9 to 4 to uphold the constitutionality of Bill Clinton's own "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Amazingly, <i>both</i> of Bill Clinton's appointees to that Court, Judges M. Blane Michael and Diana Motz, voted to strike down his own quite liberal policy as unconstitutional.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Judges Rogers, Michael, and Motz are by no means out of step for the Clinton judiciary on these matters. Last May, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined a 6 to 3 majority in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1039.ZO.filt"><i>Romer v. Evans</i></a>. In that case, gay-rights groups had challenged a ballot initiative passed by Colorado voters that overrode all attempts by Colorado towns to enact special civil-rights protections for gays. Had the two Clinton justices joined the three dissenters in that case, Colorado's policy of legalizing homosexuality but not granting it preferential status would still be good law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives have been tempted to read the Court's confused opinion in <i>Romer</i>, which Justices Breyer and Ginsburg joined without comment, quite narrowly. This is almost certainly a mistake. The opinion contains opaque references to the illegality of "status discrimination" -- a key issue in the "don't ask, don't tell" cases heard so far by the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit. If the Court pursues this idea of outlawing "status discrimination," and if it continues to view any failure to treat homosexuals like heterosexuals as being evidence only of "irrational animus," then there is no reason to think that a constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt children, and teach in grade schools is not right around the corner. The Court's meandering opinion and the silence of the five justices who joined it offer no assurance whatsoever that <i>any</i> differential treatment of homosexuality is still allowed. Those conservatives who took comfort in the Court's refusal to say it was applying "strict scrutiny" (the highest level of judicial scrutiny) to classifications based on sexual orientation are being misled. The Court is applying strict scrutiny in this case, without acknowledging candidly that it is doing so.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "mainstream values" of the Clinton judges don't end with issues bearing on homosexuality. In <i>Leavitt v. Jane L.</i>, the Court voted 5 to 4 to summarily reverse a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that invalidated those portions of a Utah state law that prohibited abortions after 20 weeks, except where the mother's life or medical health will be seriously threatened or where the child will be born with "grave defects." The case arose because under <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/91-744.ZO.filt"><i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</i></a> (1992), the Utah statute was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited abortions before the fetus is "viable" outside the womb.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Utah law, however, clearly provided for the "severability" of its other provisions in the event that one part of the law was ruled unconstitutional. The Tenth Circuit had willfully refused to sever the statute so that abortions after 20 weeks could be regulated. Five Justices joined a rare, short <i>per curiam</i> opinion summarily reversing this as blatant error. This short opinion reflected nothing more than the long-settled idea that even after <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the states can still regulate third-trimester, "post-viability" abortions so long as no "undue burden" is placed upon the mother's right to protect her own life or health. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, dissented. They claimed variously that the Court should defer here to the Tenth Circuit, that summary reversal should be used rarely, and (implicitly) that the issue was not important enough to merit a grant of <i>certiorari</i> and a summary reversal. Do they intend in a Clinton second term to try to extend the near-total right to abortion in Roe to third-trimester abortions or to infanticide? Why would anyone with "mainstream values" join an angry four-justice dissent in an easy severability case like this?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, of course, there is the Court's "mainstream" opinion by Justice Ginsburg in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1941.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Virginia</i></a> where the Court held that the Virginia Military Institute, an all-male military academy funded by the state of Virginia, could not constitutionally exclude women. This case is remarkable less for its invalidation of the all-male program at VMI than for its writing into the Constitution a particularly extreme version of the Equal Rights Amendment -- which had failed to win popular support and passage through legitimate channels in the 1970s and early 1980s.

<hr width=85% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Ginsburg wielded the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause to create a new standard of strict scrutiny for gender classifications, while using a milder label that minimizes the political fallout for liberals in the White House and in Congress. Henceforth, says Justice Ginsburg, gender classifications require "an exceedingly persuasive justification" and are subject to "skeptical scrutiny." They may not be used to do anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> "creates or perpetuates the legal, social, or economic inferiority of women" nor may they rely on anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> involves an "overbroad generalization about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of men and women." Thus if American society thinks that single-sex draft registration or combat rules are desirable, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants single-sex sports teams at its state schools, it must have something "exceedingly persuasive" to say to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants to offer charitable tax-exempt status to a private women's college or to a Roman Catholic Church priesthood, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As Chief Justice Rehnquist (in his concurrence) and Justice Scalia (in his dissent) both pointed out, this anti-democratic, elitist nonsense has nothing at all to do with the very important subject of the equal rights of women. Justice Ginsburg made no effort in her opinion to explain why she thought VMI was unconstitutional while single-sex combat units or football teams were O.K. That is because she is not interested in equal rights for women in the sense that most Americans would understand that term. What Justice Ginsburg wanted to do all along, and did do, in the VMI case was to lay the doctrinal groundwork for a final assault on <i>all</i> remaining classifications and social practices, both public and private, wherein any distinction between men and women is made according to gender. She does not identify a single gender classification or social practice, either public or private, that she is definitively willing to approve. The door is being flung open to a massive judicial assault on our sexist military services, football teams, private single-sex schools, and religious organizations.<p><b>The V-Chip</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children. When parents control what their children see, that is not censorship. That is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing" (January 23, 1996)</i>.</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton likes to leave voters with the impression that he is concerned about inappropriate television programs aimed at children. Unfortunately, Justice Ginsburg did not agree in the Supreme Court's recent <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-124.ZO.filt"><i>Denver Cable</i></a> case. In that case, the law in question sought to modify the public-access policy governing local cable networks that required them to broadcast indecent programming without restrictions. Astonishingly, Justice Ginsburg was one of only two justices on the Court who voted to hold unconstitutional <i>every single restriction</i> before the court that was aimed at suppressing indecent programming available to children watching TV. Justice Breyer's more moderate opinion would uphold a restriction like the V-chip, but not a reasonable requirement that people who want to subscribe to indecent programming must do so by taking some affirmative step to sign up for it. Evidently Justice Breyer is more concerned about the privacy rights of adults who watch indecent programming than about the rights of children who may accidentally see such programming on cable TV.<p>

values and prerogatives of the American people</em></font>
<hr width=65% size=3></center>  

	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's extreme solicitude for the consumers of pornography is shared by both of Bill Clinton's two appointees to the D.C. Circuit. Judges Judith Rogers and David Tatel were on the dissenting side of a 7 to 4 <i>en banc</i> decision that upheld a federal law restricting the broadcast of indecent material to the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. All seven judges in the majority were Reagan-Bush appointees, while all four of the dissenters were appointed by Presidents Clinton or Carter. It is by no means clear to me that this law would survive review on the Supreme Court today, given Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's views on indecency, the First Amendment, and the rights of children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As I hope I have made clear, the U.S. Supreme Court is now dangerously adrift. The last two years have seen an increasingly large number of opinions that are contemptuous of the beliefs, values, and prerogatives of the American people as well as of the democratic process itself. The Clinton justices have almost always been on the wrong side of these cases, and in many instances they have joined minorities of four in support of propositions that are ludicrous and offensive. Although Justices Souter, Kennedy, and O'Connor deserve some of the blame, the other three Reagan-Bush justices have been stellar. Justices O'Connor and Kennedy have joined those three to produce some very important 5 to 4 victories in fighting off racial quotas, allowing religious speech, curbing Big Government, protecting private property, and fighting crime. If Bill Clinton is re-elected and replaces any of those five justices with another "moderate" like Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, then every single conservative victory of the last 28 years will be at great risk of being overturned. The Warren Court ended when Richard Nixon won the presidential election of 1968; the presidential election of 1996 will determine whether the era that Nixon inaugurated is now to be replaced by a new burst of radical left-wing judging.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But what are we to make of Bill Clinton's role in all of this? Is it remotely plausible to think that he doesn't realize how far to the left his own justices and judges are of his own public statements on issue after issue? No, it is not plausible. Bill Clinton is a former professor of constitutional law, a Rhodes Scholar, and a graduate of Yale Law School. He knows perfectly well the views of the justices and judges he is nominating.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Obviously, these are very difficult times for anyone who believes in a restrained, law-abiding federal judiciary. There is, however, one consoling thought. If Bill Clinton is re-elected, he will have a mandate from the American people to rein in Big Government, protect religious speech, oppose racial preferences, preserve mainstream values, fight indecent television programming aimed at children, and fight crime and drugs. Which jurist could Bill Clinton possibly name to the Supreme Court whom he could count on to do all of the things that he says he wants done? The answer is obvious: renominate Judge Robert H. Bork.<p>

<h3>WHAT THE 104TH CONGRESS DID TO COMBAT CRIME</h3>




By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 117<br>
August 19, 1996<br>

</center>



<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:
<p>
<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<p>
<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Race and all of the complex and emotional issues that flow from  it have
been America's unique dilemma since before the founding  of the Republic. After
centuries of overt discrimination against  black Americans, the Supreme Court,
in a series of seminal  decisions beginning with <I>Brown v. Board of 
Education</I> in 1954, initiated the long process of dismantling the
institutional sources of racial  discrimination in American society in areas
such as education,  housing, and voting. Congress, too, attempted to remove
these  barriers in historic legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
 the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Rise of Affirmative Action. </B>Over the last three  decades,
however, federal judges and agency bureaucrats have  embarked upon a sustained
crusade to twist and distort the original intent  of these laws so that race,
ethnicity, and sex became the proxy  for special, rather than equal, treatment
under the law. Race  consciousness quickly overtook color blindness as the
guiding  principle for the application of civil rights laws that Congress 
explicitly intended to be neutral on these grounds. Today, liberals  justify
race and sex preferences  which have proliferated under the  guise of
affirmative action  as an appropriate and long-overdue  response to centuries of
discrimination against racial minorities  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  women.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As a result, federal agencies now administer literally hundreds  of programs
that favor individuals, businesses, and other  institutions on the basis of the
race, ethnicity, or sex of those who benefit  from these programs. These
preferences can be found in federal  statutes, regulations, and executive
orders. Some are specific to a  particular law or agency; others are
government-wide in their application.  A thorough review of these preferences,
moreover, reveals that  they come in all shapes and sizes  5 percent, 6.9
percent, 8 percent,  10 percent, even as high as 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to these federally sponsored preferences, judicial  and agency
interpretations of federal civil rights laws have  required state and local
governments, colleges and universities, and  private-sector employers to adopt
race and sex-based preferences in  areas such as hiring, promotions, college
admissions, and the  distribution of other privileges and benefits in our
society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates for federal office who believe in the  principle of
equal treatment under the law should emphasize the  following:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>The federal government should never favor one group of 
Americans over another on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex.</B> Race  or
sex-conscious remedies should be confined to individuals  who have demonstrated
that they have suffered discrimination.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress should clarify what constitutes discrimination.</B> A  pattern
of historical discrimination against a particular group does not  necessarily
mean an individual is subject to discrimination.  Discrimi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  nation, moreover, simply cannot be
inferred from statistical  disparities between whites and minorities (or between
men  and women) in employment, housing, or student bodies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress needs to recapture the philosophical spirit of the  original
civil rights movement. 
</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many liberal economists and policymakers argue that virtually  all income
differences between racial groups, and between men  and women, are attributable
to discrimination. What exactly do  we know about income differences between
whites and blacks?   What are these differences?  More important, do these
differences  serve as irrefutable proof of discrimination?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) offers a statistical  perspective
common among liberals when she relies upon  statistical differences to argue
that &quot;minorities and women do not have  equal opportunity.&quot;  According
to Lee, &quot;As long as women make up  only 8 percent of engineers, 31 percent
of scientists, and 16 percent  of physicists, we have much work ahead of  us.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#2">2</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Boston University economics professor Glenn C. Loury,  however, disagrees.
Testifying before the same House subcommittee,  Professor Loury observed that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     [T]here is no scientific basis for concluding that
existing  economic differences between groups are caused by, or  reflect the
extent of, discrimination. Groups differ in ways  which affect their aggregate
income, but which are often not  taken 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  into account when the groups are
compared. On my review  of the evidence, discrimination is not a major factor in
 explaining racial economic differences, and federal affirmative  action
policies over the past two decades have contributed  only marginally to the
diminution of these  differences.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#3">3</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to ascertain whether any real differences exist  between groups
is to compare apples to apples by controlling  for such important factors as
age, education, and family  structure. When such comparisons are made, most, if
not all, aggregate  income differences between whites and blacks disappear. In
fact,  an honest application of the liberal assumption that  discrimination
lurks behind statistical differences leads to the conclusion that  not only is
statistical proof of discrimination extremely hard to  find, but some categories
of minorities  such as black,  college-educated females  are doing so well that
they qualify as the  &quot;innocent persons&quot; who must bear the burden of
race or  sex-conscious remedies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Black men and white men are not far apart when properly  compared.</B>
June O'Neill, currently director of the Congressional  Budget Office, wrote in
1990 that, while there may be  pronounced income differences between white and
black males overall,  this difference disappears when we compare blacks to
similarly  situated whites:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      Overall, black men earned 82.9 percent of the white 
wage. Adjusting for black-white differences in geographic  region, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  schooling and age raises the ratio
to 87.7 percent; adding  differences in [standardized] test scores to this list
of  characteristics raises the ratio to 95.5 percent, and adding differences  in
years of work experience raises the ratio to 99.1  percent.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#4">4</A> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Neither are black and white women.</B> Among women with  comparable
educational credentials, there is little or no difference  between whites and
blacks. The U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights found that, among women with
college degrees, black women  actually earn more than their white counterparts.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#5">5</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Citing a recent Census Bureau study, Boston University's  Glenn Loury noted
that: &quot;In 1993 there were about 400,000 college  educated black men and
women working full time as executives,  administrators or managers.... [T]he
women enjoyed median  earnings 10 percent<I> higher</I> than comparable white 
women.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#6">6</A>  Loury emphasizes
that sizable aggregate income differences do exist  between black and white
women and attributes this to the fact  that black women are far more likely to
head single-parent  households than are whites; in 1994, roughly one-half of
black families  were headed by women compared to 13 percent of white  families.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#7">7</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Family Structure Explains Many Differences</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thomas Sowell, Senior Fellow at Stanford University's  Hoover Institution,
has found that, when education and family structure  are held constant, income
differences between whites and blacks  have been negligible for almost three
decades:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     As far back as 1969, black males who came from  homes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  where there were newspapers,
magazines and library  cards had the same incomes as whites from similar homes
and  with the same number of years of schooling. In the 1970s,  black
husband-and-wife families outside the South earned as  much as white
husband-and-wife families outside the South.  By 1981, for the country as a
whole, black  husband-and-wife families where both were college educated and
both  working earned slightly more than white families of the same  description.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#8">8
</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>To Sowell and many other experts, white-black income  differences can be
traced to differences in family structure that became  apparent in 1960 and have
been accelerating ever since: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      In every decennial census from 1920 through 1960, 
inclusive, at least 60 percent of all black males from age 15 on  up were
currently married. Moreover, the difference  between black and white males in
this respect was never as great as  5 percentage points during this entire era.
Yet, by 1980,  less than half of all black males in these age brackets were 
currently married  and the gap between black and white  males was 17 percentage
points. By 1992, that gap had widened  to 21 percentage points.<A

</P>
<P><B>What Is Affirmative Action?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Original Intent of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</B> Senator Hubert  H.
Humphrey (D-MN), floor manager for the 1964 Act, when  addressing one skeptical
colleague made what is perhaps the  most famous offer ever made on the Senate
floor: &quot;If the Senator  can find in title VII... any language which
provides that an  employer 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  will have to hire on the basis of
percentage or quota related  to color... I will start eating the pages one after
another, because it  is not in there.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#10">10</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Humphrey also assured the Senate that &quot;nothing in the bill  would
permit any official or court to require any employer or labor  union to give
preferential treatment to any minority group.&quot;  
<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#11">11</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Senator Harrison Williams (D-NJ) also understood the 1964  Civil Rights Act
to be color-blind in its application. During floor  debate, he said: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      [T]o hire a Negro solely because he is a Negro is racial 
discrimination, just as much as a `white only'  employment policy. Both forms of
discrimination are prohibited by  Title VII of this bill. The language of that
title simply states  that race is not a qualification for employment....Some 
people charge that [the Civil Rights Act of 1964] favors the Negro,  at the
expense of the white majority. But how can the  language of equality favor one
race over another?  Equality can  have only one meaning....Those who say that
equality means  favoritism do violence to common sense.
<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#12">12</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representative John Lindsay (R-NY), a member of the House  Judiciary
Committee, similarly assured members that the  legislation did not favor one
group over another: &quot;[The bill] does  not...force acceptance of people in
schools, jobs, housing, or public  accommodations because they are Negro. It
does not impose quotas  or any special privileges of seniority or acceptance.
There is  nothing whatever in this bill about racial  balance.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#13">13</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 covers over 94 million employees  in both the
public and private sectors. As controversial as the  Dole-Canady legislation may
be to liberals, it would reach only  federal workers, who comprise but 3.1
percent of the nation's work  force. Those who work for state and local
governments,  private-sector firms that receive federal contracts, and other
private sector  firms would continue to be subject to federal civil rights laws
that  require employers to favor some individuals over others on  racial,
ethnic, or gender grounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Casting a Wider Net?</B> One common perception about  affirmative action
is that it began as a benign effort to combat  discrimination by requiring
employers to cast a wider net so that members of  historically neglected groups
could compete on an equal footing  for jobs and promotions. Only later, this
theory holds, did it  evolve into the current system of quotas and preferences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While this may be true in some instances, President  Lyndon Johnson laid the
foundations for today's complex web of  race-conscious programs and set-asides
as early as June 1965. &quot;[I]t  is not enough,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;to
open the gates of opportunity.&quot;   Rather, &quot;All our citizens must have
the ability to walk  through those gates.&quot;  Johnson continued: &quot;This
is the next and the  more profound stage of the battle for civil rights. We seek
not just  freedom but opportunity. We seek not just legal equity but human 
ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a  fact and
equality as a result.&quot;  <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#14">14</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, while most commentators recall the famous  declaration by Martin
Luther King, Jr., that he dreamed of the day when  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  citizen's race would not matter
and persons would be judged  &quot;not by the color of their skin but by the
content of their  character,&quot; they forget his comment two years later when
he defended  &quot;preferential treatment&quot; for minority groups in a
magazine interview: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Playboy:</B> Do you feel it's fair to request a
multibillion-dollar  program of preferential treatment for the Negro, or for any
other  minority group? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Dr. King:</B> I do indeed.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#15">15</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today, it is common for proponents to justify affirmative action  as a group
remedy that rewards even individuals who have not  suffered from discrimination.
One of many examples of this  approach comes from Walter Dellinger, currently
Assistant Attorney  General in the U.S. Department of Justice, who defines 
affirmative action as &quot;a group-based remedy: where a group has been 
subject to discrimination, individual members of the group can  benefit from the
remedy, even if they have not proved that they have  been discriminated against
personally.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#16">16</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Proponents of affirmative action typically deny that these  policies amount
to quotas or that they constitute any form of reverse  discrimination. Numerical
goals and timetables, they argue, are  not quotas. President Clinton's Assistant
Attorney General for  Civil Rights, Deval L. Patrick, believes that affirmative
action  policies come in three flavors:<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#17">17</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Casting a wider net:</B> At one end of the spectrum are
efforts  to reach out to &quot;traditionally excluded individuals&quot; and to  &quot;recruit
talent broadly in all American communities.&quot; 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Quotas:</B> At the other end of the spectrum are quotas, which  Patrick
defines as &quot;hard and fast numbers of places in school or the  workplace
specifically reserved for members of certain groups,  regardless of
qualifications.&quot;  No one supports quotas, argues  Patrick, who adds that
federal law makes these measures patently illegal.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Affirmative consideration:</B> Here lies the middle ground
of  affirmative action, where race, ethnicity, or sex is but one of many 
factors considered in evaluating qualified candidates. &quot;This form of 
consideration,&quot; Patrick explains, &quot;does not guarantee success based 
on race, ethnicity or gender. Rather it emphasizes a full range  of
qualifications and is characterized by flexibility.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Is discrimination an inevitable part of affirmative action  programs? 
</B>Since the inception of affirmative action, the  Supreme Court has concluded
on several occasions that these programs  actually require discrimination
against innocent parties. For  example, former Justice Harry Blackmun admitted
in 
<I>Bakke v. State of California</I> that &quot;I suspect that it would be
impossible to arrange  an affirmative action program in a racially neutral way
and have it  be successful.... In order to get beyond racism, we must first take
 account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat  some persons
equally, we must treat them  differently.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#18">18</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Eight years later, the Court acknowledged that &quot;as part of  this
Nation's dedication to eradicating racial discrimination,  innocent persons may
be called upon to bear some of the burden of the  remedy.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#19">19</A>  Finally, in his autobiography,
Justice William O.  Douglas quoted his colleague, Justice Thurgood Marshall, as 
specifically acknowledging the discriminatory nature of race-conscious  affir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  mative action policies: &quot;You
guys have been practicing  discrimination for years. Now it's our  turn.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#20">20</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Supreme Court's Tighter Standard for Federal  Affirmative Action
Programs </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On June 12, 1995, the Supreme Court imposed a crucial and,  many would
argue, debilitating requirement on government  programs that bestow preferences
on the basis of race. The case  was <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena</I>.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#21">21</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded the prime  contract for a
highway construction project in Colorado to  Mountain Gravel &amp; Construction
Company. Under the terms of the  contract, Mountain Gravel would receive a
bonus, up to 2 percent of  the total contract, if it hired subcontractors
certified as small  businesses controlled by &quot;socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#22">22</A>
 Although Adarand submitted the low bid for  the guardrail portion of the
contract, Mountain Gravel accepted  a higher bid from the Gonzales Construction
Company. Why?   Under federal law, Gonzales' designation as a &quot;socially and
 economically disadvantaged&quot; business entitled Mountain Gravel to  a
$30,000 bonus from the Department of  Transportation.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#23">23</A>  The Court held that &quot;[A]ll
racial classifications, imposed by  whatever federal, state, or local
governmental actor, must be analyzed by  a reviewing court under strict
scrutiny. In other words, such  classifications are constitutional only if they
are narrowly tailored  measures that further compelling governmental interests.&quot;

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The <I>Adarand </I>decision has prompted the Clinton Administration  to
mount an aggressive defense of existing affirmative action  pro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  grams that favor one race or
ethnic group over  others.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#24">24</A> 
Because <I>Adarand</I><U> </U>will cast a long shadow over congressional and 
executive branch activity on civil rights issues in 1996 and beyond, it is 
important to examine it in some detail.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor  observed that
race-based distinctions in federal law are always highly  suspect, both when
they seek to harm groups that historically  have been discriminated against and
when they seek to bestow  advantages on them. O'Connor concluded that &quot;any
person, of  whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor 
subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting  that
person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial  scrutiny.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#25">25</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Is there a &quot;debtor&quot; or &quot;creditor&quot; race?  
</B>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas wrote concurring opinions in
which  they took strong exception to any statutory or regulatory  classification
based, in whole or in part, on race. Justice Scalia wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      In my view, government can never have a &quot;compelling 
interest&quot; in discriminating on the basis of race in order to  &quot;make up&quot;
for past racial discrimination in the opposite  direction. Individuals who have
been wronged by unlawful racial  discrimination should be made whole; but under
our  Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or  debtor
race.... To pursue the concept of racial entitlement  even  for the most
admirable and benign of purposes  is to  reinforce and preserve for future
mischief the way of thinking that  produced race slavery, race privilege and
race hatred. In the  eyes of the government, we are just one race here. It is 
American.<a href="ftnt13.htm#26">26</a> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Leaving the door open to future  mischief.</B> While the strict scrutiny
standard undoubtedly will force federal, state, and  local policymakers to
eliminate racial preferences from  government programs, Justices Scalia and
Thomas raise a legitimate point.  The very notion of strict scrutiny
contemplates that in some  situations, laws that favor one race over another
will pass constitutional  muster. In fact, Justice O'Connor left the door open
for legislatures  to enact laws containing more subtle forms of racial
preferences  by observing that &quot;The unhappy persistence of both the

power to remedy discrimination against  minorities and therefore has more
latitude to engage in race-based  affirmative action than do state and local
governments. But he cautions  that Congress may not use evidence of &quot;generalized,

it &quot;must  have some particularized evidence about the existence and effects

<P><B>Ignoring the Law in Pursuit of Racial and Sex-Based  Preferences - The
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Created by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equal  Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the  federal prohibition against
employment discrimination, as well as  prohibitions against discrimination
contained in the Americans with  Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination Act, Equal
Pay Act, and  other civil rights laws. The commission investigates allegations
of  discrimination by individuals, unions, associations, and others and,  if the
claims are not settled out of court, brings civil suit  seeking damages against
responsible parties. Unfortunately, the EEOC  has abused this authority by
assuming that any statistical disparity  between the races in employment results
from discrimination.

<P>Does Federal Law Require the EEOC to Use Quotas? The  answer clearly is &quot;No.&quot;
 During floor debate on the Civil Rights Act  of 1964, some Members of the House
questioned whether the  bill's employment provisions would force private-sector
employers  to adopt quotas. Judiciary Committee Chairman Emmanuel  Celler (D-NY)
assured them that &quot;The charge... that the Equal  Employment Opportunity
Commission to be established by Title VII  of the bill would have the power
to... order the hiring and  promotion only of employees of certain races or
religious groups... is  patently false.&quot;  Celler also denied emphatically
that the EEOC would  have the authority to remedy racial or religious imbalances
by  requiring &quot;the hiring of certain people without regard to their 
qualifications simply because they are of a given race or religion.&quot;

In fact, the very  opposite is true. Title VII prohibits discrimination. In
effect, it  says that race, religion, and national origin are not to be used  as
the basis for hiring and firing. Title VII is designed to  encourage hiring on

<P>The University of Maryland administered a scholarship  program reserved
exclusively for black students that, according to  the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals, did not meet the Supreme  Court's strict scrutiny standard for racial
classifications. The Clinton  Administration filed a brief on behalf of the
preference  program. Court documents indicate that between 1990 and 1992, the 
university awarded scholarships to 76 minority students, 42 of whom  had the
financial resources to pay their own way through college.  In fact, the
scholarships exceeded the actual financial need of all  but eight students.<A

<P>In spite of this decision, Judith A. Winston, general counsel at  the

not to revise &quot;race-targeted aid  programs.&quot;<A

Administration believes that  &quot;race-based student aid is legal... as a

unchecked at  our major universities.

stipend of two  years. As summed up by Harvard professor Harvey Mansfield,  &quot;Blacks
are compared with other blacks and not really with whites;  and there are
separate funds as well, the purpose of which is to  keep the professors on the

<P>Two experts who have reviewed the U.S. military's  experience with
affirmative action believe that it could serve as a model  for such programs in
the private sector and other government  agencies. According to former White
House Counsel C. Boyden Gray:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     One of the keys to the military's recent 
success...in...dealing with race relations...has been its insistence on each 
recruit's meeting the same employment standards. Virtually every  recruit is
required to have a high school diploma. This policy  is the result of decades of
data demonstrating that high  school achievement as represented by a diploma is
more  predictive than aptitude tests of adaptability to military life and 
likelihood of serving out an entire tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     With the same employment standards required of each  recruit, it should
come as no surprise that the military can  make integration work...Indeed,
notwithstanding the relatively  high minority drop-out rate, the percentage of
blacks in the  military, virtually all of whom have diplomas, is nearly twice 
the national percentage. <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#85">85</A>

<P><B>Equality of Opportunity, Not of Results.</B> Professor Charles  Moskos

As Moskos explains it, the system works  as follows:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     The goal for the number of minorities promoted to the 
next highest rank is based not on the overall number of  minorities in the Army,
but on the number of minorities in the pool  of those qualified for promotion.
The military has no hint of  two promotion lists, whites being compared only
with  whites, blacks only with blacks. From enlistment on up, all  candidates
are held to the same standard.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     The number of blacks who are promoted from captain to  major, a virtual
prerequisite for an officer seeking an Army  career, is usually below the
goal....The most plausible  explanation is that a disproportionate number of
black officers  lack the writing and communication skills for promotion to 
staff jobs. In all other ranks, including colonel through  general officers,
promotions show little racial differences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     Strict maintenance of common standards for  promotion... means that
those who attain senior positions are fully  qualified. Also important, those
blacks who are promoted have  a self-confidence that makes them the strongest
defenders  of standards for their own black subordinates.<A

students  improve an astounding 140 points, bringing them into the same range 
as typical white students.&quot;  Unlike California's Bridge Program,  these
programs are not targeted exclusively at minority soldiers.  Their
beneficiaries, however, are disproportionately  African-American. The bottom
line?  According to Moskos, &quot;no identifiable groups  of

affirmative action.  In<I> Griggs</I>, the Court determined that diplomas could
not be a condition of employment  because blacks had lower graduation rates and

punishing  employers for rewarding academic achievement. More important,  the

workplace rewards for academic  achievement have been abandoned.<A

insofar as they can be interpreted to  put any inhibition on any employer's

 This could be accomplished easily by amending the  rules to provide that &quot;No
funds shall be made available to the EEOC  to implement the Uniform Guidelines

performance from those they know to have been preferred in the process  of
selection. Moreover, affirmative action sometimes leaves  its beneficiaries
uncertain about the basis of their own  accomplishments. Blacks promoted to

Departments.</B> On January 20, 1995, Oklahoma City decided to  withdraw from
the U.S. Department of Justice's Police Hiring  Supplement Grant program, under
which it had been authorized to hire  25 officers. Police Chief Sam Gonzales
objected to a Justice  Department letter which demanded an &quot;underutilization
analysis&quot;  for women and minorities and an affirmative action plan that 
includes specific steps to achieve goals for correcting the  underutilization
that the department assumed must exist. Justice Department  officials also
demanded that the city develop a specific plan for  the &quot;equal employment
of women and minorities within the  Police Department's sworn personnel.&quot; 
Chief Gonzales commented:  &quot;I believe this particular language to be very
significant in that  it states `equal employment' of women and minorities rather
 than `equal employment opportunity.'&quot;<A

the FAA issued a &quot;diversity handbook&quot; to its  managers and supervisors
which argued that &quot;the merit promotion  process is but one means of filling

<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At the beginning of 1995, the issue of racial preferences  attracted
considerable attention on Capitol Hill. Since that time,  however, Congress has
not taken legislative action. As Congress turns  to issues outside the Contract
With America, legislation  addressing quotas will likely be deliberated.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although racial preferences reach into virtually every aspect  of American
society, legislation currently being considered in  Congress leaves most federal
preference discrimination  untouched. Though the debate no doubt will be
extremely controversial,  success even in this limited area would be unusually
significant  because it was the federal government, through the judicial 
activism of liberal Supreme Courts, which established the current regime  of
legal race privileges. It is proper, therefore, for Congress to  reassert its
constitutional role and restore the timeless principle  of equal treatment under
the law for all Americans by ridding  the public sector of such veiled
restitution and social experimentation.

seeks to accomplish two  broad goals: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Equal Treatment:</B> &quot;The purpose of this Act is
to ensure that  all Americans are treated equally by the Federal government in 
Federal employment, Federal contracting and subcontracting, and 
Federally-conducted programs.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#117">117</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Equal Opportunity:</B> &quot;The Act endorses those Federal 
`affirmative action' programs that are designed to recruit broadly and widen 
the opportunities for competition without guaranteeing the results  of the
competition.&quot;  At the same time, the bill would eliminate  those federal
activities that create quotas, set-asides, timetables,  goals, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  and other preferences on the
basis of race, color, national origin,  or sex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The legislation reflects the view that the federal government  must put its
own house in order with respect to racial and gender  preferences. Specifically,
the bill:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Bans race or sex-based preferences in federal programs.</B> The 
federal government, its officers, and its employees would have to  end all
intentional discrimination based &quot;in whole or in part on  race, color,
national origin, or sex&quot; with respect to contracts,  subcontracts, and
employment. In addition, no federal entity would  be allowed to &quot;grant a
preference&quot; to any individual or group on  the basis of race, sex, or
ethnicity. As defined broadly in the  Act, granting a preference includes &quot;any
preferential treatment and  includes but is not limited to any use of a quota,
set-aside,  goal, timetable, or other numerical objective.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Prohibits the federal government from encouraging federal 
contractors and subcontractors to adopt race or sex-based preferences.</B>   The
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs  (OFCCP) would no longer be
allowed to pressure firms that receive  federal contracts or subcontracts to
adopt racial or gender quotas.  Located in the Department of Labor, OFCCP
receives an annual  appropriation of $60 million to monitor the hiring practices
of federal  contractors with respect to race, ethnicity, and sex. Its
jurisdiction  extends to more than $161 billion in annual federal contracting 
activity.

</P>
<P><B>*     Protects outreach, recruiting, and marketing efforts designed  to
bring more qualified minorities and women to the attention of  em
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  ployers, colleges, and
universities.</B> Federal programs that are  targeted on minorities but do not &quot;guarantee
the results of the  competition&quot; would continue in place. One example is a
small program  in the U.S. Department of Agriculture<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#118">118</A> which provides support  for
campus recruitment and retention programs and agricultural  career awareness
initiatives in order to increase the participation of  minorities in agriculture

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Enact the Dole-Canady Equal Opportunity Act of 1995 
(H.R. 2128/S. 1085).</B> Enactment of this legislation represents the  first

federal government's practice of favoring  women and minorities in the
allocation of over $160 billion of federal  contracts; establish race-neutral
and sex-neutral principles in the  hiring, promotion, and evaluation of all
federal employees; end  the imposition of federal racial quotas on
private-sector firms that  do business with the government; and end
discriminatory practices  in the operation of hundreds of federal programs that

The guiding principle behind the Dole-Canady bill  equal  treatment under the

universities, and all private-sector  employers. To accomplish this, Congress
must restore the  original intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by adding
language that  ech
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  oes former Justice Thurgood
Marshall's statement that the  1964 Act &quot;prohibits all racial
discrimination in employment,  without exception for any group of particular
employees.&quot;  Congress  must explicitly forbid courts and administrative
agencies from  construing Title VII of the 1964 Act as authorizing, permitting,

religion, sex, or national origin.

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Because the Dole-Canady bill only reaches federal  employees
and federal programs, it would not affect affirmative  action practices that,
thanks to overzealous judges and agency  bureaucrats who have misconstrued the
original intent of the 1964  Civil 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  Rights Act, have become the norm
in the private sector, in  state and local government, and at colleges and
universities.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do you want to eliminate protections for people who  are
discriminated against?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> In fact, the original Civil Rights legislation in 1964, which  is
still on the books, protects everyone of all races and creeds  from
discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 still provides  this protection on
an individual basis. It is the courts, through  undue judicial activism, which
have miscontrued the legal application  of these laws to allow racial
preferences for certain favored races  at the expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As Justice Scalia stated in his <I>Adarand</I> opinion, there can be  no &quot;debtor
race.&quot;  In order for civil rights to be something other than  a tool for
veiled restitution and retribution, the legal protection  from discrimination
must only attach to individuals on a case by  case basis. Any other application
must result in an unfair system of  racial preferences and government-sponsored
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can conservatives call for a color blind society when 
discrimination exists?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is first important to realize that the federal government is 
limited in its ability to address such social maladies as racial 
discrimination. The best it can do is to end those government  programs that
promote discrimination. Affirmative action programs not  only promote
discrimination; discrimination is the fundamental  principle behind of these
programs.
