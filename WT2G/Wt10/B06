<P>
On January 15, 1990, AT&#38;T's long-distance telephone switching system
crashed.
<P>
This was a strange, dire, huge event.  Sixty thousand people lost
their telephone service completely.   During the nine long hours of frantic
effort that it took to restore service, some seventy million telephone calls
went uncompleted.
<P>
Losses of service, known as "outages" in the telco trade, are a
known and accepted hazard of the telephone business.    Hurricanes hit,
and phone cables get snapped by the thousands.   Earthquakes wrench
through buried fiber-optic lines.  Switching stations catch fire and burn to
the ground.  These things do happen.  There are contingency plans for
them, and decades of experience in dealing with them.   But the Crash of
January 15 was unprecedented.  It was unbelievably huge, and it occurred
for no apparent physical reason.
<P>
The crash started  on a Monday afternoon in a single switching-station
in Manhattan.  But, unlike any merely physical damage,  it spread
and spread.   Station after  station across America collapsed in a chain
reaction, until fully half of AT&#38;T's  network had gone haywire and the
remaining half was hard-put to handle the overflow.
<P>
Within nine hours, AT&#38;T software engineers more or less
understood what had caused the crash.  Replicating the problem exactly,
poring over software line by line, took them a couple of weeks.   But
because it was hard to  understand technically, the full truth of the matter
and its implications were not widely and thoroughly aired and explained.
The root cause of the crash remained obscure, surrounded by rumor and
fear. The crash was a grave corporate embarrassment. The "culprit" was a
bug in AT&#38;T's own software -- not the sort of admission the
telecommunications giant wanted to make, especially in the face of
increasing competition. Still, the truth <EM>was</EM>  told, in the baffling
technical terms necessary to explain it.
<P>
Somehow  the explanation failed to persuade American law
enforcement officials and even telephone corporate security personnel.
These people were not technical experts or software wizards, and they had
their own suspicions about the cause of this disaster.
<P>
The police and telco security  had important sources of information
denied to mere software engineers.   They had informants in the computer
underground and  years of experience in dealing with high-tech rascality
that seemed to grow ever more sophisticated.   For years they had been
expecting a direct and savage attack against the American national
telephone system.  And with the Crash  of January 15 -- the first month of
a new, high-tech decade -- their predictions, fears, and suspicions seemed
at last to have  entered the real world.   A world where the telephone
system had not merely crashed, but, quite likely, <EM>been</EM> crashed -- by
"hackers."
<P>
The  crash created a large dark cloud of suspicion that would color
certain people's assumptions and actions for months.  The fact that it took
place in the realm of software was suspicious on its face.   The fact that it
occurred on Martin Luther King Day, still the most politically touchy of
American holidays, made it more suspicious yet.
<P>
The  Crash of January 15  gave the Hacker Crackdown its sense of
edge and  its sweaty urgency.   It made people, powerful people in
positions of public  authority, willing to believe the worst.  And, most
fatally, it helped to give investigators a willingness to take extreme
measures and the determination to preserve almost total secrecy. An
obscure software fault in an aging switching system in New York  was to
lead to a chain reaction of legal and constitutional trouble all across the
country.
<P>
#
<P>
Like the crash in the telephone system, this chain reaction was
ready and waiting to happen.  During the 1980s, the American legal
system was extensively patched to deal with the novel issues of computer
crime.  There was, for instance, the Electronic  Communications Privacy
Act of 1986  (eloquently described as "a stinking mess" by a prominent
law enforcement official).   And there was the draconian Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act of 1986, passed unanimously by the United States Senate,
which later would reveal a large number of flaws.   Extensive, wellmeant
efforts had been made to keep the legal system up to date.  But in the
day-to-day grind of the real world, even the most elegant software tends to
crumble and suddenly reveal its hidden bugs.
<P>
Like the advancing telephone system, the American legal system
was certainly not ruined by its temporary crash; but for those caught under
the weight of the collapsing system, life became a series of blackouts and
anomalies.
<P>
In order to understand why these weird events  occurred, both in
the world of technology and in the world of law, it's not enough to
understand the merely technical problems.  We will get to those; but first
and foremost, we must try to understand the telephone, and the business of
telephones, and the community of human beings that telephones have
created.
<P>
#
<P>
Technologies have life cycles, like cities do, like institutions do,
like laws and governments do.
<P>
The first stage of  any technology is  the Question Mark, often
known as the "Golden Vaporware" stage.   At this early point, the
technology is only a phantom, a mere gleam in the inventor's eye.   One
such inventor was a speech teacher and electrical tinkerer named
Alexander Graham Bell.
<P>
Bell's early inventions, while ingenious, failed to move the world.
In 1863, the teenage Bell and his brother Melville made an artificial
talking mechanism out of wood, rubber, gutta-percha, and tin.  This weird
device had a rubber-covered "tongue" made of movable wooden segments,
with vibrating rubber "vocal cords," and rubber  "lips" and "cheeks."
While Melville puffed a bellows into a tin tube, imitating the lungs,  young
Alec  Bell would manipulate the "lips," "teeth," and "tongue," causing the
thing to emit high-pitched falsetto gibberish.
<P>
Another would-be technical breakthrough was the Bell
"phonautograph" of 1874, actually made out of a human cadaver's ear.
Clamped into place on a tripod, this grisly gadget drew sound-wave
images on smoked glass through a thin straw glued to its vibrating
earbones.
<P>
By 1875, Bell had learned to produce audible sounds -- ugly shrieks
and squawks -- by using magnets, diaphragms, and electrical current. Most
"Golden Vaporware" technologies go nowhere.
<P>
But the second stage of technology is the Rising Star, or, the
"Goofy Prototype," stage.   The telephone, Bell's most ambitious gadget
yet,  reached this stage on March 10, 1876.  On that great day, Alexander
Graham Bell became the first person to transmit intelligible human speech
electrically.   As it happened, young Professor Bell, industriously tinkering
in his Boston lab,  had spattered his trousers with acid.   His assistant, Mr.
Watson, heard his cry for help -- over Bell's experimental audiotelegraph.
This was an event without precedent.
<P>
Technologies in their "Goofy Prototype" stage rarely work very
well.  They're experimental, and therefore halfbaked and rather frazzled.
The prototype may be attractive and novel, and it does look as if it ought
to be good for something-or-other.  But nobody, including the inventor, is
quite sure what.  Inventors, and speculators, and pundits may have very
firm ideas about its potential use, but those ideas are often very wrong.
<P>
The natural habitat of the Goofy Prototype is in trade shows and in
the popular press.   Infant technologies need publicity and investment
money like a tottering calf need milk.  This was very true of Bell's
machine.   To raise research and development money,  Bell toured with his
device as a stage attraction.
<P>
Contemporary press reports of the stage debut of the telephone
showed pleased astonishment mixed with considerable dread.   Bell's stage
telephone was a large wooden box with a crude speaker-nozzle, the whole
contraption about the size and shape of an overgrown Brownie camera.
Its buzzing steel soundplate, pumped up by powerful electromagnets,  was
loud enough to fill an auditorium.  Bell's assistant Mr. Watson, who could
manage on the keyboards fairly well, kicked in by playing the organ from
distant rooms, and, later, distant cities. This feat was considered
marvellous, but very eerie indeed.
<P>
Bell's original notion for the telephone, an idea promoted for a
couple of  years, was that it would become a mass medium.  We might
recognize Bell's idea today as something close to modern "cable radio."
Telephones  at a central source would transmit music, Sunday sermons,
and important public speeches to a paying network of wired-up
subscribers.
<P>
At the time, most people thought this notion made good sense.    In
fact, Bell's idea  was workable.  In Hungary, this philosophy of the
telephone was successfully put into everyday practice.  In Budapest, for
decades, from 1893 until after World War I, there was a government-run
information  service called "Telefon Hirmondo(C)."  Hirmondo(C) was a
centralized source of news and entertainment and culture, including stock
reports,  plays, concerts, and novels read aloud.  At certain hours of the
day, the phone would ring, you would plug in a loudspeaker for the use of
the family, and Telefon Hirmondo(C) would be on the air -- or rather, on the
phone.
<P>
Hirmondo(C) is dead tech today, but  Hirmondo(C) might be
considered a spiritual ancestor of the modern telephone-accessed computer
data services, such as CompuServe, GEnie or Prodigy.  The principle
behind Hirmondo(C) is also not too far from computer "bulletin board
systems" or BBS's, which arrived in the late 1970s, spread rapidly across
America, and will figure largely in this book.
<P>
We are used to using telephones for individual person-to-person
speech, because we are used to the Bell system.  But this was just one
possibility among many. Communication networks are very flexible and
protean, especially when their hardware becomes sufficiently advanced.
They can be put to all kinds of uses.   And they have been -- and they will
be.
<P>
Bell's telephone was bound for glory, but this was a combination of
political decisions, canny infighting in court, inspired industrial leadership,
receptive local conditions and outright good luck.  Much the same is true
of communications systems today.
<P>
As Bell and his backers struggled to install their newfangled
system in the real world of nineteenth-century New England, they had to
fight against skepticism and industrial rivalry.  There was already a strong
electrical communications network present in America: the telegraph.  The
head of the Western Union telegraph system dismissed Bell's prototype as
"an electrical toy" and refused to buy the rights to Bell's  patent.    The
telephone, it seemed,  might be all right as a parlor entertainment -- but not
for serious business.
<P>
Telegrams, unlike mere telephones, left a permanent physical
record of their messages.  Telegrams, unlike telephones,  could be
answered whenever the recipient had time and convenience.  And the
telegram had a much  longer distance-range than Bell's early telephone.
These factors made telegraphy seem a much more sound and businesslike
technology -- at least to some.
<P>
The telegraph system was huge, and well-entrenched. In 1876, the
United States had 214,000 miles of telegraph wire, and 8500 telegraph
offices.  There were specialized telegraphs for businesses and stock
traders, government, police and fire departments.  And Bell's "toy" was
best known as a stage-magic musical device.
<P>
The third stage of technology is known as the "Cash Cow" stage.
In the "cash cow" stage, a technology finds its place in the world, and
matures, and becomes settled and productive.   After a year or so,
Alexander Graham Bell and his capitalist backers concluded that eerie
music piped from nineteenth-century cyberspace was not the  real selling-point
of his invention.  Instead, the telephone was about speech --
individual, personal speech, the human voice, human conversation and
human interaction.   The telephone was not to be managed from any
centralized broadcast center.  It was to be a personal, intimate technology.
<P>
When you picked up a telephone, you were not absorbing the cold
output of a machine -- you were speaking to another human being.   Once
people realized this, their instinctive dread of the telephone as an eerie,
unnatural device, swiftly vanished.   A "telephone call" was not a "call"
from a "telephone" itself,  but a call from another human being, someone
you would generally know and recognize.   The real point was not what
the machine could do for you (or to you), but what you yourself, a person
and citizen, could do <EM>through</EM> the machine.  This decision on the part of
the young Bell Company was absolutely vital.
<P>
The first telephone networks went up around Boston -- mostly
among the technically curious and the well-to-do (much the same segment
of the American populace that, a hundred years later, would be buying
personal computers).  Entrenched backers of the telegraph continued to
scoff.
<P>
But in January 1878, a disaster made the telephone famous.   A
train crashed in Tarriffville, Connecticut.  Forward-looking doctors in the
nearby city of Hartford had had Bell's "speaking telephone" installed.    An
alert local druggist was able to telephone an entire community of local
doctors, who rushed to the site to give aid.  The disaster, as disasters do,
aroused intense press coverage. The phone had proven its usefulness in the
real world.
<P>
After Tarriffville, the telephone network spread like crabgrass.  By
1890 it was all over New England.  By '93, out to Chicago.  By '97, into
Minnesota, Nebraska and Texas. By 1904 it was all over the continent.
<P>
The telephone had become a mature technology. Professor Bell
(now generally known as "Dr. Bell" despite his lack of a formal degree)
became quite wealthy.   He lost interest in the tedious day-to-day business
muddle of the booming telephone network, and gratefully returned his
attention to creatively hacking-around in his  various laboratories, which
were now much larger, better ventilated,  and gratifyingly better-equipped.
Bell was never to have another great inventive success, though his
speculations and prototypes anticipated fiber-optic transmission, manned
flight, sonar, hydrofoil ships, tetrahedral construction, and Montessori
education.   The "decibel," the standard scientific measure of sound
intensity, was named after Bell.
<P>
Not all Bell's vaporware notions were inspired.  He was fascinated
by human eugenics.   He also spent many years developing a weird
personal system of astrophysics in which gravity did not exist.
<P>
Bell was a definite eccentric.  He was something of a
hypochondriac, and throughout his life he habitually stayed up until four
A.M., refusing to rise before noon. But Bell had accomplished a great feat;
he was an idol of millions and his influence, wealth, and great personal
charm, combined with his eccentricity, made him something of a loose
cannon on deck.   Bell maintained a thriving scientific salon in his winter
mansion in Washington, D.C., which gave him considerable backstage
influence in governmental and scientific circles.   He was a major financial
backer of the the magazines <EM>Science</EM> and <EM>National Geographic,</EM> both
still flourishing today as important organs of the American scientific
establishment. Bell's companion Thomas Watson, similarly wealthy and
similarly odd, became the ardent political disciple of a 19th-century
science-fiction writer and would-be social reformer, Edward Bellamy.
Watson also trod the boards briefly as a Shakespearian actor.
<P>
There would never be another Alexander Graham Bell, but in years
to come there would be surprising numbers of people like him.  Bell was a
prototype of the high-tech entrepreneur.   High-tech entrepreneurs will
play a very prominent role in this book: not merely as technicians and
businessmen, but as pioneers of the technical frontier, who can carry the
power and prestige they derive from high-technology into the political and
social arena.
<P>
Like later entrepreneurs, Bell was fierce in defense of his own
technological territory.  As the telephone began to flourish, Bell was soon
involved in violent lawsuits in the defense of his patents.  Bell's Boston
lawyers were excellent, however, and Bell himself, as an elecution teacher
and gifted public speaker, was a devastatingly effective legal witness.  In
the eighteen years of  Bell's patents, the Bell company was involved in six
hundred separate lawsuits.  The legal records printed filled 149 volumes.
The Bell Company won every single suit.
<P>
After Bell's exclusive patents expired, rival telephone companies
sprang up all over America.  Bell's company, American Bell Telephone,
was soon in deep trouble.  In 1907, American Bell Telephone fell into the
hands of the rather sinister J.P. Morgan financial cartel, robber-baron
speculators who dominated Wall Street.
<P>
At this point, history might have taken a different turn.  American
might well have been served forever by a patchwork of locally owned
telephone companies.   Many state politicians and local businessmen
considered this an excellent solution.
<P>
But the new Bell holding company, American Telephone and
Telegraph or AT&#38;T, put in a new man at the helm, a visionary industrialist
named Theodore Vail. Vail, a former Post Office manager, understood
large organizations and had an innate feeling for the nature of large-scale
communications.   Vail quickly saw to it that AT&#38;T seized the
technological edge once again.   The Pupin and Campbell "loading coil,"
and the deForest "audion," are both extinct technology today, but in 1913
they gave Vail's company the best <EM>long-distance</EM> lines ever built.  By
controlling long-distance -- the links between, and over, and above the
smaller local phone companies -- AT&#38;T swiftly gained the whip-hand
over them, and was soon devouring them right and left.
<P>
Vail plowed the profits back into research and  development,
starting the Bell tradition of huge-scale and brilliant industrial research.
<P>
Technically and financially, AT&#38;T gradually steamrollered the
opposition.  Independent telephone companies never became entirely
extinct, and hundreds of them flourish today.  But Vail's  AT&#38;T became
the supreme communications company.   At one point, Vail's AT&#38;T
bought Western Union itself, the very company that had derided Bell's
telephone as a "toy."   Vail thoroughly reformed Western Union's
hidebound business along his modern principles;  but when the  federal
government grew anxious at this centralization of power, Vail politely
gave Western Union back.
<P>
This centralizing process was not unique.  Very similar  events had
happened in American steel, oil, and railroads.   But AT&#38;T, unlike the
other companies, was to remain supreme.  The monopoly robber-barons of
those other industries were humbled and shattered by government trust-busting.
Vail, the former Post Office official, was quite willing to
accommodate the US government; in fact he would forge an active
alliance with it.   AT&#38;T would become almost a wing of the American
government, almost another Post Office -- though not quite.   AT&#38;T
would willingly submit to federal regulation, but in return, it would use the
government's regulators as its own police, who would keep out
competitors and assure the Bell system's profits and preeminence.
<P>
This was the second birth -- the political birth -- of the American
telephone system.  Vail's arrangement was to persist, with vast success, for
many decades, until 1982. His system was an odd kind of American
industrial socialism.  It was born at about the same time as Leninist
Communism, and it lasted almost as long -- and, it must be admitted, to
considerably better effect.
<P>
Vail's system worked.  Except perhaps for aerospace, there has
been no technology more thoroughly dominated by Americans than the
telephone.   The telephone was seen from the beginning as a
quintessentially American technology.   Bell's policy, and the policy of
Theodore Vail, was a profoundly democratic policy of <EM>universal access.</EM>
Vail's famous corporate slogan, "One Policy, One System, Universal
Service," was a political slogan, with a very American ring to it. The
American telephone was not to become the specialized tool of government
or business, but a general public utility.  At first, it was true, only the
wealthy could afford private telephones, and Bell's company pursued the
business markets primarily.   The American phone system was a capitalist
effort, meant to make money; it was not a charity.  But from the first,
almost all communities with telephone service had public telephones.  And
many stores -- especially drugstores -- offered public use of their phones.
You might not own a  telephone -- but you could always get into the
system, if you really needed to.
<P>
There was nothing inevitable about this decision to make
telephones "public" and "universal."   Vail's system involved a profound
act of trust in the public.  This decision was a political one, informed by
the basic values of the American republic.  The situation might have been
very different;  and in other countries, under other systems, it certainly
was.
<P>
Joseph Stalin, for instance, vetoed plans for a Soviet phone system
soon after the Bolshevik revolution.  Stalin was certain that publicly
accessible telephones would become instruments of anti-Soviet
counterrevolution and conspiracy.   (He was probably right.)  When
telephones did arrive in the Soviet Union, they would be instruments of
Party authority, and always heavily tapped.  (Alexander Solzhenitsyn's
prison-camp novel <EM>The First Circle</EM> describes efforts to develop a phone
system more suited to Stalinist purposes.)
<P>
France, with its tradition of rational centralized government, had
fought bitterly even against the electric telegraph, which seemed to the
French entirely too anarchical and frivolous.   For decades, nineteenth-century
France communicated via the "visual telegraph," a nation-spanning,
government-owned  semaphore system of huge stone towers that
signalled from hilltops, across vast distances, with big windmill-like arms.
In 1846, one Dr. Barbay, a semaphore enthusiast, memorably uttered an
early version of what might be called "the security expert's argument"
against the open media.
<P>
"No, the electric telegraph is not a sound invention. It will always
be at the mercy of the slightest disruption, wild youths, drunkards, bums,
etc...  The electric telegraph meets those destructive elements with only a
few meters of wire over which supervision is impossible.  A single man
could, without being seen, cut the telegraph wires leading to Paris, and in
twenty-four hours cut in ten different places the wires of the same line,
without being arrested. The visual telegraph, on the contrary, has its
towers, its high walls, its gates well-guarded from inside by strong armed
men.  Yes, I declare, substitution of the electric telegraph for the visual
one is a dreadful measure, a truly idiotic act."
<P>
Dr. Barbay and his high-security stone machines were eventually
unsuccessful, but his argument -- that communication  exists for the safety
and convenience of the state, and must be carefully protected from the
wild boys and the gutter rabble  who might want to crash the system --
would be heard again and again.
<P>
When the French telephone system finally did arrive, its snarled
inadequacy was to be notorious.  Devotees of the American Bell System
often recommended a trip to France, for skeptics.
<P>
In Edwardian Britain, issues of class and privacy were a ball-and-chain
for telephonic progress.   It was considered outrageous that anyone --
any wild fool off the street -- could simply barge bellowing into one's
office or home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell.  In
Britain, phones were tolerated for the use of business, but private phones
tended be stuffed away into closets, smoking rooms, or servants' quarters.
Telephone operators were resented in Britain because they did not seem to
"know their place."   And no one of breeding would print a telephone
number on a business card; this seemed a crass attempt to make the
acquaintance of strangers.
<P>
But phone access in America was to become a popular right;
something like universal suffrage, only more so.  American women could
not yet vote when the phone system came through; yet from the beginning
American women doted on the telephone.  This "feminization" of the
American telephone was often commented on by foreigners.   Phones in
America were not censored or stiff or  formalized; they were social,
private, intimate, and domestic.   In America, Mother's Day is by far the
busiest day of the year for the phone network.
<P>
The early telephone companies, and especially AT&#38;T, were among
the foremost employers of American women.  They employed the
daughters of the American middle-class in great armies: in 1891, eight
thousand women; by 1946, almost a quarter of a million.   Women
seemed to enjoy telephone work; it was respectable, it was steady, it paid
fairly well as women's work went, and -- not least -- it seemed a genuine
contribution to the social good of the community.   Women found Vail's
ideal of public service attractive.  This was especially true in rural areas,
where women operators, running extensive rural partylines, enjoyed
considerable social power.   The operator knew everyone on the party-line,
and everyone knew her.
<P>
Although Bell himself was an ardent suffragist, the telephone
company did not employ women for the sake of advancing female
liberation.  AT&#38;T  did this for sound commercial reasons.  The first
telephone operators of the Bell system were not women, but teenage
American boys. They were telegraphic  messenger boys (a group about to
be rendered technically obsolescent), who swept up around the phone
office, dunned customers for bills, and made phone connections on the
switchboard, all on the cheap.
<P>
Within the very first  year of operation, 1878, Bell's company
learned a sharp lesson about combining teenage boys and telephone
switchboards.   Putting teenage boys in charge of the phone system
brought swift and consistent disaster.  Bell's chief engineer described them
as "Wild Indians."  The boys were openly rude to customers.  They talked
back to subscribers, saucing off, uttering facetious remarks, and generally
giving lip.  The rascals took Saint Patrick's Day off without permission.
And worst of all they played clever tricks with the switchboard plugs:
disconnecting calls, crossing lines so that customers found themselves
talking to strangers, and so forth.
<P>
This combination of power, technical mastery, and effective
anonymity seemed to act like catnip on teenage boys.
<P>
This wild-kid-on-the-wires phenomenon was not confined to the
USA; from the beginning, the same was true of the British phone system.
An early British commentator kindly remarked:  "No doubt boys in their
teens found the work not a little irksome, and it is also highly probable that
under the early conditions of employment the adventurous and inquisitive
spirits of which the average healthy boy of that age is possessed, were not
always conducive to the best attention being given to the wants of the
telephone subscribers."
<P>
So the boys were flung off the system -- or at least, deprived of
control of the switchboard.  But the "adventurous and inquisitive spirits"
of the teenage boys would be heard from in the world of telephony, again
and again.
<P>
The fourth stage in the technological life-cycle is death:  "the Dog,"
dead tech.   The telephone has so far avoided this fate.  On the contrary, it
is thriving, still spreading, still evolving, and at increasing speed.
<P>
The telephone has achieved a rare and exalted state for a
technological artifact:  it has become a <EM>household object.</EM>  The
telephone, like the clock, like pen and paper, like kitchen utensils and
running water, has become a technology that is visible only by its absence.
The telephone is technologically transparent.  The global telephone system
is the largest and most complex machine in the world, yet it is easy to use.
More remarkable yet,  the telephone is almost entirely physically safe for
the user.
<P>
For the average citizen in the 1870s, the telephone was weirder,
more shocking, more "high-tech" and harder to comprehend, than the most
outrageous stunts of advanced computing for us Americans in the 1990s.
In trying to understand what is happening to us today, with  our bulletin board
systems, direct overseas dialling, fiberoptic transmissions, computer
viruses, hacking stunts, and a vivid tangle of new laws and new crimes, it
is important to realize that our society has been through a similar challenge
before -- and that, all in all, we did rather well by it.
<P>
Bell's stage telephone seemed bizarre at first.  But the sensations of
weirdness vanished quickly, once people began to hear the familiar voices
of relatives and friends, in their own homes on their own telephones.   The
telephone changed from a fearsome high-tech totem to an everyday pillar
of human community.
<P>
This has also happened, and is still happening, to computer
networks.   Computer networks  such as NSFnet, BITnet,  USENET,
JANET,  are technically advanced, intimidating, and much harder to use
than telephones.  Even the popular, commercial computer networks, such
as GEnie, Prodigy, and CompuServe, cause much head-scratching and
have been described as  "user-hateful."   Nevertheless they too are
changing from fancy high-tech items into everyday sources of human
community.
<P>
The words "community" and "communication" have the same root.
Wherever you put a communications network, you put a community as
well.  And whenever you <EM>take away</EM>  that network -- confiscate it,
outlaw it, crash it, raise its price beyond affordability -- then you hurt that
community.
<P>
Communities  will fight to defend themselves.  People will fight
harder and more bitterly to defend their communities,  than they will fight
to defend their own individual selves.   And this is very true of the
"electronic community" that arose around computer networks in the 1980s
-- or rather, the <EM>various</EM> electronic communities, in telephony, law
enforcement, computing, and the digital  underground that, by  the year
1990, were raiding, rallying, arresting, suing, jailing, fining and issuing
angry manifestos.
<P>
None of the events of 1990 were entirely new. Nothing happened
in 1990 that did not have some kind of earlier and more understandable
precedent.   What gave the Hacker Crackdown its new sense of gravity and
importance was the feeling -- the <EM>community</EM> feeling - that the political
stakes had been raised; that trouble in cyberspace was no longer mere
mischief or inconclusive skirmishing, but a genuine fight over genuine
issues, a fight for community survival and the shape of the future. These
electronic communities, having flourished throughout the 1980s, were
becoming aware of themselves, and increasingly, becoming aware of
other, rival communities.   Worries were sprouting up right and left, with
complaints, rumors, uneasy speculations.   But it would take a catalyst, a
shock, to make the new world evident.   Like Bell's great publicity break,
the Tarriffville Rail Disaster of January 1878, it would take a cause
celebre.
<P>
That cause was the AT&#38;T Crash of January 15, 1990. After the
Crash, the wounded and anxious telephone community would come out
fighting hard.
<P>
#
<P>
The community of telephone technicians, engineers, operators and
researchers is the oldest community in cyberspace.   These are the
veterans, the most developed group,  the richest, the most respectable, in
most ways the most powerful.   Whole generations  have come and gone
since Alexander Graham Bell's day, but the community he founded
survives; people work for the phone system today whose great-grandparents
worked for the phone system. Its specialty magazines, such
as <EM>Telephony,</EM>  <EM>AT&#38;T Technical Journal,</EM>   <EM>Telephone Engineer and
Management,</EM>  are decades old; they make computer publications like
<EM>Macworld</EM> and <EM>PC Week</EM>  look like amateur johnny-come-latelies.
<P>
And the phone companies take no back seat in hightechnology,
either.  Other companies' industrial researchers may have won new
markets;  but the researchers of Bell Labs have won <EM>seven  Nobel
Prizes.</EM>  One potent device that Bell Labs originated, the transistor, has
created entire <EM>groups</EM> of industries.  Bell Labs are world-famous for
generating "a patent a day," and have even made vital discoveries in
astronomy, physics and cosmology.
<P>
Throughout its seventy-year history, "Ma Bell" was not so much a
company as a way of life.  Until the cataclysmic divestiture of the 1980s,
Ma Bell was perhaps the ultimate maternalist mega-employer.   The
AT&#38;T corporate image was the "gentle giant,"  "the voice with a smile," a
vaguely socialist-realist world of cleanshaven linemen in shiny helmets
and blandly pretty phone-girls in headsets and nylons.   Bell System
employees were famous as rock-ribbed Kiwanis and Rotary members,
Little-League enthusiasts, school-board people.
<P>
During the long heyday of Ma Bell, the Bell employee corps were
nurtured top-to-bottom on a  corporate ethos of public service.   There was
good money in Bell, but Bell was not <EM>about</EM> money; Bell used public
relations, but never mere marketeering.   People went into the Bell System
for a good life, and they had a good life. But it was not mere money that
led Bell people out in the midst of storms and earthquakes to fight with
toppled phone-poles, to wade in flooded manholes, to pull the redeyed
graveyard-shift over collapsing switching-systems. The Bell ethic was the
electrical equivalent of the postman's: neither rain, nor snow, nor gloom of
night would stop these couriers.
<P>
It is easy to be cynical about this, as it is easy to be cynical about
any political or social system;  but cynicism does not change the fact that
thousands of people took these ideals very seriously.   And some still do.
<P>
The Bell ethos was about public service; and that was gratifying;
but it was also about private <EM>power,</EM> and that was gratifying too.   As a
corporation, Bell was very special. Bell was privileged.  Bell had snuggled
up close to the state.  In fact, Bell was as close to government as you could
get in America and still make a whole lot of legitimate money.
<P>
But unlike other companies,  Bell was above and beyond the vulgar
commercial fray.  Through its regional operating companies, Bell was
omnipresent, local, and  intimate, all over America;  but the central ivory
towers at its corporate heart were the tallest and the ivoriest around.
<P>
There were other phone companies in America, to be sure;
the so-called independents.  Rural cooperatives, mostly; small fry,
mostly tolerated, sometimes warred upon.
<P>
For many decades, "independent" American phone companies
lived in fear and loathing of the official Bell monopoly  (or the "Bell
Octopus," as Ma Bell's nineteenth-century enemies described her in many
angry newspaper manifestos).  Some few of these independent
entrepreneurs,  while legally in the wrong,  fought so bitterly against the
Octopus that their illegal phone networks were cast into the street by Bell
agents and publicly burned.
<P>
The pure technical sweetness of the Bell System gave its operators,
inventors and engineers a deeply satisfying sense of power and mastery.
They had devoted their lives to improving this vast nation-spanning
machine; over years, whole human lives, they had watched it improve  and
grow.   It was like a great technological  temple.  They were an elite, and
they knew it -- even if others did not; in fact, they felt even more powerful
<EM>because</EM> others did not understand. The deep attraction of this sensation
of elite technical power should never be underestimated. "Technical
power" is not for everybody; for many people it simply has no charm at all.
But for some people, it becomes the core of their lives.  For a few, it is
overwhelming, obsessive;  it becomes something close to an addiction.
People -- especially clever teenage boys whose lives are otherwise mostly
powerless and put-upon -- love this sensation of secret power, and are
willing to do all sorts of amazing things to achieve it.  The technical
<EM>power</EM> of electronics has motivated many  strange acts detailed in this
book, which would otherwise be inexplicable.
<P>
So Bell had power beyond mere capitalism.  The Bell service
ethos worked, and was often propagandized, in a rather saccharine fashion.
Over the decades,  people  slowly grew tired of this.   And then, openly
impatient with it.  By the early 1980s, Ma Bell was to find herself with
scarcely a real friend in the world.   Vail's industrial socialism had become
hopelessly out-of-fashion politically.  Bell would be punished for that.
And that punishment would fall harshly upon the people of the telephone
community.
<P>
#
<P>
In 1983, Ma Bell was dismantled by federal court action.  The
pieces of Bell are now separate corporate entities.  The core of the
company became AT&#38;T Communications, and also AT&#38;T  Industries
(formerly Western Electric, Bell's manufacturing arm).  AT&#38;T Bell Labs
became Bell Communications Research, Bellcore. Then there are the
Regional Bell Operating Companies, or  RBOCs, pronounced "arbocks."
<P>
Bell was a titan and even these regional chunks are gigantic
enterprises:  Fortune 50 companies with plenty of wealth and power
behind them.     But the clean lines of "One Policy, One System, Universal
Service" have been shattered, apparently forever.
<P>
The "One Policy" of the early Reagan Administration was to
shatter a system that smacked of noncompetitive socialism.  Since that
time, there has been no real telephone "policy" on the federal level.
Despite the breakup, the remnants of Bell have never been set free to
compete in the open marketplace.
<P>
The RBOCs are still very heavily regulated, but not from the top.
Instead, they struggle politically, economically and legally, in what seems
an endless turmoil, in a patchwork of overlapping federal and state
jurisdictions.   Increasingly, like other major American corporations, the
RBOCs  are becoming multinational, acquiring important commercial
interests in Europe, Latin  America, and the Pacific Rim.  But this, too,
adds to their legal and political predicament.
<P>
The people of what used to be Ma Bell are not happy about their
fate.  They feel ill-used.  They might have been grudgingly willing to make
a full transition to the free market; to become just companies amid other
companies. But this never happened.   Instead,  AT&#38;T and the RBOCS
("the Baby Bells")  feel themselves wrenched from side to side by state
regulators, by Congress, by the FCC,  and especially by the federal court of
Judge Harold Greene, the magistrate who ordered the Bell breakup and
who has been the de facto czar of American telecommunications ever
since 1983.
<P>
Bell people feel that they exist in a kind of paralegal limbo today.
They don't understand what's demanded of them.   If it's "service," why
aren't they treated like a public service?  And if it's money, then why aren't
they free to compete for it?  No one seems to know, really.   Those who
claim to know  keep changing their minds.  Nobody in authority seems
willing to grasp the nettle for once and all.
<P>
Telephone people from other countries are amazed by the
American telephone system today.  Not that it works so well; for
nowadays even the French telephone system works, more or less.  They are
amazed that the American telephone system <EM>still</EM>  works <EM>at all,</EM>
under these strange conditions.
<P>
Bell's  "One System" of long-distance service is now only about
eighty percent of a system, with the remainder held by Sprint, MCI, and
the midget long-distance companies.   Ugly wars over dubious corporate
practices such as "slamming" (an underhanded method of snitching clients
from rivals) break out with some regularity in the realm of long-distance
service.  The battle to break Bell's long-distance monopoly was long and
ugly, and since the breakup the battlefield has not become much prettier.
AT&#38;T's famous shame-and-blame advertisements, which emphasized the
shoddy work and purported ethical shadiness of their competitors,  were
much remarked on for their studied psychological cruelty. There is much
bad blood in this industry, and much long-treasured resentment.  AT&#38;T's
post-breakup corporate logo, a striped sphere, is known in the industry as
the "Death Star"  (a reference from the movie <EM>Star Wars,</EM> in which the
"Death Star" was the spherical  hightech fortress of the harsh-breathing
imperial ultra-baddie, Darth Vader.)   Even AT&#38;T employees are less than
thrilled by the Death Star.   A popular (though banned) T-shirt among
AT&#38;T employees bears the old-fashioned Bell logo of the Bell System,
plus the newfangled striped sphere, with the before-and-after comments:
"This is your brain -- This is your brain on drugs!"   AT&#38;T made a very
well-financed and determined effort to break into the personal computer
market;  it was disastrous, and telco computer experts are derisively
known by their competitors as "the pole-climbers."  AT&#38;T and the Baby
Bell arbocks still seem to have few friends. Under conditions of sharp
commercial competition, a crash like that of January 15, 1990 was a major
embarrassment to AT&#38;T.  It was a direct blow against their much-treasured
reputation for reliability.   Within days of the crash AT&#38;T's
Chief Executive Officer, Bob Allen, officially apologized, in terms of
deeply pained  humility: "AT&#38;T had a major service disruption last
Monday. We didn't live up to our own standards of quality, and we didn't
live up to yours. It's as simple as that.  And that's not acceptable to us.  Or
to you... We understand how much people have come to depend upon
AT&#38;T service, so our AT&#38;T Bell Laboratories scientists and our network
engineers are doing everything possible to guard against a recurrence...
We know there's no way to make up for the inconvenience this problem
may have caused you."
<P>
Mr Allen's "open letter to customers" was printed in lavish ads all
over the country:  in the <EM>Wall Street Journal,</EM>  <EM>USA Today,</EM>  <EM>New
York Times,</EM> <EM>Los Angeles Times,</EM>  <EM>Chicago Tribune,</EM> <EM>Philadelphia
Inquirer,</EM>  <EM>San Francisco Chronicle Examiner,</EM> <EM>Boston Globe,</EM>
<EM>Dallas Morning News,</EM> <EM>Detroit Free Press,</EM> <EM>Washington Post,</EM>
<EM>Houston Chronicle,</EM> <EM>Cleveland Plain Dealer,</EM> <EM>Atlanta Journal
Constitution,</EM> <EM>Minneapolis Star Tribune,</EM> <EM>St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch,</EM>  <EM>Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer,</EM> <EM>Tacoma News Tribune,</EM>
<EM>Miami Herald,</EM> <EM>Pittsburgh  Press,</EM>  <EM>St. Louis Post Dispatch,</EM> <EM>Denver
Post,</EM> <EM>Phoenix Republic Gazette</EM> and <EM>Tampa Tribune.</EM>
<P>
In another press release, AT&#38;T went to some pains to suggest that
this "software glitch" <EM>might</EM> have happened just as easily to MCI,
although, in fact, it hadn't.  (MCI's switching software was quite different
from AT&#38;T's -- though not necessarily any safer.)   AT&#38;T also announced
their plans to offer a rebate of service on Valentine's Day to make up for
the loss during the Crash.
<P>
"Every technical resource available, including Bell Labs scientists
and engineers, has been devoted to assuring it will not occur again," the
public was told. They were further assured that "The chances of a
recurrence are small -- a problem of this magnitude never occurred before."
<P>
In the meantime, however, police and corporate security
maintained their own suspicions about "the chances of recurrence" and the
real reason why a "problem of this magnitude" had appeared, seemingly
out of nowhere.   Police and security knew for a fact that hackers of
unprecedented sophistication were illegally entering, and reprogramming,
certain digital switching stations.  Rumors of hidden "viruses" and secret
"logic bombs" in the switches ran rampant in the underground, with much
chortling over AT&#38;T's predicament, and idle speculation over what
unsung hacker genius was responsible for it.  Some hackers, including
police informants, were trying hard to finger one another as the true
culprits  of the Crash.
<P>
Telco people found little comfort in objectivity when they
contemplated these possibilities.   It was just too close to the bone for
them; it was embarrassing; it hurt so much; it was hard even to talk about.
<P>
There has always been thieving and misbehavior in the phone
system.  There has always been trouble with the rival independents, and in
the local loops.  But to have such trouble in the core of the system, the
long-distance switching stations, is a horrifying affair.   To telco people,
this is all the difference between finding roaches in your kitchen and big
horrid sewer-rats in your bedroom.
<P>
From the outside, to the average citizen, the telcos still seem
gigantic and impersonal.  The American public seems to regard them as
something akin to Soviet apparats.  Even when the telcos  do their best
corporatecitizen routine,  subsidizing magnet high-schools and sponsoring
news-shows on public television, they seem to win little except public
suspicion.
<P>
But from the inside, all this looks very different. There's harsh
competition.  A legal and political system  that seems baffled  and bored,
when not actively hostile to telco interests.  There's a loss of morale, a
deep sensation of having somehow lost the upper hand.  Technological
change has caused a loss of data and revenue to other, newer forms of
transmission.   There's theft, and new forms of theft, of growing scale and
boldness and  sophistication.  With all these factors, it was no surprise to
see the telcos, large and small, break out in a litany of bitter complaint.
<P>
In late '88 and throughout 1989, telco representatives grew shrill in
their complaints to those few American law enforcement officials who
make it their business to try to understand what telephone people are
talking about. Telco security officials had discovered the computerhacker
underground, infiltrated it thoroughly, and become deeply alarmed at its
growing expertise.  Here  they had found a target that was not only
loathsome on its face, but clearly ripe for counterattack.
<P>
Those bitter rivals: AT&#38;T, MCI and Sprint -- and a crowd of Baby
Bells:  PacBell, Bell South, Southwestern Bell, NYNEX, USWest, as well
as the Bell research consortium Bellcore, and the independent long-distance
carrier  Mid-American  -- all were to have their role in the great
hacker dragnet of 1990.   After years of being battered and pushed around,
the telcos had, at least in a small way, seized the initiative again.  After
years of turmoil, telcos and government officials were once again to work
smoothly in concert in defense of the System. Optimism blossomed;
enthusiasm grew on all sides; the prospective taste of vengeance was
sweet.
<P>
#
<P>
From the beginning -- even before the crackdown had a name --
secrecy was a big problem.  There were many good reasons for secrecy in
the hacker crackdown.  Hackers and code-thieves were wily prey, slinking
back to their bedrooms and basements and destroying vital incriminating
evidence at the first hint of trouble. Furthermore, the crimes themselves
were heavily  technical and difficult to describe, even to police -- much
less to the general public.
<P>
When such crimes <EM>had</EM> been described intelligibly to the public,
in the past, that very publicity had tended to <EM>increase</EM> the crimes
enormously.   Telco officials, while painfully aware of the vulnerabilities
of their systems, were anxious not to publicize those weaknesses.
Experience showed them that those weaknesses, once discovered, would
be pitilessly exploited by tens of thousands of people -- not only by
professional grifters and by underground hackers and phone phreaks, but
by many otherwise more-or-less honest everyday folks, who regarded
stealing service from the faceless, soulless "Phone Company" as a kind of
harmless indoor sport.  When it came to protecting their interests, telcos
had long since given up on general public sympathy for "the Voice with a
Smile."  Nowadays the telco's "Voice" was very likely to be a computer's;
and the American public showed much less of the proper respect and
gratitude due the fine public service bequeathed them by Dr. Bell and Mr.
Vail. The more efficient, high-tech, computerized, and impersonal the
telcos became, it seemed, the more they were met by sullen public
resentment and amoral greed.
<P>
Telco officials wanted to punish the phone-phreak underground,  in
as public and exemplary a manner as possible.  They wanted to make dire
examples of the worst offenders, to seize the ringleaders and intimidate the
small fry, to discourage and frighten the wacky hobbyists, and send the
professional grifters to jail.  To do all this, publicity was vital.
<P>
Yet operational secrecy was even more so.  If word got out that a
nationwide crackdown was coming, the hackers might simply vanish;
destroy the evidence, hide their computers, go to earth, and wait for the
campaign to blow over.  Even the young  hackers were crafty and
suspicious, and as for the professional grifters, they tended to split for the
nearest state-line at the first sign of trouble.  For the crackdown to work
well, they would all have to be caught red-handed, swept upon suddenly,
out of the blue, from every corner of the compass. And there was another
strong motive for secrecy.  In the worst-case scenario, a blown campaign
might leave the telcos open to a devastating hacker counter-attack.   If
there were indeed hackers loose in America  who had caused the January
15 Crash -- if there were truly gifted hackers, loose in the nation's
long-distance switching systems, and enraged or frightened by the crackdown --
then they might react unpredictably to an attempt to  collar them.   Even if
caught, they might have talented and vengeful friends still running around
loose.   Conceivably, it could turn ugly.  Very ugly.  In fact, it was hard to
imagine just how ugly things might turn, given that possibility. Counter-attack
from hackers was a genuine concern for the telcos.  In point of fact,
they would never suffer any such counter-attack.  But in months to come,
they would be at some pains to publicize this notion and to utter grim
warnings about it.
<P>
Still, that risk seemed well worth running.  Better to run the risk of
vengeful attacks, than to live at the mercy of potential crashers.  Any cop
would tell you that a protection racket had no real future.
<P>
And publicity was such a useful thing.   Corporate security officers,
including telco security,  generally work under conditions of great
discretion.  And corporate security officials do not make money for their
companies. Their job is to <EM>prevent the loss</EM> of money, which is much
less glamorous than actually winning profits. If you are a corporate
security official, and you do your job brilliantly, then nothing bad happens
to your company at all.  Because of this, you appear completely
superfluous.   This is one of the many unattractive aspects of security
work.   It's rare that these folks have the chance to draw some healthy
attention to their own efforts.
<P>
Publicity also served the interest of their friends in law
enforcement.  Public officials, including law enforcement officials,  thrive
by attracting favorable public interest.  A brilliant prosecution in a matter
of vital public interest  can make the career of a prosecuting attorney.  And
for a police officer, good publicity opens the purses of the legislature; it
may bring a citation, or a promotion, or at least a rise in status and the
respect of one's peers.
<P>
But to have both publicity and secrecy is to have one's cake and eat
it too.  In months to come, as we will show, this impossible act was to
cause great pain to the agents of the crackdown.  But early on, it seemed
possible -- maybe even likely -- that the crackdown could successfully
combine the best of both worlds.   The <EM>arrest</EM> of hackers would be
heavily publicized.  The actual <EM>deeds</EM> of the hackers, which were
technically hard to explain and also a security risk, would be left decently
obscured.   The <EM>threat</EM> hackers posed would be heavily trumpeted; the
likelihood of their actually committing such fearsome crimes would be left
to the public's imagination.  The spread of the computer underground, and
its growing technical sophistication, would be heavily promoted;  the
actual hackers themselves, mostly bespectacled middle-class white
suburban teenagers, would be denied any personal publicity.
<P>
It does not seem to have occurred to any telco official that the
hackers accused would demand a day in court; that journalists would smile
upon the hackers as "good copy;"  that wealthy high-tech entrepreneurs
would offer moral and financial support to crackdown victims; that
constitutional lawyers would show up with briefcases, frowning mightily.
This possibility does not seem to have ever entered the game-plan.
<P>
And even if it had, it probably would not have slowed the ferocious
pursuit of a stolen phone-company document, mellifluously known as
"Control Office Administration of Enhanced 911 Services for Special
Services and Major Account Centers."
<P>
In the chapters to follow, we will explore the worlds of police and
the computer underground, and the large shadowy area where they overlap.
But first, we must  explore the battleground.  Before we leave the world of
the telcos, we must understand what a switching system actually is and
how your telephone actually works.
<P>
#
<P>
To the average citizen, the idea of the telephone is represented by,
well,  a <EM>telephone:</EM>  a device that you talk into.
<P>
To a telco professional, however, the telephone itself is known, in
lordly fashion, as a "subset."   The "subset" in your house is a mere
adjunct, a distant nerve ending, of the central switching stations, which are
ranked in levels of hierarchy, up to the  long-distance electronic switching
stations, which are some of the largest computers on earth.
Let us imagine that it is, say, 1925,  before the introduction of
computers, when the phone system was simpler and somewhat easier to
grasp.   Let's further imagine that you are Miss Leticia Luthor, a fictional
operator for Ma Bell in New York City of the 20s.
Basically, you, Miss Luthor, <EM>are</EM> the "switching system."  You
are sitting in front of a large vertical switchboard, known as a "cordboard,"
made of shiny wooden panels, with ten thousand metal-rimmed holes
punched in them, known as jacks.  The engineers would have put more
holes into your switchboard, but ten thousand is as many as you can reach
without actually having to get up out of your chair.
<P>
Each of these ten thousand holes has its own little electric
lightbulb, known as a "lamp," and its own neatly printed number code.
<P>
With the ease of long habit, you are scanning your board for lit-up
bulbs.  This is what you do most of the time, so you are used to it.
<P>
A lamp lights up.  This means that the phone at the end of that line
has been taken off the hook.   Whenever a handset is taken off the hook,
that closes a circuit inside the phone which then signals the local office,
i.e. you, automatically.  There might be somebody calling, or then again
the phone might be simply off the hook, but this does not matter to you
yet.  The first thing you do, is record that number in your logbook, in your
fine American public-school handwriting.   This comes first, naturally,
since it is done for billing purposes.
<P>
You now take the plug of your answering cord, which goes directly
to your headset, and plug it into the lit-up hole.  "Operator," you announce.
<P>
In operator's classes, before taking this job, you have been issued a
large pamphlet full of canned operator's responses for all kinds of
contingencies, which you had to memorize.  You have also been trained in
a proper nonregional, non-ethnic pronunciation and tone of voice.  You
rarely  have the occasion to make any spontaneous remark to a customer,
and in fact this is frowned upon (except out on the rural lines where people
have time on their hands and get up to all kinds of mischief).
<P>
A tough-sounding user's voice at the end of the line gives you a
number.  Immediately, you write that number down in your logbook, next
to the caller's number, which you just wrote earlier.  You then look and see
if the number this guy wants is in fact on your switchboard, which it
generally is, since it's generally a local call. Long distance costs so much
that people use it sparingly.
<P>
Only then do you pick up a calling-cord from a shelf  at the base of
the switchboard.  This is a long elastic cord mounted on a kind of reel so
that it will zip back in when you unplug it.  There are a lot of cords down
there, and when a bunch of them are out at once they look like a nest of
snakes.  Some of the girls think there are bugs living in those cable-holes.
They're called "cable mites" and are supposed to bite your hands and give
you rashes.  You don't believe this, yourself.
<P>
Gripping the head of your calling-cord, you slip the tip of it deftly
into the sleeve of the jack for the called person.  Not all the way in,
though.  You just touch it.  If you hear a clicking sound, that means the
line is busy and you can't put the call through.  If the line is busy, you have
to stick the calling-cord into a "busy-tone jack," which will give the guy a
busy-tone.  This way you don't have to talk to him yourself and absorb his
natural human frustration.
<P>
But the line isn't busy.  So you pop the cord all the way in.   Relay
circuits in your board make the distant phone ring, and if somebody picks
it up off the hook, then a phone conversation starts.   You can hear this
conversation on your answering cord, until you unplug it. In fact you could
listen to the whole conversation if you wanted, but this is sternly frowned
upon by management, and frankly, when you've overheard one, you've
pretty much heard 'em all.
<P>
You can tell how long the conversation lasts by the glow of the
calling-cord's lamp, down on the calling-cord's shelf.   When it's over, you
unplug and the calling-cord zips back into place.
<P>
Having done this stuff a few hundred thousand times, you become
quite good at it.  In fact you're plugging, and connecting, and
disconnecting, ten, twenty, forty cords at a time.  It's a manual handicraft,
really, quite satisfying in a way, rather like weaving on an upright loom.
<P>
Should a long-distance call come up, it would be different, but not
all that different.  Instead of connecting the call through your own local
switchboard, you have to go up the hierarchy, onto the long-distance lines,
known as "trunklines."  Depending on how far the call goes, it may have to
work its way through a whole series of operators, which can take quite a
while.   The caller doesn't wait on the line while this complex process is
negotiated across the country by the gaggle of operators.   Instead, the
caller hangs up, and you call him back yourself when the call has finally
worked its way through.
<P>
After four or five years of this work, you get married, and you have
to quit your job, this being the natural order of womanhood in the
American 1920s.  The phone company has to train somebody else --
maybe two people, since the phone system has grown somewhat in the
meantime.  And this costs money.
<P>
In fact, to use any kind of human being as a switching system is a
very expensive proposition.   Eight thousand Leticia Luthors would be bad
enough, but a quarter of a million of them is a military-scale proposition
and makes drastic measures in automation financially worthwhile.
<P>
Although the phone system continues to grow today, the number of
human beings employed by telcos has been dropping steadily for years.
Phone "operators" now deal with nothing but unusual contingencies, all
routine operations having been shrugged off onto machines. Consequently,
telephone operators are considerably less machine-like nowadays,  and
have been known to have accents and actual character in their voices.
When you reach a human operator today, the operators are rather more
"human" than they were in Leticia's day -- but on the other hand, human
beings in the phone system are much harder to reach in the first place.
<P>
Over the first half of the twentieth century, "electromechanical"
switching systems of growing complexity were cautiously introduced into
the phone system.  In certain backwaters, some of these hybrid  systems
are still in use.  But after 1965, the phone system began to go completely
electronic, and this is by far the dominant mode today.  Electromechanical
systems have "crossbars," and "brushes," and other large moving
mechanical parts, which, while faster and cheaper than Leticia, are still
slow, and tend to wear out fairly quickly.
<P>
But fully electronic systems are inscribed on silicon chips, and are
lightning-fast, very cheap, and quite durable.   They are much cheaper to
maintain than even  the best electromechanical systems, and they fit into
half the space.   And with every year, the silicon chip grows smaller,
faster, and cheaper yet.  Best of all,  automated electronics work around
the clock and don't have salaries or health insurance.
<P>
There are, however, quite serious drawbacks to the use of
computer-chips.   When they do break down, it is a daunting challenge to
figure out what the heck has gone wrong with them.  A broken cordboard
generally had a problem in it big enough to see.  A broken chip has
invisible, microscopic faults.  And the faults in bad  software can be so
subtle as to be practically theological. If you want a mechanical system to
do something new, then you must travel to where it is, and pull pieces out
of it, and wire in new pieces.  This costs money.  However, if you want a
chip to do something new, all you have to do is change its software, which
is easy, fast and dirt-cheap. You don't even have to see the chip to change
its program. Even if you did see the chip, it wouldn't look like much.  A
chip with program X doesn't look one whit different from a chip with
program Y. With the proper codes and sequences, and access to
specialized phone-lines, you can change electronic switching systems all
over America from anywhere you please.
<P>
And so can other people.  If they know how, and if they want to,
they can sneak into a  microchip via the special phonelines and diddle with
it, leaving no physical trace at all.  If they broke into the operator's station
and held Leticia at gunpoint, that would be very obvious.  If they broke
into a telco building and went after an electromechanical switch with a
toolbelt, that would at least leave many traces.  But people can do all
manner of amazing things to computer switches just by typing on a
keyboard, and keyboards are everywhere today.  The extent of this
vulnerability is deep, dark, broad, almost mind-boggling, and yet this is a
basic, primal fact of life about any computer on a network.
<P>
Security experts over the past twenty years have insisted, with
growing urgency, that this basic vulnerability of computers represents an
entirely new level of risk, of unknown but obviously dire potential to
society.   And they are right.
<P>
An electronic switching station does pretty much everything Letitia
did, except in nanoseconds and on a much larger scale.  Compared to Miss
Luthor's ten thousand jacks, even a primitive 1ESS switching computer,
60s vintage,  has a 128,000 lines.   And the current AT&#38;T system of
choice is the monstrous fifth-generation 5ESS.
<P>
An Electronic Switching Station can scan every line  on its "board"
in a tenth of a second, and it does this over and over, tirelessly, around the
clock.  Instead of eyes, it uses "ferrod scanners" to check the condition of
local lines and trunks.  Instead of hands, it has "signal distributors,"
"central pulse distributors," "magnetic latching relays," and "reed
switches," which complete and break the calls. Instead of a brain, it has a
"central processor."   Instead of an instruction manual, it has a program.
Instead of a handwritten logbook for recording and billing calls, it has
magnetic tapes. And it never has to talk to anybody. Everything a customer
might say to it is done by punching the direct-dial tone buttons on your
subset.
<P>
Although an Electronic Switching Station can't talk, it does need an
interface, some way to relate to its, er, employers.   This interface is known
as the "master control center."  (This interface might be better known
simply as "the interface," since it doesn't actually "control" phone calls
directly.  However, a term like "Master Control Center" is just the kind of
rhetoric that telco maintenance engineers  -- and hackers -- find
particularly satisfying.) Using the master control center, a phone engineer
can test local and trunk lines for malfunctions.  He (rarely she) can check
various alarm displays, measure traffic on the lines, examine the records of
telephone usage and the charges for those calls, and change the
programming.
<P>
And, of course, anybody else who gets into the master control
center by remote control can also do these things, if he (rarely she) has
managed to figure them out, or, more likely, has somehow swiped the
knowledge from people who already know.
<P>
In 1989 and 1990, one particular RBOC, BellSouth, which felt
particularly troubled, spent a purported $1.2 million on computer security.
Some think it spent as  much as two million, if you count all the associated
costs. Two million dollars is still very little compared to the great
cost-saving utility of telephonic computer systems.
<P>
Unfortunately, computers are also stupid.  Unlike human beings,
computers  possess the truly profound stupidity of the inanimate.
<P>
In the 1960s, in the first shocks of spreading computerization, there
was much easy talk about the stupidity of computers -- how they could
"only follow the program" and were rigidly required to do "only what they
were told."   There has been rather less talk about the stupidity of
computers since they began to achieve grandmaster status in chess
tournaments, and to manifest many other impressive forms of apparent
cleverness.
<P>
Nevertheless, computers <EM>still</EM> are profoundly brittle and stupid;
they are simply vastly more subtle in their stupidity and brittleness.   The
computers of the 1990s are much more reliable in their components than
earlier computer systems, but they are also called upon to do far more
complex things, under far more challenging conditions.
<P>
On a basic mathematical level, every single line of a software
program offers a chance for some possible screwup.   Software does not sit
still when it works; it "runs," it interacts with itself and with its own inputs
and outputs. By analogy, it stretches like putty into millions of possible
shapes and conditions, so many shapes that they can never all be
successfully tested, not even in the lifespan of the universe.  Sometimes
the putty snaps.
<P>
The stuff we call "software" is not like anything that human society
is used to thinking about.  Software is something like a machine, and
something like mathematics, and something like language, and  something
like thought, and art, and information...  but software is not in fact any of
those other things.   The protean quality of software is one of the great
sources of its fascination.  It also makes software very powerful, very
subtle, very unpredictable, and very risky.
<P>
Some software is bad and buggy.  Some is "robust," even
"bulletproof."  The best software is that which has been tested by
thousands of users under thousands of different conditions, over years.  It
is then known as "stable."   This does <EM>not</EM> mean that the software is now
flawless, free of bugs.  It generally means that there are plenty of bugs in
it, but the bugs are well-identified and fairly well understood.
<P>
There is simply no way to assure that software is free of flaws.
Though software is mathematical in nature, it cannot be "proven" like a
mathematical theorem; software is more like language, with inherent
ambiguities, with different definitions, different assumptions, different
levels of meaning that can conflict.
<P>
Human beings can manage, more or less, with human language
because we can catch the gist of it.
<P>
Computers, despite years of effort in "artificial intelligence," have
proven spectacularly bad in "catching the gist" of anything at all.  The
tiniest bit of semantic grit may still bring the mightiest computer tumbling
down. One of the most hazardous things you can do to a computer
program is try to improve it -- to try to make it safer.  Software "patches"
represent new, untried un"stable" software, which is by definition riskier.
<P>
The modern telephone system has come to depend, utterly and
irretrievably, upon software.  And the System Crash of January 15, 1990,
was caused by an <EM>improvement</EM> in software.  Or rather, an <EM>attempted</EM>
improvement.
<P>
As it happened, the problem itself -- the problem per se  --  took
this form.  A piece of telco software had been written in C language, a
standard language of the telco field.  Within the C software was a long
"do... while" construct.  The "do... while" construct contained a "switch"
statement.  The "switch" statement contained an "if" clause.  The "if"
clause contained a "break."  The "break" was <EM>supposed</EM> to "break" the "if"
clause.  Instead, the "break" broke the "switch" statement.
<P>
That was the problem, the actual reason why people picking up
phones on January 15, 1990, could not talk to one another.
<P>
Or at least, that was the subtle, abstract, cyberspatial seed of the
problem.  This is how the problem manifested itself from the realm of
programming into the realm of real life.
<P>
The System 7 software for AT&#38;T's 4ESS switching station, the
"Generic 44E14 Central Office Switch Software," had been extensively
tested, and was considered very stable.   By the end of 1989, eighty of
AT&#38;T's switching systems nationwide had been programmed with the
new software.  Cautiously, thirty four stations were left to run the slower,
less-capable System 6, because AT&#38;T suspected there might be
shakedown problems with the new and unprecedently sophisticated
System 7 network.
<P>
The stations with System 7 were programmed to switch over to a
backup net in case of any problems.  In mid-December 1989, however, a
new high-velocity, high security software patch was distributed to each of
the 4ESS switches that would enable them to switch over even more
quickly, making the System 7 network that much more secure.
<P>
Unfortunately, every one of these 4ESS switches was now in
possession of a small but deadly flaw.
<P>
In order to maintain the network, switches must monitor the
condition of other switches -- whether they are up and running, whether
they have temporarily shut down, whether they are overloaded and in need
of assistance, and so forth.  The new software helped control this
bookkeeping function by monitoring the status calls from other switches.
<P>
It only takes four to six seconds for a troubled 4ESS switch to rid
itself of all its calls, drop everything temporarily, and re-boot its software
from scratch. Starting over from scratch will generally rid the switch of
any software problems that may have developed in the course of running
the system.   Bugs that arise will be simply wiped out by this process.  It is
a clever idea. This process of automatically re-booting from scratch is
known as the "normal fault recovery routine."   Since AT&#38;T's software is
in fact exceptionally stable, systems rarely have to go into "fault recovery"
in the first place;  but AT&#38;T has always boasted of its "real world"
reliability, and this tactic is a belt-and-suspenders routine.
<P>
The 4ESS switch used its new software to monitor its fellow
switches as they recovered from faults.   As other switches came back on
line after recovery, they would send their "OK" signals to the switch.   The
switch would make a little note to that effect in its "status map,"
recognizing that the fellow switch was back and ready to go, and should be
sent some calls and put back to regular work.
<P>
Unfortunately, while it was busy bookkeeping with the status map,
the tiny flaw in the brand-new software came into play.  The flaw caused
the 4ESS switch to interacted, subtly but drastically, with incoming
telephone calls from human users.  If -- and only if -- two incoming phone-calls
happened to hit the switch within a hundredth of a second,  then a
small patch of data would be garbled by the flaw.
<P>
But the switch had been programmed to monitor itself constantly
for any possible damage to its data. When the switch perceived that its
data had been somehow  garbled, then it too would go down, for swift
repairs to its software.  It would signal its fellow switches not to send any
more work.  It would go into the fault recovery mode for four to six
seconds.  And then the switch would be fine again, and would send out its
"OK, ready for work" signal.
<P>
However, the "OK, ready for work" signal was the <EM>very thing that
had caused the   switch to go down in the first place.</EM>  And <EM>all</EM> the
System 7 switches had the same flaw in their status-map software.  As
soon as they stopped to make  the bookkeeping note that their fellow
switch was "OK," then they too would become vulnerable to the slight
chance that two phone-calls would hit them within a hundredth of a
second.
<P>
At approximately 2:25 p.m. EST on Monday, January 15, one of
AT&#38;T's 4ESS toll switching systems in New York  City had an actual,
legitimate, minor problem.  It went into fault recovery routines, announced
"I'm going down," then announced, "I'm back, I'm OK."   And this cheery
message then blasted throughout the network to many of its fellow 4ESS
switches. Many of the switches, at first, completely escaped trouble.
These lucky switches were not hit by the coincidence of two phone calls
within a hundredth of a second.   Their software did not fail -- at first.  But
three switches -- in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Detroit --  were unlucky, and
were caught with their hands full.  And they went down.  And they came
back up, almost immediately. And they too began to broadcast the lethal
message that they, too, were "OK" again, activating the lurking software
bug in yet other switches.
<P>
As more and more switches did have that bit of bad luck and
collapsed, the call-traffic became more and more densely packed in the
remaining switches, which were groaning to keep up with the load.   And
of course, as the calls became more densely packed, the switches were
<EM>much more likely</EM> to be hit twice within a hundredth of a second. It only
took four seconds for a switch to get well. There was no <EM>physical</EM>
damage of any kind to the switches, after all.   Physically, they were
working perfectly. This situation was "only" a software problem. But the
4ESS switches were leaping up and down every four to six seconds, in a
virulent spreading wave all over America,  in utter, manic, mechanical
stupidity.  They kept <EM>knocking</EM>  one another down with their contagious
"OK" messages. It took about ten minutes for the chain reaction to cripple
the network.  Even then, switches would periodically luck-out and manage
to resume their normal work.  Many calls -- millions of them -- were
managing to get through.  But millions weren't.
<P>
The switching stations that used System 6 were not directly
affected.  Thanks to these old-fashioned switches, AT&#38;T's national system
avoided complete collapse.  This fact also made it clear to engineers that
System 7 was at fault.
<P>
Bell Labs engineers, working feverishly in New Jersey, Illinois,
and Ohio, first tried their entire repertoire of standard network remedies on
the malfunctioning System 7.  None of the remedies worked, of course,
because nothing like this had ever happened to any phone system before.
<P>
By cutting out the backup safety network entirely, they were able to
reduce the frenzy of "OK" messages by about half.  The system then began
to recover, as the chain reaction slowed.   By 11:30 pm on Monday
January 15, sweating engineers on the midnight shift breathed a sigh of
relief as the last switch cleared-up.
<P>
By Tuesday they were pulling all the brand-new 4ESS software
and replacing it with an earlier version of System 7. If these had been
human operators, rather than computers at work, someone would simply
have eventually stopped screaming.  It would have been <EM>obvious</EM> that the
situation was not "OK," and common sense would have kicked in.
Humans possess common  sense -- at least to some extent.   Computers
simply don't. On the other hand, computers can handle hundreds of calls
per second.  Humans simply can't.   If every single human being in
America worked for the phone company, we couldn't match the
performance of digital switches: direct-dialling, three-way calling,
speed-calling, callwaiting, Caller ID, all the rest of the cornucopia of digital
bounty.   Replacing computers with operators is simply not an option any
more.
<P>
And yet we still, anachronistically,  expect humans to be running
our phone system.   It is hard for us to understand that we have sacrificed
huge amounts of initiative and control to senseless yet powerful machines.
When the phones fail, we want somebody to be responsible.  We want
somebody to blame.
<P>
When the Crash of January 15 happened, the American populace
was simply not prepared to  understand that enormous landslides in
cyberspace, like the Crash itself, can happen, and can be nobody's fault in
particular.   It was easier to believe, maybe even in some odd way more
reassuring to believe, that some evil person,  or evil group, had done this
to us.  "Hackers" had done it. With a virus.   A trojan horse.  A software
bomb.  A dirty plot of some kind.   People believed this, responsible
people.  In 1990, they were looking hard for evidence to confirm their
heartfelt suspicions.
<P>
And they would look in a lot of places. Come 1991, however, the
outlines of an apparent new reality would begin to emerge from the fog.
<P>
On July 1 and 2, 1991, computer-software collapses in telephone
switching stations disrupted service in Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Los
Angeles and San Francisco.   Once again, seemingly minor maintenance
problems had crippled the digital System 7.  About twelve million people
were affected in the Crash of July 1, 1991.
<P>
Said the New York Times Service:  "Telephone company
executives and federal regulators said they were not ruling out the
possibility of sabotage by computer hackers, but most seemed to think the
problems stemmed from some unknown defect in the software running the
networks."
<P>
And sure enough, within the week, a red-faced software company,
DSC Communications Corporation of  Plano, Texas, owned up to
"glitches" in the "signal transfer point" software that DSC had designed for
Bell Atlantic and Pacific Bell.  The immediate cause of the July 1 Crash
was a single mistyped character:  one tiny typographical flaw in one single
line of the software.  One mistyped letter, in one single line, had deprived
the nation's capital of phone service.  It was not particularly surprising that
this tiny flaw had escaped attention: a typical System 7 station requires
<EM>ten million</EM> lines of code.
<P>
On Tuesday, September 17, 1991, came the most spectacular
outage yet.   This case had nothing to do with software failures -- at least,
not directly.  Instead, a group of AT&#38;T's switching stations in New York
City had simply run out of electrical power and shut down cold.  Their
back-up batteries had failed.  Automatic warning systems were supposed
to warn of the loss of battery power, but those automatic systems had
failed as well.
<P>
This time, Kennedy, La Guardia, and Newark airports all had their
voice and data communications cut.   This horrifying event was
particularly ironic, as attacks on airport computers by hackers had long
been a standard nightmare scenario, much trumpeted by computer-security
experts who feared the computer underground. There had even
been a Hollywood thriller about sinister hackers ruining airport computers
-- <EM>Die Hard II.</EM>
<P>
Now AT&#38;T itself had crippled airports with computer
malfunctions  -- not just one airport, but three at once, some of the busiest
in the world.
<P>
Air traffic came to a standstill throughout the Greater New York
area, causing more than 500 flights to be cancelled, in a spreading wave all
over America and even into Europe.  Another 500 or so flights were
delayed, affecting, all in all, about 85,000 passengers.  (One of these
passengers was the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission.)
<P>
Stranded passengers in New York and New Jersey were further
infuriated to discover that they could not even manage to make a long
distance phone call, to explain their delay to loved ones or business
associates. Thanks to the crash, about four and a half million domestic
calls, and half a million international calls, failed to get through. The
September 17 NYC Crash, unlike the previous ones, involved not a
whisper of "hacker" misdeeds.  On the contrary,  by 1991, AT&#38;T itself
was suffering much of the vilification that had formerly been directed at
hackers. Congressmen were grumbling.  So were state and federal
regulators.  And so was the press.
<P>
For their part, ancient rival MCI took out snide fullpage newspaper
ads in New York, offering their own longdistance services for the "next
time that AT&#38;T goes down." "You wouldn't find a classy company like
AT&#38;T using such advertising," protested AT&#38;T Chairman Robert Allen,
unconvincingly.  Once again, out came the full-page AT&#38;T apologies in
newspapers, apologies for "an inexcusable culmination of both human and
mechanical failure."   (This time, however, AT&#38;T offered no discount on
later calls.  Unkind critics suggested that AT&#38;T were worried about
setting any precedent for refunding the financial losses caused by
telephone crashes.)
<P>
Industry journals asked  publicly if AT&#38;T was "asleep at the
switch."   The telephone network, America's purported marvel of high-tech
reliability,  had gone down three times in 18 months.  <EM>Fortune</EM> magazine
listed the Crash of September 17 among the "Biggest Business Goofs of
1991,"  cruelly parodying AT&#38;T's ad campaign in an article entitled
"AT&#38;T Wants You Back (Safely On the Ground, God Willing)."
<P>
Why had those New York switching systems simply run out of
power?  Because no human being had attended to the alarm system.  Why
did the alarm systems blare automatically, without any human being
noticing? Because the three telco technicians who <EM>should</EM> have been
listening were absent from their stations in the  power-room, on another
floor of the building -- attending a training class.  A training class about
the alarm systems for the power room!
<P>
"Crashing the System" was no longer "unprecedented" by late
1991.   On the contrary, it no longer even seemed an oddity.   By 1991, it
was clear that all the policemen in the world could no longer "protect" the
phone system from crashes.   By far the worst crashes the system had ever
had, had been inflicted, by the system, upon <EM>itself.</EM>  And this time
nobody was making cocksure statements that this was an anomaly,
something that would never happen again.   By 1991 the System's
defenders had met their nebulous Enemy, and the Enemy was -- the
System.

<TITLE>THE HACKER CRACKDOWN - Introduction</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="crack_2.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="crack_4.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="crack_toc.html#SEC3">Introduction</A></H1>
<P>
This is a book about cops, and  wild teenage whiz-kids, and
lawyers, and hairy-eyed anarchists, and industrial technicians, and hippies,
and high-tech millionaires, and game hobbyists, and computer security
experts, and Secret Service agents, and grifters, and thieves. This book is
about the electronic frontier of the 1990s. It concerns activities that take
place inside computers and over telephone lines.
<P>
A science fiction writer coined the useful term "cyberspace" in
1982.  But the territory in question, the electronic frontier, is about a
hundred and thirty years old. Cyberspace is the "place" where a telephone
conversation appears to occur.  Not inside your actual phone, the plastic
device on your desk.  Not inside the other person's phone, in some other
city.  <EM>The place between</EM> the phones.  The indefinite place <EM>out
there,</EM> where the two of you, two human beings, actually meet and communicate.
<P>
Although it is not exactly  "real," "cyberspace" is a genuine place.
Things happen there that have very  genuine consequences.  This "place" is
not "real," but it is serious, it is earnest.  Tens of thousands of people have
dedicated their lives to it, to the public service of public communication by
wire and electronics.
<P>
People have worked on this "frontier" for generations now.  Some
people became rich and famous from their efforts there.  Some just played
in it, as hobbyists.  Others soberly pondered it, and wrote about it, and
regulated it, and negotiated over it in international forums, and sued one
another about it, in gigantic, epic court battles that lasted for years.  And
almost since the beginning, some people have committed crimes in this
place.
<P>
But in the past twenty years, this electrical "space," which was
once thin and dark and one-dimensional -- little more than a narrow
speaking-tube, stretching from phone to phone -- has flung itself open like
a gigantic jack-in-the-box.  Light has flooded upon it, the eerie light of the
glowing computer screen.   This dark electric netherworld has become a
vast flowering electronic landscape.   Since the 1960s, the world of the
telephone has cross-bred itself with computers and television, and though
there is still no substance to cyberspace,  nothing you can handle, it has a
strange kind of physicality now.   It makes good sense today to talk of
cyberspace  as a place all its own.
<P>
Because people live in it now.   Not just a few people, not just a
few technicians and eccentrics, but thousands of people, quite normal
people.  And not just for a little while, either, but for hours straight, over
weeks, and  months, and years.   Cyberspace today is a "Net," a "Matrix,"
international in scope and growing swiftly and steadily. It's growing in
size, and wealth, and  political importance.
<P>
People are making entire careers in modern cyberspace.   Scientists
and technicians, of course; they've been there for twenty years now.  But
increasingly, cyberspace is filling with journalists and doctors and lawyers
and artists and clerks.   Civil servants make their careers there now,
"on-line" in vast government databanks; and so do spies, industrial, political,
and just plain snoops; and so do police, at least a few of them.  And there
are children living there now.
<P>
People have met there and been married there. There are entire
living communities in cyberspace today; chattering, gossipping, planning,
conferring and scheming,  leaving one another voice-mail and electronic
mail, giving one another big weightless chunks of valuable data,  both
legitimate and illegitimate.  They busily pass one another computer
software and the occasional festering computer virus.
<P>
We do not really understand how to live in cyberspace yet.  We are
feeling our way into it, blundering about.   That is not surprising.  Our
lives in the physical world, the "real" world, are also far from perfect,
despite a lot more practice.   Human lives, real lives,  are imperfect by
their nature, and there are human beings in cyberspace.  The way we live
in cyberspace is a funhouse mirror of the way we live in the real world.
We take both our advantages and our troubles with us.
<P>
This book is about trouble in cyberspace. Specifically, this book is
about certain strange events in the year 1990, an unprecedented and
startling year for the the growing world of computerized communications.
<P>
In 1990 there came a nationwide crackdown on illicit computer
hackers, with arrests, criminal charges,  one dramatic show-trial, several
guilty pleas,  and huge confiscations of data and equipment all over the
USA.
<P>
The Hacker Crackdown of 1990 was larger, better organized, more
deliberate, and more resolute than any previous effort in the brave new
world of computer crime. The U.S.  Secret Service, private telephone
security, and state and local law enforcement groups across the country all
joined forces in a determined attempt to break the back of America's
electronic underground.   It was a fascinating effort, with very mixed
results.
<P>
The Hacker Crackdown had another unprecedented effect; it
spurred the creation, within "the computer community," of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a new and very odd interest group, fiercely  dedicated
to the establishment and preservation of electronic civil liberties. The
crackdown, remarkable in itself, has created a melee of debate over
electronic crime, punishment, freedom of  the press,  and issues of search
and seizure.   Politics has entered cyberspace.   Where people go, politics
follow. This is the story of the people of cyberspace.

<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="crack_toc.html#SEC1">Preface to the Electronic Release</A></H1>
<P>
January 1, 1994 -- Austin, Texas
<P>
Hi, I'm Bruce Sterling, the author of this electronic book.
<P>
Out in the traditional world of print, <EM>The Hacker Crackdown</EM> is
ISBN 0-553-08058-X, and is formally catalogued by the Library of
Congress as "1. Computer crimes -- United States.  2. Telephone -- United
States -- Corrupt practices.  3.  Programming (Electronic computers) --
United States -- Corrupt practices."  'Corrupt practices,' I always get a kick
out of that description.  Librarians are very ingenious people.
<P>
The paperback is ISBN 0-553-56370-X.  If you go and buy a print
version of <EM>The Hacker Crackdown,</EM> an action I encourage heartily, you
may notice that in the front of the book,  beneath the copyright notice  --
"Copyright (C) 1992 by Bruce Sterling" -- it has this little block of printed
legal boilerplate from the publisher.  It says, and I quote:
<P>
"No part of this book may be reproduced or transmitted in any
form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopying,
recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without
permission in writing from the publisher. For information address:
Bantam Books."
<P>
This is a pretty good disclaimer, as such disclaimers go.  I collect
intellectual-property disclaimers, and I've seen dozens of them, and this
one is at least pretty straightforward.  In this narrow and particular case,
however, it isn't quite accurate. Bantam Books puts that disclaimer on
every book they publish, but Bantam Books does not, in fact, own the
electronic rights to this book.  I do, because of certain extensive contract
maneuverings my agent and I went through before this book was written.  I
want to give those electronic publishing rights away through certain
not-for-profit channels, and I've convinced Bantam that this is a good idea.
<P>
Since Bantam has seen fit to peacably agree to this scheme of
mine, Bantam Books is not going to fuss about this.  Provided you don't
try to sell the book, they are not going to bother you for what you do with
the electronic copy of this book. If you want to check this out personally,
you can ask them; they're at 1540 Broadway NY NY 10036.  However, if
you were so foolish as to print this book and start retailing it for money in
violation of my copyright and the commercial interests of Bantam Books,
then Bantam, a part of the gigantic Bertelsmann multinational publishing
combine, would roust some of their heavy-duty attorneys out of
hibernation and crush you like a bug.  This is only to be expected.  I didn't
write this book so that you could make money out of it.  If anybody is
gonna make money out of this book, it's gonna be me and my publisher.
<P>
My publisher deserves to make money out of this book.  Not only
did the folks at Bantam Books commission me to write the book, and pay
me a  hefty sum to do so, but they bravely printed, in text, an electronic
document the reproduction of which was once alleged to be a federal
felony.  Bantam Books and their numerous attorneys were very brave and
forthright about this book.  Furthermore, my former editor at Bantam
Books, Betsy Mitchell, genuinely cared about this project, and worked
hard on it, and had a lot of wise things to say about the manuscript.  Betsy
deserves genuine credit for this book, credit that editors too rarely get.
<P>
The critics were very kind to <EM>The Hacker Crackdown,</EM> and
commercially the book has done  well.  On the other hand, I didn't write
this book in order to squeeze every last nickel and dime out of the mitts of
impoverished sixteen-year-old cyberpunk high-school-students.  Teenagers
don't  have any money -- (no, not even enough for the  sixdollar <EM>Hacker
Crackdown</EM> paperback, with its attractive bright-red cover and useful
index).   That's a major reason why teenagers sometimes succumb to the
temptation to do things they shouldn't, such as swiping my books out of
libraries.   Kids:  this one is all yours, all right?  Go give the print version
back. <CODE>*8-)</CODE>
<P>
Well-meaning, public-spirited civil libertarians don't have much
money, either.   And it seems almost criminal to snatch cash out of the
hands of America's direly underpaid electronic law enforcement
community.
<P>
If you're a computer cop, a hacker, or an electronic civil liberties
activist, you are the target audience for this book.  I wrote this book
because I wanted to help you, and help other people understand you and
your unique, uhm, problems.  I wrote this book to aid your activities, and
to contribute to the public discussion of important political issues.  In
giving the text away in this fashion, I am directly contributing to the book's
ultimate aim:  to help civilize cyberspace.
<P>
Information <EM>wants</EM> to be free.  And  the information inside this
book longs for freedom with a peculiar intensity.  I genuinely believe that
the natural habitat of this book is inside an electronic network.  That may
not be the easiest direct method to generate revenue for the book's author,
but that  doesn't matter; this is where this book belongs by its nature.  I've
written other books -- plenty of other books -- and I'll write more and I am
writing more, but this one is special.  I am making <EM>The Hacker
Crackdown</EM> available electronically as widely as I can conveniently
manage, and if you like the book, and think it is useful, then I urge you to
do the same with it.
<P>
You can copy this electronic book.   Copy the heck out of it, be my
guest, and give those copies to anybody who wants them.  The nascent
world of cyberspace is full of sysadmins, teachers, trainers, cybrarians,
netgurus, and various species of  cybernetic activists.  If you're one of those
people,  I know about you, and I know the hassle you go through to try to
help people learn about the electronic frontier.  I hope that possessing this
book in electronic form will lessen your troubles.  Granted, this treatment
of our electronic social spectrum is not the ultimate in academic rigor.
And politically, it has something to offend and trouble almost everyone.
But hey, I'm told it's readable, and at least the price is right. You can
upload the book onto bulletin board systems, or Internet nodes, or
electronic discussion groups.  Go right ahead and do that, I am giving you
express permission right now.  Enjoy yourself.
<P>
You can put the book on disks and give the disks away, as long as
you don't take any money for it.
<P>
But this book is not public domain.  You can't copyright it in your
own name.   I own the copyright. Attempts to pirate this book and make
money from  selling it may involve you in a serious litigative snarl.
Believe me, for the pittance you might wring out of such an action, it's
really not worth it.  This book don't "belong" to you.  In an odd but very
genuine way, I feel it doesn't "belong" to me, either.  It's a book about the
people of cyberspace, and distributing it in this way is the best way I know
to actually make this information available, freely and easily, to all the
people of cyberspace -- including people far outside the borders of the
United States, who otherwise may never have a chance to see any edition
of the book, and who may perhaps learn something useful from this
strange story of distant, obscure, but portentous events in so-called
"American cyberspace."
<P>
This electronic book is now literary freeware.  It now belongs to
the emergent realm of alternative information economics.  You have no
right to make this electronic book part of the conventional flow of
commerce.  Let it be part of the flow of knowledge: there's a difference.
I've divided the book into four sections, so that it is less ungainly for
upload and download; if there's a section of particular relevance to you and
your colleagues, feel free to reproduce that one and skip the rest. Just make
more when you need them, and give them to whoever might want them.
<P>
Now have fun.

<DD>&quot;An Efficient Off-line Electronic Cash System
    Based on the Representation Problem&quot;, Stefan Brands, 1991. Technical
    paper; abstract (in part): &quot;We present a new off-line electronic cash
    system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which 
    little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first 
    to be based entirely on discrete logarithms. Using the represenation 
    problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us 
    to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut 
    and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash 
    system is much more efficient in both computation and communciation 
    complexity than previously proposed systems...Contrary to previously 
    proposed systems, [our system's] correctness can be mathematically 
    proven to a very great extent...Our system offers a number of 
    extensions that are hard to acheive in previously known systems...&quot;

    that previous systems. Instead of using many terms, each for a single bit
    of the challenge, our system uses a single term for a large number of 
    possible challenges. The withdrawal protocol does not use a 
    cut-and-choose methodology as with earlier systems, but uses a direct 
    construction.&quot; 1991. This is a gzip-compressed PostScript file.

<DT><a href="fake_pgp.pl"><B>fake_pgp.pl</B></a>
<DD>PERL script for generating PGP look-alike message.
    Completely fake, does not actually encrypt anything,
    and will not fool PGP. Why use this? Beats me.
<DT><a href="geopgp1.pl"><B>geopgp1.pl</B></a>
<DD>This is a PERL script that takes as input a PGP encrypted,
    ascii output file. It skips the headers and stuff, and
    converts every character in the body into a geographic name. 
    The author says: &quot;So maybe this can be used to mail other
    people lists of geographic names rather than encrypted
    messages since I've heard some networks frown upon encrypted
    mail :-)&quot;

    unless you wish to sit for many hours waiting for this
    keyfile to process, rename your keyring to pubtemp.pgp,
    rename this pubring.pgp, and add the contents of pubtemp.pgp
    to the new pubring.pgp, rather than adding this keyring to
    yours. Alternately, just keep it as a separate key ring,
    and use it when you need to.

    good key management options, comprehensive help system, etc. (Don't
    worry, a large proportion of this file's 600K+ file size is the
    included VRBRUN300.DLL file required by Molusc and many other Windows
    programs. Chances are you already have it. The application itself if

<DD>Stealth 1.0 is a simple filter for PGP which strips off all
    identifying header information to leave only the encrypted data in a
    format suitable for steganographic use. That is, the data can be hidden in
    images, audio files, text files, CAD files, and/or any other file type that
    may contain random data, then sent to another person who can retrieve the
    data from the file, attach headers, and PGP decrypt it. This does NOT

<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.

    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."

    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.

<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<strong>The First Wind: The One From Above</strong><p>

Chapter One<p>

This chapter tells how the supreme government was 
affected by the poverty of the Indigenous peoples 
of Chiapas and endowed the area with hotels, 
prisons, barracks, and a military airport. It 
also tells how the beast feeds on the blood of 
the people, as well as other miserable and 
unfortunate happenings.
<P>

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/todos-santos.gif" 
     ALIGN =  "left" WIDTH = "200">

Suppose that you live in the North, Center, or 
West of this country. Suppose that you heed the 
old SECOTUR (Department of Tourism) slogan, "Get 
to know Mexico first." Suppose that you decide to 
visit the Southeast of your country and that in 
the Southeast you choose to visit the state of 
Chiapas. Suppose that you drive there (getting 
there by airplane is not only expensive but 
unlikely, a mere fantasy: There are only two 
"civilian" airports and one military one). 
Suppose that you take the Transiste'mica Highway. 
Suppose that you pay no attention to the Army 
barracks located at Mati'as Romero and that you 
continue on to Ventosa. Suppose that you don't 
notice the Department of Government's immigration 
checkpoint near there (the checkpoint makes you 
think that you are leaving one country and 
entering another). Suppose that you decide to 
take a left and head towards Chiapas. Several 
kilometers further on you will leave the state of 
Oaxaca and you will see a big sign that reads, 
"WELCOME TO CHIAPAS." Have you found it? Good, 
suppose you have. You have entered by one of the 
three existing roads into Chiapas: The road into 
the northern part of the state, the road along 
the Pacific coast, and the road you entered by 
are the three ways to get to this Southeastern 
corner of the country by land. But the state's 
natural wealth doesn't leave only by way of these 
three roads. Chiapas loses blood through many 
veins: Through oil and gas ducts, electric lines, 
railways, through bank accounts, trucks, vans, 
boats and planes, through clandestine paths, 
gaps, and forest trails. This land continues to 
pay tribute to the imperialists: petroleum, 
electricity, cattle, money, coffee, banana, 
honey, corn, cacao, tobacco, sugar, soy, melon, 
sorghum, mamey, mango, tamarind, avocado, and 
Chiapaneco blood flows as a result of the 
thousand teeth sunk into the throat of the 
Mexican Southeast. These raw materials, thousands 
of millions of tons of them, flow to Mexican 
ports and railroads, air and truck transportation 
centers. From there they are sent to different 
parts of the world: The United States, Canada, 
Holland, Germany, Italy, Japan, but with the same 
fate--to feed imperialism. The fee that 
capitalism imposes on the Southeastern part of 
this country oozes, as it has since from the 
beginning, blood and mud.
<P>
A handful of businesses, one of which is the 
Mexican State, take all the wealth out of Chiapas 
and in exchange leave behind their mortal and 
pestilent mark: in 1989 these businesses took 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/mujeres-EZLN.gif"
     ALIGN =  "right" WIDTH = "200">

1,222,669,000,000 pesos from Chiapas and only 
left behind 616,340,000,000 pesos worth of credit 
and public works. More than 600,000,000,000 pesos 
went to the belly of the beast.
<P>
In Chiapas, Pemex [the national oil company] has 
86 teeth clenched in the townships of Estacio'n 
Jua'rez, Reforma, Ostuaca'n, Pichucalco, and 
Ocosingo. Every day they suck out 92,000 barrels 
of petroleum and 517,000,000,000 cubic feet of 
gas. They take away the petroleum and gas, and in 
exchange leave behind the mark of capitalism: 
ecological destruction, agricultural plunder, 
hyperinflation, alcoholism, prostitution, and 
poverty. The beast is still not satisfied and has 
extended its tentacles to the Lacandona jungle: 
eight petroleum deposits are under exploration. 
The paths are made with machetes by the same 
campesinos who are left without land by the 
insatiable beast. The trees fall and dynamite 
explodes on land where campesinos are not allowed 
to cut down trees to cultivate. Every tree that 
is cut down costs them a fine that is 10 times 
the minimum wage, and a jail sentence. The poor 
cannot cut down trees, but the petroleum beast 
can, a beast that every day falls more and more 
into foreign hands. The campesinos cut them down 
to survive, the beast to plunder.
<P>
Chiapas also bleeds coffee. Thirty-five percent 
of the coffee produced in Mexico comes from this 
area. The industry employs 87,000 people. Forty-
seven percent of the coffee is for national 
consumption and 53% is exported abroad, mainly to 
the United States and Europe. More than 100,000 
tons of coffee are taken from this state to 
fatten the beast's bank accounts: in 1988 a kilo 
of pergamino coffee was sold abroad for 8,000 
pesos. The Chiapaneco producers were paid 2,500 
pesos or less.
<P>
The second most important plunder, after coffee, 
is beef. Three million head of cattle wait for 
middle-men and a small group of businessmen to 
take them away to fill refrigerators in Arriaga, 
Villahermosa, and Mexico City. The cattle are 


<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/Carlos_Cisneros_golpeado_3.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "left" WIDTH = "200">

sold for 400 pesos per kilo by the poor farmers 
and resold by the middle-men and businessmen for 
up to ten times the price they paid for them.
<P>
The tribute that capitalism demands from Chiapas 
has no historical parallel. Fifty-five percent of 
national hydroelectric energy comes from this 
state, along with 20% of Mexico's total 
electricity. However, only a third of the homes 
in Chiapas have electricity. Where do the 12,907 
kilowatts produced annually by hydroelectric 
plants in Chiapas go?
<P>
In spite of the current trend toward ecological 
awareness, the plunder of wood continues in 
Chiapas's forests. Between 1981 and 1989, 
2,444,777 cubic meters of precious woods, 
conifers, and tropical trees were taken from 
Chiapas. They were taken to Mexico City, Puebla, 
Veracruz, and Quintana Roo. In 1988 wood exports 
brought a revenue of 23,900,000,000 pesos, 6,000% 
more than in 1980.
<P>
The honey that is produced in 79,000 beehives in 
Chiapas goes entirely to US and European markets. 
The 2,756 tons of honey produced annually in the 
Chiapaneco countryside is converted into dollars 
which the people of Chiapas never see.
<P>
Of the corn produced in Chiapas, more than half 
goes to the domestic market. Chiapas is one of 
the largest corn producers in the country. 
Sorghum grown in Chiapas goes to Tabasco. Ninety 
percent of the tamarind goes to Mexico City and 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/traslado-cadaveres.gif"
     ALIGN =  "left" WIDTH = "200">

other states. Two-thirds of the avocados and all 
of the mameys are sold outside of the state. 
Sixty-nine percent of the cacao goes to the 
national market, and 31% is exported to the US, 
Holland, Japan, and Italy. The majority of the 
bananas produced are exported.
<P>
What does the beast leave behind in exchange for 
all it takes away?
<P>
Chiapas has a total area of 75,634.4 square 
kilometers, some 7.5 million hectares. It is the 
eighth largest state and is divided into 111 
townships organized, for the purposes of looting, 
into nine economic regions. Forty percent of the 
nation's plant varieties, 36% of its mammal 
species, 34% of its reptiles and amphibians, 66% 
of its bird species, 20% of its fresh-water fish, 
and 80% of its butterfly species are found in 
Chiapas. Seven percent of the total national 
rainfall falls in Chiapas. But its greatest 
wealth is the 3.5 million people of Chiapas, two-
thirds of whom live and die in rural communities. 
Half of them don't have potable water and two-
thirds have no sewage service. Ninety percent of 
the rural population pay little or no taxes.
<P>
Communication in Chiapas is a grotesque joke for 
a state that produces petroleum, electricity, 
coffee, wood, and cattle for the hungry beast. 
Only two-thirds of the municipal seats have 
paved-road access. Twelve thousand communities 
have no other means of transport and 
communication than mountain trails. Since the 
days of Porfirio Di'az, the railroad lines have 
serviced capitalism rather than the people. The 
railroad line that follows the coast (there are 
only two lines: the other crosses the northern 
part of the state) dates back to the turn of the 
century, and its tonnage is limited by the old 
bridges that cross the canyons of the Southeast. 
The only port in Chiapas, Puerto Madero, is just 
one more way for the beast to extract the state's 
resources.
<P>
Education? The worst in the country. At the 
elementary school level, 72 out of every 100 
children don't finish the first grade. More than 
half of the schools only offer up to a third 
grade education and half of the schools only have 
one teacher for all the courses offered. There 
are statistics, although they are kept secret of 
course, that show that many Indigenous children 
are forced to drop out of school due to their 
families' need to incorporate them into the 
system of exploitation. In any Indigenous 
community it is common to see children carrying 
corn and wood, cooking, or washing clothes during 
school hours. Of the 16,058 classrooms in 1989, 
only 96 were in Indigenous zones.
<P>
Industry? Look, 40% of Chiapas's "industry" 
consists of Nixtamal mills, tortillas, and wood 
furniture mills. Large companies (petroleum and 
electricity), 0.2% of the total industry, belong 
to the Mexican government (and soon to 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/DIC_1.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "right" WIDTH = "200">

foreigners). Medium-sized industry, 0.4% of the 
total industry, is made up of sugar refineries 
and fish, seafood, flour, milk, and coffee 
processing plants. Of the state's industry, 94% 
of the area's industry is micro-industry.
<P>
The health conditions of the people of Chiapas 
are a clear example of the capitalist imprint: 
One-and-a-half million people have no medical 
services at their disposal. There are 0.2 clinics 
for every 1,000 inhabitants, one-fifth of the 
national average. There are 0.3 hospital beds for 
every 1,000 Chiapanecos, one third the amount in 
the rest of Mexico. There is one operating room 
per 100,000 inhabitants, one half of the amount 
in the rest of Mexico. There are 0.5 doctors and 
0.4 nurses per 1,000 people, one-half of the 
national average.
<P>
Health and nutrition go hand in hand in poverty. 
Fifty-four percent of the population of Chiapas 
suffer from malnutrition, and in the highlands 
and forest this percentage increases to 80%. A 
campesino's average diet consists of coffee, 
corn, tortillas, and beans.
<P>
This is what capitalism leaves as payment for 
everything that it takes away...
<P>
This part of the Mexican territory, which 
willingly annexed itself to the young independent 
republic in 1824, appeared in national geography 
when the petroleum boom reminded the country that 
there was a Southeast (82% of Pemex's 
petrochemical plants are in the Southeast; in 
1990 two-thirds of public investment in the 
Southeast was in energy). Chiapas's experience of 
exploitation goes back for centuries. In times 
past, wood, fruits, animals, and men went to the 
metropolis through the veins of exploitation, 
just as they do today. Like the banana republics, 
but at the peak of neoliberalism and "libertarian 
revolutions," the Southeast continues to export 
raw materials, just as it did 500 years ago. It 
continues to import capitalism's principal 
product: death and misery.
<P>
One million Indigenous people live in these lands 
and share a disorienting nightmare with mestizos 
and ladinos: their only option, 500 years after 
the "Meeting of Two Worlds," is to die of poverty 
or repression. The programs to improve the 
conditions of poverty, a small bit of social 
democracy which the Mexican state throws about 
and which, under the regime of Salinas de Gortari 
carries the name Pronasol, are a joke that brings 
bloody tears to those who live under the rain and 
sun.
<P>



<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/REVUELTA_3.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "left" WIDTH = "200">

Welcome! You have arrived in the poorest state in 
the country: Chiapas.
<P>
Suppose that you drive on to Ocosocoatla and from 
there down to Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state 
capital. You don't stay long. Tuxtla Gutierrez is 
only a large warehouse which stores products from 
other parts of the state. Here you find some of 
the wealth which will be sent to whatever 
destinations the capitalists decide. You don't 
stay long, you have just barely touched the lips 
of the wild beast's bloody jaws. You go on to 
Chiapas de Corzo without noticing the Nestle' 
factory that is there, and you begin to climb up 
into the mountains. What do you see? One thing is 
certain, you have entered another world, an 
Indigenous world. Another world, but the same as 
that in which millions of people in the rest of 
the country live.
<P>
Three hundred thousand Tzotziles, 120,000 Choles, 
90,000 Zoques, and 70,000 Tojolabales inhabit 
this Indigenous world. The supreme government 
recognizes that "only" half of these 1,000,000 
Indigenous people are illiterate.
<P>
Continue along the mountain road and you arrive 
in the region known as the Chiapaneco highlands. 
Here, more than 500 years ago, Indigenous people 
were the majority, masters and owners of land and 
water. Now they are only the majority in 
population and in poverty. Drive on until you 
reach San Cristo'bal de las Casas, which 100 
years ago was the state capital (disagreements 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/CNPI_11.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "right" WIDTH = "200">

among the bourgeoisie robbed it of the dubious 
honor of being the capital of the poorest state 
in Mexico). No, don't linger. If Tuxtla Gutierrez 
is a large warehouse, San Cristo'bal is a large 
market. From many different routes the Tzotziles, 
Tzeltales, Choles, Tojolabales, and Zoques bring 
the Indigenous tribute to capitalism. Each brings 
something different: wood, coffee, cloth, 
handicrafts, fruits, vegetables, corn. Everyone 
brings something: sickness, ignorance, jeers, and 
death. This is the poorest region of the poorest 
state in the country. Welcome to San Cristo'bal 
de las Casas, a "Colonial City" according to the 
history books, although the majority of the 
population is Indigenous. Welcome to Pronasol's 
huge market. Here you can buy or sell anything 
except Indigenous dignity. Here everything is 
expensive except death. But don't stay too long, 
continue along the road, the proud result of the 
tourist infrastructure. In 1988 there were 6,270 
hotel rooms, 139 restaurants, and 42 travel 
agencies in this state. This year, 1,058,098 
tourists visited Chiapas and left 250,000,000,000 
pesos in the hands of restaurant and hotel 
owners.
<P>
Have you calculated the numbers? Yes, you're 
right: there are seven hotel rooms for every 
1,000 tourists while there are only 0.3 hospital 
beds per 1,000 Chiapaneco citizens. Leave the 
calculations behind and drive on, noticing the 
three police officials in berets jogging along 
the shoulder of the road. Drive by the Public 
Security station and continue on passing hotels, 
restaurants, large stores and heading towards the 
exit to Comita'n. Leaving San Cristo'bal behind 
you will see the famous San Cristo'bal caves 
surrounded by leafy forest. Do you see the sign? 
No, you are not mistaken, this natural park is 
administered by...the Army! Without leaving your 
uncertainty behind, drive on...Do you see them? 
Modern buildings, nice homes, paved roads...Is it 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/REVUELTA_6.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "left" WIDTH = "200">

a university? Workers' housing? No, look at the 
sign next to the cannons closely and read: 
"General Army Barracks of the 31st Military 
Zone." With the olive-green image still in your 
eyes, drive on to the intersection and decide not 
to go to Comita'n so that you will avoid the pain 
of seeing that, a few meters ahead, on the hill 
that is called the Foreigner, North American 
military personnel are operating, and teaching 
their Mexican counterparts to operate radar. 
Decide that it is better to go to Ocosingo since 
ecology and all that nonsense is very 
fashionable. Look at the trees, breath 
deeply...Do you feel better? Yes? Then be sure to 
keep looking to your left, because if you don't 
you will see, seven kilometers ahead, another 
magnificent construction with the noble symbol of 
SOLIDARIDAD on the facade. Don't look. I tell 
you, look the other way. You don't notice that 
this new building is...a jail (evil tongues say 
that this is a benefit of Pronasol; now 
campesinos won't have to go all the way to Cerro 
Hueco, the prison in the state capital). No 
brother, don't lose heart, the worst is always 
hidden: Excessive poverty discourages tourism. 
Continue on, down to Huixta'n, up to Oxchuc, look 
at the beautiful waterfall where the Jatate 
river, whose waters cross the Lacandona Jungle, 
begins. Pass by Cuxulja and instead of following 
the detour to Altamirano drive on till you reach 
Ocosingo: "The Door to the Lacandona Jungle..."
<P>
Good, stay a while. Take a quick tour around the 
city... Principal points of interest? The two 
large constructions at the entrance to the city 
are brothels, next door is a jail, the building 
further beyond, a church, this other one is a 
beef-processing plant, that other one, Army 
barracks, over there is the court, the Municipal 
building, and way over there is Pemex. The rest 
are small piled-up houses which crumble when the 
huge Pemex trucks and ranch pick-up trucks pass 
by.
<P>
What does it look like? A Porfirista-type large-
landed estate? But that ended 75 years ago! No, 
don't follow the road that goes to San Quinti'n, 
in front of the Montes Azules Reserve. Don't go 
to where the Jatate and Perlas rivers join, don't 
go down there, don't walk for three eight-hour 
days, don't go to San Marti'n and see that it is 
a very poor and small community, don't approach 
that shed that is falling to pieces. What is it? 
A sometimes church, school, meeting room. Now it 
is a school. It is 11 a.m.. No, don't go closer, 
don't look in, don't look at the four groups of 
children riddled with tapeworms and lice, half-
naked, don't look at the four young Indigenous 
teachers who work for miserable pay for which 
they have to walk three days, the same three days 
that you just walked, to collect. Don't notice 
that the only division between the classrooms is 
a small hall. Up to what grade do they teach 
here? Third. No, don't look at the posters which 
are the only thing that the government has sent 
to these children. Don't look at them: They are 
posters about AIDS prevention.
<P>
Better for us to move on, let's return to the 
paved roads. Yes, I know that it is in bad 
condition. Let's leave Ocosingo, continue to 
admire the countryside... The owners? Yes, ranch 
owners. What is produced? Cattle, coffee, corn... 
Did you see the National Indigenous Institute? 
Yes, the one as you leave the city. Did you see 
those pickup trucks? They are given on credit to 
Indigenous campesinos. They only take unleaded 
gas because it's better for the environment... 
There is no unleaded gas in Ocosingo? Well, 
that's not a big thing... Yes, you are right, the 
government is worried about the campesinos. Of 
course evil tongues say that there are guerrillas 
in these mountains and that the government's 
financial aid is really to buy Indigenous 
people's loyalty, but these are rumors, surely 
they are just trying to undermine Pronasol... 
What? The Citizen's Defense Committee? Oh yes! It 
consists of a group of "heroic" ranchers, 
traders, and corrupt union bosses who organize 
small guards to threaten the people. No, I 
already told you that the Porfirista large-landed 
estate was done away with 75 years ago... It

would be better for us to move on...At the next 
intersection take a left. No, don't go towards 
Palenque. Let's go to Chilo'n... Pretty, no? Yes.
<P>
Yajalon...it's very modern, it even has a gas 
station... Look, there's a bank, the municipal 
building, the courthouse, over there the Army... 
It looks like another hacienda? Let's go and you 
won't see those other large, modern buildings on 
the outskirts of town, along the road to Tila and 
Sabanilla with their big beautiful SOLIDARIDAD 
signs, you won't see that it is...a jail.
<P>
Good, we have arrived at the intersection. Now to 
Ocosingo...Palenque? Are you sure? Okay, let's 
go. Yes, the countryside is beautiful. Are those 
ranches? You're correct: they produce cattle, 
coffee, wood. Look, we're already at Palenque. A 
quick tour of the city? Okay. Those are hotels, 
over there restaurants, the municipal building, 
the courthouse, those are the Army barracks, and 
over there... What? No, I already know what 
you're going to tell me... Don't say it... Tired? 
Okay, we'll stop for a bit. You don't want to see 
the pyramids? No? Okay. Xi'Nich? Ah...an 
Indigenous march. Yes, it's going to Mexico City. 
How far? 1,106 kilometers. Results? The 
government receives their petitions. Yes, that's 
all. Are you still tired? More? Let's wait... To 
Bonampak? The road is very bad. Okay, let's go. 
Yes, the panoramic route...This is the Federal 
Military Reserve, that other one belongs to the 
Navy, the one over there belongs to the 
Department of Government... Is it always like 
this? No, sometimes they top it off with a 
campesinos' protest march. Tired? Do you want to 
go back? Okay. Other places? Different places? In 
what country? Mexico? You will see the same. The 
colors will change, the languages, the 
countryside, the names, but the people, the 
exploitation, the poverty and death are the same. 
Just look closely in any state in the Republic. 
Well, good luck...And if you need a tourist guide 
please be sure to let me know. I'm at your 
service. Oh! One more thing. It will not always 
be this way. Another Mexico? No, the same...I am 
talking about something else, about other winds 
beginning to blow, as if another wind is picking 
up...

<P>
Chapter Two<P>

This chapter tells the story of the Governor, an 
apprentice to the viceroy, and his heroic fight 
against the progressive clergy and his adventures 
with the feudal cattle, coffee and business 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/REVUELTA_7.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "left" WIDTH = "200">

lords. It also tells other equally fantastic 
tales.
<P>
Once upon a time there was a viceroy made of 
chocolate with a peanut for a nose. The viceroy's 
apprentice, Governor Patrocinio Gonza'lez 
Garrido, in the manner of the old monarchs who 
were put in power by the Spanish crown during the 
Conquest, has re-organized the geography of 
Chiapas. The assignment of spaces to the urban 
and rural categories is a somewhat sophisticated 
exercise of power but when directed by Mr. 
Gonza'lez Garrido's denseness, it has reached 
exquisite levels of stupidity. The viceroy 
decided that cities with services and benefits 
should be for those who already have everything. 
And he decided, the viceroy that is, that the 
masses are fine out in the open, exposed to wind 
and rough weather, and that they only deserve 
space in the jails, which never cease to be 
uncomfortable. Because of this, the viceroy 
decided to construct jails in the outskirts of 
the cities so that the proximity of the 
undesirable and delinquent masses would not 
disturb the rich. Jails and Army barracks are the 
principal works promoted by this governor in 
Chiapas. His friendship with ranchers and 
powerful businessmen is a secret to no one. 
Neither is his animosity for the three dioceses 
which regulate the state's Catholic life. The 
Diocese of San Cristo'bal, headed by Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz, is a constant menace to Gonza'lez 
Garrido's reorganizing project. Hoping to 
modernize the absurd system of exploitation and 
extraction which prevails in Chiapas, Patrocinio 
Gonza'lez comes up against the stubbornness of 
religious and secular figures who support and 
preach Catholicism's option for the poor.
<P>
With the hypocritical applause of Aguirre Franco, 
the Bishop of Tuxtla Gutierrez, and the mute 
approval of the Bishop of Tapachula, Gonza'lez 
Garrido sustains and gives new life to the 
"heroic" conspiracies of ranchers and businessmen 
against the members of the Diocese of San 
Cristo'bal. "Don Samuel's teams," as they are 
called by some, are not made up of inexperienced 
believers: Before Patrocinio Gonza'lez Garrido 
had even dreamed of being state governor, the 
Diocese of San Cristo'bal de las Casas preached 
the right to freedom and justice. For one of the 
country's most backward bourgeoisie, the 
agricultural bourgeoisie, this could only mean 
one thing: rebellion. These rancher and business 
"patriots" and "believers" know how to prevent 
rebellion: the existence of privately financed, 
armed paramilitary groups trained by members of 
the Federal Army, Public Security police and 
state law is well known by the campesinos who 
suffer from their threats, torture and gunshots.
<P>
A few months ago, Father Joel Padro'n from the 
parish of Simojovel was arrested. Accused by the 
region's ranchers of initiating and taking part 
in land take-overs, Father Joel was arrested by 
state authorities and held in the Cerro Hueco 
Jail in the state capital. The mobilization of 
the members of the Diocese of San Cristo'bal 
(those of Tuxtla Gutierrez and Tapachula were 
conspicuous in their absence) and a federal 
compromise succeeded in obtaining the parish 
priest Padro'n's freedom.
<P>

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/palacio-municipal.gif"
     ALIGN =  "right" WIDTH = "200">

While thousands of campesinos marched in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez to demand Padro'n's freedom, ranchers 
in Ocosingo sent their paramilitary forces to 
clear out property-owning campesinos. Four 
hundred men, armed by the ranchers, destroyed and 
burned houses, beat Indigenous women and murdered 
a campesino, Juan, by shooting him in the face. 
After the expulsion, the paramilitary forces-
composed mostly of workers from local ranches and 
small-property owners proud of partaking in raids 
with the young ranchers-drove along the region's 
roads in pickup trucks provided by their masters. 
Ostentatiously displaying their arms, drunk and 
intoxicated, they shouted: "Ranchers are number 
one!" and warned everyone that it was only the 
beginning. Undaunted, municipal authorities in 
Ocosingo and soldiers stationed in the region 
looked passively on the gunmen's triumphant 
parade.
<P>
In Tuxtla Gutierrez, almost 10,000 campesinos 
marched in favor of Father Padro'n's release. In 
a corner of Ocosingo, Juan's widow buried her 
husband, victim of the proud ranchers. There was 
no march or protest petition for Juan's death. 
This is Chiapas.
<P>
Recently, Viceroy Gonza'lez Garrido was the 
protagonist of a new scandal, which was uncovered 
because the press reported the story. With the 
viceroy's approval, Ocosingo's feudal lords 
organized the Committee for Citizen Defense, a 
blatant attempt to institutionalize their neo-
Porfirista paramilitary forces that keep order in 
the countryside of Chiapas. Surely nothing would 
have happened had it not been for the discovery 
of a plot to assassinate the parish priest Pablo 
Ibarren and the nun Mari'a del Carmen, along with 
Samuel Ruiz, the Bishop of San Cristo'bal. The 
plot was reported by the honest Chiapaneco press, 
which even now exists, and reached national 
forums. There were retractions and denials; the 
viceroy declared that he maintains good relations 
with the Church and named a special committee to 
investigate the case. The investigation yielded 
no results, and the waters returned to their 
course.
<P>

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/REVUELTA_8.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "left" WIDTH = "200">

During the same days, government agencies made 
some horrifying statistics known: in Chiapas 
14,500 people die every year, the highest 
mortality rate in the country. The causes? 
Curable diseases such as respiratory infections, 
enteritis, parasites, amoebas, malaria, 
salmonella, scabies, dengue, pulmonary 
tuberculosis, trachoma, typhus, cholera and 
measles. Many say that the figure is actually 
over 15,000 because deaths in marginalized zones, 
the majority of the state, are not reported... 
During Patrocinio Gonza'lez Garrido's four-year 
term more than 60,000 Chiapanecos have died, most 
of them poor. The war against the people, 
directed by the viceroy and commanded by the 
feudal lords, consists of methods more subtle 
than bombardments. There is no mention in the 
press of this murderous plot which costs lives 
and land as in the days of the Conquest.
<P>
The Committee for Citizen Defense continues to 
carry out its proselytizing work, holding 
meetings to convince the rich and poor of the 
city of Ocosingo that they should organize and 
arm themselves so that the campesinos won't enter 
the city because they will destroy everything, 
without respecting the rich or the poor. The 
viceroy smiles with approval.

<P>
Chapter Three<P>

This chapter tells how the viceroy had a 
brilliant idea and put this idea into practice. 
It also tells how the Empire decreed the death of 
socialism, and then put itself to the task of 
carrying out this decree to the great joy of the 
powerful, the distress of the weak and the 
indifference of the majority. It tells of Zapata 
and how he is said to be still be alive. It also 
tells of other disconcerting events.
<P>
The viceroy is worried. The campesinos refuse to 
applaud the institutional pillage written into 
the new Article 27 of the Constitution. The 
viceroy is enraged. The poor aren't happy with 
being exploited. They refuse to humbly accept the 
charity that Pronasol spreads around the 
Chiapaneco countryside. The viceroy is desperate. 
He consults his advisors. His advisors tell him 
an old truth: Jails and military bases aren't 
enough to ensure continued domination. It is also 
necessary to control people's thoughts. The 
viceroy is disturbed. He paces his palace. Then 
he stops and smiles.
<P>
XEOCH: Rap and lies for the campesinos.
<P>
In Ocosingo and Palenque, Cancue and Chilo'n, 
Altamirano and Yajalo'n, the Indigenous people 
are celebrating. A new gift from the supreme 
government has made life a little happier for the 
peons, small landowners, landless campesinos and 
impoverished inhabitants of the ejidos. They have 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/REVUELTA_9.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "right" WIDTH = "200">

been given a local radio station that reaches the 
most isolated corners of eastern Chiapas. The 
station's programming is fitting: Marimbas and 
rap music proclaim the good news. The Chiapaneco 
countryside is being modernized. XEOCH transmits 
from the township of Ocosingo and can be found at 
600 Mhz AM from four in the morning till 10 at 
night. Its news shows abound with lies. They tell 
of the "disorientation" that "subversive" lay-
workers spread among the peasantry, the abundance 
of aid credits that are never received by the 
Indigenous communities, and the existence of 
public works that have never been built. The 
viceroy is also given time on the air so that he 
can remind the population with threats that not 
all is lies and rap music; there are also jails 
and military bases and a penal code which is the 
most repressive in the Republic. The penal code 
punishes any expression of discontent. The laws 
against demonstrations, rebellion, inciting to 
riot, etc., demonstrate that the viceroy is 
careful to maintain everything in order.
<P>
There isn't any reason to fight. Socialism has 
died. Long live conformity and reform and the 
modern world and capitalism and all of the 
cruelties that are associated with them! The 
viceroy and the feudal lords dance and smile 
euphorically in their palaces. Their joy is 
disconcerting for the few free-thinkers who live 
in the area. Even they are incapable of 
understanding. They are without hope. It is true 
that one must fight, but the balance of forces 
isn't favorable, now isn't the time. We must wait 
longer, maybe years. We must be alert against the 
adventurers. We must make sure that nothing 
happens in the cities or in the countryside, that 
everything continues as always. Socialism has 
died. Long live capitalism! Radio, the print 
media, and television proclaim it. It is repeated 
by some ex-socialists who are now sensationally 
changed.
<P>
Not everyone hears the voices of hopelessness and 
conformity. Not everyone is carried away by 
hopelessness. There are millions of people who 
continue on without hearing the voices of the 
powerful and the indifferent. They can't hear; 
they are deafened by the crying and blood that 
death and poverty are shouting in their ears. 
But, when there is a moment of rest, they hear 
another voice. They don't hear the voice that 
comes from above; they hear the voice that is 
carried to them by the wind from below, a voice 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/COLON3.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "right" WIDTH = "200">

that is born in the Indigenous heart of the 
mountains. This voice speaks to them about 
justice and freedom, it speaks to them about 
socialism, about hope...the only hope that exists 
in the world. The oldest of the old in the 
Indigenous communities say that there once was a 
man named Zapata who rose up with his people and 
sang out, "Land and Freedom!" These old 
campesinos say that Zapata didn't die, that he 
must return. These old campesinos also say that 
the wind and the rain and the sun tell the 
campesinos when to cultivate the land, when to 
plant and when to harvest. They say that hope is 
also planted and harvested. They also say that 
the wind and the rain and the sun are now saying 
something different: that with so much poverty, 
the time has come to harvest rebellion instead of 
death. That is what the old campesinos say. The 
powerful don't hear; they can't hear, they are 
deafened by the brutality that the Empire shouts 
in their ears. "Zapata," insists the wind, the 
wind from below, our wind.
<P>


<strong>The Second Wind: The Wind From Below</strong><P>


Chapter Four<P>

This chapter tells how dignity and defiance 
joined hands in the Southeast, and how Jacinto 
Pe'rez's phantoms run through the Chiapaneco 
highlands. It also tells of a patience that has 
run out and of other happenings which have been 
ignored but have major consequences.
<P>
These people were born dignified and rebellious, 
brothers and sisters to the rest of Mexico's 
exploited people. They are not just the product 
of the Annexation Act of 1824, but of a long 
chain of ignominious acts and rebellions. From 
the time when cassock and armor conquered this 
land, dignity and defiance have lived and spread 
under these rains.
<P>
Collective work, democratic thinking, and 
subjection to the decisions of the majority are 
more than just traditions in Indigenous zones. 
They have been the only means of survival, 
resistance, dignity, and defiance. These "evil 
ideas," as they are seen by landholders and 
businessmen, go against the capitalist precept of 
"a lot in the hands of a few."
<P>
It has mistakenly been said that the Chiapas 
rebellion has no counterpart, that it is outside 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/Sub_Marcos.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "left" WIDTH = "200">

the national experience. This is a lie. The 
exploited Chiapaneco's specialty is the same as 
that of exploited people from Durango, Veracruz, 
or the plateau of northern Mexico: to fight and 
to lose. If the voices of those who write history 
speak excessively, it is because the voice of the 
oppressed does not speak...yet. There is no 
historic, national, or regional calendar that has 
documented each and every rebellion against this 
system that is imposed and maintained with blood 
and fire throughout the national territory. In 
Chiapas, this rebel voice is only heard when it 
shakes the world of the landowners and 
businesspeople. Indeed, the phantom of Indigenous 
barbarism strikes government-building walls and 
gains access with the help of revolution, 
trickery, and threats. If the rebellion in the 
Southeast loses, as the rebellions lost in the 
North, Center, and West, it is not the result of 
bad timing, it is because wind is the fruit of 
the land; it comes in time and ripens in the 
breasts of those who have nothing but dignity and 
rebelliousness. And this wind from below, that of 
rebellion and dignity, is not just an answer to 
the wind from above. It is not just an angry 
response or the destruction of an unjust and 
arbitrary system. Rather it carries with it a new 
proposal, a hope of converting rebellion and 
dignity into freedom and dignity.
<P>
How will this new voice make itself heard in 
these lands and across the country? How will this 
hidden wind blow, this wind which now blows only 
in the mountains and canyons without yet 
descending to the valleys where money rules and 
lies govern? This wind will come from the 
mountains. It is already being born under the 
trees and is conspiring for a new world, so new 
that it is barely an intuition in the collective 
heart that inspires it...
<P>

Chapter Five
<P>
This chapter tells how the dignity of the 
Indigenous people tried to make itself heard, but 
its voice only lasted a little while. It also 
tell how voices that spoke before are speaking 
again today and that the Indians are walking 
forward once again but this time with firm 
footsteps. They are walking together with other 
dispossessed peoples to take what belongs to 
them. The music of death that now plays only for 
those who have nothing will now play for 
everyone. It also tells of other frightful things 
which have happened and, they say, must happen.
<P>
The Indigenous march to Xi'Nich, composed of 
campesinos from Palenque, Ocosingo, and Salto de 
Agua, demonstrates the system's absurdity. These 
Indigenous people had to walk 1,106 kilometers to 
make themselves heard. They had to go to the 
capital of the Republic in order for the central 
power to arrange a meeting with the viceroy. They 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/enfrentamiento_3.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "right" WIDTH = "200">

arrived in Mexico City when capitalism was 
painting a frightful tragedy across the skies of 
Jalisco. They arrived at the capital of old New 
Spain, now Mexico, exactly 500 years after the 
foreign nightmare imposed itself in the night of 
this land. They arrived and all the honest and 
noble people, of which there are still some, 
listened to them and the voices that oppress them 
today in the Southeast, North, Center and West of 
the country also listened to them. They walked 
back, another 1,106 kilometers, their bags filled 
with promises. Again, nothing came of it....
<P>
In the municipal seat of Simojovel campesinos 
belonging to the CIOAC organization were attacked 
by people paid by local ranchers. The campesinos 
in Simojovel have decided to stop being silent 
and to respond to the ranchers threats. 
Campesinos surround the municipal seat. Nothing 
and no one enters or leaves without their 
consent. The Federal Army withdraws to its 
barracks, the police retreat, and the state's 
feudal lords demand arms in an attempt to restore 
order and respect. Negotiating commissions come 
and go. The conflict appears to have resolved 
itself. But the causes persist. With the same 
outward appearances everything returns to calm.
<P>
In the town of Betania, in the outskirts of San 
Cristo'bal de las Casas, Indigenous people are 
regularly detained and harassed by judicial 
agents for cutting firewood for their homes. The 
judicial agents say that they are only doing this 
to protect the environment. The Indigenous people 
decide to stop being silent and kidnap three 
judicial officials. They take the Panamerican 
highway and cut off communications to the east of 
San Cristo'bal. At the intersection between 
Ocosingo and Comita'n, campesinos are holding the 
judiciaries and they demand to speak to the 
viceroy before they will agree to unblock the 
road. Business comes to a halt, tourism 
collapses. Negotiating commissions come and go. 
The conflict appears to resolve itself but the 
causes persist. With the same outward 

<IMG SRC = "/~erict/Graphics/Struggle/Chiapas/Carlos_Cisneros_golpeado_1.jpg"
     ALIGN =  "right" WIDTH = "200">

appearances, everything returns to calm.
<P>
In Marque's de Comillas, in the township of 
Ocosingo, campesinos cut wood to survive. The 
judicial officials arrest them and confiscate the 
wood for their commander. The Indigenous people 
decide to stop being silent and they take the 
agents' vehicles and kidnap the agents. The 
Governor sends Public Security police who are 
kidnapped in the same way. The Indigenous people 
hold on to the trucks, the wood and the 
prisoners. They let the prisoners go. There is no 
response. They march to Palenque to demand 
solutions and the Army oppresses them and kidnaps 
their leaders. They hold on to the vehicles. 
Negotiating commissions come and go. The 
government lets the leaders go, the campesinos 
return the vehicles. The conflict appears to 
resolve itself but the causes persist. With the 
same outward appearance everything returns to 
calm.
<P>
In the municipal seat of Ocosingo, 4,000 
Indigenous campesinos from the organization 
ANCIEZ march from different points of the city. 
Three marches converge in front of the Municipal 
building. The municipal president doesn't know 
what it's all about and flees. On the floor of 
his office is a calendar indicating the date: 
April 10, 1992. Outside Indigenous campesinos 
from Ocosingo, Oxchuc, Huixta'n, Chilo'n, 
Yajalon, Sabanilla, Salto de Agua, Palenque, 
Altamirano, Margaritas, San Cristo'bal, San 
Andre's and Cancuc dance in front of a giant 
image of Zapata painted by one of them, recite 
poetry, sing, and speak. Only they are listening. 
The landowners, businessmen, and judicial 
officials are closed up in their homes and shops, 
the federal garrison appears deserted. The 
campesinos shout that Zapata lives and the 
struggle continues. One of them reads a letter 
addressed to Carlos Salinas de Gortari [President 
of Mexico, 1988--present] in which they accuse 
him of having brought all of the Agrarian Reform 
gains made under Zapata to an end, of selling the 
country with the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and of bringing Mexico back to the 
times of Porfirio Di'az. They declare forcefully 
that they will not recognize Salinas' reforms to 
Article 27 of the Political Constitution. At two 
o'clock in the afternoon the demonstration 
disperses, in apparent order, but the causes 
persist. With the same outward appearances 
everything returns to calm.
<P>
Abasolo is an ejido in the township of Ocosingo. 
For years, campesinos took land that legally 
belonged to them. Three of this community's 
leaders have been put in jail and tortured by the 
Governor. The Indigenous people decide to stop 
being silent and they take the San Cristo'bal-
Ocosingo highway. Negotiating commissions come 
and go. The leaders are freed. The conflict 
appears to resolve itself but the causes persist. 
With the same outward appearance everything 
returns to calm.
<P>
Antonio dreams of owning the land he works on, he 
dreams that his sweat is paid for with justice 
and truth, he dreams that there is a school to 
cure ignorance and medicine to scare away death, 
he dreams of having electricity in his home and 
that his table is full, he dreams that his 
country is free and that this is the result of 
its people governing themselves, and he dreams 
that he is at peace with himself and with the 
world. He dreams that he must fight to obtain 
this dream, he dreams that there must be death in 
order to gain life. Antonio dreams and then he 
awakens... Now he knows what to do and he sees 
his wife crouching by the fire, hears his son 
crying. He looks at the sun rising in the East, 
and, smiling, grabs his machete.
<P>
The wind picks up, he rises and walks to meet 
others. Something has told him that his dream is 
that of many and he goes to find them.
<P>
The viceroy dreams that his land is agitated by a 
terrible wind that rouses everything, he dreams 
that all he has stolen is taken from him, that 
his house is destroyed, and that his reign is 
brought down. He dreams and he doesn't sleep. The 
viceroy goes to the feudal lords and they tell 
him that they have been having the same dream. 
The viceroy cannot rest. So he goes to his doctor 
and together they decide that it is some sort of 
Indian witchcraft and that they will only be 
freed from this dream with blood. The viceroy 
orders killings and kidnappings and he builds 
more jails and Army barracks. But the dream 
continues and keeps him tossing and turning and 
unable to sleep.
<P>
Everyone is dreaming in this country. Now it is 
time to wake up...
<P>
The storm is here. From the clash of these two 
winds the storm will be born, its time has 
arrived. Now the wind from above rules, but the 
wind from below is coming...
<P>
The prophecy is here. When the storm calms, when 
rain and fire again leave the country in peace, 
the world will no longer be the world but 
something better.

  These documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act
  by EFF Board member John Gilmore, through his lawyer, Lee Tien.
  Each document was scanned in, then proofread for obvious mistakes.
<P>
  Footnotes were used in many documents; as a rule, the general
  format of the page was kept, and footnotes are indicated by the note
  number in brackets, i.e. [n.1].  The text of each footnote appears at
  the bottom of the page, separated by a short line of "=" signs.
<P>
  Section symbols were replaced by a "s.".  If a document was signed,
  the signature is indicated by (signed:) followed by the name of the
  person signing the document.  If there is no "(signed)", the document
  was not signed.  Anything not in the original text is bracketed.<P>

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.

<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<CENTER><H2>Database Experience</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

While at the National Center for Human Genome Research (NCHGR) I built 
several database to HTML gateways using Sybase 11 and websql/Perl.

<P>

The <A HREF = "http://www.nchgr.nih.gov/Intramural_research/Lab_transfer/Bic/"
TARGET = "Resource Window">Breast 
Cancer Information Core's</A> (BIC) online BRCA1 Mutation database 
is used by genetic researchers tracking mutations on the BRCA1 Gene in a 
shared environment.  Scientists submit updated records to the BIC 
committee which reviews for validity and, if appropriate, modifies the 
database with a point-and-click style web interface.  The updated 
information is then immediately available to all other BIC members who 
can search the database by keyword.  The CGI/Sybase will return 
search hits as well as various statistical calculations generated 
on-the-fly based on the data returned in the search.  <B>The implementation 
and presentation of the BIC database has won several Scientific Awards 
and has been reviewed in both <U><A HREF = "science.html">Science</A></U> 
and <U>Nature</U> Magazine.</B>

<P>

Another SYBASE-to-HTML gateway involves the NCHGR Seminar Manager which 
allows groupware scheduling of events related to NCHGR.  Authorized users 
can access the seminar database to find the most recent lists of events 
sorted by date.  Events may be added, modified or deleted according to user 
and group permissions, and all modifications are logged for retrospective 
verification.  Finally, when events pass, they are automatically removed 
from the database.

<P>

I also converted the PLS formatted CHID database to Sybase and created 
a web based frontend for keyword searching.  Because of the size of the 
possible returned rows, I also implemented logic to return only a limited 
number of rows, but to keep a memory so that the client could click for 
the next set, until done.

<P>

Finally, I developed a set of CGI-Internet Database management programs 
which could be implemented outside of a server based authentication 
system.  Though not as robust as commercial SQL databases, these have 
worked well on virtual servers and peronal homepages.  As with all my 
scripting work, these scripts have been made freely available at <A HREF 
= "http://www.eff.org/~erict/Scripts" TARGET = "Resource Window">Selena 
Sol's Public Domain Script Archive</A>

    case. 'Lectric Law Library operator, Jeff Liebling, sued
    Interlaw Ltd. (interlaw.com) to protect LLL's similar interlaw.com

<DD>InterNIC (the primary US, and to a certain
    extent global, domain name issuing agency) mid-'96 2nd revision of
    domain name dispute policy (includes summary of changes). InterNIC
    (particularly, NSI, the part of InterNIC that handles domain names)
    is attempting to shift legal responsibility away from itself, by moving
    to a system in which they deal with domain name disputes as they are
    resolved in the courts, rather than trying to resolve them internally.
    Policy goes into effect Sept. 9, 1996. It remains to be seen if the
    policy change will solve any of the root problems, or simply shift the 
    venue to the courts.

<DD>Aug. 96 draft policy of the Internet
    Assigned Numbers Authority, breaking up the InterNIC monopoly on 
    non-geographic Internet domain names, and establishing multiple 
    registries. This should go a long way to avoiding future Internet 
    domain name disputes, as any Foo Inc. company that wants a foo.com domain
    will now have the option of getting a foo.inc or foo.biz domain name
    instead of suing the present holder of foo.com and trying to take that
    domain away from them.

<DD>Paper, &quot;Do You Own Your Own Name in 
    CyberSpace?&quot;, By Mark F. Radcliffe of Gray Cary Ware &amp; Freidenrich. Dec. 
    27, 1995. An overview of InterNIC's domain name policies, and the 
    disputes that are arising under them. (Redistributed with permission of
    GCW&amp;F.)
<DT><a href="9510_internic_domain.policy"><B>9510_internic_domain.policy</B></a>
<DD>InterNIC (the primary US, and to a certain 
    extent global, domain name issuing agency) late-'95 revised policy on 
    domain names and disputes arising therefrom. Widely criticized as too
    little too late.
<DT><a href="9507_internic_domain.policy"><B>9507_internic_domain.policy</B></a>
<DD>InterNIC (the primary US, and to a certain
    extent global, domain name issuing agency) old (mid-'95) policy on
    domain names and disputes arising therefrom. This policy has been 
    replaced by a newer one, that is arguably far worse for everyone, and has
    already generated at least 5 lawsuits.
<DT><a href="950728_internic_trademark.statement"><B>950728_internic_trademark.statement</B></a>
<DD>Statement by InterNIC that trademark
    registrations are unnecessary for domain names. Despite this public
    statement, InterNIC does in fact require trademarks for domain names,
    if those names are disputed. Whoever has the trademark wins, essentially.
<DT><a href="internic_domain_fee.faq"><B>internic_domain_fee.faq</B></a>
<DD>InterNIC (the primary US, and to a certain

<DD>InterNIC (the primary US, and to a certain
    extent global, domain name issuing agency) policy on fees for 
    registering and keeping domain names.
<DT><a href="pto_domain.statement"><B>pto_domain.statement</B></a>
<DD>Statement from the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office.
    &quot;With the recent publication of the Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI)
    Domain Dispute Resolution Policy Statement, the number of applications
    for domain names in the USPTO has greatly increased since the Policy
    Statement refers specifically to the benefits arising from having a
    registered trademark or service mark. The PTO is developing policy for
    handling this new breed of mark...&quot;

    Knowledgenet Inc. in 1994 sued NSI (InterNIC) for issuing the
    knowledgenet.com domain name, David L. Boone, for having the domain, and
    Boone's Internet access provider.
<DT><a href="MTV_v_Curry/"><B>MTV_v_Curry/</B></A>
<DD>Directory of info on the MTV v. Adam Curry domain name
    dispute. Music TeleVision sued former employee Adam Curry over his use
    of the mtv.com domain name, claiming trademark violation. Curry had
    registered mtv.com himself, while an MTV employee, after MTV declined to
    do so itself. After leaving the company, Curry put the domain name to
    non-MTV uses. MTV's case was fairly good - Curry was providing
    entertainment-related info, and as such was arguably competing with MTV.
    Had Curry been doing anything else with the name, MTV's case would
    probably have failed. MTV and Curry settled, and Curry now uses the
    curry.com domain name, while MTV has taken over mtv.com. This case
    was arguably the first prominent domain name dispute, and opened the
    entire question of whether or not a domain name is intellectual property,
    and in what sense. In Curry's case, the answer leaned toward it
    being property in the trademark sense, just like a name on a product.
    Subsequent cases are pushing in the opposite direction, trying to
    establish domain names as property that benefits the holder (and ergo
    cannot be taken without cause and recompense).

    wwire.net, wwire.com, and womenswire.com amother others), an online
    service. Wired Mag sent legal threats to WWire, claiming that the
    wire.net domain name infringed their trademark. The dispute was settled
    at least fairly amicably before any legal action ensued, with WWire
    acceding to the magazine's demands.

<DD>&quot;The Unscrupulous Diner's Dilemma and

    ultimate implication, I believe, is that to achieve a civilized form
    of cyberspace, we have to limit the use of anonymous communications.
    Many early citizens of cyberspace will bitterly oppose any such
    development, arguing that anonymous and pseudonymous electronic
    communications are vital to preserve electronic freedoms and allow free
    expression of human personality. But the problem with that view is that
    we all collectively face the diners' dilemma -- we must collaborate in
    groups to build a rich social fabric, and we know that the ability to
    act anonymously, sporadically, in large groups brings out the worst in
    human character.&quot; One of Mr. Johnson's more controversial pieces.

<DD>&quot;An Efficient Off-line Electronic Cash System
    Based on the Representation Problem&quot;, Stefan Brands, 1991. Technical
    paper; abstract (in part): &quot;We present a new off-line electronic cash
    system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which 
    little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first 
    to be based entirely on discrete logarithms. Using the represenation 
    problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us 
    to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut 
    and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash 
    system is much more efficient in both computation and communciation 
    complexity than previously proposed systems...Contrary to previously 
    proposed systems, [our system's] correctness can be mathematically 
    proven to a very great extent...Our system offers a number of 
    extensions that are hard to acheive in previously known systems...&quot;

    off-line electronic coins that is both far more efficient and much simpler
    that previous systems. Instead of using many terms, each for a single bit
    of the challenge, our system uses a single term for a large number of 
    possible challenges. The withdrawal protocol does not use a 
    cut-and-choose methodology as with earlier systems, but uses a direct 
    construction.&quot; 1991. This is a gzip-compressed PostScript file.

<DD>File containing NIST's August 1991 notice requesting 
    comments on a proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for
    Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This proposed standard
    specifies a public- key based digital signature algorithm (DSA)
    appropriate for Federal digital signature applications. The proposed
    DSS uses a public key to verify to a recipient the integrity of data and
    the identity of the sender of the data. The DSS can also be used by a
    third party to ascertain the authenticity of a signature and the data
    associated with it. 
<DT><a href="fips_dss_proposed.standard"><B>fips_dss_proposed.standard</B></a>
<DD>File containing August 1991 announcement by 
    NIST of the proposed Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This standard 
    specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which can be used to 
    generate a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect 
    unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of 
    the user who generates the signature. In addition, the recipient of 
    signed data can use a digital signature in proving to a third party that 
    the signature was in fact generated by the signer of the data. This is 
    known as nonrepudiation since the signer of data cannot, at a later time, 
    repudiate the signature.

  These documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act
  by EFF Board member John Gilmore, through his lawyer, Lee Tien.
  Each document was scanned in, then proofread for obvious mistakes.
<P>
  Footnotes were used in many documents; as a rule, the general
  format of the page was kept, and footnotes are indicated by the note
  number in brackets, i.e. [n.1].  The text of each footnote appears at
  the bottom of the page, separated by a short line of "=" signs.
<P>
  Section symbols were replaced by a "s.".  If a document was signed,
  the signature is indicated by (signed:) followed by the name of the
  person signing the document.  If there is no "(signed)", the document
  was not signed.  Anything not in the original text is bracketed.<P>

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<DD>Cisco Systems press release announcing
    release of new version of ISAKMP+Oakely Internet key management daemon.
    The &quot;Internet Security Association &amp; Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)&quot; 
    is a leading proposal within the IETF to provide standard key 
    management for Internet protocols, including IP Security (IPsec) and 
    also for other network layers such as Transport-Layer Security (TLS). 
    ISAKMP provides a scalable, flexible, and secure mechanism for 
    establishing Security Associations among a set of communicating 
    network parties. The &quot;Oakley Session Key Exchange (Oakley)&quot; provides 
    a hybrid Diffie-Hellman session key exchange for use within the 
    ISAKMP framework. Oakley provides the important property of 
    &quot;Perfect Forward Secrecy&quot;, among other attributes.

Network Operator Designation for telecommuncations and cable television
services<p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

1. The objective of the New Zealand Government is efficient markets in
telecommunications goods and services. To this end, the Government has
adopted policies and promoted statutory measures to facilitate
competitive entry into those markets and to maintain the conditions
for effective competition trading.<P>

2. In deregulating telecommunications the Government was concerned that
all operators of a network should have the same rights of access to
land resources to lay lines or cables. A statutory process was enacted
to enable all operators, where necessary, to be declared a network
operator and to enjoy special rights of access. This provision was
later extended to operators of a cable broadcasting service.<P>

3. This leaflet outlines the process of network operator
designation. It is issued for information purposes, and is not a
substitute for reference to the precise wording of the relevant
statutes or for professional legal advice. <P>

<h4>Legislation</h4>

4. The relevant legislation for designation as a network operator is
section 2A of the Telecommunications Act 1987 as amended by section 4
of the Telecommunications Amendment Act 1988, and further amended by
section 86(2) of the Broadcasting Act 1989. This last amendment
extended the scope of the designation to include providers of
facilities for cable broadcasting. <P>

5. The purpose of an Order in Council declaring a person to be a
network operator "is to facilitate entry into and competition in
telecommunications markets", (Section 2A(l) of the Telecommunications
Act 1987, as amended). Later this provision was extended to cover
persons providing broadcasting services by cable.<P>

6. The most important statutory privilege provided by network operator
status is the special rights of access to land, and in particular the
road reserve, to lay or construct lines where this is required to
commence and carry on a telecommunications business, or a cable
broadcasting business. To gain these rights a prospective network
operator has to apply to the Minister of Communications making a case
in terms of section 2A(2) of the Act. Section 2A(2) reads as
follows:<P>

<hr>

Where the Minister is satisfied that declaration is necessary to
enable a person to commence or carry on a business of providing<P>

(a) facilities for telecommunications between 10 or more other
persons, being facilities enabling at least 10 of those persons to
communicate with each other; or<P>

(b) Facilities for broadcasting to 500 or more other persons, being
facilities that enable programmes to be transmitted along a line or
lines to each of those persons,<P>

the Minister shall make a recommendation under subsection (3) of this
section.<P>
<hr>

8. If the Minister is satisfied that the application meets the criteria
specified in the Act, a recommendation is made to the Governor
general, for an Order in Council, declaring the applicant to be a
network operator. The Order in Council is published in the Gazette.<P>

9. Subsection (4) of the Act provides that where the Minister is
satisfied that a network operator has ceased to provide facilities for
telecommunications or cable broadcasting, the Minister shall make a
recommendation under subsection (5) of section 2A of the
Telecommunications Act. Under subsection (5) the Governor General may
from time to time, on the recommendation of the Minister, by Order in
Council published in the Gazette, revoke a declaration made under
subsection (3).<P>

10. Under the Telecommunications Amendment Act 1987 (as amended by the
Telecommunications Act 1988) the term network operator is used in the
following sections: <P>
<UL>
<LI>relating to the protection of networks from the connection of
unauthorised equipment (section 6) and the rights to seek damages
(section 20D) or injunctions (section 20C) in the event of the
contravention of section 6.

<LI>relating to the admissibility of evidence (telegrams, telexes and
toll calls) (section 9).

<LI>relating to the rights:
 <UL>
 <LI> of entry to any land to construct lines (section ll): ie to appeal
to a district Court in the event of unreasonable refusal by a
landowner to negotiate terms and conditions for entry;

 <LI> of entry with respect to existing lines and existing works (section
12); to remove trees (sections 13 and 14); to construct or repair
lines on roads (section 15);

 <LI> to request payment for altering lines or works on a road (section
16);

 <LI> to construct and maintain telephone cabinets, etc on roads (section
18).
 </UL>
</UL>

<H4>Matters relating to the foregoing</h4>

Monitoring for the purpose of maintaining telecommunications (section
10); avoiding interference with public traffic (section 17);
compensation for injurious affection (section l9); protection of title
to lines and works (section 20).<P>

11. Network operator status is not a prerequisite to providing either
telecommunications or cable broadcasting services; that is, these
services can be provided without declaration as a network operator. A
person contemplating entering the telecommunications or cable
television markets, therefore, is able to provide its services without
network operator status but, should it find it necessary to have the
special rights of access to land that network operator status
provides, it may apply to the Minister making its case in terms of
section 2A(2) of the Act. Declaration as a network operator does not
imply Government endorsement of the company's business proposal.<P>

12. Before making a recommendation under section 2A(2) the Minister
must be satisfied that network operator status is necessary. In this
regard, the Minister must be satisfied that without the declaration
granting network operator status the proposal would not
proceed. Further, the Minister must be satisfied that the applicant's
proposal will in fact place it in the business of providing the
facilities contemplated in section 2A(2). <P>

<h4>Applications</h4>

13. The processing of applications for designation as a network
operator is managed by the Telecommunications Section of the
Communications Division, Ministry of Commerce, who advise the Minister
of Communications. <P>

14. The Ministry is willing to answer any questions or to meet with
prospective applicants. Inquiries about the process should be directed
to <P>

               The Manager <BR>
               Telecommunications Policy<BR>

               Facsimile:   (04) 499 0797<P>

15. To assist the processing of applications, it is suggested that
applications include:
<UL>
<LI>details of the actual business to be provided, including anticipated
customer levels;

<LI>a copy or details of the company's business plan, showing how the
business development is to proceed;

<LI>details of costings and financial planning regarding the development
and implementation of the proposal;

<LI>details of geographic areas in which cable laying will be necessary,
and the number of customers that will be reached by that cable.
</UL>

16. The Minister should also be assured that any application for
network operator is substantial. To this end any application should
also include:
<UL>
<LI>a copy of the company's certificate of incorporation, (this is
essential to establish that the company is a legal entity);

<LI>a list of the company's managers, directors, and major shareholders;
and a brief company history.
</UL>

17. Assuming the information provided is complete, the Ministry of
Commerce will prepare a report to the Minister. If the Minister is
satisfied that it is necessary for the applicant to be designated a
network operator, the Minister is required to recommend that the
Governor General, by Order in Council published in the Gazette,
declare the applicant to be a network operator for the purposes of the
Telecommunications Act. The Ministry's objective is to have this whole
process completed within six weeks of receiving the application and
the full information requirements.<P>

18. Once the necessary Order in Council has been made, it comes into
force twenty eight days later.<P>

                       THE LEAST THE KURDISH NATION ASKS
            </CENTER></H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>   
   
   
   The Kurdish nation stands oppressed. The Kurdish nation endures the
   persecution, subjugation, and suppression of a plight unknown in the
   annals of history. For over seventy years the powers of evil and
   injustice have held sway in the land of Kurdistan. For over seventy
   years Kurdistan has been divided, partitioned, and separated into
   pieces that leave the so called "international borders" as a scar in
   the land of the Kurds. There is no comparison for this injury and
   pain. There is no remedy that can deal with this disease that has
   befallen the Kurds.
   <P>
   The Kurdish nation has dealt with such a plethora of abuse, that even
   Hitler would stand in awe. The Kurdish nation bleeds so profusely,
   that even the mountains turn red. For over seventy years Kurds have
   withstood the tyranny of a thousand generations. For over seventy
   years Kurdistan has become the prison of the Kurds. Death is an
   everyday occurrence and desolation a common sight. If not for the
   reality of the Kurds, one would think this was the world's worst
   nightmare.
<P>   
   The Kurdish nation has survived even when hope has died. The Kurdish
   nation lives even when life is dead. For over seventy years Kurdistan
   is the epitome of tragedy. For over seventy years, Kurdistan screams
   in the throws of death--yet no one listens. The world stands silent in
   the Kurdish torment and suffering. If not for the Kurds themselves,
   there would not even be one person to listen to these pleas.
   <P>
   The Kurdish nation asks the world to at least bear witness to this
   agony. The Kurdish nation suffers alone and there are no tears for
   their dead. If a million years passed, there would be no equal to this
   catastrophe.

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<H2><CENTER>What is a Hacker</CENTER></H2>

Hacking is a lot of things to alot of people, there is no good way to
explain it.  However, it is certainly not limited to computer nerds
breaking into computer systems.  Hacking might be finding a better way to
make a program work...or it might be playing games, it might be political
with an anarchist agenda, it might be a process or product, thing or
theology, a way of life or just something you do once...it might be
solving a riddle, getting even, causing panic, creating knowledge. 
Hackers are men, women, children, and if their email address are correct
lobsters from Mars.  And hacking is certainly not limited to
computers...are hip hop artists musical hackers?  Was McLuhan a social
hacker? 

<P>

I suggest you do some reading at

<DD>&quot;An Efficient Off-line Electronic Cash System
    Based on the Representation Problem&quot;, Stefan Brands, 1991. Technical
    paper; abstract (in part): &quot;We present a new off-line electronic cash
    system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which 
    little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first 
    to be based entirely on discrete logarithms. Using the represenation 
    problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us 
    to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut 
    and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash 
    system is much more efficient in both computation and communciation 
    complexity than previously proposed systems...Contrary to previously 
    proposed systems, [our system's] correctness can be mathematically 
    proven to a very great extent...Our system offers a number of 
    extensions that are hard to acheive in previously known systems...&quot;

<DD>&quot;Single Term Off-Line Coins&quot;, Niels
    Ferguson. Technical article; abstract: &quot;We present a new construction for
    off-line electronic coins that is both far more efficient and much simpler
    that previous systems. Instead of using many terms, each for a single bit
    of the challenge, our system uses a single term for a large number of 
    possible challenges. The withdrawal protocol does not use a 
    cut-and-choose methodology as with earlier systems, but uses a direct 
    construction.&quot; 1991. This is a gzip-compressed PostScript file.

<DT><a href="book_1st.request"><B>book_1st.request</B></a>
<DD>initial request to transfer jurisdiction from
    State Dept. (who routinely deny export approval) to
    Commerce Dept. (who routinely approve) for Bruce
    Schneier's _Applied_Cryptography_ book, published by
    John Wiley &amp; Sons. The book, and later separately
    available diskette, are clearly exportable, and clearly
    are the jurisdiction of the Commerce Dept. 
<DT><a href="book_1st.response"><B>book_1st.response</B></a>
<DD>Request granted, as book is &quot;public domain&quot; and out-
    side State jurisdiction. State dept. specifically states
    that a special 2-disk set of related code available from
    Schneier is not covered by the ruling (not to be
    confused with the diskette that is the subject of the
    2nd request, below) which contains only source code
    that is in the book, approved for export in hardcopy).
<DT><a href="floppy_2nd.request"><B>floppy_2nd.request</B></a>
<DD>Attempt to convince State dept. to transfer
    control of the single floppy that was created and
    distributed separately as an adjunct to the book,
    (containing only source code that is in the book, 
    approved for export in hardcopy) to the Commerce Dept...
<DT><a href="floppy_3rd.request"><B>floppy_3rd.request</B></a>
<DD>Phil Karn filed his 2nd CJR (floppy_2nd.request) on
    March 8, 1994, as soon as he got the response to the
    first one, but the State Department tarried long
    beyond their 15-working-day limit for telling Phil
    whether he can export this floppy or not. Phil sent in
    this further request that they answer him, Apr. 19, 94.
    He also kept calling them, and Alan Suchinsky of the
    Office of Defense Trade Controls returned his call on
    May 10th, saying that the response had been rewritten
    twice but was going to be finalized that week.
<DT><a href="floppy_2nd.response"><B>floppy_2nd.response</B></a>
<DD>Request denied! State holds that they have
    jurisdiction, and that the material is *not* public
    domain, protected by the 1st Amendment, or exportable.
    Authors maintain this is &quot;nonsense&quot;, and that this
    is unconstitutional. State says that &quot;The text
    files on the subject disk are not an exact
    representation of what is found in 'Applied
    Cryptography.' Each source code listing has been
    partitioned into its own file and has the capability of
    being easily compiled into an executable
    subroutine.&quot; As a result, &quot;This article is
    designated as a defense article under category
    XIII(b)(1) of the United States Munitions List.&quot;
    In other words, State maintains that because the source
    code is in several files instead of jumbled into one
    file, it is therefore &quot;not an exact representation&quot;
    of the original, and makes it fairly plain that the
    real reason for denying the CJR is because it is
    useful for its intended purpose (e.g. easy to compile,
    as opposed the text in the book, which would have to
    by typed in manually.)
<DT><a href="floppy.appeal"><B>floppy.appeal</B></a>
<DD>Phil filed an appeal on June 9, 1994, challenging both the
    details of the distinction between the paper and floppy
    versions and the Constitutionality of restricting the
    export of the floppy version.
<DT><a href="karn_dos_itar_042895.letter"><B>karn_dos_itar_042895.letter</B></a>
<DD>letter from Phil Karn &amp; attorney to Dept. of
    State, Apr. 28, 1995, warning that if a positive decision
    is not reached immediately by State, Karn will file suit
    against them for violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="nsa_3des_export_denial_0396.letter"><B>nsa_3des_export_denial_0396.letter</B></a>
<DD>[Not directly related to the case, but
    of peripheral interest] Letter from State Dept.'s Office of Defense Trade
    Controls (controled by the National Security Agency) denying Phil Karn
    approval to export software that supports Triple-DES encryption. 
    Interesting especially for 3 reasons: The export has nothing to do with 
    public distribution, but was requested to provide security for the foreign,
    but US-staffed and owned, branch of a US company; such export denial was
    threatened if the X9 Committee which establishes banking security standards
    settled on 3DES instead of Clipper - NSA is making good on its threats; and
    the 3DES export denial portion of the form response appears to be a 
    standard part of the form now (in other words, NSA/DoS may be routinely 
    denying all 3DES exports.)

    &quot;disclosing&quot; to foreigners, unconstitutionally restricts Jungers First
    Amendment rights to teach a class in which cryptography is detailed,
    if a foreign student is present. Case is closely related to Karn
    case.

<h6>Last Updated Mon Dec 30 21:58:21 PDT 1996</h6><br>
<br>
   An EFF-sponsored lawsuit by Professor Daniel Bernstein
   to determine whether the Professor has the right to teach
   about cryptography, and collaborate with his peers around the
   world. A major point is whether he can publish source code that foreigners
   might be able to access, or speak it directly to individual who might
   be foreign. The case rests on established First Amendment law
   and relies on the fact that computer source code is human-to-human
   communication protected by the First Amendment (in addition to anything
   else it might be useful for.)

  Each document was scanned in, then proofread for obvious mistakes.
<P>
  Footnotes were used in many documents; as a rule, the general
  format of the page was kept, and footnotes are indicated by the note
  number in brackets, i.e. [n.1].  The text of each footnote appears at
  the bottom of the page, separated by a short line of "=" signs.
<P>

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

Hytelnet for the Macintosh version 6.6

Hytelnet is a user friendly front end to a large database of
internet accessable library and information servces.

This file is a binhexed self extracting archive that contains:
	- Hytelnet Reader
	- Information document in old MacWrite format
	- Hytelnet Data files.

The file may be un-binhexed using one of the following programs:
	- mcvert available on many Unix hosts
	- Any of the stuffit line of programs (stuffit expander,
	  stuffit deluxe, stuffit lite)
	- Compator pro
	- binhex 4.0
	- A variety of other archiving packages

The Macintosh version will:
	- automatically open NCSA telnet 
	  and connect to remote sites.
	- update the Hytelnet database using files from the
	  HYTEL-l list serv or usenet group.
	- Read PC files over a network.  It will also update
	  a networked PC database from the Hytel-l list serv files.
	
Essential Files:
	- HyperCard 2.1 (or HyperCard Player)
	- System 7.0 is prefered
	- Hytelnet data directory and files.
	
The author of the Macintosh front end can be contacted through

<DT>Here is my personal library.  However, the books that I have learned
    with are not necessarily all that are out there, so, the fact that a
    book is  not listed here does not mean that it is not excellent.
    These are  just the
    books I can recommend to you if you want to learn how to program in
    CGI, because they are the ones I have expereience with.  Happy 
    reading.

    <BR>Okay, so a shameless plug for my book. But it is really good!

    <DD>by Randall Schwartz and Larry Wall.
    Though these were not written with CGI in mind, I consider both
    books as CGI Bibles
    Everything I've learned comes initially from them.  They were both
    written so well
    that an ex-Cultural Anthropologist (me) was able to learn programming in
    three months.  Buy Learning Perl first though.  Published by O'Reilly.

    <DD>by Laura Lemay and published by SAMS.  This is a perfect desk 
    reference for any webmaster.  Laura Lemay is one of my favorite 
    technical writers because she is a writer and not a technician.  The 
    appendices of this tome are what I always want to have at my side 
    because they go through all of the tags and color schemes.  My copy 
    was donated by Robin Rees at SAMS for my work with CGI, but it is well 
    worth the buy.

    <DD>by Steven Asbury, Jason Mathews and myself and published by WAITE 
    Group Press.  This book attempts to present solutions to common CGI 
    tasks in a straight forward, not overy technical manner providing cut 
    and paste solutions to "real" programming tasks.  How To solutions 
    range from very basic to extremely complex and solutions often provide 
    both Perl and C examples.

    The Web</A></B>
    <DD>by Robert Jon Mudry and published by Coriolis Group Books.  This was 
    one of my first CGI
    Books.  It was particularly useful when trying to understand how data
    gets sent from an HTML form to a CGI script and how the CGI script
    parses out the incoming data into a format useful for processing.

    Mark Gaither, Sebastian Hassinger and Mike Erwin.
    Excellent discussion of GET, POST and environmental variables.
    The book also has a good section on choosing a CGI
    programming language.  My pet peeve about most CGI books is that they
    do not spend enough time on teaching people how to
    "think" about programming, they only teach how to "do".  If you are
    just starting out, believe me, it is not a waste of your
    time.  Published by Programmers Press.

    Also published by Coriolis, this book is an excellent guide to
    building the Form part of the CGI.   To many programmers get all excited
    about the code and forget that the code is to server humans.  The GUI is
    the more important thing to get right and Urb has some
    great pointers.

    <DD>A behemouth of a book but pretty darn thick for the $30.00.  This
    is the absolute perfect supplement for Learning and programming Perl
    with detailed and expansive examples.  Once you have a good feel for the
    theory of perl, this book will help you to expand and expand and realize

    introduction to CGI that you can get.  Brenner is a fantastic author
    and even if you are an experienced CGI Programmer, you should buy the
    book to support the man who gave us cgi-lib.pl!  Published by M&T

    This is the one I use because it has a good section explaining all the

    of that "What is the WWW" filler junk that takes up most of the other 
    HTML guides out there.  Just the Tags m'am.

    Window">CGI Programming in C &  Perl</B></A>
    <DD>by Thomas Boutell and published by Addison Wesley is a fantastic 
    book for the beginner and advanced programmer.  The first five chapters 
    are very useful for a beginner who is trying to figure out the very 
    basics of how to install a CGI, and the last half includes detailed 
    step by step looks through real applications.  (Note: <A HREF = 
    "mailto:lm@bheaven.com">Luis Magdaleno</A> warns that there are some 
    bugs in the code distributed in the book...I did not try to run any 
    of his scripts as much as used them for the ideas they set forward, so I 
    can't say one way or another).

    resource in my opinion.

    "Resource Window">Perl 5 by Example</A></B>
    <DD>by <A HREF = "mailto:medined@planet.net">David Medinets</A>. This 
    is an incredible online resource with a well thoughtout and 
    well presented array of examples which will help any Perl 4 hacker 
    figure out Perl 5 and any non-programmer make their way into the 
    cutting edge of web programming. In the words of the author, "Perl 5 
    by Example will teach you how to use the Perl programming language by 
    showing examples that demonstrate the concepts being discussed. The 
     examples are designed to give you a chance to experiment-which in turn
     should clarify the material."  And the whole thing online!

    TARGET = "Resource Window">Perl by Example</A></B>
    <DD>by Ellie Quigley.  This tutorial/reference is the ideal guide for 
    UNIX professionals who want to (or must) learn
    Perl as quickly as possible.  It goes through a whole host of 
    tasks commonly asked of Perl in a clear and explained way so that you 
    can quickly cut and paste solutions to your real problems.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We got the usual unusual amount of sleep that night (anticipation or a 
fear of missing the flight, I never know).  Little need for an alarm 
clock, Soy woke up every hour and I woke up at 4:30 AM.  At 5:10, I 
showered, at 5:15 I was packed, and by 5:20 we were waiting for the 
electronic garage door to slide open.

<P>

Pre-dawn Northern Virginia slipped quietly behind us as we made our way 
towards Dulles, a smattering of seriously deranged commuters speeding 
their way into DC.  I don't remember much of the flight really.  Soy and 
I slept all the way to San Juan, woken by the pilot's tour guide debut, 
"On the left side of the aircraft you can see San Juan."  

<P>

It was a grand view of course.  From above the Caribbean is very 
beautiful.  Islands floated underneath us one by one, blue shallow-water 
halos surrounding them and darker reef systems beyond that reaching into 
the deeper blue waters.

<P>

Before I knew it, we were landing at the airport in St. Croix and walking 
down the portable stairway into the oppressive island sun moderated by a 
constant moist breeze.  Each of us had only carry on baggage so we made 

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/lizard.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "200">

our way over to the "Traveler's Tours" stand to catch the shuttle to the 
hotel, "Chenay Bay Beach Resort".

<P>

Offered a complimentary rum and coke, Soy and I opted for straight, 
unadulterated fruit punch, the slushes we are and hung out by the shuttle 
bus till the other tourists straggled over.  We shared the shuttle with 
two gay guys from Atlanta who were as excited as us as we made our way 
out of the bland industrialized airport district into the island interior 
on our way to Christiansted, the island's capital and location of their 
hotel.  

<P>

The interior ecosystem seemed much like that of Santorini, low trees and 
bushes, and intently covering grasses.  However, the scenery was dotted 
with the occasional palm tree and the one brilliant dash of red-orange 
that the cab driver noted was called the "Flamboyant Flower" (probably 
not the taxonomic name of course).

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/chenay_bay.gif" ALIGN = "left"
         WIDTH = "200">

<P>

Most houses were low and wide and separated by a great deal of distance.  
I wondered what the best architecture was for hurricanes and thanked my 
karma for the bright blue above.

<P>

After thirty minutes (2:30 PM) we reached our hotel, settled all of the 
bureaucracy and zipped over to the beach down the small cobblestone path 
leading from out cottage.

<P>

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/chenay_bay_cottages.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "200">

The cottage was very comfortable and all I had hoped for.  A single room 
with separate bathroom and kitchenette, basically an economy apartment.  
The air conditioner was powerful and cooking supplies were provided.

<P>

Snorkeling right off the beach was pretty pitiful. The water was 
extremely clear but the scenery was mainly sand and sea grass.  (In 
retrospect, if you can spend a little bit more, I recommend the Cormorant 
Beach resort which has a fabulous live reef surrounding it)  After about 
five minutes, I got out and went to the boat house to ask the workers 
what they suggested. 

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/coral.gif" ALIGN = "left"
         WIDTH = "200">
<P>

They thought that we should take a two-man kayak to the island off in the 
horizon.  It looked to be about 2 miles off shore but they said that 
there would be enough time before dusk.  (We just boarded the glass 
bottom boat for Buck island, so excuse my sloppy typing).

<P>

So we grabbed our stuff, hoped on the kayak and began rowing.  
(Fortunately, I tied everything to the boat).

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/eric_kayak.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "200">

<P>

Once we got out of the sheltered bay, the waves began to play a factor 
and we began to fight a little against the current and the pelting 
flows.  About 200 yards off the island, we realized that the boat was 
becoming very unruly and hard to row (we attributed it wrongly to the 
current).  About 100 yards off the island, we began taking on water 
"visibly" (we'd apparently been filling the interior of the boat the 
whole time through a hole in the bottom of the boat.

<P>

Soon after, the boat flipped, dumping us into the bright blue, crystal 
clear, 80 degree, but deep and all-surrounding water.  After several 
attempts to get back on the boat (every time we flipped it over, it still 
seemed to sink) we gave up and began making our way to the island.  
Fearing the $500.00 loss of equipment fee, I dragged the boat behind me. 
Fortunately, Soy had a life vest and she had taken flippers which I wore 
to make dragging the boat easier.

<P>

About forty minutes later, haggard and weary, we beached the kayak as 
best we could and rested.

<P>

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/kayak_hole.gif" ALIGN = "left"
         WIDTH = "200">

For the next twenty minutes, I tried to get the kayak on the beach but 
for some reason it was sooooooo heavy.  I still had not realized that the 
interior was full of sea water so I strained and strained with the 
monster, falling on my butt several times and cutting my arm on a rock.

<P>

Finally, we flagged down a very nice older woman named Ulma who was out 
rowing. She came over and quickly analyzed the situation.  She found the 
hole and we all tipped the kayak on its side while the water poured out.  
It poured, and poured and poured.  maybe five minutes. Once it seemed 
empty, she told us to try to make it back, but this time Soy would cover 
the hole with her foot.  Like that we paddled back.

<P>

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/palm.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "200">

When we got back, we found out that they actually knew about the hole, 
but forgot to tell us.  I was too happy to be on the island to be pissed 
off and in the end we made it back with an excellent story....so we just 
told them that they should take the boat off the beach and went back to 
the cottage.

<P>

We were pretty hungry by then so we walked over to a little dive called 
"Cheeseburgers in Paradise" where I had...a cheeseburger and we listened 
to cheesy lounge reggae.  We met a lonely engineer who had been working 
at the Hess oil refinery for the last year.  He told us about his 
exploits as an engineer which were very interesting.  And when we were 
done, we called a cab and dropped by the local supermarket to pick up 
supplies.  Then home and sleep.  It had been an exhausting day.

<P>

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/hammock.gif" ALIGN = "left"
         WIDTH = "200">

Saturday started early.  At 8:30 we'd arranged for a cab to pick us up 
and take us to Christiansted to meet the boat which went to Buck Island, 
an underwater natural preserve with snorkeling trails through a complex 
of branch-like coral.  

<P>

The ride was about thirty minutes and the 
visibility was about one hundred feet so the sandy bottom was just 
visible far below.  I looked for dolphins playing in our wake but never 
did see any.  I guess that would be just too much.

<P>

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/coral3.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "200">

After the short ride, we slowed and made our way through the buoy marked 
boat path through the reef surrounding Buck Island and settled into a 
cove.  We'd already been given the snorkeling gear so we all jumped in.  
Three different groups went through the trail for about ten minutes and 
then we were left to ourselves for an hour and a half.  Soy and I headed 
deeper into the reef on our own which was swarming with a fluorescent 
rainbow.  Diving down, I swam in the middle of a huge (30 X 10 feet) 
school of blue angel fish.  Surprisingly, they did not disperse, but swam 
with me so long as I didn't reach for them.

<P>

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/school.gif" ALIGN = "left"
         WIDTH = "200">

Trumpet fish schooled near the surface much shorter than those I saw in 
Hawaii, but a pleasant nostalgia nonetheless.  Both red and purple 
California-style sea urchins dotted the walls on the outside of the reef 
which we decided not to explore further since it was not on the trail and 
a blue painted cinder block on the bottom pointed back the way we came.

<P>

After the time was up, and when we could see the crew waving at us, we 
swam back along the inside of the reef viewing the sandy bottom sea 
life.  Someone said that they saw a ray, but we didn't :(

<P>

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/beach2.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "200">

Then a quick jaunt over to the other side of the island where we dropped 
anchor off a salt-fine beach.  We got another forty minutes to hike into 
the interior of the island or along the beach.  Soy and I opted to stay 
on the beach and walk along the shore taking pictures and swimming (I'd 
carried the camera in one hand above the water from boat to shore).

<P>

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/beach.gif" ALIGN = "left"
         WIDTH = "200">

I'd been conservative with the sunscreen earlier, so I also brought a 
T-Shirt (my computer room faded skin was feeling the effects of the 
previous day).  After thirty minutes, we hiked back, swam to the boat and 
prepared to go.  As it turned out, there were stragglers, but that was 
okay because it gave me time to dive off the boat for awhile and swim 
more.  Finally though, it was time to return.

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/eric_on_beach.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "150">

<P>

By the time we returned to Christiansted, we were both very hungry. I'd 
quizzed various locals about places they liked to eat earlier and the 
most common answer was "Harvey's" where they served Caribbean food.  The 
decor was bar-like and reminded me of the restaurants in Morocco.  It was 
obviously off the tourist-beaten path and was filled with a lot of locals 
lounging and hanging out.

<P>

Soy ordered Boiled King Fish with a side of Fungi, a strange local side 
order.  I had extra spicy BBQ chicken.  The spices on St. Croix are 
decent if you ask for a bottle of extra hot sauce.  Enough to satiate my 
deadened nerves of course.  The food was great though and we were both 
full enough to take large doggy bags.  

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/fruit.gif" ALIGN = "left"
         WIDTH = "200">

<P>

After that we returned to the resort, took a rest and then grabbed a 
kayak to go around the point of Chenay Bay where there was supposed to be 
better snorkeling but was not as far as the island.  Soy kept the hole in 
the boat covered and we paddled around the point quickly staying close to 
shore for a rock landing.

<P>

The snorkeling was okay, the coral was beautiful, but there were less 
fishes.  Actually, the most exciting part of the expedition was landing 
the kayak on the rocky beach between jutting coral barriers without 
killing ourselves. Considering the waves, it was lucky we were as 
successful as we were.  When we left, I had Soy walk by foot back to the 
protected bay and I did the exit on my own.

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/coral1.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "200">

<P>

After that, it was time for dinner.  The resort held an island roast out 
buffet with a wide assortment of island dishes from spit roasted boar , 
to seasoned rice with BBQ chicken, to various seafood dishes and some 
funky deserts.  We had more virgin pina coladas (Soy) and strawberry 
Daiquiri (me) and relaxed to an excellent steel drum band.

<P>

The next day was another early start.  I'd made reservations with "VI 
Divers" for a half day series of dives.  Unfortunately, in filling out 
the paper work they asked to see my diving certification card which was 
in Virginia still.  They absolutely refused to  let me dive without the card.

<P>

Saddened and frustrated, I made my way back to the center of town to 
catch a cab back to Chenay Bay.  Along the way though, I passed "Dive 
Experience" and there seemed to be a lot of activity.  On the off chance 
that I might get lucky and that this store had different policies, I went 
in and told the receptionist my situation.  Fortunately, their policy was 
less stringent and so long as I agreed to sign my life away, I could go 
with them for the day. 

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/scuba.gif " ALIGN = "left"
         WIDTH = "200">
<P>

I signed away, grabbed some gear and took off for the waiting boat.  It 
was an eight person expedition with three absolutely exceptional guides.  
With my memory, I decided not to put al the gear together myself and 
asked the main guide if he would do it for me.  He complimented me on my 
lack of machismo in a diving situation.

<P>

The ride was bumpy but fun.  I accidentally got in a conversation about 
the Internet with two brothers who live in D.C.  But soon we were at the 
first dive site, greeted by a small sea turtle poking its head out of the 
water and looking at us quizzically.

<P>

The first dive was a cliff dive.  We descended 100 feet and swam south 
easterly along one side of an undersea valley.  Below us and in the open 
water, rays slipped by into the gloom.  Visibility was mediocre for the 
area, maybe forty or fifty feet but it was clear enough for me to see the 
fishes and coral formations on the side of the wall.  Unfortunately, my 
camera would not work.  I found out later that it is only good up to 
twelve feet. After that the pressure seals the shutter shut.

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/island.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "200">
<P>

It was great to be diving again and the lack of a wet suit was a nice 
experience.

<P>

The second dive was shallower.  We explored a coral reef with sand 
fingers which shot through the reef.  Though the density of life was not 
as stunning as Hanauma in Oahu or Buck Island, it was extravagant 
nonetheless.

<P>

While skimming the bottom, looking closely through the coral and going in 
and out of small caves, I brushed a strand of fire coral which still 
stings a day later.  I rubbed sand on the spot and went on. I never saw a 
sea turtle while in the water, but oh well.

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/salt_river.gif" ALIGN = "left"

<P>

When I got back to port, I met Soy and our favorite cab driver "Cuthbert 
Lett" to go on a half day island tour.  Lett was fantastic.  He was a 
wealth of knowledge about the island's history and wildlife as well as 
those of the other Caribbean islands.

<P>

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/eric_and_lett.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "200">

The highlight of the tour was a hike through the rain forest on the west 
en d of the island.  Lett stayed in the van and Soy and I hacked our way 
through the dense thicket swarming with brightly colored insects, lizards 
and a chorus of birds above in the canopy.  Lacking a machete, we just 
climbed through where possible.

I finished off the day by rowing out to the island at Chenay Bay on a 
single person kayak where I climbed up the rock wall on one side to check 
out the roosting pelicans.  I could not get too close because they made 
such a racket that I thought they might attack me.  I came back after 
some more wandering and met Soy who had been relaxing at the pool side 
watching the sun go down.

<P>

The next day, Lett drove us over to the Cormorant Resort which was 
supposed to have better snorkeling than Chenay Bay (which was actually a 
let down).  In fact, the snorkeling was fantastic.  There was about 25 
feet visibility and a huge live reef teaming with all the fish I'd hoped 
to find as well as snow eels, squids, trumpet fish, etc....  The reef 
began outside of a semicircle of fine white sand which protected the 
beach for swimming and then extended further than I could swim out to 
sea, the depth gradually slopping away and communities of fishes changin 
at different depths.  In fact, if I'd gone out a few miles, I would 
eventually reach the dive spot from the day before.

         WIDTH = "100">
<P>

Soy and I swam out pretty far though, maybe to a depth of twenty-five 
feet (though the reef jutted upwards in many places so that it was not 
like swimming in open water far above the action).  We took along a baggy 
of bread but unlike Hanauma Bay, the fish were not used to being fed so 
they were shy and waited out of our reach for the bread to float down.

<P>

Like an idiot, I forgot to cover the backs of my legs with suntan lotion 
so I got quite a burn, but not too much to be disabling.  After 
snorkeling for four hours, we grabbed a cab back to our cottage at Chenay 
Bay and let the hanging fan above us lull us to sleep.  A couple of hours 
later we woke up, took showers and grabbed a cab back into town to wander 
the shops.

<P>

Downtown Christiansted is not huge but there are some nice shops which 
sell item goods at reasonable prices.  Soy picked up a clay diorama for 

<IMG SRC = "../../Graphics/St_croix/sugar_mill.gif" ALIGN = "right"
         WIDTH = "100">

her friend in Thailand and I spent ten minutes delicately packing it in 
tissue paper to protect in from the coming shipping.

<P>

Then we went to Gallows Bay to a restaurant called "No Bones Cafe" which 
Soy had picked from our tour book.  It was a very cool Netty's-like 
establishment with a few rooms like a maze and a dozen parrots and island 
birds around, Charlie Parker painting the air and a very unique menu of 
exotic seafood dishes.  I had a cheeseburger of course and Soy got Shrimp 
and Scallop Scampi over linguini.  Actually the burger was one of the 
best I've ever eaten and came with grandma-style fried potatoes.  The 
waiter and cook were nice too.

<P>

         WIDTH = "150">

Soy and I talked the night away and later had Lett pick us up for the 
last cab ride.  At home we watched TV until we fell asleep.  Next morning 
we woke up pretty late and hung out at the beach while we waited for the 
shuttle to the airport.  The cab driver was pretty late and was a poor 
driver.  I recommend not using Traveler's Tours if possible.

<P>

And then, back home.

    merged into one case for trial before a 3-judge panel in the Philadelphia
    US District Court. (This directory a.k.a. ALA_CDT_CIEC_v_DoJ/)

    Governor &amp; Attorney General of Georgia case, challenging the 
    unconstitutional 1996 Georgia state legislature's &quot;Net police&quot; law. 
    ACLU is the lead plaintif in this case, funding the court costs and doing
    most of the legal work, though the impetus from the case, as well as
    the initial draft complain, comes from Electronic Frontiers Georgia 
    (EFGA).

    &quot;Seven Dirty Words&quot; case, FCC v. Pacifica Foundation (the original
    Carlin monologue that was the subject of the case was actually called

    indecency regulation in broadcasting, and for over two decades has 
    established the FCC as the largest censorship body in the world. This 
    case is essentially one of the forebears of the &quot;Communications Decency 
    Act&quot;.

<DD>Directory of info on PETER D. JUNGER v. DEPARTMENT OF 
    STATE, OFFICE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS, &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY case.
    Junger claims the ITAR and AECA export restrictions on encryption 
    (particularly the absurdly broad definition of 'export', which includes

    Amendment rights to teach a class in which cryptography is detailed, if a 
    foreign student is present.

<DD>directory of documents from the &quot;Applied
    Cryptography&quot; book + disk export case (book by Schneier, disk by Karn).

    program (stripped version) export case, put forward by

    software piracy via BBS.)

    switched to using lectlaw.com.
<DT><a href="Lotus_cases/"><B>Lotus_cases/</B></A>
<DD>Directory of info related to the Lotus Development Corp.
    v. Borland International, and Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Paperback Software 
    &quot;look-and-feel&quot; lawsuits (there are no civil liberties implications 
    in these cases, but vast implications for competition, open access 
    and free flow of information. If not overturned in the Supreme Court, 
    the Appellate Court's decision in Lotus v. Borland would allow 
    software giants to copyright not only graphical displays of menus, and 
    the code to generate them (quite appropriate under copyright law), but 
    also the underlying ideas or structure of the menuing systems in their 
    software - essentially a copyright on the methods of operation of a 
    computer program.
<DT><a href="Mitnick_WELL/"><B>Mitnick_WELL/</B></A>
<DD>Directory of info related to the capture &amp; prosecution of
    Kevin Mitnick, who allegedly &quot;cracked&quot; the WELL and other Internet service

<DD>directory of info on the seizure of several
    Montreal (Canada) BBSs and the prosecution of their operators.
<DT><a href="MTV_v_Curry/"><B>MTV_v_Curry/</B></A>
<DD>Directory of info on the MTV v. Adam Curry domain name
    dispute. Music TeleVision sued former employee Adam Curry over his use
    of the mtv.com domain name, claiming trademark violation. Curry had
    registered mtv.com himself, while an MTV employee, after MTV declined to
    do so itself. After leaving the company, Curry put the domain name to
    non-MTV uses. MTV's case was fairly good - Curry was providing 
    entertainment-related info, and as such was arguably competing with MTV.
    Had Curry been doing anything else with the name, MTV's case would 
    probably have failed. MTV and Curry settled, and Curry now uses the 
    curry.com domain name, while MTV has taken over mtv.com. This case
    was arguably the first prominent domain name dispute, and opened the
    entire question of whether or not a domain name is intellectual property,
    and in what sense. In Curry's case, the answer leaned toward it
    being property in the trademark sense, just like a name on a product.
    Subsequent cases are pushing in the opposite direction, trying to
    establish domain names as property that benefits the holder (and ergo
    cannot be taken without cause and recompense).

<DD>directory of documents regarding
    the Straton Oakmont Inc. &amp; Daniel Porush v. Prodigy Services Company

    editorial responsibility.

    wire.net domain name infringed their trademark. The dispute was settled
    at least fairly amicably before any legal action ensued, with WWire
    acceding to the magazine's demands.

[You will need to get InfoZip's unzip utility. It can be found at ftp.eff.org,
pub/Net_info/Tools/unzip_vms.exe (see also the README.unzip_VMS in that 
directory) for the VMS version.  For the Unix version, get unzip50.tar.gz, 
in the same directory.]

Note:

    In order to use the Unix or VMS versions of Hytelnet you must have
    the PC version.  The PC version is available via anonymous ftp from
    ftp.usask.ca (128.233.3.11) in the /hytelnet/pc directory.

    If you do not already have an unzip utility for Unix, you can get
    unzip50.tar.Z from the ../hytelnet/unix directory on ftp.usask.ca.

    If you do not already have an unzip utility for VMS, you can get
    unzip50.exe from the ../hytelnet/vms directory on ftp.usask.ca.
 

To make and install the Unix version:

    First install the files from the PC version of Hytelnet on your
    Unix host.  For example: 

    % cd /usr/local/hytelnet
    % unzip hyteln65.zip	(extract readnow and hytelnet.zip)
    % unzip -a hytelnet.zip	(extract the rest)
    % rm *.zip *.exe help.txt read.me start.txt whatis

    Then install the Unix Hytelnet files:

    % gunzip hytelnet.tar.gz
    % tar -xvf hytelnet.tar
    % make hytelnet

    The help, read.me, start, whatis and index files from this archive
    should be placed in the same directory as the unziped PC Hytelnet
    files.


To make and install the VMS version:
 
    First install the files from the PC version of Hytelnet on your
    VMS host.  Then make Hytelnet.  For example:
 
    $ set default pub:[hytelnet]
    $ unzip hyteln65.zip        (extract readnow and hytelnet.zip)
    $ unzip -a hytelnet.zip     (extract the rest)
    $ del *.zip.,*.exe.,help.txt.,read.me.,start.txt.,whatis..
 
    Then copy the VMS Hytelnet files into this directory and make the
    VMS version of Hytelnet:
 
    $ copy ...
    $ @make      (use "@make multinet" if you use Multinet)
 
    The help, read.me, start, whatis and index files from the VMS version
    should be placed in the same directory as the unziped PC Hytelnet
    files.
 
    Note: for the benefit of VMS users who do not have a C compiler,
          I have placed two pre-compiled versions of hytelnet
	  in the vms directory.  These are: hytelnet.exe and
	  hytelnet-multinet.exe.

Telnet, tn3270, rlogin, finger, ftp, pad

    The Unix and VMS versions of Hytelnet notice these commands
    embedded in the database, and will execute them for the user,
    if desired.


Configuration

    If you install the Hytelnet data files somewhere other than in
    /usr/local/hytelnet (pub:[hytelnet] on VMS), you will have to
    change the definition of STARTDIR in hytelnet.c.

    You can disable the execution of external commands by running
    Hytelnet with the -secure option.  Or you can edit the makefile and
    define SECURE before compiling the program.

    On VMS systems, external command execution is automatically disabled
    for anonymous users (those who login under the name 'hytelnet').

    On Unix systems, it is disabled for anonymous users from outside
    the local domain.  For this to work, edit hytelnet.c and define
    DOMAIN_CUE to be a unique substring of your domain (eg. ".usask.ca").

    To allow anonymous users to telnet-out, edit hytelnet.c and change
    the definition of ANONYMOUS_USER to "".

    A few sites require that a port number be specified in the
    telnet command.  The syntax for this varies on VMS and DOS systems.
    If this doesn't work for you, you may have to play around with the
    definition of PORTSEP in hytelnet.c.


Please let me know if you have any problems with the Unix or VMS
versions of Hytelnet.

  These documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act
  by EFF Board member John Gilmore, through his lawyer, Lee Tien.
  Each document was scanned in, then proofread for obvious mistakes.
<P>
  Footnotes were used in many documents; as a rule, the general
  format of the page was kept, and footnotes are indicated by the note
  number in brackets, i.e. [n.1].  The text of each footnote appears at
  the bottom of the page, separated by a short line of "=" signs.
<P>
  Section symbols were replaced by a "s.".  If a document was signed,
  the signature is indicated by (signed:) followed by the name of the
  person signing the document.  If there is no "(signed)", the document
  was not signed.  Anything not in the original text is bracketed.<P>

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<H2><CENTER>CHRONOLOGY OF THE YANOMAMI GENOCIDE</CENTER></H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The genocide of the Yanomami began in the early 70's, when the
first invasions of the Indian territory by miners were registered. Since
then, about 2,000 Indians were killed. The Brazilian government allowed
this genocide to happen, as shown by the data listed below:

<P>

1974: the Perimetral Norte highway, a road cutting the Yanomami
territory, begins to be built. The area is invaded by hundreds of
workermen ; in the three-year period that followed, influenza, measles,
and tuberculosis claim the lives of over 80 Indians. Soon after that,
the results of the Radambrasil Project, which surveyed the mineral potential
of the Amazonian soil, are published. The survey indicates the existence
of large quantities of uranium, gold, diamonds, and tin ore in the
Yanomami area.

<P>

1975: about 500 miners invade the Surucucus mountain range, an
Indian land, looking for tin ore. The governor of the State of Roraima,
Ramos Pereira, supports the invasion and says that "a rich area cannot
permit itself the luxury of preserving half a dozen Indian tribes hindering
the development."

<P>

1978: FUNAI (National Indian Foundation) signs a covenant with
mining company Vale do Rio Doce for the exploitation of tin ore in
Yanomami lands. The covenant is suspended.

<P>

1979: the appointed governor of Roraima, Ottomar de Souza Pinto,
announces as he is sworn into office that the top priority of
his administration would be to resume the mining for tin ore.

<P>

1980: the minister for Mines and Energy, Ce'sar Cals, issues
licenses authorizing two mining companies to carry out research on
titanium deposits in Yanomami lands. A group of miners is detected
inside Yanomami lands located in Amazonia.

<P>

1981: about 2,000 miners invade the area again, this time looking
for gold. Governor Ottomar Pinto insists that the formal prohibition to
carry out mining activities in these lands should be lifted. In
November, eighteen Yanomami Indians die of measles in Amazonia.

<P>

1982: five Yanomami are murdered by miners in a region near the
Catrimani and Apiau' rivers. More and more, outbreaks of diseases
area registered among the Indians.

<P>

1983: FUNAI signs with Codesaima, a company operated by the government
of Raraima, a covenant for carrying out research and mining for ores in
the Indian area.

<P>

1984: Mozarildo Cavalcanti, federal deputy for Raraima, presents a bill
to the Chamber of Deputies proposing that mining for tin ore should
be permitted in part of the area. An Yanomami is shot on the back by a miner
at the Catrimani river.

<P>

1985: 44 miners headed by businessman Jose' Altino Machado invade
Surucucus and subdue at gunpoint four army soldiers and a sargeant who
were guarding the area. They are expelled by Army, Federal Police, and
Military Police troops. After being arrested, Altino Machado says he
would repeat the operation. Soon after that, miners invade the northeast
region of the territory. Deputy Mozarildo Cavalcanti presents a bill to
the Chamber of Deputies providing for the exploitation of tin ore in
Yanomami lands by authorization of the Executive Branch.

<P>

1986: Altino Machado deposes before the Chamber of Deputies and says
he will fight for the miners to remain in the area.

<P>

1987: the Brazilian government launches a campaign affirming that
the demarcation of the Yanomami lands is a pretext for the Indians to
establish an independent state. The propaganda is an attempt to justify
the implementation of the Calha Norte Project. The military commander of
the Amazonian Region, general Antenor Santa Cruz, says that the presence
of miners in the Indian area "plays a strategic role in the occupation of
the national territory." Four Yanomami of the Paapiu' area are clubbed,
stabbed, and shot to death by miners.

<P>

1988: miners kill nine Yanomami. The ex-president of Funai, Romero
Juca' takes office as governor of Roraima and says he will ensure the
security of the 20 thousand miners who invaded the Indian area. The
government cuts the Yanomami territory into 19 discontinuous areas,
one national park and two national forests, leaving 76% of the
traditional Yanomami territory out of the demarcation. Four Indians
are murdered by the invaders the following year.

<P>

1990: miners kill two Indians. The president of the Republic, Jose'
Sarney, creates the Araricoera and Catrimani-Couto Magalha~es
mining reservations inside Indian lands. The extermination of 15% of
the Yanomami population, about 2 thousand Indians, in the two previous
years because of diseases brought by the miners is denounced.

<P>

1991: the reinvasion grows. FUNAI mentions 1 thousand miners. Ottomar
de Souza Pinto takes office as the new governor of Roraima, and continues
to support the invasion.

<P>

1992: about 2 thousand miners invade the area again. At least 150
Yanomami die of diseases. An Indian is murdered.

<P>

1993: in August, FUNAI denounces the massacre of 73 Yanomami.

<P>

  These documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act
  by EFF Board member John Gilmore, through his lawyer, Lee Tien.
  Each document was scanned in, then proofread for obvious mistakes.
<P>
  Footnotes were used in many documents; as a rule, the general
  format of the page was kept, and footnotes are indicated by the note
  number in brackets, i.e. [n.1].  The text of each footnote appears at
  the bottom of the page, separated by a short line of "=" signs.
<P>
  Section symbols were replaced by a "s.".  If a document was signed,
  the signature is indicated by (signed:) followed by the name of the
  person signing the document.  If there is no "(signed)", the document
  was not signed.  Anything not in the original text is bracketed.<P>

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<DD>Press release in German, from Austrian organization
    eCE. Discusses the coming to Vienna the concept of a digital town,
    thereby providing public access to electronic networks. Moreover, the
    &quot;digital town&quot; aims at extending public services by
    providing electronic information on local political issues
    (electronic townhall), collecting cultural information
    (theaters, opera, museums, cinemas, etc.). As such, the
    &quot;digital town&quot; is far more than an ordinary BBS: it brings
    &quot;the network to the people.&quot; (Abstract in English).

    TARGET = Resource Window">Auto-changing JavaScript MIDI Player</A> - 
    This java script program to play songs continuously, one right after 
    the other as listed.  You can browse all the pages associated to the 
    homepage running this without song interuption, or, you can choose a 
    song to play, iconize the window and the remaining songs will 
    automatically begin after your selection with no further intervention 
    by you or the homepage visitor. 
<LI><A HREF = "http://www.i-depth.com/"

    TARGET = Resource Window">Lake Web's Perl Scripts</A> - Several 
    nicely done and well documented CGI scripts written in Perl including a 
    CGI to send files, one to manage ACESS databases, handle cookies, and a 
    classified add system.
<LI><A HREF = "http://amorn.baremetal.com/netscape/stuff/readme.htm"
    TARGET = Resource Window">Web Search</A> - <A HREF = 
    "mailto:amorn@amorn.baremetal.com">Amorn Chomchoey</A> has created a 
    fantastic meta search engine script which will keyword search multiple 
    search servers (ie Yahoo, Alta Vista, Webcrawler).
<LI><A HREF = "http://www.sdm.de/e/www/hilfe/gen_tree-2.1.tar.gz"
    TARGET = Resource Window">Gen Tree</A> - This Perl script scans the 
    tree (better: the directed graph) of HTML pages of a web site (it's 
    not always a tree because circles and loops are possible!), starting 
    at the home page of that site and following all hyperlinks in a 
    recursive descent (you can also scan just a sub-tree of your web 
    site if you want). Circles and loops are recognized through unique 
    identification of each page by the device and i-node numbers of its 
    corresponding file. When scanning of the web site is complete, an 
    HTML page is generated which contains all the pages found in form of 
    one hyperlink to each of them. The tree structure of the web site is 
    reflected in this page by the indentation of these hyper-links. The 
    text which is displayed in these hyperlinks is extracted
    from the &LT;TITLE&GT; ... &LT;/TITLE&GT; tags inside the corresponding 
    page. The script is capable of executing server side includes and of 
    analyzing server side image maps. This way, no important hyperlinks 
    are missed (many home pages consist of an image map and nothing 
    else!). It is also able to analyze CGI scripts simply by calling them 
    and analyzing their output (therefore, no HTTP server is needed!).

<DT><a href="harlem_ii.proposal"><B>harlem_ii.proposal</B></a>
<DD>March 1994 abstract of the proposal: Harlem
    Information Infrastructure Center. &quot;The U.S. government can no
    longer afford to neglect Black and Hispanic communities when it
    comes to information superhighway technology. It is time to
    radically change the way the data superhighway is developing -- to
    shift from an information repository for the privilege few to an
    information system that empowers all citizens. The ability to
    retrieve highly specific data rapidly from international information
    sources, and to work collaboratively with others to build that
    information into entrepreneurial opportunities through global
    markets, seem to be the key skills required for Harlem's success in
    the emerging global information based society. With industrial-age
    jobs disappearing, the U.S. government can't afford to leave anyone
    behind as our nation's economy shifts to an information-based
    economy. As networking becomes the highway to commute to work, we
    need to assure that Harlem finds the means to travel via the data
    superhighway.&quot;

<h6>Last Updated Mon Dec 30 21:58:21 PDT 1996</h6><br>
<br>
   An EFF-sponsored lawsuit by Professor Daniel Bernstein
   to determine whether the Professor has the right to teach
   about cryptography, and collaborate with his peers around the
   world. A major point is whether he can publish source code that foreigners
   might be able to access, or speak it directly to individual who might
   be foreign. The case rests on established First Amendment law
   and relies on the fact that computer source code is human-to-human
   communication protected by the First Amendment (in addition to anything
   else it might be useful for.)

<b>Comments:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Bravo, Selena!  If we are to avoid the horrors of the past we must not forget it,
and if we are to make the future a better place, then first we must begin to correct
what is in the now.  But don't forget the cultural horrors of the world...the ideals that force our
young women (and young men, increasingly) to starve themselves unto death in the name of some designer's idea of beauty.
idea of beauty;  that still require that an authoritative man be hailed as admirable and a similarly-behaved woman to be
labeled "a bitch"; that maintain the fiction that stupidity is a virtue and illiteracy is fashionable; and that continue to instill
violence as an acceptable solution and pacifism as "wimpy".  
      Anybody who wants to engage in debate on any of these issues may mail me if they like.
     Continue your mission, Selena!

It is a very simple and elegant program.  Today I came back to see if you had anything else that might be useful when I came across The Struggle.  Again I find myself very impressed.

When I noticed "The Struggle" while surfing the EFF pages, I wasn't
sure just what it was, but after seeing Selena Sol's name, I knew reading it would prove a valuable use of my time on the Web.

 I enjoyed your essay.  I agree that we each have the power to affect or neglect our world. While it is important to be aware of the injustices of the world, it is also important not to simply dwell on the horror of it all.  The human spirit, which we acess through our own creativity, brings harmony into the world.  Along with the facts we need humor, aesthetics, and expression.  I'm not saying a spoonful of sugar will help the medicine go down; I'm saying we need something more to lift our spirits and to reaffirm the life force, which is creative by nature.   </BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

The truth about the amount of thuggery, torture and pain the US and its allies are responsible for in the name of protecting our interests, if revealed in one sitting to one person, that person would never again sleep at night knowing there are people who have painfully given thier lives and are giving their lives so that maybe their children may walk this earth free and fed. The legacy is long and astonishing. It is up to people like us to keep this in perspective as revolutionary new achievements in western state-supported terrorism are accomplished every day.<P> It is a race against time and stupidity.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<DD>Letter from State Dept.'s Office of

    denying Phil Karn approval to export software that supports Triple-DES 
    encryption. Interesting especially for 3 reasons: The export has nothing 
    to do with public distribution, but was requested to provide security 
    for the foreign, but US-staffed and owned, branch of a US company; such 
    export denial was threatened if the X9 Committee which establishes 
    banking security standards settled on 3DES instead of Clipper - NSA is 
    making good on its threats; and the 3DES export denial portion of the 
    form response appears to be a standard part of the form now (in other 
    words, NSA/DoS may be routinely denying all 3DES exports.)

<DD>Statement on cryptographic technology and

    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;

    This bill, known as the Pro-CODE bill, is the most pro-privacy, 
    pro-commerce, pro-Net bill to day, and essentially supercedes the ECPA96

<DD>Sen. Leahy's on a roll: Leahy and others introduced this new
    bill to partially deregulate encryption export, Mar. 5 96. - a promising
    move that is sure to raise the level of Congressional awareness of
    increasingly vital online security, privacy and commercial needs.
    Such a bill could also nail the coffin shut on hare-brained
    Administration schemes like &quot;key escrow&quot; (copies of all users' encryption
    keys held for the convenience of law enforcement.) Problems remain in
    the legislation, including unclear language in some areas, and the
    creation of a new felony of using encryption to thwart police
    investigation of a felony - tatamount to making it an extra crime to
    close the curtains when breaking the law. EFF is largely supportive
    of most of the provisions of the legislation. The bill also creates
    a legal infrastructure for key escrow, though it does aim to prevent
    the imposition of such a system. The House version, H.R. 3011, is
    considerably stronger in this regard.

    imposition of key 'escrow' systems. Like Leahy's bill, this
    legislation (introduced Mar. 5 1996) creates a new, but fairly narrow
    felony of cryptographical obstructing justice in furtherance of a felony.

<br>
   An EFF-sponsored lawsuit by Professor Daniel Bernstein
   to determine whether the Professor has the right to teach
   about cryptography, and collaborate with his peers around the
   world. A major point is whether he can publish source code that foreigners
   might be able to access, or speak it directly to individual who might
   be foreign. The case rests on established First Amendment law
   and relies on the fact that computer source code is human-to-human
   communication protected by the First Amendment (in addition to anything
   else it might be useful for.)

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<DT><a href="book_1st.request"><B>book_1st.request</B></a>
<DD>initial request to transfer jurisdiction from
    State Dept. (who routinely deny export approval) to
    Commerce Dept. (who routinely approve) for Bruce
    Schneier's _Applied_Cryptography_ book, published by
    John Wiley &amp; Sons. The book, and later separately
    available diskette, are clearly exportable, and clearly
    are the jurisdiction of the Commerce Dept. 
<DT><a href="book_1st.response"><B>book_1st.response</B></a>
<DD>Request granted, as book is &quot;public domain&quot; and out-
    side State jurisdiction. State dept. specifically states
    that a special 2-disk set of related code available from
    Schneier is not covered by the ruling (not to be
    confused with the diskette that is the subject of the
    2nd request, below) which contains only source code
    that is in the book, approved for export in hardcopy).
<DT><a href="floppy_2nd.request"><B>floppy_2nd.request</B></a>
<DD>Attempt to convince State dept. to transfer
    control of the single floppy that was created and
    distributed separately as an adjunct to the book,
    (containing only source code that is in the book, 
    approved for export in hardcopy) to the Commerce Dept...
<DT><a href="floppy_3rd.request"><B>floppy_3rd.request</B></a>
<DD>Phil Karn filed his 2nd CJR (floppy_2nd.request) on
    March 8, 1994, as soon as he got the response to the
    first one, but the State Department tarried long
    beyond their 15-working-day limit for telling Phil
    whether he can export this floppy or not. Phil sent in
    this further request that they answer him, Apr. 19, 94.
    He also kept calling them, and Alan Suchinsky of the
    Office of Defense Trade Controls returned his call on
    May 10th, saying that the response had been rewritten
    twice but was going to be finalized that week.
<DT><a href="floppy_2nd.response"><B>floppy_2nd.response</B></a>
<DD>Request denied! State holds that they have
    jurisdiction, and that the material is *not* public
    domain, protected by the 1st Amendment, or exportable.
    Authors maintain this is &quot;nonsense&quot;, and that this
    is unconstitutional. State says that &quot;The text
    files on the subject disk are not an exact
    representation of what is found in 'Applied
    Cryptography.' Each source code listing has been
    partitioned into its own file and has the capability of
    being easily compiled into an executable
    subroutine.&quot; As a result, &quot;This article is
    designated as a defense article under category
    XIII(b)(1) of the United States Munitions List.&quot;
    In other words, State maintains that because the source
    code is in several files instead of jumbled into one
    file, it is therefore &quot;not an exact representation&quot;
    of the original, and makes it fairly plain that the
    real reason for denying the CJR is because it is
    useful for its intended purpose (e.g. easy to compile,
    as opposed the text in the book, which would have to
    by typed in manually.)
<DT><a href="floppy.appeal"><B>floppy.appeal</B></a>
<DD>Phil filed an appeal on June 9, 1994, challenging both the
    details of the distinction between the paper and floppy
    versions and the Constitutionality of restricting the
    export of the floppy version.
<DT><a href="karn_dos_itar_042895.letter"><B>karn_dos_itar_042895.letter</B></a>
<DD>letter from Phil Karn &amp; attorney to Dept. of
    State, Apr. 28, 1995, warning that if a positive decision
    is not reached immediately by State, Karn will file suit
    against them for violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="nsa_3des_export_denial_0396.letter"><B>nsa_3des_export_denial_0396.letter</B></a>
<DD>[Not directly related to the case, but
    of peripheral interest] Letter from State Dept.'s Office of Defense Trade
    Controls (controled by the National Security Agency) denying Phil Karn
    approval to export software that supports Triple-DES encryption. 
    Interesting especially for 3 reasons: The export has nothing to do with 
    public distribution, but was requested to provide security for the foreign,
    but US-staffed and owned, branch of a US company; such export denial was
    threatened if the X9 Committee which establishes banking security standards
    settled on 3DES instead of Clipper - NSA is making good on its threats; and
    the 3DES export denial portion of the form response appears to be a 
    standard part of the form now (in other words, NSA/DoS may be routinely 
    denying all 3DES exports.)

<DD>Directory of info on PETER D. JUNGER v. DEPARTMENT OF
    STATE, OFFICE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS, &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY case.
    Junger claims the ITAR and AECA export restrictions on encryption
    (particularly the absurdly broad definition of 'export', which includes
    &quot;disclosing&quot; to foreigners, unconstitutionally restricts Jungers First
    Amendment rights to teach a class in which cryptography is detailed,
    if a foreign student is present. Case is closely related to Karn
    case.

<DT><a href="960724_isoc_crypto.statement"><B>960724_isoc_crypto.statement</B></a>
<DD>Statement on cryptographic technology and
    the Internet, from Internet Architecture Board and Internet Engineering
    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;
<DT><a href="9606_pff_crypto.report"><B>9606_pff_crypto.report</B></a>
<DD>&quot;The Computer Revolution, Encryption &amp; True 
    Threats to National Security&quot;; report condemning Clinton Adminstration
    encryption export policy and key &quot;escrow&quot; plans, by G.A. Keyworth II 
    and David E. Colton, for the Progress and Freedom Foundation. HTML
    version available at http://www.pff.org/pff/encry.html at the PFF site.
    Co-author Keyworth was US President Ronald Reagan's scient advisor.
<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report</B></a>
<DD>May 1996 (pre-publication draft) 
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the 
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of 
    export restrictions. Unfortunately, report also calls for key &quot;escrow&quot;, 
    and buys into the government's wacky idea of a federally-controlled &quot;Key 
    Infrastructure&quot;, among other flaws. NOTE: This file is over 1 megabyte.
    See 9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz for a gzip-compressed version.
<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz</B></a>
<DD>gzip-compressed version of above 
    NRC report (about 450K).
<DT><a href="alt_escrow_idea.debate"><B>alt_escrow_idea.debate</B></a>
<DD>Brief debate on two alternative key &quot;escrow&quot; ideas:
    proposal by Dave Staelin for a system in which users choose any crypto 
    but are required to retain copies of all keys used, said keys being 
    obtainable by subpoena or warrant; modified proposal by Ron Rivest, in 
    which copies of keys are held by a &quot;trusted&quot; third party who can be 
    subpoenaed or searched by court order, keeping the escrow &quot;feature&quot; but 
    removing the storage burden on the user. These proposals are followed by
    technical and (brief) legal critique by Matt Blaze, who points out
    fundamental problems in both systems, and finds them infeasible.
<DT><a href="clipper_nist.defense"><B>clipper_nist.defense</B></a>
<DD>1994 statement by NIST regarding key escrow and
    how it is intended to be &quot;voluntary&quot;. NIST maintains the same thing in
    1995, even though FOIA-obtained documents *prove* this is a lie! (see
    /pub/Privacy/Clipper/Clipper_FOIA/
<DT><a href="cops_net_architecture_johnson.article"><B>cops_net_architecture_johnson.article</B></a>
<DD>&quot;Law Enforcement and The
    Architecture of Cyberspace -- Should the Cops on the Beat Design the
    Electronic Street?&quot;, article by David Johnson. Excerpt: &quot;The
    Administration has made its position clear: it will seek to
    encourage the use of the &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; and push for legislation that
    will require electronic communications systems to be designed to
    facilitate wiretapping and surveillance in real time...So we have a set
    of proposals that, in somewhat breath-taking fashion, claim for the
    cops not only the right to walk the beat but a privilege to say just
    how the street will be designed...But no such origin accounts for
    our best public spaces and I can tell you...that putting wiretapping
    at the top of the design priority list is a really dumb idea...&quot;
<DT><a href="denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article"><B>denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article</B></a>
<DD>Paper by Dr. Dorothy Denning
    that paints a picture of imminent &quot;crypto-anarchy&quot; disrupting society if
    all citizens are not required to turn over encryption keys to government
    (via governmental or corporate key &quot;escrow&quot; agencies.) Includes a 
    critique that illuminates many of the logic flaws and fallcies 
    necessary to support GAK (government access to keys) plans like those 
    advocated by Denning and the NSA. All in all, a very strange rant.
<DT><a href="epic_fbi_crypto_childporn.alert"><B>epic_fbi_crypto_childporn.alert</B></a>
<DD>EPIC mini-alert, reporting that FBI 
    director Louis Freeh has already, as of Oct. 95, begun to attack 
    cryptography as a hindrance to law enforcement with &quot;evidence&quot; that FBI 
    efforts were hindered by encrypted files in a recent child porn 
    investigation.
<DT><a href="ellison_key_escrow.paper"><B>ellison_key_escrow.paper</B></a>
<DD>&quot;The Government Doesn't Want Key Escrow&quot;, Carl
    Ellison. Demonostrates that what the govt. really wants is access to 
    citizen encryption keys, and that &quot;escrow&quot; is only one way to go about
    this.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515.letter"><B>hr_crypto_960515.letter</B></a>
<DD>Letter from Rep. Goodlatte (and over 20 other
    Representatives) to Clinton Administration urging relaxation of crypto
    export controls and abandonment of Clipper III &quot;key escrow&quot; proposals.
    Also includes Goodlatte press release regarding the letter.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement"><B>hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement</B></a>
<DD>Brief EFF statement on the House
    letter to Clinton demanding abandonment of &quot;key escrow&quot; and urging
    relaxation of export controls. (Also includes a copy of the letter).

<DD>link to directory on Clipper, the
    first US government key &quot;escrow&quot; scheme, and related plans, including
    Capstone and Tessera, higher-speed versions of Clipper (All are based
    on the classified Skipjack algorithm, NIST's Escrowed Encryption Standard)
    Most of the action on this issue was 1993-4, with focus shifting to
    &quot;Clipper II&quot; and &quot;Clipper III&quot; in subsequent years. [Note: This directory
    is aliased to &quot;Clipper&quot; as well as the longer name, to save typing time

<DD>Directory of info on new (as of Mar. 96) pro-crypto,
    pro-privacy, pro-Net bills introduced by Sen. Leahy (the Encrypted
    Communications Privacy Act) and Rep. Goodlatte (the Security And Freedom
    through Encryption Act), and numerous co-sponsors. Despite a few problems,
    the very similar bills would relax export controls on encryption, allowing
    the full fruition of online privacy, security, authentication and
    commerce. They also take steps (stronger in Goodlatte's version) to
    prevent the mandating of &quot;key escrow&quot; systems.
<DT><a href="Clipper_II/"><B>Clipper_II/</B></A>

<DT><a href="G7/"><B>G7/</B></A>
<DD>directory of info on key &quot;escrow&quot;, crypto export/import, Internet 
    censorship, and other dangerous regulatory resolutions, coming from G7.
    G7 is the &quot;Group of Seven&quot; nations, including the US, Japan, Canada,

<DD>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology's
    analysis of recent US President Clinton's executive order, which
    moves to establish yet another version of encryption key &quot;escrow&quot;, as
    well as sets up a &quot;Crypto Czar&quot; - a new US official of ambassadorial
    stature. The message: The Admin does not intend to lose the Crypto
    War, and is ramping up its efforts to pull an end run around Congress,
    the public, and industry.

<DD>Oct. 10 1996 Clinton Administration key 
    &quot;escrow&quot; and crypto export policy statement. White House say it will 
    allow export of 56bit (still very weak) crypto if the keys are &quot;escrowed&quot;
    in 2 years, and stronger crypto if it is escrowed now. Essentially
    no serious or meaningful change in the Admin's position.

    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and 
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or 
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;

<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report</B></a>
<DD>May 1996 (pre-publication draft)
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of
    export restrictions. Of particular interest is NRC's end-run around the
    NSA's typical line of &quot;if you only knew what we knew...&quot;: NRC members
    obained security clearances and examined the classifed material, too, 
    and still came to the conclusion that export restrictions and imposed
    key escrow are not the solution. Unfortunately, report also calls for 
    key &quot;escrow&quot; to be explored at least for internal government use, among
    several other flaws (from our point of view), mostly minor. The end 
    result is a definitely pro-crypto, pro-privacy position, and this 
    report is likely to be highly influential on the crypto-policy debate.

    hypocritically-titled Clinton Administration key &quot;escrow&quot; scheme -
    the US government wants the keys to YOUR privacy. This time the impetus
    is coming from Interagency Working Group on Cryptographic Policy (IWGCP),
    and Administration old-boys group led by Bruce McConnell and Ed Appel.
    (Slightly earlier drafts were apparently circulated in Washington,

    banking security standards settled on 3DES instead of Clipper - NSA is 
    making good on its threats; and the 3DES export denial portion of the 
    form response appears to be a standard part of the form now (in other 
    words, NSA/DoS may be routinely denying all 3DES exports.)

    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;

<DD>Brief debate on two alternative key &quot;escrow&quot; ideas:
    proposal by Dave Staelin for a system in which users choose any crypto 
    but are required to retain copies of all keys used, said keys being 
    obtainable by subpoena or warrant; modified proposal by Ron Rivest, in 
    which copies of keys are held by a &quot;trusted&quot; third party who can be 
    subpoenaed or searched by court order, keeping the escrow &quot;feature&quot; but 
    removing the storage burden on the user. These proposals are followed by
    technical and (brief) legal critique by Matt Blaze, who points out
    fundamental problems in both systems, and finds them infeasible.

    encourage the use of the &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; and push for legislation that
    will require electronic communications systems to be designed to
    facilitate wiretapping and surveillance in real time...So we have a set
    of proposals that, in somewhat breath-taking fashion, claim for the
    cops not only the right to walk the beat but a privilege to say just
    how the street will be designed...But no such origin accounts for

San Francisco - On Monday, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel struck down Cold War
export restrictions on the privacy technology called cryptography.  Her
decision knocks out a major part of the Clinton Administration's
effort to force companies to build &quot;wiretap-ready&quot; computers,
set-top boxes, telephones, and consumer electronics.

<P>

The decision is a victory for free speech, academic freedom, and the
prevention of crime.  American scientists and engineers will now be
free to collaborate with their peers in the United States and in other
countries.  This will enable them to build a new generation of tools
for protecting the privacy and security of communications.

<P>

The Clinton Administration has been using the export restrictions to goad
companies into building wiretap-ready &quot;key recovery&quot; technology.  
In a November Executive Order, President Clinton offered limited
administrative exemptions from these restrictions to companies which
agree to undermine the privacy of their customers.  Federal District
Judge Patel's ruling knocks both the carrot and the stick out of
Clinton's hand, because the restrictions were unconstitutional in the
first place.

<P>

The Cold War law and regulations at issue in the case prevented American
researchers and companies from exporting cryptographic software and
hardware.  Export is normally thought of as the physical carrying of an
object across a national border.  However, the regulations define
&quot;export&quot; to include simple publication in the U.S., as well as
discussions with foreigners inside the U.S.  They also define
&quot;software&quot; to include printed English-language descriptions and
diagrams, as well as the traditional machine-readable object code and
human-readable source code. 

<P>

The secretive National Security Agency has built up an arcane web of
complex and confusing laws, regulations, standards, and secret
interpretations for years.  These are used to force, persuade, or
confuse individuals, companies, and government departments into making
it easy for NSA to wiretap and decode all kinds of communications.
Their tendrils reach deep into the White House, into numerous Federal
agencies, and into the Congressional Intelligence Committees.  In
recent years this web is unraveling in the face of increasing
visibility, vocal public disagreement with the spy agency's goals,
commercial and political pressure, and judicial scrutiny.

<P>

Civil libertarians have long argued that encryption should be widely
deployed on the Internet and throughout society to protect privacy,
prove the authenticity of transactions, and improve computer security.
Industry has argued that the restrictions hobble them in building
secure products, both for U.S. and worldwide use, risking America's
current dominant position in computer technology.  Government
officials in the FBI and NSA argue that the technology is too
dangerous to permit citizens to use it, because it provides privacy to
criminals as well as ordinary citizens.

<P>

&quot;We're pleased that Judge Patel understands that our national
security requires protecting our basic rights of free speech and
privacy,&quot; said John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, which backed the suit.  &quot;There's no sense in `burning the
Constitution in order to save it'.  The secretive bureaucrats who have
restricted these rights for decades in the name of national security must
come to a larger understanding of how to support and preserve our
democracy.&quot;

<P>

<B>        Reactions to the decision</B>

<P>

&quot;This is a positive sign in the crypto wars -- the first rational
statement concerning crypto policy to come out of any part of the
government,&quot; said Jim Bidzos, President of RSA Data Security, one of
the companies most affected by crypto policy.

<P>

&quot;It's nice to see that the executive branch does not get to decide
whether we have the right of free speech,&quot; said Philip Zimmermann,
Chairman of PGP, Inc.  &quot;It shows that my own common sense
interpretation of the constitution was correct five years ago when I
thought it was safe to publish my own software, PGP.  If only US
Customs had seen it that way.&quot;  Mr. Zimmermann is a civil libertarian
who was investigated by the government under these laws when he wrote
and gave away a program for protecting the privacy of e-mail.  His
&quot;Pretty Good Privacy&quot; program is used by human rights activists
worldwide to protect their workers and informants from torture and
murder by their own countries' secret police.

<P>

&quot;Judge Patel's decision furthers our efforts to enable secure electronic
commerce,&quot; said Asim Abdullah, executive director of CommerceNet.

<P>

Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington-based Internet advocacy group, hailed the
victory.  &quot;The Bernstein ruling illustrates that the Administration
continues to embrace an encryption policy that is not only unwise, but
also unconstitutional.  We congratulate Dan Bernstein, the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, and all of the supporters who made this victory
for free speech and privacy on the Internet possible.&quot;

<P>

&quot;The ability to publish is required in any vibrant academic
discipline. This ruling re-affirming our obvious academic right will
help American researchers publish without worrying,&quot; said Bruce
Schneier, author of the popular textbook <I>Applied Cryptography</I>, and
a director of the International Association for Cryptologic Research, a
professional organization of cryptographers. 

<P>

Kevin McCurley, President of the International Association for
Cryptologic Research, said, &quot;Basic research to further the
understanding of fundamental notions in information should be welcomed
by our society.  The expression of such work is closely related to one
of the fundamental values of our society, namely freedom of speech.&quot;

<P>

<B>        Background on the case</B>

<P>

The plaintiff in the case, Daniel J. Bernstein, Research Assistant
Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, developed an
&quot;encryption algorithm&quot; (a recipe or set of instructions) that he
wanted to publish in printed journals as well as on the Internet.
Bernstein sued the government, claiming that the government's
requirements that he register as an arms dealer and seek government
permission before publication was a violation of his First Amendment
right of free speech.  This is required by the Arms Export Control Act
and its implementing regulations, the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations.

<P>

In the first phase of this litigation, the government argued that
since Bernstein's ideas were expressed, in part, in computer language
(source code), they were not protected by the First Amendment.  On
April 15, 1996, Judge Patel rejected that argument and held for the
first time that computer source code is protected speech for purposes
of the First Amendment.

<P>

<B>        Details of Monday's Decision</B>

<P>

Judge Patel ruled that the Arms Export Control Act is a prior restraint
on speech, because it requires Bernstein to apply for and obtain from
the government a license to publish his ideas.  Using the Pentagon
Papers case as precedent, she ruled that the government's &quot;interest of
national security alone does not justify a prior restraint.&quot;

<P>

Judge Patel also held that the government's required licensing
procedure fails to provide adequate procedural safeguards.  When the
Government acts legally to suppress protected speech, it must reduce
the chance of illegal censorship by the bureacrats involved -- in this
case, the State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls.  Her
decision states, &quot;Because the ITAR licensing scheme fails to provide
for a time limit on the licensing decision, for prompt judicial review
and for a duty on the part of the ODTC to go to court and defend a
denial of a license, the ITAR licensing scheme as applied to Category
XIII(b) acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the
First Amendment.&quot; Professor Bernstein is now free to publish his ideas
without asking the government's permission first.

<P>

She also ruled that the export controls restrict speech based on the
content of the speech, not for any other reason.  &quot;Category XIII(b) is
directed very specifically at applied scientific research and speech on
the topic of encryption.&quot;  The Government had argued that it restricts
the speech because of its function, not its content.

<P>

The judge also found that the ITAR is vague, because it does not
adequately define how information that is available to the public
&quot;through fundamental research in science and engineering&quot; is exempt
from the export restrictions.  &quot;This subsection ... does not give
people ... a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.&quot; The
failure to precisely define what objects and actions are being
regulated creates confusion and a chilling effect.  Bernstein has been
unable to publish his encryption algorithm for over four years.  Many
other cryptographers and ordinary programmers have also been restrained
from publishing because of the vagueness of the ITAR.  Brian
Behlendorf, a maintainer of the popular public domain &quot;Apache&quot; web
server program, stated, &quot;No cryptographic source code was ever
distributed by the Apache project.  Despite this, the Apache server
code was deemed by the NSA to violate the ITAR.&quot;  Judge Patel also
adopted a narrower definition of the term &quot;defense article&quot; in 
order to save it from unconstitutional vagueness.

<P>

The immediate effect of this decision is that Bernstein now is free to
teach his January 13th cryptography class in his usual way.  He can
post his class materials on the Internet, and discuss the upcoming
class's materials with other professors, without being held in
violation of the ITAR.  &quot;I'm very pleased,&quot; Bernstein said.  
&quot;Now I won't have to tell my students to burn their notebooks.&quot;


<P>

It is unclear exactly where Judge Patel's decision applies -- in the
Northern District of California (containing San Francisco and Silicon
Valley) or throughout the country.  Check with your own lawyer if
you contemplate taking action based on the decision.

<P>

It is not yet clear from the decision whether the export controls on
object code (the executable form of computer programs which source
code is automatically translated into) have been overturned.  It may
be that existing export controls will continue to apply to runnable
software products, such as Netscape's broswer, until another court
case challenges that part of the restrictions.

These are the letters written by Dan Bernstein and by the Office of Defense Trad Controls, regarding Bernstein's Snuffle encryption program, which the ODTC has obstinately regarded as a "defense article," with all the limitations upon export, etc., that go with that designation.  Bernstein's case is now in court, and is considered a prime testing ground for the legality of current restrictions upon encryption algorithms.

<DT><a href="book_1st.request"><B>book_1st.request</B></a>
<DD>initial request to transfer jurisdiction from
    State Dept. (who routinely deny export approval) to
    Commerce Dept. (who routinely approve) for Bruce
    Schneier's _Applied_Cryptography_ book, published by
    John Wiley &amp; Sons. The book, and later separately
    available diskette, are clearly exportable, and clearly
    are the jurisdiction of the Commerce Dept. 
<DT><a href="book_1st.response"><B>book_1st.response</B></a>
<DD>Request granted, as book is &quot;public domain&quot; and out-
    side State jurisdiction. State dept. specifically states
    that a special 2-disk set of related code available from
    Schneier is not covered by the ruling (not to be
    confused with the diskette that is the subject of the
    2nd request, below) which contains only source code
    that is in the book, approved for export in hardcopy).
<DT><a href="floppy_2nd.request"><B>floppy_2nd.request</B></a>
<DD>Attempt to convince State dept. to transfer
    control of the single floppy that was created and
    distributed separately as an adjunct to the book,
    (containing only source code that is in the book, 
    approved for export in hardcopy) to the Commerce Dept...
<DT><a href="floppy_3rd.request"><B>floppy_3rd.request</B></a>
<DD>Phil Karn filed his 2nd CJR (floppy_2nd.request) on
    March 8, 1994, as soon as he got the response to the
    first one, but the State Department tarried long
    beyond their 15-working-day limit for telling Phil
    whether he can export this floppy or not. Phil sent in
    this further request that they answer him, Apr. 19, 94.
    He also kept calling them, and Alan Suchinsky of the
    Office of Defense Trade Controls returned his call on
    May 10th, saying that the response had been rewritten
    twice but was going to be finalized that week.
<DT><a href="floppy_2nd.response"><B>floppy_2nd.response</B></a>
<DD>Request denied! State holds that they have
    jurisdiction, and that the material is *not* public
    domain, protected by the 1st Amendment, or exportable.
    Authors maintain this is &quot;nonsense&quot;, and that this
    is unconstitutional. State says that &quot;The text
    files on the subject disk are not an exact
    representation of what is found in 'Applied
    Cryptography.' Each source code listing has been
    partitioned into its own file and has the capability of
    being easily compiled into an executable
    subroutine.&quot; As a result, &quot;This article is
    designated as a defense article under category
    XIII(b)(1) of the United States Munitions List.&quot;
    In other words, State maintains that because the source
    code is in several files instead of jumbled into one
    file, it is therefore &quot;not an exact representation&quot;
    of the original, and makes it fairly plain that the
    real reason for denying the CJR is because it is
    useful for its intended purpose (e.g. easy to compile,
    as opposed the text in the book, which would have to
    by typed in manually.)
<DT><a href="floppy.appeal"><B>floppy.appeal</B></a>
<DD>Phil filed an appeal on June 9, 1994, challenging both the
    details of the distinction between the paper and floppy
    versions and the Constitutionality of restricting the
    export of the floppy version.
<DT><a href="karn_dos_itar_042895.letter"><B>karn_dos_itar_042895.letter</B></a>
<DD>letter from Phil Karn &amp; attorney to Dept. of
    State, Apr. 28, 1995, warning that if a positive decision
    is not reached immediately by State, Karn will file suit
    against them for violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="nsa_3des_export_denial_0396.letter"><B>nsa_3des_export_denial_0396.letter</B></a>
<DD>[Not directly related to the case, but
    of peripheral interest] Letter from State Dept.'s Office of Defense Trade
    Controls (controled by the National Security Agency) denying Phil Karn
    approval to export software that supports Triple-DES encryption. 
    Interesting especially for 3 reasons: The export has nothing to do with 
    public distribution, but was requested to provide security for the foreign,
    but US-staffed and owned, branch of a US company; such export denial was
    threatened if the X9 Committee which establishes banking security standards
    settled on 3DES instead of Clipper - NSA is making good on its threats; and
    the 3DES export denial portion of the form response appears to be a 
    standard part of the form now (in other words, NSA/DoS may be routinely 
    denying all 3DES exports.)

    &quot;disclosing&quot; to foreigners, unconstitutionally restricts Jungers First
    Amendment rights to teach a class in which cryptography is detailed,
    if a foreign student is present. Case is closely related to Karn
    case.

<h6>Last Updated Mon Dec 30 21:58:21 PDT 1996</h6><br>
<br>
   An EFF-sponsored lawsuit by Professor Daniel Bernstein
   to determine whether the Professor has the right to teach
   about cryptography, and collaborate with his peers around the
   world. A major point is whether he can publish source code that foreigners
   might be able to access, or speak it directly to individual who might
   be foreign. The case rests on established First Amendment law
   and relies on the fact that computer source code is human-to-human
   communication protected by the First Amendment (in addition to anything
   else it might be useful for.)

Each icon is a clickable link to itself. Click-and-hold in Netscape & pick
save to download, or click and release to download a copy (e.g. to load to disk).
<BR><HR><BR>
You can get a <A HREF="ribbon.tar.gz">tar-archived, gzip-compressed</A>, or

New (Feb. 21): <A HREF="blueribbon.wrl">Blue ribbon "virtual reality icon"</A> (VRML .wrl format).
To inline in Netscape 2.0 page, use HTML commands like so:<BR>
&lt;embed src="blueribbon.wrl" width=128 height=128 border=0 align=middle&gt;
<BR>NOTE: Requires Netscape's Live3D Plug-In for in-line viewing, or any VRML
browser helper-app for download-and-play viewing.
<P>
New (Feb. 22): <A HREF="ribbongifuu.sig">Blue Ribbon GIF file, uuencoded,
for inclusion in signature files</A>. Netscape and other browsers capable of
processing uuencoded GIFs in email/news signatures will be able to
download and extract the image.  NOTE: Netiquette prefers short sig
files, so it may not be a good idea to use this one indefinitely. But
it'll be an eye-catcher for a while.

NOTE: You do <B>NOT</B> need to ask for permission to use these graphics.
They are public domain, created either by EFF, or by people who have
voluntarily donated new icons to the collection.<BR><HR><BR>

[You will need to get InfoZip's unzip utility. It can be found at ftp.eff.org,
pub/Net_info/Tools/unzip_vms.exe (see also the README.unzip_VMS in that 
directory) for the VMS version.  For the Unix version, get unzip50.tar.gz, 
in the same directory.]

	    About the Hytelnet Software  - July 6, 1993
	    ===========================

The Hytelnet software (version 3) consists of the following files:

    FILENAME       DESCRIPTION                       PLATFORM
                                                     Unix  VMS

    index	   Index (used by the 'i' command)     x    x
    help	   Hytelnet help screen                x    x
    read.me	   Some info on hytelnet               x    x
    start	   The 'Welcome to Hytelnet' screen    x    x
    whatis	   Still more info on Hytelnet         x    x

Note:

    In order to use the Unix or VMS versions of Hytelnet you must have
    the PC version.  The PC version is available via anonymous ftp from
    ftp.usask.ca (128.233.3.11) in the /hytelnet/pc directory.

    If you do not already have an unzip utility for Unix, you can get
    unzip50.tar.Z from the ../hytelnet/unix directory on ftp.usask.ca.

    If you do not already have an unzip utility for VMS, you can get
    unzip50.exe from the ../hytelnet/vms directory on ftp.usask.ca.
 

To make and install the Unix version:

    First install the files from the PC version of Hytelnet on your
    Unix host.  For example: 

    % cd /usr/local/hytelnet
    % unzip hyteln65.zip	(extract readnow and hytelnet.zip)
    % unzip -a hytelnet.zip	(extract the rest)
    % rm *.zip *.exe help.txt read.me start.txt whatis

    Then install the Unix Hytelnet files:

    % gunzip hytelnet.tar.gz
    % tar -xvf hytelnet.tar
    % make hytelnet

    The help, read.me, start, whatis and index files from this archive
    should be placed in the same directory as the unziped PC Hytelnet
    files.


To make and install the VMS version:
 
    First install the files from the PC version of Hytelnet on your
    VMS host.  Then make Hytelnet.  For example:
 
    $ set default pub:[hytelnet]
    $ unzip hyteln65.zip        (extract readnow and hytelnet.zip)
    $ unzip -a hytelnet.zip     (extract the rest)
    $ del *.zip.,*.exe.,help.txt.,read.me.,start.txt.,whatis..
 
    Then copy the VMS Hytelnet files into this directory and make the
    VMS version of Hytelnet:
 
    $ copy ...
    $ @make      (use "@make multinet" if you use Multinet)
 
    The help, read.me, start, whatis and index files from the VMS version
    should be placed in the same directory as the unziped PC Hytelnet
    files.
 
    Note: for the benefit of VMS users who do not have a C compiler,
          I have placed two pre-compiled versions of hytelnet
	  in the vms directory.  These are: hytelnet.exe and
	  hytelnet-multinet.exe.

Telnet, tn3270, rlogin, finger, ftp, pad

    The Unix and VMS versions of Hytelnet notice these commands
    embedded in the database, and will execute them for the user,
    if desired.


Configuration

    If you install the Hytelnet data files somewhere other than in
    /usr/local/hytelnet (pub:[hytelnet] on VMS), you will have to
    change the definition of STARTDIR in hytelnet.c.

    You can disable the execution of external commands by running
    Hytelnet with the -secure option.  Or you can edit the makefile and
    define SECURE before compiling the program.

    On VMS systems, external command execution is automatically disabled
    for anonymous users (those who login under the name 'hytelnet').

    On Unix systems, it is disabled for anonymous users from outside
    the local domain.  For this to work, edit hytelnet.c and define
    DOMAIN_CUE to be a unique substring of your domain (eg. ".usask.ca").

    To allow anonymous users to telnet-out, edit hytelnet.c and change
    the definition of ANONYMOUS_USER to "".

    A few sites require that a port number be specified in the
    telnet command.  The syntax for this varies on VMS and DOS systems.
    If this doesn't work for you, you may have to play around with the
    definition of PORTSEP in hytelnet.c.


Please let me know if you have any problems with the Unix or VMS
versions of Hytelnet.

<DD>Guidelines for creating a new version or 
    translation of the Guide.
<DT><a href="netguide.eff"><B>netguide.eff</B></a>
<DD>The one you are probably looking for. This is the basic
    Unix text file version of BDGttI. If you are using DOS this
    will probably work for you too. If you have line length
    problems, get the ZIP'd version below. This file always
    contains the most current version of the text (&quot;fancy&quot; 
    versions such as PostScript, hypertext, etc., may be somewhat 
    older, as they take time to create after the text version is
    released.)
<DT><a href="netgd3_1.zip"><B>netgd3_1.zip</B></a>
<DD>A ZIP'd-up DOS text version of EGttI. Differs from
    netguide.eff only in that each line ends with a cr/lf
    character pair, instead of just lf. May make it easier to
    view it on a DOS system. 
<DT><a href="netguide_3.1.txt"><B>netguide_3.1.txt</B></a>
<DD>A link to netguide.eff for those that like long names.
    Incidentally, gives the current version number for
    your convenience. Especially intended for sysadmins
    and other Internet and FirstClass redistributors, as
    well as Mac and Amiga users (see also Other_versions/
    subdirectory for &quot;fancy&quot; formatted versions of the
    Guide.) 
<DT><a href="netguide.faq"><B>netguide.faq</B></a>
<DD>This is Joke's Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (FAQ)
    document about EGttI. It should answer almost any query
    about EGttI as it is very in-depth, covering the purpose,
    creation, and location of EGttI including all versions/
    formats and multiple archive sites. Get it! READ it!

<DD>&quot;An Efficient Off-line Electronic Cash System
    Based on the Representation Problem&quot;, Stefan Brands, 1991. Technical
    paper; abstract (in part): &quot;We present a new off-line electronic cash
    system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which 
    little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first 
    to be based entirely on discrete logarithms. Using the represenation 
    problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us 
    to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut 
    and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash 
    system is much more efficient in both computation and communciation 
    complexity than previously proposed systems...Contrary to previously 
    proposed systems, [our system's] correctness can be mathematically 
    proven to a very great extent...Our system offers a number of 
    extensions that are hard to acheive in previously known systems...&quot;

<DD>&quot;Single Term Off-Line Coins&quot;, Niels
    Ferguson. Technical article; abstract: &quot;We present a new construction for
    off-line electronic coins that is both far more efficient and much simpler
    that previous systems. Instead of using many terms, each for a single bit
    of the challenge, our system uses a single term for a large number of 
    possible challenges. The withdrawal protocol does not use a 
    cut-and-choose methodology as with earlier systems, but uses a direct 
    construction.&quot; 1991. This is a gzip-compressed PostScript file.

<DD>&quot;The Unscrupulous Diner's Dilemma and

    ultimate implication, I believe, is that to achieve a civilized form
    of cyberspace, we have to limit the use of anonymous communications.
    Many early citizens of cyberspace will bitterly oppose any such
    development, arguing that anonymous and pseudonymous electronic
    communications are vital to preserve electronic freedoms and allow free
    expression of human personality. But the problem with that view is that
    we all collectively face the diners' dilemma -- we must collaborate in
    groups to build a rich social fabric, and we know that the ability to
    act anonymously, sporadically, in large groups brings out the worst in
    human character.&quot; One of Mr. Johnson's more controversial pieces.

<DD>File containing NIST's August 1991 notice requesting 
    comments on a proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for
    Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This proposed standard
    specifies a public- key based digital signature algorithm (DSA)
    appropriate for Federal digital signature applications. The proposed
    DSS uses a public key to verify to a recipient the integrity of data and
    the identity of the sender of the data. The DSS can also be used by a
    third party to ascertain the authenticity of a signature and the data
    associated with it. 
<DT><a href="fips_dss_proposed.standard"><B>fips_dss_proposed.standard</B></a>
<DD>File containing August 1991 announcement by 
    NIST of the proposed Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This standard 
    specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which can be used to 
    generate a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect 
    unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of 
    the user who generates the signature. In addition, the recipient of 
    signed data can use a digital signature in proving to a third party that 
    the signature was in fact generated by the signer of the data. This is 
    known as nonrepudiation since the signer of data cannot, at a later time, 
    repudiate the signature.

<DD>Cisco Systems press release announcing
    release of new version of ISAKMP+Oakely Internet key management daemon.
    The &quot;Internet Security Association &amp; Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)&quot; 
    is a leading proposal within the IETF to provide standard key 
    management for Internet protocols, including IP Security (IPsec) and 
    also for other network layers such as Transport-Layer Security (TLS). 
    ISAKMP provides a scalable, flexible, and secure mechanism for 
    establishing Security Associations among a set of communicating 
    network parties. The &quot;Oakley Session Key Exchange (Oakley)&quot; provides 
    a hybrid Diffie-Hellman session key exchange for use within the 
    ISAKMP framework. Oakley provides the important property of 
    &quot;Perfect Forward Secrecy&quot;, among other attributes.

  These documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act
  by EFF Board member John Gilmore, through his lawyer, Lee Tien.
  Each document was scanned in, then proofread for obvious mistakes.
<P>
  Footnotes were used in many documents; as a rule, the general
  format of the page was kept, and footnotes are indicated by the note
  number in brackets, i.e. [n.1].  The text of each footnote appears at
  the bottom of the page, separated by a short line of "=" signs.
<P>
  Section symbols were replaced by a "s.".  If a document was signed,
  the signature is indicated by (signed:) followed by the name of the
  person signing the document.  If there is no "(signed)", the document
  was not signed.  Anything not in the original text is bracketed.<P>

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<H2><CENTER>Simple Song</CENTER></H2>
Here is a simple song<BR>
heartfelt though not long<BR>
meant to clarify <BR>
the words that I<BR>
have muttered in such varried verses understandable only to me<BR>
that is, to make clear how dearly I love thee.<BR>
<P>
And here is the other verse<BR>
to fill in the gaps in the first<BR>
which is only a thanks from me<BR>
for being the ground under my feet<BR>
and both the structure and the tucker-under-the-covers and sheets<BR>
of my reality<BR>
from which I stray<BR>
into the sea of illusion which is my life.<BR>

<H1>About the CAF mailing lists (and newsgroups)</H1>
<PRE>

A description of the comp-academic-freedom-talk mailing list. It is a
free-forum for the discussion of questions such as: How should general
principles of academic freedom (such as freedom of expression, freedom
to read, due process, and privacy) be applied to university computers
and networks? How are these principles actually being applied? How can
the principles of academic freedom as applied to computers and
networks be defended?

<DD>&quot;The Coming Jurisdictional Swamp of
    Global Internetworking (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love
    Anonymity)&quot;, by Douglas Barnes. Overview of several reasons why
    anonymity on the Net is a good idea, and a look at the many ways in
    which a foreign jurisdiction can exercise authority over citizens of
    other countries.
<DT><a href="between_global_and_local.paper"><B>between_global_and_local.paper</B></a>
<DD>William Uncapher's &quot;Between Local and 
    Global: Placing the Mediascape in the Transnational Cultural Flow&quot; 
    (draft). Excerpt: &quot;The ongoing integration of media systems world 
    wide provides an essential component to the emerging disciplines and 
    theories of globalization. And yet a persistent and institutionalized 
    theorizing of media systems into either 'mass' or 'interpersonal' 
    realms continues to obscure many of the complex, even revolutionary 
    changes presently occurring at intermediate levels...&quot;
<DT><a href="content_regulation_johnson.article"><B>content_regulation_johnson.article</B></a>
<DD>&quot;Taking Cyberspace Seriously:
    Dealing with Obnoxious Messages on the Net&quot;, David Johnson. Excerpt:
    &quot;Territorially-based laws fail us when we confront new phenomena
    involving participants whose geographical locations span legal
    jurisdictions and have little relationship to the locus of the harms they
    might inflict...we can reduce the intensity of the debate, and find some
    real solutions...if we take seriously the idea that cyberspace is a
    separate place...fully absorb the fact that most communications on the
    net amount to the joint creation of a new shared space allowing the
    assembly of like-minded individuals.&quot;
<DT><a href="cyberjuris_quidproquo_johnson.article"><B>cyberjuris_quidproquo_johnson.article</B></a>
<DD>&quot;Jurisdictional Quid Pro Quo and
    the Law of Cyberspace&quot;, article by David Johnson. Excerpt: &quot;...both
    national and international law doctrines regarding jurisdiction rely
    heavily on questions regarding the (1) the extent of the voluntary
    &quot;contacts&quot; the relevant person has had with the interested jurisdiction
    and (2) the fairness of asserting personal jurisdiction over the acts
    of a foreign person. There is a sliding scale, with the importance of
    looking to fairness becoming greater as the extent of contacts diminishes.
    There may also be a corrollation between a state's assertion of
    jurisdiction over a person or matter and its practical ability to
    enforce a judgment.&quot;
<DT><a href="cyberlaw_johnson.article"><B>cyberlaw_johnson.article</B></a>
<DD>&quot;Lawmaking and Law Enforcement in Cyberspace&quot;,
    article by David Johnson. Excerpt: &quot;One way to advance exploration of
    the question whether Cyberspace should be self-regulating (or,
    perhaps, even &quot;sovereign&quot; within its sphere) is to discuss in concrete
    terms how the law of Cyberspace can be made and enforced so as to
    achieve both effectiveness and fundamental principles of fairness.&quot;
<DT><a href="global_civil_soc_networks.paper"><B>global_civil_soc_networks.paper</B></a>
<DD>&quot;Computer Networks and the Emergence of
    Global Civil Society: The Case of the Association for Progressive
    Communications&quot;, paper presented at the Annual Conf. on Peace Studies,
    Boulder CO, Feb. 28, 1992, by Howard H. Frederick. Excerpt: &quot;The growth
    of...global interdependent communication relations has been greatly
    accelerated by the advent of decentralizing communication technologies
    such as computer networking. Global civil society as represented by
    the &quot;NGO Movement&quot; (nongovernmental organizations) now represents a
    force in international relations, one that circumvents hegemony of
    markets and of governments. This paper outlines the concept of global
    civil society and the NGO Movement, describes the obstacles that they
    face from governments and transnational corporations, and sketches the
    emergence of the Association for Progressive Communications network
    as an illustration of this worldwide phenomenon.'
<DT><a href="iu.plague.073196.article"><B>iu.plague.073196.article</B></a>
<DD>Governments around the globe are rushing to
    barricade their borders, dam the flow of foreign data, and create a
    new world information order. Cover story of August 1996 Internet
    Underground magazine: &quot;Plague of Freedom&quot;, by Declan McCullagh.
<DT><a href="russian_coup_netuse.article"><B>russian_coup_netuse.article</B></a>
<DD>Laurence Press' August 1991 collection of
    information and postings related to how the Internet was used in the
    Russian coup.
<DT><a href="whole_world_talking.article"><B>whole_world_talking.article</B></a>
<DD>Kevin Cooke and Dan Lehrer article, &quot;The 
    Internet: The Whole World is Talking&quot;, from The Nation, July 12, 1993.
    Covers use of Internet in Russian coup and other examples of the Net
    trascending national borders. Also doubles as an OK introduction to
    what the Internet is and what its potential is, as well as the threats
    to it.

<DD>1994 statement by NIST regarding key escrow and

  Each document was scanned in, then proofread for obvious mistakes.
<P>
  Footnotes were used in many documents; as a rule, the general
  format of the page was kept, and footnotes are indicated by the note
  number in brackets, i.e. [n.1].  The text of each footnote appears at
  the bottom of the page, separated by a short line of "=" signs.
<P>
  Section symbols were replaced by a "s.".  If a document was signed,
  the signature is indicated by (signed:) followed by the name of the
  person signing the document.  If there is no "(signed)", the document
  was not signed.  Anything not in the original text is bracketed.<P>

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<DD>File containing NIST's August 1991 notice requesting 
    comments on a proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for
    Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This proposed standard
    specifies a public- key based digital signature algorithm (DSA)
    appropriate for Federal digital signature applications. The proposed
    DSS uses a public key to verify to a recipient the integrity of data and
    the identity of the sender of the data. The DSS can also be used by a
    third party to ascertain the authenticity of a signature and the data
    associated with it. 
<DT><a href="fips_dss_proposed.standard"><B>fips_dss_proposed.standard</B></a>
<DD>File containing August 1991 announcement by 
    NIST of the proposed Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This standard 
    specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which can be used to 
    generate a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect 
    unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of 
    the user who generates the signature. In addition, the recipient of 
    signed data can use a digital signature in proving to a third party that 
    the signature was in fact generated by the signer of the data. This is 
    known as nonrepudiation since the signer of data cannot, at a later time, 
    repudiate the signature.

<DT><a href="nist_dss.bulletin"><B>nist_dss.bulletin</B></a>
<DD>The National Institute of Standards and Technology 
    (NIST) has proposed a public key-based Digital Signature Standard (DSS).
    This CSL Bulletin provides agencies with information regarding the 
    proposed standard and describes several applications which may benefit 
    from the DSS.
<DT><a href="nist_dss_clipper_des_042993.testimony"><B>nist_dss_clipper_des_042993.testimony</B></a>
<DD>File containing statement of
    Raymond Kammer, Acting Director, National Institute of Standards and
    Technology, before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and 
    Finance (Committee on Energy and Commerce), on April 29, 1993. Kammer
    discusses NIST's activities in telecommunications security, the planned
    recertification of the Data Encryption Standard, the proposed Digital
    Signature Standard, and the Clipper Chip.

  Each document was scanned in, then proofread for obvious mistakes.
<P>
  Footnotes were used in many documents; as a rule, the general
  format of the page was kept, and footnotes are indicated by the note
  number in brackets, i.e. [n.1].  The text of each footnote appears at
  the bottom of the page, separated by a short line of "=" signs.
<P>
  Section symbols were replaced by a "s.".  If a document was signed,
  the signature is indicated by (signed:) followed by the name of the
  person signing the document.  If there is no "(signed)", the document

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the end of 1996, the National Center for Human Genome Research (NCHGR), 
decided to drop the use of Lotus Notes as their groupware standard in 
favor of a web-based intranet.  As webmaster, I has the pleasure of being 
asked to replicate the functionality of Lotus Notes on the web to the 
best of my ability.  

<P>

In a matter of months I was able to develop CGI-based versions of a
groupware calendar, a bulletin/discussion board, a sitewide keyword search
engine, and helped in the development of a real-time chat program.  These
applications have been heavily used for a multitude of intranet
applications. 

<P>

As with all of my work, script text and working examples are available 
as public domain freeware at

<DT><a href="960724_isoc_crypto.statement"><B>960724_isoc_crypto.statement</B></a>
<DD>Statement on cryptographic technology and
    the Internet, from Internet Architecture Board and Internet Engineering
    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;
<DT><a href="9606_pff_crypto.report"><B>9606_pff_crypto.report</B></a>
<DD>&quot;The Computer Revolution, Encryption &amp; True 
    Threats to National Security&quot;; report condemning Clinton Adminstration
    encryption export policy and key &quot;escrow&quot; plans, by G.A. Keyworth II 
    and David E. Colton, for the Progress and Freedom Foundation. HTML
    version available at http://www.pff.org/pff/encry.html at the PFF site.
    Co-author Keyworth was US President Ronald Reagan's scient advisor.
<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report</B></a>
<DD>May 1996 (pre-publication draft) 
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the 
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of 
    export restrictions. Unfortunately, report also calls for key &quot;escrow&quot;, 
    and buys into the government's wacky idea of a federally-controlled &quot;Key 
    Infrastructure&quot;, among other flaws. NOTE: This file is over 1 megabyte.
    See 9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz for a gzip-compressed version.
<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz</B></a>
<DD>gzip-compressed version of above 
    NRC report (about 450K).
<DT><a href="alt_escrow_idea.debate"><B>alt_escrow_idea.debate</B></a>
<DD>Brief debate on two alternative key &quot;escrow&quot; ideas:
    proposal by Dave Staelin for a system in which users choose any crypto 
    but are required to retain copies of all keys used, said keys being 
    obtainable by subpoena or warrant; modified proposal by Ron Rivest, in 
    which copies of keys are held by a &quot;trusted&quot; third party who can be 
    subpoenaed or searched by court order, keeping the escrow &quot;feature&quot; but 
    removing the storage burden on the user. These proposals are followed by
    technical and (brief) legal critique by Matt Blaze, who points out
    fundamental problems in both systems, and finds them infeasible.
<DT><a href="clipper_nist.defense"><B>clipper_nist.defense</B></a>
<DD>1994 statement by NIST regarding key escrow and
    how it is intended to be &quot;voluntary&quot;. NIST maintains the same thing in
    1995, even though FOIA-obtained documents *prove* this is a lie! (see
    /pub/Privacy/Clipper/Clipper_FOIA/
<DT><a href="cops_net_architecture_johnson.article"><B>cops_net_architecture_johnson.article</B></a>
<DD>&quot;Law Enforcement and The
    Architecture of Cyberspace -- Should the Cops on the Beat Design the
    Electronic Street?&quot;, article by David Johnson. Excerpt: &quot;The
    Administration has made its position clear: it will seek to
    encourage the use of the &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; and push for legislation that
    will require electronic communications systems to be designed to
    facilitate wiretapping and surveillance in real time...So we have a set
    of proposals that, in somewhat breath-taking fashion, claim for the
    cops not only the right to walk the beat but a privilege to say just
    how the street will be designed...But no such origin accounts for
    our best public spaces and I can tell you...that putting wiretapping
    at the top of the design priority list is a really dumb idea...&quot;
<DT><a href="denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article"><B>denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article</B></a>
<DD>Paper by Dr. Dorothy Denning
    that paints a picture of imminent &quot;crypto-anarchy&quot; disrupting society if
    all citizens are not required to turn over encryption keys to government
    (via governmental or corporate key &quot;escrow&quot; agencies.) Includes a 
    critique that illuminates many of the logic flaws and fallcies 
    necessary to support GAK (government access to keys) plans like those 
    advocated by Denning and the NSA. All in all, a very strange rant.
<DT><a href="epic_fbi_crypto_childporn.alert"><B>epic_fbi_crypto_childporn.alert</B></a>
<DD>EPIC mini-alert, reporting that FBI 
    director Louis Freeh has already, as of Oct. 95, begun to attack 
    cryptography as a hindrance to law enforcement with &quot;evidence&quot; that FBI 
    efforts were hindered by encrypted files in a recent child porn 
    investigation.
<DT><a href="ellison_key_escrow.paper"><B>ellison_key_escrow.paper</B></a>
<DD>&quot;The Government Doesn't Want Key Escrow&quot;, Carl
    Ellison. Demonostrates that what the govt. really wants is access to 
    citizen encryption keys, and that &quot;escrow&quot; is only one way to go about
    this.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515.letter"><B>hr_crypto_960515.letter</B></a>
<DD>Letter from Rep. Goodlatte (and over 20 other
    Representatives) to Clinton Administration urging relaxation of crypto
    export controls and abandonment of Clipper III &quot;key escrow&quot; proposals.
    Also includes Goodlatte press release regarding the letter.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement"><B>hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement</B></a>
<DD>Brief EFF statement on the House
    letter to Clinton demanding abandonment of &quot;key escrow&quot; and urging
    relaxation of export controls. (Also includes a copy of the letter).

<DT><a href="Clipper_Capstone_EES_Tessera_Skipjack/"><B>Clipper_Capstone_EES_Tessera_Skipjack/</B></A>
<DD>link to directory on Clipper, the
    first US government key &quot;escrow&quot; scheme, and related plans, including
    Capstone and Tessera, higher-speed versions of Clipper (All are based
    on the classified Skipjack algorithm, NIST's Escrowed Encryption Standard)
    Most of the action on this issue was 1993-4, with focus shifting to
    &quot;Clipper II&quot; and &quot;Clipper III&quot; in subsequent years. [Note: This directory
    is aliased to &quot;Clipper&quot; as well as the longer name, to save typing time

<DT><a href="Crypto_bills_1996/"><B>Crypto_bills_1996/</B></A>
<DD>Directory of info on new (as of Mar. 96) pro-crypto,
    pro-privacy, pro-Net bills introduced by Sen. Leahy (the Encrypted
    Communications Privacy Act) and Rep. Goodlatte (the Security And Freedom
    through Encryption Act), and numerous co-sponsors. Despite a few problems,
    the very similar bills would relax export controls on encryption, allowing
    the full fruition of online privacy, security, authentication and
    commerce. They also take steps (stronger in Goodlatte's version) to
    prevent the mandating of &quot;key escrow&quot; systems.
<DT><a href="Clipper_II/"><B>Clipper_II/</B></A>

<DT><a href="960724_isoc_crypto.statement"><B>960724_isoc_crypto.statement</B></a>
<DD>Statement on cryptographic technology and
    the Internet, from Internet Architecture Board and Internet Engineering
    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;

<DD>Sen. Burns (sponsor of the Pro-CODE
    crypto export deregulation bill) announces opposition to Clipper III,
    and criticizes Administration export policy.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515.letter"><B>hr_crypto_960515.letter</B></a>
<DD>Letter from Rep. Goodlatte (and over 20 other 
    Representatives) to Clinton Administration urging relaxation of crypto
    export controls and abandonment of Clipper III &quot;key escrow&quot; proposals.
    Also includes Goodlatte press release regarding the letter.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement"><B>hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement</B></a>
<DD>Brief EFF statement on the House 
    letter to Clinton demanding abandonment of &quot;key escrow&quot; and urging 
    relaxation of export controls. (Also includes a copy of the letter).
<DT><a href="s1726_96.bill"><B>s1726_96.bill</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Burns' May 2, 1996, encryption export 
    deregulation bill. As with the ECPA96 bill, co-sponsored by Leahy.
    This bill, known as the Pro-CODE bill, is the most pro-privacy, 
    pro-commerce, pro-Net bill to day, and essentially supercedes the ECPA96 
    and SAFE bills (stronger prohibition against forced key escrow, better
    export dereg, and does not create a new crime.) Need some final tweaking,
    but all in all a very solid piece of privacy legislation.
<DT><a href="eff_procode_ipc_goldkey_960502.announce"><B>eff_procode_ipc_goldkey_960502.announce</B></a>
<DD>EFF statement on S.1726, the
    Burns-sponsored Pro-CODE crypto deregulation bill, on the advent of
    the Golden Key encryption freedom campaign, and on the formation of
    the Internet Privacy Coalition.
<DT><a href="s1726_burns_960328.announce"><B>s1726_burns_960328.announce</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Burns' press release regarding his new 
    encryption export deregulation bill.
<DT><a href="s1587_96.bill"><B>s1587_96.bill</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Leahy's on a roll: Leahy and others introduced this new
    bill to partially deregulate encryption export, Mar. 5 96. - a promising
    move that is sure to raise the level of Congressional awareness of
    increasingly vital online security, privacy and commercial needs.
    Such a bill could also nail the coffin shut on hare-brained
    Administration schemes like &quot;key escrow&quot; (copies of all users' encryption
    keys held for the convenience of law enforcement.) Problems remain in
    the legislation, including unclear language in some areas, and the
    creation of a new felony of using encryption to thwart police
    investigation of a felony - tatamount to making it an extra crime to
    close the curtains when breaking the law. EFF is largely supportive
    of most of the provisions of the legislation. The bill also creates
    a legal infrastructure for key escrow, though it does aim to prevent
    the imposition of such a system. The House version, H.R. 3011, is
    considerably stronger in this regard.

    legislation (introduced Mar. 5 1996) creates a new, but fairly narrow
    felony of cryptographical obstructing justice in furtherance of a felony.

<DD>File containing NIST's August 1991 notice requesting 
    comments on a proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for
    Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This proposed standard
    specifies a public- key based digital signature algorithm (DSA)
    appropriate for Federal digital signature applications. The proposed
    DSS uses a public key to verify to a recipient the integrity of data and
    the identity of the sender of the data. The DSS can also be used by a
    third party to ascertain the authenticity of a signature and the data
    associated with it. 
<DT><a href="fips_dss_proposed.standard"><B>fips_dss_proposed.standard</B></a>
<DD>File containing August 1991 announcement by 
    NIST of the proposed Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This standard 
    specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which can be used to 
    generate a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect 
    unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of 
    the user who generates the signature. In addition, the recipient of 
    signed data can use a digital signature in proving to a third party that 
    the signature was in fact generated by the signer of the data. This is 
    known as nonrepudiation since the signer of data cannot, at a later time, 
    repudiate the signature.

<DD>Statement on cryptographic technology and

    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;

<DD>May 1996 (pre-publication draft) 
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the 
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of 
    export restrictions. Unfortunately, report also calls for key &quot;escrow&quot;, 
    and buys into the government's wacky idea of a federally-controlled &quot;Key

<DD>Brief debate on two alternative key &quot;escrow&quot; ideas:
    proposal by Dave Staelin for a system in which users choose any crypto 
    but are required to retain copies of all keys used, said keys being 
    obtainable by subpoena or warrant; modified proposal by Ron Rivest, in 
    which copies of keys are held by a &quot;trusted&quot; third party who can be 
    subpoenaed or searched by court order, keeping the escrow &quot;feature&quot; but 
    removing the storage burden on the user. These proposals are followed by
    technical and (brief) legal critique by Matt Blaze, who points out
    fundamental problems in both systems, and finds them infeasible.

<DD>&quot;Law Enforcement and The

    Administration has made its position clear: it will seek to
    encourage the use of the &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; and push for legislation that
    will require electronic communications systems to be designed to
    facilitate wiretapping and surveillance in real time...So we have a set
    of proposals that, in somewhat breath-taking fashion, claim for the
    cops not only the right to walk the beat but a privilege to say just
    how the street will be designed...But no such origin accounts for
    our best public spaces and I can tell you...that putting wiretapping
    at the top of the design priority list is a really dumb idea...&quot;
<DT><a href="denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article"><B>denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article</B></a>

    that paints a picture of imminent &quot;crypto-anarchy&quot; disrupting society if
    all citizens are not required to turn over encryption keys to government
    (via governmental or corporate key &quot;escrow&quot; agencies.) Includes a

<html><head><title>Intro to the STPP Listserv</title></head><body>

INTRODUCING THE SCIENCE, TECH, AND PUBLIC POLICY LISTSERV!!!!!!!!!!!
<p>
    What is it?  The STPP listserv is an online interactive discussion 
    group using all our university-granted e-mail accounts.  If e-mail is 
    a telephone call, a listserv is a conference call.  
<p>
    Students (so far only in the GW Graduate Department) have 
    participated in ongoing disucssions with other  S&T students regarding  
    either topics specifc to their courses or topics in the greater S&Tgenre.  
<p>
   Since its inception,  we have covered topics ranging from the 
   implications of Competitiveness policy on R&D, to Complexity theory, 
   to NASA futures to the NII and the Open Platform proposal.
<p>

WHY WE BEGAN THE STPP LISTSERV
<p>
   The listserv was meant to be both a lubricant for social organization and 
   a forum to discuss issues that we are engaged in in our lives, in our 
   careers and in our education.
<p>
   The American educational system is sadly lacking in its ability to 
   'discuss'.  Professors lecture at you, books lecture at you and exams 
   ask you to vomit out those lectures. 
<p>
   Since we are all out of the dorms now, and cannot participate in 
   those wonderful all night babble sessions, we lack a particularly apt 
   forum to consolidate our own ideas.  
<p>
   True consolidation of ideas depends on discussion..not lecture.  
   Lecture gives you the tools but discussion teaches you how to use them.
   Lecture is only supplemental.
<p>
   The listserv forum is just what is needed to complete one's education.

<p>
FUTURE PROJECTS AND DIRECTIONS FOR THE LIST
<p>
   This listserv though, has potentials beyond being a supplement to our 
   courses.  And certainly, as it grows to incorporate S&T programs 
   nationally, it will tend to outgrow such basic uses.  There are two other 
   benefits the growth of this list would bestow on its members.
<p>
   First, by joining a trans-university vibrant community of other 
   students from other programs, we could all reach beyond the limited scope 
   of our own programs.  As there are only a limited amount of  STPP programs 
   around the country, such a national discussion would only enhance the 
   prowess of future S&T analysts and enhance the reputation of the field.  
   Further, S&T analysts would be better equiped to benefit society.
<p>
   Second, such a forum would promote networking so that as a group, we 
   would be more organized, powerful, informed and directed.  The consequences 
   of having chosen one program over others when we were accpeted to 
   graduate programs will not limit us.  We can gain from all departments at all 
   the campuses
<p>
PROGRAMS IN DEVELOPMENT
<p>
   Besides interests and arguments we as students bring to the discussions, we 
   plan to involve professors and inspirational figures (like scientists or 
   Congresspeople) who, from time to time, can both guide and inspire discussion.
<p>
   Such involvement is still in planning and requires that the discussion participants 
   reach a certain critical mass.  However, we have imagined online lectures in 
   which a guest speaker would upload a paper (perhaps lecture notes) and then 
   guide the discussion which that lecture inspired answering questions and 
   participating in dialogue.
<p>
HOW YOU CAN BECOME INVOLVED

  Simply send e-mail to erict@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu.  In the body of your letter 
  include your school and department and a note saying "sign me up".

<h2><center>The Ascent of Man</center></h2>
<p>
                    
<b><center>By Way of Introduction</center></b>
 <p> It was my second semester as a Freshman at U.C. Berkeley.  I remember
sitting cross-legged on the floor of the Barrington Co-op single, just
inches below the smoke line, across from some friends and some strangers. 
Outside to the East, the sun was casually peeking over the Berkeley Hills. 
    <p>
 It was one of the strangers who said it: "Evolution is dead, killed by
the bloody hands of culture," or something equally, prosaically
Freshmanlike.  What she meant, of course, was that the invention of
culture had stifled human morphological evolution by deintensifying the
pressures of a hostile environment.  For example, eyeglasses, by reducing
the adaptive advantage of better sighted individuals, create a `cultural
buffer zone' between individuals and the environment.  This buffer zone
deprives morphological metamorphosis of its prime motivator: Natural
Selection. 
 <p>
     Although I thoroughly disagreed with her at the time, I argued more
from intuition than from logic so my arguments were quickly cut to shreds. 
Of course, I was hardly convinced of anything more than the fact that I
should have studied debate in High School.  Actually, though I didn't
realize it for some time, that morning marked the beginning of a long, and
continuing, personal quest for the meaning and processes of evolution;  A
quest which has led me to Anthropology 7 and its final paper. 
<p>
     "Cultural advance," writes Prof. Miller, "has not occurred
independently of morphological change; indeed the two are almost
inextricably linked."  What better topic with which to redeem myself!  Of
course, any discussion of this claim must first be preceeded by an outline
of the cultural and morphological changes to which she refers. 
<b><center>The Handy Man</center></b>
<p>
     "Twiggy" must have had a fairly difficult and dangerous life on the
East African savanahs.  She and her companions were surrounded by a
hostile environment, unprotected by steel-framed buildings, inconvenienced
by a lack of supermarkets and inhibited by other hominids competing for
the same resources.  How was it that she and her genus were able to
survive and flourish under such conditions? 
   <p>
  The answser lies in Twiggy's genus name Homo habilus, or, handy man. 
Clearly, H. habilus had an affinity for making and using tools, a trait
that clearly set it apart from its predecessor, the Australopithecines. 
In fact, as Melvin Konnor notes in The Tangled Wing, "the dependance on
tools, be they stones, hammers, or languages, is what separates man from
his hominid ancestors and makes him unique." [Konner 1982:157]
<p>
     While H. habilus technology was still very basic, consisting mainly
of stone choppers and chopping tools, through such basic tool use, H.
habilus could better "face the challenges of the environment" and hence,
better utilize the resources of that environmnet to outcompete other
hominids. 
<p>   
  However, the innovation of tool creation and usage depended on
certain morphological transformations.  As Asimov points out in
Extraterrestrial Civilizations, "though dolphins may have just as much
potential for cultural ability as humans, because they lack hands and the
ability to make and control fire they are caught in a technological dead
end." [Azimov 1979: 16]
<p>   
  The morphological distinction of H. habilus begins with a recognition
of cranial morphological change.  On average, H. habilus brains were 100
cubic centimeters larger than the Australopithecines.  Further, changes in
the shape of the skull vault suggest some cerebral reorganization. [Nelson
and Jurmain 1991: 439] Together, such changes clearly gave H. habilus an
increased ability to design tools.  Further, the trend towards more
efficient bipedalism was also of great importance.  H. habilus could free
up his hands to both carry and manipulate his tools.  Bipedality allowed
him to run down prey while putting his newfound tools to use. [Miller
1993: Lecture] Such skills were far beyond those of the Australopithecines
and clearly gave H. habilus the advantage. 
<b><center>Out of Africa</center></b>
<p>
     The next step up the ladder of evolution was Homo erectus.  "as one
might expect," write Nelson and Jurmain, "[H. erectus] were taller, larger
brained...and more effective bipeds."[Nelson and Jurmain 1991: 463]
Further, the dentition of H. erectus became more adaptive to a softer,
omnivorous diet.  Hence, though still displaying a "mosaic of primitive
traits," like thick bones, prognathism, and skull shape, H. erectus slowly
continued and expanded the morphological trends initiated by H. habilus.
[Nelson and Jurmain 1991: 490]
<p>   
  More striking than the morphological changes were advancements in
culture.  H. erectus was also, "more culture-dependent and [a] more
skillful toolmaker." [Nelson and Jurmain 1991: 463] At Zhoukoudian, for
instance, we find suggestions of the controlled use of fire, development
of bifacial Acheulian tools, communal living, sexual division of labor and
limited communication. [Nelson and Jurmain 1991, 483] Why would cultural
evolution progress so much more rapidly than morphological evolution, and
what environmnetal stimuli might provoke such a difference? 
<p>   
  The answer lies in the pioneering spirit of H. erectus who was the
first to make it out of Africa.  H. erectus remains are found in Java and
China as well as East, South, and North Africa.  H. erectus probably
migrated because of climatic and geographic changes which changed food
types and availability. [Nelson and Jurmain 1991, 494] Such migration led
H. erectus to a vast aray of ecological niches ranging from the savanahs
of Africa to the Rain Forests of Java, to the colder climes of Northern
China. 
<p>   
  Because mutation rate limited rapid morphological evolution however,
H. erectus was forced to find other ways of coping with the varied
environments.  Clearly, cultural advancement was the key.  Cultural tools
could substitute for the limitations of morphology.  Group hunting tactics
could make them more efficient hunters, carefully honed stone implements
could aid in killing and consuming prey and communal education could
sufficiently pass on learned skills. 
<b><center>On to the Present</center></b>
<p>
     As Nelson and Jurmain note, "it was H. erectus, commited to
bipedalism and a cultural way of life, who transformed hominid evolution
to human evolution." [Nelson and Jurmain 1991, 494] Hence, we see a marked
increase in cranial capacity from H. erectus to Archaic Homo sapiens. 
Professor Miller cites an increase of 600 cubic centimeters. [Miller
1993,: Lecture] Clearly, brain size was being expanded to support a
greater dependence on culture as the manipulation of culture became the
pivotal selective adaptation for natural selection to work with.  Those
sapiens who could best utilize culture, would be most fit.  And though the
archaic H. sapiens remained somewhat primitive morphologically with their
extremely robust features, such morphology was advantageous in their
relatively unconquered world of physical hardship. 
<p>
     Meanwhile cultural advancement continued to develop.  Archaic H.
sapiens are known for such advancements as ritualistic buriels, cave art,
and the levallois technique for tool manufacture.  However, geographically
dispersed cultural variations began to flourish.  For instance, where
skull drilling might be employed to affect curing of disease in Kabwe,
disease or deformation might go untreated in groups like Shanidar.  Either
way, we clearly see the proliferation of culture in the Archaic H.
sapiens. 
<p>   
  However, the story does not end there.  We must finally discuss the
anatomically modern Homo sapiens.  Morphologically the a.m. H. sapiens
reflect the heightened dependence on culture.  In contrast to the constant
growth of cranial capacity however, the a.m. H. sapiens show a decrease in
size but a tremendous transformation in brain organization.  This shift of
focus from the "paleo- mammalian brain" to the "neo-mammalian" brain
provided a heightened ability to form complex thoughts and use symbols,
both crucial to the manipulation of culture. [Bloom 1988: 167] Further
morphological changes include the loss of prognathism, thinning of the
bones, and development of the chin. 
<p>   
  As would be expected, such morphological change was accompanied by
expansions of cultural manipulation.  A.m. H. sapiens are noted for mnuch
more complex usage of tools including blades, bows, and sewing needles,
and, as time passed, cars, airplanes and computer networks. 
<b><center>Conclusion</center></b>
<p>
     Hence, we see that though cultural advancements did, as Prof. Miller
states, increase our "ability to face the challenges of new environmnets,"
this advancement was both dependent upon and the precurser of important
morphological transformations which worked congruently with their cultural
counterparts to increase the fitness of homo sapiens and their close
ancestors.  And with that we can put to rest the idea that "evolution is
dead."  Evolution is certainly not dead.  If anything, it has grown in
complexity as its fractal has incorporated cultural as well as
morphological facets.  Evolution may have a new identity, but it is
certainly alive and well.

  These documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act
  by EFF Board member John Gilmore, through his lawyer, Lee Tien.
  Each document was scanned in, then proofread for obvious mistakes.
<P>
  Footnotes were used in many documents; as a rule, the general
  format of the page was kept, and footnotes are indicated by the note
  number in brackets, i.e. [n.1].  The text of each footnote appears at
  the bottom of the page, separated by a short line of "=" signs.
<P>
  Section symbols were replaced by a "s.".  If a document was signed,
  the signature is indicated by (signed:) followed by the name of the
  person signing the document.  If there is no "(signed)", the document
  was not signed.  Anything not in the original text is bracketed.<P>

<DT><a href="itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript"><B>itar_hr_govop_hearing.transcript</B></a>
<DD>An excerpt from the transcript of 
    hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government 
    Operations, as part of a general investigation into ways that the
    government can take control of privately developed ideas.
    Export controls on cryptography are one such way. It includes
    two items that were "inserted into the record". One memo shows
    that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded
    that ITAR was unconstitutional. Testimony shows that the State
    Department and the President may have ignored possibly binding
    legal advice from the Office of Legal Counsel.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_garn.letter"><B>mcconnell_garn.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a draft letter from Robert McConnell, 
    Assistant Attorney General for Legal and Intergovernmental affairs to
    Jake Garn, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking,
    Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was drafted by Theodore Olson,
    and sent by him to Robert McConnell, with the cover letter
    supplied below as olson_mcconnell.letter. It was written while
    a revised Export Administration Act was in a House/Senate
    conference committee, and it encourages Sen. Garn to remedy
    "certain constitutional defects" in the new bill. The term
    "technology" as defined by the bill is overly broad and
    presents a probable violation of the First Amendment.
<DT><a href="mcconnell_zablocki.letter"><B>mcconnell_zablocki.letter</B></a>
<DD>Clement Zablocki was the Chairman of the House 
    Committee on Foreign Affairs. This letter is a review of a bill that 
    would amend the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). It is particularly 
    good in that it makes a compelling argument for why the ITAR 
    establishes a system of prior restraint.
<DT><a href="olson_mcconnell.letter"><B>olson_mcconnell.letter</B></a>
<DD>This is a cover letter for the draft letter from 
    Robert McConnell to Senator Jake Garn. It, and the draft, were
    written by Theodore Olson, Assistant Attorney General for the
    Office of Legal Counsel. It reaffirms the OLC position that
    the proposed EAA, and the existing ITAR, establish a regulatory
    scheme that "extends too broadly into an area of protected
    First Amendment speech."
<DT><a href="shiffren_tien.letter"><B>shiffren_tien.letter</B></a>
<DD>The cover letter/reply to Lee Tien's FOIA request. 
    Notable for the fact that there are other documents (specifically 
    from the FBI and NSA) that could be relevant.
<DT><a href="simms_mcconnell.memo"><B>simms_mcconnell.memo</B></a>
<DD>A brief note acknowledging that the ITAR is overly 
    broad, from Simms of OLA to McConnell.
<DT><a href="simms_robinson.memo"><B>simms_robinson.memo</B></a>
<DD>This is a memo prepared for Davis Robinson, then the 
    Legal Adviser for the Department of State. This is a very
    well-documented paper on the various unconstitutional provisions 
    of ITAR. The two areas this memo concentrates on are the 
    "technical data" definition as well as the definition of "export." 
    Near the conclusion, Simms states: "We remain of the opinion, 
    however, that ... the ITAR still present some areas of 
    potentially unconstitutional application. ...The best legal 
    solution ... is for the Department of State, not the courts, to 
    narrow the regulations."

<h1><img src="/pub/Graphics/Icons/eff3d_trans_icon.gif" ALT="">
<a name="top">EFF &quot;Legal Cases - Canada - Montreal BBS Raids (1994)&quot; Archive</a></h1>

<H5>seizure_rcmp_950413.announce - RCMP press release about and summarizing 
<br> (their version of the story of) the raids.
<br>raided_bbs.lists - two incomplete lists of the sysops believed to have been
<br> raided.
<br>960507.update - 13 month update: Judge rejects, flying in face of 
<br> Supreme Court rulings, the argument that the electronic surveillance of
<br> the sysops was illegal, and also rejects separate argument that
<br> search was illegal - conducted days after warrant expired. This and 
<br> other related cases will proceed
<br>960228.update - 10 month update: Lawyer for 3 defendants argues that 
<br> police surveillance of the BBSs without court authorization violated
<br> Charter rights (argument based on Sup. Ct. decision regarding 
<br> decepitive or surrepititious monitoring.) Judge to rule on this in
<br> May, but already rejected separate challenge, that police obtained
<br> access to BBS under false pretenses (therefore in violation of laws
<br> against unauthorized access.) All other related cases put on hold.
<br>960122.update - 9 month update: 1 defendant plea-bargains ($2,000 fine, 
<br> forfeit seized equipment, no criminal record). Cases against some 
<br> other defendants look very flimsy. Lawyer for 3 defendants plans to 
<br> challenge the surveillance and raids as illegal. Also some discussion 
<br> of the rammifications of the cases for all sysops.
<br>950921.update - 5 month update: A look at some of the truly ridiculous 
<br> demonization and hype surrounding these cases, plus update on case status:
<br> further delays, then finally charges against all 15 defendants. However, 
<br> in at least one case defendant can prove he didn't even have a computer 
<br> during the period the police allege he was a software pirate. Police had 
<br> to return this person's seized equipment. RCMP also says it will only 
<br> seek $5000 fines (max is $1,000,000). Despite at least one major error,
<br> police and prosecution seem to be doing a better &amp; more resonable job 
<br> than the local media...
<br>950719.update - 3 month update: Most of the 15 suspects put on hold as
<br> govt. continues to prepare case. Two were charged.

<DT><a href="19961118_cdt_exec_order.analysis"><B>19961118_cdt_exec_order.analysis</B></a>
<DD>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology's
    analysis of recent US President Clinton's executive order, which
    moves to establish yet another version of encryption key &quot;escrow&quot;, as
    well as sets up a &quot;Crypto Czar&quot; - a new US official of ambassadorial
    stature. The message: The Admin does not intend to lose the Crypto
    War, and is ramping up its efforts to pull an end run around Congress,
    the public, and industry.
<DT><a href="961001_wh_clipper3.statement"><B>961001_wh_clipper3.statement</B></a>
<DD>Oct. 10 1996 Clinton Administration key 
    &quot;escrow&quot; and crypto export policy statement. White House say it will 
    allow export of 56bit (still very weak) crypto if the keys are &quot;escrowed&quot;
    in 2 years, and stronger crypto if it is escrowed now. Essentially
    no serious or meaningful change in the Admin's position.
<DT><a href="961001_leahy_clipper3.statement"><B>961001_leahy_clipper3.statement</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Leahy's criticism of the new
    White House policy statement on &quot;Clipper III&quot;.
<DT><a href="960724_isoc_crypto.statement"><B>960724_isoc_crypto.statement</B></a>
<DD>Statement on cryptographic technology and 
    the Internet, from Internet Architecture Board and Internet Engineering 
    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and 
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or 
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;
<DT><a href="960602_burns_wh.letter"><B>960602_burns_wh.letter</B></a>
<DD>Letter from Sen. Burns (sponsor of Pro-CODE 
    crypto bill) to Clinton Administration urging that the White House take 
    seriously the National Research Council's conclusions regarding flawed US 
    crypto-export policy.
<DT><a href="9606_pff_crypto.report"><B>9606_pff_crypto.report</B></a>
<DD>&quot;The Computer Revolution, Encryption &amp; True
    Threats to National Security&quot;; report condemning Clinton Adminstration
    encryption export policy and key &quot;escrow&quot; plans, by G.A. Keyworth II
    and David E. Colton, for the Progress and Freedom Foundation. HTML
    version available at http://www.pff.org/pff/encry.html at the PFF site.
    Co-author Keyworth was US President Ronald Reagan's scient advisor.
<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report</B></a>
<DD>May 1996 (pre-publication draft)
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of
    export restrictions. Of particular interest is NRC's end-run around the
    NSA's typical line of &quot;if you only knew what we knew...&quot;: NRC members
    obained security clearances and examined the classifed material, too, 
    and still came to the conclusion that export restrictions and imposed
    key escrow are not the solution. Unfortunately, report also calls for 
    key &quot;escrow&quot; to be explored at least for internal government use, among
    several other flaws (from our point of view), mostly minor. The end 
    result is a definitely pro-crypto, pro-privacy position, and this 
    report is likely to be highly influential on the crypto-policy debate. 
    NOTE: This file is over 1 megabyte. See 
    9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz for a gzip-compressed version.
<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz</B></a>
<DD>gzip-compressed version of above
    NRC report on encryption. (about 450K). May 1996 (pre-publication draft)
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of
    export restrictions. Of particular interest is NRC's end-run around the

<DT><a href="960520_nist_clipper3_paper.draft"><B>960520_nist_clipper3_paper.draft</B></a>
<DD>&quot;Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security 
    and Public Safety in the Global Information Infrastructure&quot;: New rather
    hypocritically-titled Clinton Administration key &quot;escrow&quot; scheme -
    the US government wants the keys to YOUR privacy. This time the impetus
    is coming from Interagency Working Group on Cryptographic Policy (IWGCP),
    and Administration old-boys group led by Bruce McConnell and Ed Appel.
    (Slightly earlier drafts were apparently circulated in Washington,
    as the Clipper III plan is what spurred the writing of the May 15 letter,
    below).
<DT><a href="960520_burns_clipper_III.announce"><B>960520_burns_clipper_III.announce</B></a>

<DD>The one you are probably looking for. This is the basic
    Unix text file version of BDGttI. If you are using DOS this
    will probably work for you too. If you have line length
    problems, get the ZIP'd version below. This file always
    contains the most current version of the text (&quot;fancy&quot; 
    versions such as PostScript, hypertext, etc., may be somewhat 
    older, as they take time to create after the text version is
    released.)
<DT><a href="netgd3_1.zip"><B>netgd3_1.zip</B></a>
<DD>A ZIP'd-up DOS text version of EGttI. Differs from
    netguide.eff only in that each line ends with a cr/lf
    character pair, instead of just lf. May make it easier to
    view it on a DOS system. 
<DT><a href="netguide_3.1.txt"><B>netguide_3.1.txt</B></a>
<DD>A link to netguide.eff for those that like long names.
    Incidentally, gives the current version number for
    your convenience. Especially intended for sysadmins
    and other Internet and FirstClass redistributors, as
    well as Mac and Amiga users (see also Other_versions/
    subdirectory for &quot;fancy&quot; formatted versions of the
    Guide.) 
<DT><a href="netguide.faq"><B>netguide.faq</B></a>
<DD>This is Joke's Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (FAQ)
    document about EGttI. It should answer almost any query
    about EGttI as it is very in-depth, covering the purpose,
    creation, and location of EGttI including all versions/
    formats and multiple archive sites. Get it! READ it!

    It is made publicly accessible for download as well, just in case
    someone finds a use for it in this condition.

<DD>Statement on cryptographic technology and
    the Internet, from Internet Architecture Board and Internet Engineering
    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;

    and criticizes Administration export policy.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515.letter"><B>hr_crypto_960515.letter</B></a>
<DD>Letter from Rep. Goodlatte (and over 20 other 
    Representatives) to Clinton Administration urging relaxation of crypto
    export controls and abandonment of Clipper III &quot;key escrow&quot; proposals.
    Also includes Goodlatte press release regarding the letter.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement"><B>hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement</B></a>
<DD>Brief EFF statement on the House 
    letter to Clinton demanding abandonment of &quot;key escrow&quot; and urging 
    relaxation of export controls. (Also includes a copy of the letter).
<DT><a href="s1726_96.bill"><B>s1726_96.bill</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Burns' May 2, 1996, encryption export 
    deregulation bill. As with the ECPA96 bill, co-sponsored by Leahy.
    This bill, known as the Pro-CODE bill, is the most pro-privacy, 
    pro-commerce, pro-Net bill to day, and essentially supercedes the ECPA96 
    and SAFE bills (stronger prohibition against forced key escrow, better
    export dereg, and does not create a new crime.) Need some final tweaking,
    but all in all a very solid piece of privacy legislation.
<DT><a href="eff_procode_ipc_goldkey_960502.announce"><B>eff_procode_ipc_goldkey_960502.announce</B></a>
<DD>EFF statement on S.1726, the
    Burns-sponsored Pro-CODE crypto deregulation bill, on the advent of
    the Golden Key encryption freedom campaign, and on the formation of
    the Internet Privacy Coalition.
<DT><a href="s1726_burns_960328.announce"><B>s1726_burns_960328.announce</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Burns' press release regarding his new 
    encryption export deregulation bill.
<DT><a href="s1587_96.bill"><B>s1587_96.bill</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Leahy's on a roll: Leahy and others introduced this new
    bill to partially deregulate encryption export, Mar. 5 96. - a promising
    move that is sure to raise the level of Congressional awareness of
    increasingly vital online security, privacy and commercial needs.
    Such a bill could also nail the coffin shut on hare-brained
    Administration schemes like &quot;key escrow&quot; (copies of all users' encryption
    keys held for the convenience of law enforcement.) Problems remain in
    the legislation, including unclear language in some areas, and the
    creation of a new felony of using encryption to thwart police
    investigation of a felony - tatamount to making it an extra crime to
    close the curtains when breaking the law. EFF is largely supportive
    of most of the provisions of the legislation. The bill also creates
    a legal infrastructure for key escrow, though it does aim to prevent
    the imposition of such a system. The House version, H.R. 3011, is
    considerably stronger in this regard.
<DT><a href="s1587_96_epic.analysis"><B>s1587_96_epic.analysis</B></a>
<DD>Electronic Privacy Info. Center's analysis of
    the ECPA96 bill.
<DT><a href="eff_s1587_030596.statement"><B>eff_s1587_030596.statement</B></a>
<DD>EFF's largely positive statement regarding
    Sen. Leahy's new &quot;Encrypted Communications Privacy Act&quot;. Some problems
    remain with the legislation, and it would be simpler and better for
    the industry and the public to deregulate rather than shift regulations,
    but the legislation is a major step forward and is certain to raise
    awareness in Congress of vital issues like digital commerce, Internet
    security, and online privacy.
<DT><a href="leahy_pgp_960502_net.letter"><B>leahy_pgp_960502_net.letter</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Leahy's open letter to the Net community,
    on PGP, encryption and new privacy legislation. This appears to be the
    first time any US Senator has publicly used the PGP encryption program.
<DT><a href="leahy_s1587_95_intro.statement"><B>leahy_s1587_95_intro.statement</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Leahy's introduction to his new
    [largely] pro-privacy, pro-encryption bill to reduced export
    restrictions on encryption. The bill, S. 1587, was introduced Mar. 5,
    1996.

    Sen. Leahy's efforts in S. 1587, but with stronger protections against
    imposition of key 'escrow' systems. Like Leahy's bill, this
    legislation (introduced Mar. 5 1996) creates a new, but fairly narrow
    felony of cryptographical obstructing justice in furtherance of a felony.

    for the two items it includes in the

    unconstitutional, and some testimony
    indicates that the State Department and
    the President may have ignored possibly
    binding legal advice from the OLC.

<DD>Letter from State Dept.'s Office of 
    Defense Trade Controls (controled by the National Security Agency) 
    denying Phil Karn approval to export software that supports Triple-DES 
    encryption. Interesting especially for 3 reasons: The export has nothing 
    to do with public distribution, but was requested to provide security 
    for the foreign, but US-staffed and owned, branch of a US company; such 
    export denial was threatened if the X9 Committee which establishes 
    banking security standards settled on 3DES instead of Clipper - NSA is 
    making good on its threats; and the 3DES export denial portion of the 
    form response appears to be a standard part of the form now (in other 
    words, NSA/DoS may be routinely denying all 3DES exports.)

<DT><a href="Crypto_bills_1996/"><B>Crypto_bills_1996/</B></A>
<DD>Directory of info on new (as of Apr. 96) pro-crypto,
    pro-privacy, pro-Net bills introduced by Sen. Leahy (the Encrypted 
    Communications Privacy Act), Rep. Goodlatte (the Security And Freedom 
    through Encryption Act), Sen. Burns (the Promotion of Commercie 
    On-Line in the Digital Era Act), and numerous co-sponsors. Despite a few 
    problems, the very similar bills would relax export controls on 
    encryption, allowing the full fruition of online privacy, security, 
    authentication and commerce. They also take steps (strongest in 
    Burns' version) to prevent the mandating of &quot;key escrow&quot; systems.
<DT><a href="Bernstein_case/"><B>Bernstein_case/</B></A>
<DD>Documents from the EFF &amp; Bernstein v. US Dept. of State
    lawsuit, in which we challenge the constitutionality of the ITAR crypto
    export restrictions. This case is similar to the Karn case.
<DT><a href="ITAR_FOIA/"><B>ITAR_FOIA/</B></A>
<DD>directory of info on the [un]constitutionality of the ITAR
    export restrictions on cryptography, obtained via the Freedom of
    Information Act, incl. admissions from govt. lawyers that ITAR
    is unconstitutional.
<DT><a href="Junger_v_DoS/"><B>Junger_v_DoS/</B></A>
<DD>Directory of info on PETER D. JUNGER v. DEPARTMENT OF
    STATE, OFFICE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS, &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY case.
    Junger claims the ITAR and AECA export restrictions on encryption
    (particularly the absurdly broad definition of 'export', which includes
    &quot;disclosing&quot; to foreigners, unconstitutionally restricts Jungers First
    Amendment rights to teach a class in which cryptography is detailed, 
    if a foreign student is present.
<DT><a href="Karn_Schneier_export_case/"><B>Karn_Schneier_export_case/</B></A>
<DD>directory of documents from the &quot;Applied
    Cryptography&quot; book + disk export case (book by
    Schneier, disk by Karn). The obtuseness of
    the Executive branch is truly stunning in this
    one. Very similar to the Bernstein case.
<DT><a href="Key_escrow/"><B>Key_escrow/</B></A>
<DD>Link to directory of info on the US Administration's 
    &quot;Clipper 2&quot; effort - commercial key escrow (the &quot;stick&quot; for which is
    export controls on encryption).
<DT><a href="Kerberos_export_case/"><B>Kerberos_export_case/</B></A>
<DD>directory of docs from the Kerberos security
    program (stripped version) export case, put forward by
    Cygnus in an attempt to get export permission for
    this &quot;barebones&quot; version of Kerberos. This case
    revolves around &quot;technical data&quot; rather than
    &quot;cryptographic&quot; export restrictions.
<DT><a href="PGP_Zimmerman_Viacrypt_AustinCW_case/"><B>PGP_Zimmerman_Viacrypt_AustinCW_case/</B></A>
<DD>Documents relating to grand jury 
    investigation against Phil Zimmermann and others allegedly associated with
    distributing &quot;Pretty Good Privacy&quot;, and encryption program, via the 
    Internet.

<DT><a href="fips_dss_doc.rfc"><B>fips_dss_doc.rfc</B></a>
<DD>File containing NIST's August 1991 notice requesting 
    comments on a proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for
    Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This proposed standard
    specifies a public- key based digital signature algorithm (DSA)
    appropriate for Federal digital signature applications. The proposed
    DSS uses a public key to verify to a recipient the integrity of data and
    the identity of the sender of the data. The DSS can also be used by a
    third party to ascertain the authenticity of a signature and the data
    associated with it. 
<DT><a href="fips_dss_proposed.standard"><B>fips_dss_proposed.standard</B></a>
<DD>File containing August 1991 announcement by 
    NIST of the proposed Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This standard 
    specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which can be used to 
    generate a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect 
    unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of 
    the user who generates the signature. In addition, the recipient of 
    signed data can use a digital signature in proving to a third party that 
    the signature was in fact generated by the signer of the data. This is 
    known as nonrepudiation since the signer of data cannot, at a later time, 
    repudiate the signature.
<DT><a href="nist_dss.bulletin"><B>nist_dss.bulletin</B></a>
<DD>File containing CSL Bulletin's January 1993 describing

<DT><a href="nist_dss.bulletin"><B>nist_dss.bulletin</B></a>
<DD>The National Institute of Standards and Technology 
    (NIST) has proposed a public key-based Digital Signature Standard (DSS).
    This CSL Bulletin provides agencies with information regarding the 
    proposed standard and describes several applications which may benefit 
    from the DSS.
<DT><a href="nist_dss_clipper_des_042993.testimony"><B>nist_dss_clipper_des_042993.testimony</B></a>
<DD>File containing statement of
    Raymond Kammer, Acting Director, National Institute of Standards and
    Technology, before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and 
    Finance (Committee on Energy and Commerce), on April 29, 1993. Kammer
    discusses NIST's activities in telecommunications security, the planned
    recertification of the Data Encryption Standard, the proposed Digital
    Signature Standard, and the Clipper Chip.

<DD>Stealth 1.0 is a simple filter for PGP which strips off all
    identifying header information to leave only the encrypted data in a
    format suitable for steganographic use. That is, the data can be hidden in
    images, audio files, text files, CAD files, and/or any other file type that
    may contain random data, then sent to another person who can retrieve the
    data from the file, attach headers, and PGP decrypt it. This does NOT
    contain crypto code or any other export-restricted material, and is only a
    filter. This is the Unix (source) version, as a gzip-compressed tar 
    archive.

[If you want the plain ASCII text file version of the book, get
zen1_0.ascii or zen1_0.ascii.gz].

[Last changed: 02/02/92]

This is the first edition of a booklet entitled ``Zen and the Art of
the Internet: A Beginner's Guide to the Internet''.  It's roughly 100
pages in length, and is divided into the following sections:

	* Chapter 1--Network Basics
	* Chapter 2--Electronic Mail
	* Chapter 3--Anonymous FTP
	* Chapter 4--Usenet News
	* Chapter 5--Telnet
	* Chapter 6--Tools (finger/ping/etc)
	* Chapter 7--Commercial Uses of the Internet
	* Chapter 8--Things you'll hear about (projects/organizations)
	* Chapter 9--Finding Out More
	* An appendix on reaching other networks
	* An appendix on mail-based file retrieval (FTPmail, archive servers)
	* An appendix on how to create a newsgroup
	* A glossary of 80+ terms
	* A bibliography of over a dozen books and two dozen papers
	  and magazines related to the Internet and similar topics.

Why do you want this?  Well, for one thing it's free.  It's also
unique--there presently exists no single comprehensive collection of
the information directly related to being connected to the Internet.
Most users learn by word of mouth and stumbling upon things.  This
guide should give you a reference to consult if you're curious about
what can be done with the Internet.  It also presents the fundamental
topics that are all too often assumed and considered trivial by many
network users.  This is your first "virtual quickie."

Now, how to read it.  The file zen1_0.dvi is a DVI (DeVice
Independent) file created by the TeX typesetting system.  Filters
exist to convert these DVI files into printer-specific files for a variety
of printers.  Also included is the file zen1_0.ps, a Postscript version.
This can be printed on a number of printers, most notably the Apple
LaserWriter series.  (We tested it with a Pacific Page cartridge in an
HP LaserJet III.)

In the tar file zen1_0.tar.gz (a gzip-compressed tar file--ask your local
system administrator how to extract the files from this), there are a
number of files suffixed by `.texi'.  These are the TeXinfo source to
the booklet.  TeX is a free typesetting system, the source for which
you can FTP or buy on a tape.  TeXinfo is the system written on top of
TeX by the GNU Project for easy manual creation.  To create a DVI file
of your own (for whatever reason), simply tex the file zen-1.0.texi.
Right now you can't create the info file needed for reading it in the
info system or in Emacs' info mode.  Contact me if you'd like to find
out why not, and suggest possible solutions.  The tar archive includes a
sample PostScript version and a sample DVI version.

I'm sorry, we cannot supply hardcopy versions of this booklet at this
time.  The support staffs of educational institutions are encouraged to
put multiple copies out for their user communities.  Also any companies
in need of training literature are welcome to use this booklet. (The
author is keenly interested in hearing from anyone considering such a
large distribution; if you're going to do such a thing, please let me
know.)

[Last I looked, this book has in fact been printed, and can be purchased at
any good bookstore in hardcopy.  - mech@eff.org]

Being that this is the first edition, a good amount of information was
been omitted, in trade for being able to release it for general
critique this Spring.  (Otherwise it probably wouldn't be presentable
again until the summer.) In particular WAIS, IRC, and a few other
things stand out.  They will be added in a more complete version;
suggestions on what to include are more than welcome. Hopefully the
thinner chapters (e.g. commercial uses) will grow soon too.  (For example,
I want to include an appendix on what it takes to become connected to the
Internet, and perhaps one on how to register a domain name--both vital
issues to people who are contemplating joining the Internet but aren't
quite sure what's involved or what's "inside the black box.")

If you have any comments or questions, please send them to the address
guide-bugs@cs.widener.edu.  I hope this guide is of use to you!

<DD>File containing June 11, 1987 Committee on Science, 
    Space and Technology's analysis of the Computer Security Act of 1987. 
    The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, to whom was
    referred the bill (H.R. 145) to provide for a computer standards
    program within the National Bureau of Standards, to provide for
    Government-wide computer security, and to provide for the training
    in security matters of persons who are involved in the management,
    operation, and use of Federal Computer systems, and for other
    purposes, having considered the same, report favorably thereon with
    an amendment and recommend that the bill as amended do pass.

<DD>File containing May 1990 US General Accounting 
    Office's report to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology (House 
    of Representatives) regarding the government-wide review of computer 
    security, as required by the Computer Security Act. GAO believes that 
    The planning and review process implemented under the
    Computer Security Act did little to strengthen computer security 
    governmentwide. Although agency officials believe that the process 
    heightened awareness of computer security, they typically described the 
    plans as merely &quot;reporting requirements&quot; and of limited use in addressing 
    agency-specific problems.
<DT><a href="goldstein.testimony"><B>goldstein.testimony</B></a>
<DD>File containing inofrmation abotut the June 9, 1993 
    testimony of Emmanuel Goldstein (Editor, '2600 Magazine') before the 
    House of Representatives. Included is a summary of the proceedings (as 
    given by Goldstein), as well as a copy of Goldstein's statement to the 
    House. While the topics to be discussed included network security, toll 
    fraud, and the social implications of rapidly emerging technologies, 
    Goldstein claims to have been unfairly attacked by several 
    representatives who claimed his 2600 Magazine' is nothing more than a 
    manual for computer crime. 
<DT><a href="markey_goldstein.testimony"><B>markey_goldstein.testimony</B></a>
<DD>File containing the actual transcript of the 
    second panel of the June 9, 1993 testimony of Emmanuel Goldstein before 
    the House of Representatives. Includes comments by a variety of 
    experts in the computer security field, as well as the angry comments of 
    Rep. Markey and Rep. Fields, who seemed intent on bashing 'computer 
    hackers' and 'demonstrat[ing] their ignorance on the subject and their 
    unwillingness to listen to anything that didn't match their 
    predetermined conclusions.
<DT><a href="net_protection.article"><B>net_protection.article</B></a>
<DD>File containing Steve Cisler's October 1993 article 
    entitled &quot;Protection and the Internet.&quot; Article originally appeared 
    in The Apple Library Users Group Newsletter, Fall 1993. Cisler's 
    summary: Now that the Internet is becoming popular, many
    people and organizations want to protect the Internet, protect
    people from the Internet, protect individual systems from casual
    visitors, protect children from access to certain files and online
    interactions, and protect whole cultures from outside influences.
<DT><a href="net_security.paper"><B>net_security.paper</B></a>
<DD>File containing December 1993 paper by Dan Farmer, 
    'Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into It' describing how 
    to improve network security by fighting fire with fire - use 
    sophisticated cracking techniques to find weaknesses in your own systems.
<DT><a href="nist_net_security.testimony"><B>nist_net_security.testimony</B></a>
<DD>File containing statement of F. Lynn McNulty
    Associate Director for Computer Security National Institute of 
    Standards and Technology U.S. Department of Commerce before the
    Subcommittee on Science Committee on Science, Space, and Technology
    U.S. House of Representatives, March 22, 1994. McNulty discusses 
    the role that NIST plays in the security of both the Internet and the
    evolving national information infrastructure...&quot;In essence, then, NIST 
    has the responsibility -- through standards, guidance, and technology 
    transfer -- for helping agencies protect their information technology and 
    applications.&quot;
<DT><a href="nist_security.faq"><B>nist_security.faq</B></a>
<DD>File containing NIST publication 'Computer Viruses 
    and Related Threats: A Management Guide.' NIST says 'Computer viruses 
    and related threats represent an increasingly serious security problem 
    in computing systems and networks. This document presents 
    guidelines for preventing, deterring, containing, and recovering 
    from attacks of viruses and related threats. This section 
    acquaints senior management with the nature of the problem and 
    outlines some of the steps that can be taken to reduce an organization's 
    vulnerability.
<DT><a href="nsa_employee.manual"><B>nsa_employee.manual</B></a>
<DD>File containing National Security Agency's 
    employee manual. Ultimate source unknown, but
    this has been confirmed as the real thing. Though it is classified, 
    NSA stated that it would require a FOIA demand to get a copy of this, 
    and it appears that the manual was leaked, and thus found it's way 
    onto the net. It is presented here for several reasons: 1) it's 
    appearance on the net indicates that secretive governments have a 
    hardtime maintaining secrets when networks like this exist, and an 
    even harder time controlling leaks when they appear; 2) it is a 
    relevant document indicating some of the character of the 
    agency responsible for the Clipper proposal; 3) it's leakage is a 
    good example of how &quot;wetware&quot; can compromise even the most secure 
    hard- and software setup; and 4) it actually has some useful security 
    tips in it.
<DT><a href="ota_priv_sec.report"><B>ota_priv_sec.report</B></a>
<DD>File containing the very large and very detailed 
    report from the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment on 
    &quot;Information Security and Privacy in Network Environments&quot;. Report 
    dated September 15, 1994, and focuses on several issues, including U.S. 
    cryptography export restrictions, key &quot;escrow&quot;, etc.
<DT><a href="ota_priv_sec_report.summary"><B>ota_priv_sec_report.summary</B></a>
<DD>File containing 8-page summary of the OTA 
    report in ota_priv_sec.report file.
<DT><a href="priv_sec_resource.list"><B>priv_sec_resource.list</B></a>
<DD>File containing David Johnson's report 'Staying 
    Informed: Resources for Privacy Seekers &amp; Computer Security', which lists 
    security resources and companies (this is not a net-resource list, but a 
    list of non-virtual-world materials). Released March of 1994.
<DT><a href="s1948_natl_security.bill"><B>s1948_natl_security.bill</B></a>

    S1948 &quot;Counterintelligence and Security Enhancements Act of 1994,&quot; 
    whose purpose is to amend the National Security Act of 1947 to improve 
    the counterintelligence and security posture of the United States 
    intelligence community and to enhance the investigative authority of the 
    Federal Bureau of Investigation in counterintelligence matters, and for 
    other purposes. Bill introduced March of 1994.

<DD>This is the complete text for SRI Information and
    Telecommunications Sciences and Technology Division Technical Report 
    ITSTD-721-FR-90-21 on computer security. To format it, you need to 
    have the &quot;troff&quot; text formatter and the &quot;-ms&quot; macro package. Except 
    for printing the cover (which you don't really need), you do not need 
    a PostScript printer. This is a gzip-compressed tar archive.
<DT><a href="tempest_legal.draft"><B>tempest_legal.draft</B></a>
<DD>File containing Cristopher Seline's 1990 article, 
    'Eavesdropping On the Electromagnetic Emanations of Digital Equipment: 
    The Laws of Canada, England and the United States', dealing with laws 
    relating to eavesdropping on the elctromagnietic emanations of digital 
    equiptment using TEMPEST technology (surveillance technology allowing 
    information on any digital device to to be intercepted and reconstructed 
    into useful intelligence.
<DT><a href="tempest_monitoring.article"><B>tempest_monitoring.article</B></a>

    with the Administration's key escrow encryption program, which he 
    states encourages the use of the government designed encryption 
    microcircuits, commonly referred to as CLIPPER chips. Brooks states that 
    Clipper chips provide high quality privacy protection, but also enable 
    law enforcement organizations, when lawfully authorized, to obtain 
    the key that unlocks the encryption and thereby maintain the present 
    ability to conduct electronic surveillance.

<DD>&quot;Law Enforcement and The
    Architecture of Cyberspace -- Should the Cops on the Beat Design the
    Electronic Street?&quot;, article by David Johnson. Excerpt: &quot;The
    Administration has made its position clear: it will seek to
    encourage the use of the &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; and push for legislation that
    will require electronic communications systems to be designed to
    facilitate wiretapping and surveillance in real time...So we have a set
    of proposals that, in somewhat breath-taking fashion, claim for the
    cops not only the right to walk the beat but a privilege to say just
    how the street will be designed...But no such origin accounts for
    our best public spaces and I can tell you...that putting wiretapping
    at the top of the design priority list is a really dumb idea...&quot;

<h3> INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE INFORMATION ERA</h3>
<h4>






                                                For PAd 261, Professor Catron
                                                         By Selena Sol

     <h4>                                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h4>
<p>
     The concept of Intellectual Property rights emerged as a public policy
device relative to social,
economic, and political forces and sculpted by a particular technology, the
printing press.  Given the
growing influential role of information and the vast structural changes
affected in the metamorphosis
from an industrialized to an informationalized world, we must ask whether
the policy goals and
structures of the Intellectual Property system, conceived in an agrarian,
print-dominated society,
remain relevant today.
   <p>  
This paper discusses changes in the cultural context within which we
create Intellectual Property
policy.  Specifically, this paper notes changes in the tools for creating and
marketing information, the
importance of information in economic and social life, the demands of
information and
communication technologies on Intellectual Property enforcement, and th
philosophic givens of the
Intellectual Property system.
<p>
     In light of such drastic changes, this paper concludes by 
suggesting new givens and new tools for
Congress to consider in formulating Information Policy in the Information
Era.    Such policy must
include both a short-term and a long-term analysis and address new social
demands.
<p>







<h3>                                                      INTRODUCTION
<p></h3>
                     "The medium, or process, of our time-electronic technology-is 
                     reshaping and restructuring patterns of social interdependence
and 
                     every aspect of our personal  life.  It is forcing us to reconsider
and 
                     reevaluate practically every thought, every  action, and every
insti-
                     tution formerly taken for granted." - Marshall McLuhan from
The 
                     Medium is the Massage
 <p>
     Throughout history, the evolution of societies has been driven by many
forces.  And many are they
who have tried to direct and influence this evolution with policy and law.
Yet, however well-crafted
were those laws and policies, never have they provided permanent solutions
to any of our problems. 
Because development is always advanced by the creativity and curiosity
implicit to humanity, and
because our physical, social, political, technological and ideological
"environment" is in constant
flux, the path of social evolution can never really be predicted or
institutionalized.  New
opportunities will forever materialize and new environments will always
demand corresponding
legal and policy institutional metamorphosis.  In short, society must
continually hold its social
institutions up to criticism and either demand that they adapt to new
environments or toss them on
the historical policy scrap heap.  Like biological species, societies which
fail to adapt, fail to
survive. 
    <p>  We stand teetering on the edge of a new age.  The Information Era,
blossoming about us, fed on
silicon and fiber optics, affects every aspect of our society from the way we
communicate with
friends, to the way we teach our children, to the way we entertain ourselves,
to the way we work and
create.  In leaps and bounds, the industrialized world is transforming into an
informationalized
one.  <p>
     Yet we are not pulled inextricably along a pre-determined path of
development.  The
information revolution is the first self-aware social revolution in the history
of humanity.  Many
structural  revolutions (agriculture, industry, Christianity) have previously
transformed humanity and
for the decades and centuries following those metamorphoses philosophers
and historians have
"described" the implications of the change.  We, still in the maelstrom of
change, have a chance to act
rather than simply observe in retrospect.  
     <p>Through our present policy choices we sculpt our future society.  
Subtle policy decisions that
we make now might have profound impacts on our future world.  In an era of
change, such as the
present era, such decisions only become more potent.  Our ability to
recognize and utilize our
opportunities, will determine what future we leave our children and
grandchildren.  The key question
therefore, is how will we restructure our society for the altered prerequisites
of the Information
Era ?<p><h3>
             THE  IMPORTANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY
<p></h3>
            "Powerful new technologies are obviously transforming the ways in
which 
            Americans express themselves, communicate information and push
back 
            the frontiers of science....The question before Congress is whether
our in- 
            tellectual property laws and institutions can carry the burden." -
Senator 
            Charles McMathias before the Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights 
            and Trademarks

   <p>  As our society continues its transformation into an information 
society, it is particularly crucial
that we deal successfully with new demands on Intellectual Property policy.   
Through Intellectual
Property we define how information, the primary resource of the new Era,
will be conceptualized
and realized...whether it should be considered an economic commodity or a
societal resource.  
     <p>Should we be able to own information as we own a car or a house?  
If so, what limitations will
we impose on ownership?  How will information owners be protected? 
How will society be
protected from information owners? Answering these questions is not trivial. 
Because information
has become central tomost modern cultural activities, our decisions on how
to define information may
be decisions about international affairs, commerce, communication and
entertainment policy, privacy,
or the distribution of wealth and social status. 
<p>     Although Congress has traditionally been able to incorporate new
technologies into old
Intellectual Property policies, the rapid acceleration of  technological
development, and the novel
nature of the change it initiates, pose serious problems for the traditional
system.  Such changes,
for example,  have created new interest groups and motivated old interest
groups with new, but valid
and important, claims.  
   <p>  For example, traditional Intellectual Property owners are concerned 
with how their works will be
protected and in what ways creation and distribution will be restructured. 
Artists, publishers,
producers, and distributors call for stronger enforcement of their rights in an
age of easy, quick, and
perfect copy technology.    On the other hand,  the newly created industry of
information processors
like database producers, information analysts, or music sample artists who
re-compile and re-create
existing information for new and novel purposes, oppose restrictions.  They
argue that though they use
existing creations, by recompiling them, they are creating anew, adding value
to the information, and
therefore deserve profit as well.  Finally, the general public wants assurance
that they will be able to
use the information which is becoming integral to life at a fair price and that
such information is
available to all who need it.   Though it is a truly wicked problem,
addressing the conflicting needs of
society is crucial.
     <p>In understanding how to respond to the new demands on the 
Intellectual Property system
however, we must first understand what the system hopes to achieve in the
first place and why it
has developed the way it has.  By looking to the Constitution, we can better
understand the goals of
the American Intellectual Property system.  Similarly, by studying the
Intellectual Property system as
a product of historical/structural forces, we can better understand why the
Intellectual Property
system exists in the form that it does and better determine whether new
demands for change are
demands of degree rather than of kind.  If the Information Era changes are
only changes of degree,
we should be able to work within the current system.  If the changes are
changes of kind however,
we must consider altering the basic structure of Intellectual Property policy
to meet new demands.
<p><h3>
     THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
SYSTEM
<p></h3>
         "The Congress shall have the power to promote the progress of science
and 
         useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the
exclusive 
         right to their respective writings and discoveries -Article I, Section 8 
         US  Constitution
<p>
         "The enactment of copyright legislation by Congress under the terms of
the 
         Constitution is not based on any natural right that the author has in his
writings...
         but on the grounds that the welfare of the public will be served and
progress of 
         science and useful arts will be promoted.." - Excerpt from the 1909
Copyright Act
<p>
     The concept behind the American Intellectual Property system is fairly
simple. The government
grants ownership rights to authors and inventors for a limited amount of time. 
And that is it. 
Traditional Intellectual Property policy is simply to set the rules and let the
marketplace govern
the players.  The catch however, is that in order to utilize the
government-granted Intellectual
property rights, creators must transform their ideas into tangible "products". 
Authors must publish
and inventors must fashion inventions.  In both cases, owner profits are based
on disseminating ideas
to the public, which is the primary goal of Intellectual Property rights.  This
symbiotic relationship,
crafted by James Madison, was based on the idea that neither the author's nor
the public's interests
would be subordinated because both were mutually supportive.  By giving
authors and inventors a
monetary stimulus for inventing and creating,  society would continue to
advance and create. 
   <p>  Further, because copyrights and patents are only valid for a 
limited time, valuable information
would be totally transferred to public ownership [non-ownership] after the
creator had been given
enough time to make a profit proportional to his/her investment.  Hence, the
evils of monopoly
inherent in the idea of rights to ownership could be avoided.  In the end, all
parties were served.
<p>
<h3>                          INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY HISTORICALLY
<p></h3>
          "An intellectual property system is made up of laws and practices
[which] 
            reflect the larger society of which it is part.  For, although 
intellectual  pro-
            perty rights have been recognized in natural law, historically,
governments 
            have granted such rights to achieve a variety  of policy goals.  Which
policy
           goal...depends...on history, circumstances, and the overriding needs of 
 
            society." - OTA report on  Intellectual Property in an Age of 
Electronics     
           and Information
<p>
     The second aspect of Intellectual Property policy we should understand is
its
historical/structural development.  Historically, social, economic, political
and technological
factors have all influenced the evolution of the Intellectual Property system. 
Such relationships are
particularly apparent when viewed over time.  Hence, we should look not
only at how the American
system actually coalesced into law, but also, at the process of its formation. 
   <p>  For the idea of Intellectual Property to arise in the first place, 
there were certain prerequisites.  In
Genesis of American Patent and Copyright Law, Bruce Bugbee identifies
these prerequisites as the
following:  a centralized political authority and a government that intervened
in economic affairs; the
development of trade and commerce; a market for literature, art and
invention; and the growth of the
idea of and respect for the individual as creator.  Furthermore, as is now the
case, technology played
a major part.  In many ways the codification and development of Intellectual
Property rights was a
response to the major social, economic and political changes brought about
by the development of the
printing press.    Hence, it is no coincidence that formalized Intellectual
Property laws developed
during the European Middle Ages in which the social/technological
prerequisites were all present.
     <p>Unleashed in the late Middle Ages, the printing press had several 
market advantages over the
traditional monk-based craft system of literary reproduction and several
associated social
ramifications.  Printing press production was fast and cheap and, as such,
greatly enhanced the
dissemination of ideas as publishers sought to make more money by
producing more books. 
With this  greater flow of information, however, came an increasing level of
literacy and a newfound
appreciation of the diversity of ideas and opinions.  Freed from the restraints
of a religious monopoly,
Europe took its first steps towards the Renaissance and the Age of
Enlightenment. 
  <p>   Timing was crucial.  The development of the printing press coincided
with an age of religious and
political turbulence.   Printing presented the European monarchs with a
serious political challenge. 
As McLuhan notes in the Medium is the Massage, "...it created a portable
book, which men could
read in privacy and isolation...Man could now inspire---and conspire."  Yet
equally as revolutionary
were the economic possibilities of the press which created the first
"mass-produced" information
commodity.  The voracious European appetite for knowledge could translate
directly into money and
power for the monarch who dared master it.
    <p> Hence, Intellectual Property policy was born in tension.  Created 
to deal with the threat of
revolutionary ideas, as well as to take advantage of economic opportunity,
early Intellectual
Property law reflected a balance between censorship of the press and
regulation of the expanding
printing trade.
    <p> Early on, for example, the English government struck deals with
publishers.  Copyrights were
initially granted to publishers if they agreed to uphold strict censorship
guidelines.  However, such a
bargain was time sensitive and valid only as long as all players remained
constant in their needs and
expectations.  Hence, it was not long before Intellectual Property policy was
forced to evolve.  
Following the Restoration, the danger of publishers' monopolies was more
the focus of the English
government than censoring seditious or heretical material.  
    <p> As a result, Parliament did not renew the licensing Act of 1692.   
Without government
acknowledgement of copyrights, however, the book trade was thrown into
chaos.  Such a short-
sighted policy decision was, of course, unacceptable.  Parliament quickly
concluded that Intellectual
Property policy tethered divergent monsters which unrestrained could wreak
havoc on their society. 
The resulting policy compromise was the Statute of Anne.  
      <p>Although the Statute of Anne reasserted many aspects of the old
publishers' copyright system, it
also codified the idea of author's right, an idea which had begun to find social
legitimacy in the
writings of Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers.  Hence, publishers could
still count on a stable
market system, and society would not have to fear the dangers of publishers'
monopoly of ideas.
   <p>  What this story tells us is that the concept of Intellectual 
Property rights emerged as a public
policy device relative to social, economic, and political forces and sculpted
by a particular
technology, the printing press. Given the growing influential role of
information and the vast
structural changes affected in the metamorphosis from an industrialized to an
informationalized
world, we must ask whether the policy goals and structures of the Intellectual
Property system,
conceived by an agrarian, print-technology dominated society, remain
appropriate.

          "When I write of an ontological shift.  I mean more than a change in
how we 
          humans see things, more than a paradigm shift or a switch in our
epistemological 
          stance.  Of course, our access to knowledge changes dramatically as
we computer-
          ize....But there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of
in our 
          epistemology.  An ontological shift is a change in the world under our
feet, in the 
          whole context in which our knowledge and awareness are rooted." -
Michael Heim 
          The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality
  
   <p>  In examining the changing environment in relation to Intellectual 
Property policy, there are three
areas of particular interest.  Firstly, because rights are only as valid as they
are enforceable, we must
consider how issues of enforcement affect the Intellectual Property system. 
Also, since Intellectual
Property policy reflects a balance between the market place, the creator, and
the public, we must
consider how the Information Era effects the marketplace and the process of
creation with respect to
the public good.  Finally, we must clarify what information really is and how
best to "work with it" in
its new environment.
<p><h3>
                         ENFORCEMENT ISSUES IN THE INFORMATION ERA
<p></h3>
     On three fronts, Information Era technologies pose serious threats to the
enforcement of
Intellectual Property rights.  Technology is making the reproduction and
manipulation of
information cheaper, faster and more private.  Hence, intellectual theft
becomes more trivial and
Intellectual Property rights less enforceable.  
   <p>  Traditional Intellectual Property was enforceable because to make 
money on an idea, one had to
transfer one's idea into a tangible product, the exchange of which could be
enforced in the
marketplace.  A book, for example, required a printing press, not a trivial
investment, and lent itself
to attaching author and publisher names and copyright symbols.  Further,
distribution was fairly
obvious;  if you suspected Intellectual Property theft, you needed only to go
the book shop, identify the
culprit and apply punishment.  Given the technology, Intellectual Property
enforcement was
convenient.
     <p>New information and communication technologies however, are changing
this convenient situation. 
Cheap, easy-to-use technology makes duplication, cutting and pasting, and
mass, private distribution a
simple matter.  The Intellectual Property "thief" need only photocopy a work,
scan it to hard drive and
upload it anonymously onto the Internet where it can be instantaneously
accessed by millions
worldwide.  In such a situation, it becomes extremely problematic, if not
impossible, to enforce
Intellectual Property rights.  At best, you'll scare off a few and at worst you'll
martyr a few.  On the
one hand, the sheer volume and speed of Intellectual Property theft threatens
to overwhelm the most
diligent policing of Intellectual Property.  On the other hand, as information
markets become more
based in the privacy of one's home, it becomes less possible to detect,
control, and verify
infringements of Intellectual Property law.   Simply putting stricter
regulations and imposing greater
fines is useless in a situation of unenforceablity.   
    <p> Today's computer and media networks combined with  home recording
devices not only make
Intellectual Property "theft" child's play, but they cause consumers to doubt
the very legitimacy of
Intellectual Property claims.  Have you ever made a compilation tape to
listen to on your way to
work?  Have you ever taped a movie from HBO?  Have you ever copied a
program from your home
computer to your office computer, or even given a copy to a friend?  Have
you ever worried about the
Intellectual Property police arresting you because of it?  If you answered yes
to any of these
questions, don't feel bad, you're far from alone.  One OTA survey showed,
"that at least seven in ten
people believe that copying personal possessions, like a record or a program
is acceptable
behavior."  
    <p> Yet, if Intellectual Property rights cannot be enforced, how can we 
assure that creators are
rewarded and thus inspired.  Though "private use" is different from "pirate
use" in that private use is
not a commercial activity in direct market competition at the expense of the
creator, when considered
in total, the private use of the many might have the same effect as pirate use:
creators might lose their
financial incentive to create.  Though laws are only as useful as they are
enforceable, simply
admitting defeat is not the answer.  Congress needs to provide a new,
enforceable incentive system in
place of Intellectual Property. 
<p><h3>


                              INFORMATION ERA MARKETS AND ECONOMICS
<p></h3>
     Just as we must understand how the information environment affects the
legal aspect of Intellectual
Property, we must also consider how it is affected by similar changes in the
economic realm.   Here,
two major changes pose serious challenges to the traditional Intellectual
Property system.  These
changes include: 1) the increasing power of the artist in the market and 2)
collaboration and
knowledge sharing replacing individualism and knowledge hoarding as the
paradigm of the industrial
sector.
   <p>   Cheap, powerful, and simple technological tools are making the 
artist a major player in the
economics of ideas.  No longer is artistic compensation dependent on the
huge institutionalized
publishing and distributing system typical of the past.  Information Era
technologies allow artists to
produce a finished work of high quality with little technical prowess or
capital investment.  For two
thousand dollars, for example, a musician might produce an endless number
of digital CD quality
recordings in a basement without paying 40-100 dollars an hour at a
recording studio.  In fact, the role
of "independents" in the music industry has grown steadily in the late eighties
and nineties.
      <p>Further, aside from being able to produce professionally, the 
artist can also publish and distribute
using electronic networks that transmit text, sound, or images.  "The result" as
the Office of
Technological Assessment's (OTA) report on Intellectual property in an Age
of Electronics
concludes, "is that roles once held by several people are now held only by
one person.  Starting
with a single copy of a letter, article, picture or  musical composition
composed at a computer and
transmitted to readers at the other end of the network, one person can become
author, printer,
publisher, and distributer of work."  Thus market rewards need not cover
costly production costs or
be divided with an ever-hungry publishing company.  Hence, when
considering new systems for
providing incentives, we must consider that artists' profits systems are also
changing.
   <p>  A second change in the economic environment is that of 
collaboration.  In The Machine That
Changed The World,  Womack and others describe how the Japanese system
of  'lean production' is
changing the way all businesses think about production.  Though the system of
lean production is
beyond the scope of this policy analysis, Womack's discussion of information
mobility is particularly
pertinent.  In complex industries typical of the Information Era, like
electronics and automobiles,
information must be mobile so that corporations can 1) meld technologies
from diverse fields, and
2) remain agile in the marketplace.  
     <p>In complex production it is increasingly important to mesh diverse
technical know how.  A
complex industry like automobile production for example, requires microchip
components, materials
research, marketing strategies, engineering, machine workers etc.... Each of
these diverse fields must
be fused, and fused concurrently, into a complex product of some 10,000
parts or more.  Any
damming of information reduces a company's ability to fuse information and
hence, reduces a its
marketplace viability.  The auto companies not up-to-date with the latest
information technologies
developments are not up-to-date in the auto industry.  And just as lean
manufacturers demand
information mobility, so too do lean suppliers, at the top of their own
production pyramids.  
   <p>  Japanese manufacturers like Toyota have developed strong ties even
between competing firms to
lubricate the information pipeline. This is possible because marketplace
viability is not necessarily
based on what you know as much as on what you can do with it.  Reverse
engineering, for example, is
only valuable if you have the organizational learning necessary to transform
data into product.  Plus,
you must reverse engineer it and produce it yourself before you have lost
market share or before the
end of the ever-shortening product cycle.  Information Era manufacturing is
not simply a matter of
copying.  Free information allows the lean-organized company to achieve its
greatest potential
while not necessarily giving competitors any great advantage.
    <p> Just as information mobility is necessary in the manufacturing 
system, so too is it necessary in the
broader marketplace.  As industry becomes more complex and customer
demands more diverse, lean
production shows that old systems of mass production are outdated. 
Companies must be agile in the
new marketplace.  Agility requires that no resources become fixed or
institutionalized. Companies
need an open environment in which to combine and recreate.   Womack
shows that in the post mass-
market age success in the market is quickly becoming a factor of fast product
cycles, lock-in,
customer loyalty, and market share.  Lean companies, he explains, must meet
specific customer
demands, develop life-long relationships with them, and flood the market
with their products if they
hope to be around for the next round of market competition.  Money is to be
made in process and
service rather than in the production of commodities.
  <p>   Because the mass production systems relied on having a specific 
product reproduced over and
over, the Intellectual Property system was necessary to protect that form until
profits could recoup
investment in the production process.  However, in the Information Era,
Intellectual property policy
only hinders efficient production.
<p><h3>
              THE CREATIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE INFORMATION ERA
<p></h3>
     The swiftly evolving creative environment, both the processes of creation
and changes in the
social role of creators, also challenges traditional notions of Intellectual
Property.  In this new
environment fluidity and interactivity have become increasingly important
and will affect the
relationship between incentives, creators, and creations.  Such changes have
important implications
on Intellectual Property policy.
   <p>  Firstly, the development and use of new tools both opens new 
avenues of creation and changes the
old methods.  This is not specific to the Information Era of course.  Such a
change in process was also
instigated by the previous Print Revolution.  In
pre-Guttenberg/pre-ever-scribbling monk days, for
example, authorship as we know it today, was virtually unknown.  The
stories of cultures passed from
the mouth of the storyteller to the ears of the audience.  There was no
authoritative version and the
stories were fluid, changing from day to day from year to year and from
culture to culture.  Because
the story was never frozen in print, it made no sense to think of "owning" a
story.  How could one
own an idea; it was a gift shared by all and transformed by all.  Because we
are reared within a
culture, there can never be a truly novel thought, for all our experiences are
tempered by a cultural
tradition and filter.  At best, there can be only individual versions of a
"culturally-owned" idea.  Such
is the ethic of an oral culture.
     <p>Once the printing press was developed of course, anonymity and 
sharing gave way to private
ownership and individual effort.  The printing press paved the way for the
individual "author", for
through the press, it became possible for a single author to produce and
distribute a work without the
communal efforts needed in previous ages.
   <p>  Now however, new technologies are once again changing the creative
landscape.  Information
technology is a world of cutting and pasting, sampling and remixing.  The
Information Era creator is
not so much a creator as a re-creator.  The creative process is once again
fluid and interactive like
in the days of old.  Just as the printing press and the publishing industry
produced "the author", so
might electronic networking un-produce her.  Like the stories of Homer,
electronic works on the net
are works still in progress, with multiple authors, each at different stages of
revising the work.  In
the December 1994 issue of Scientific American, Gary Stix writes,
      <p>      "Every day 20,000 or so electronic mail messages carry the 
abstracts of new 
            papers  stored in the computer's databases to more than 60 countries. 
Readers 
            of the summaries then download thousands of copies of the full
papers.  The 
            Internet has become the world's biggest blackboard.  As this
phenomenon emerges 
            the definition of scientific collaboration may change.  Commentators
on articles 
            virtually become members of the research team."
  <p>
     Hence, as in the days prior to the printing press, originality of authorship
will be hard to
verify, and must, by virtue of its ambiguity, eventually become less of an
issue.  However, the
Intellectual Property system has no tool to deal with works that do not
necessarily have an
obvious "author".   The present Intellectual Property system, as a societal
tool, based on economic
rewards to foster creativity,  requires that authorship be clearly identified.  If
the process of creation
in the Information Era runs counter to the idea of authorship by fostering
collaboration, the continual
evolution of works, and focussing on performance rather than product, the
question is, what new
policies will provide incentives for future creators. 
<p><h3>
                                INFORMATION IN THE INFORMATION ERA
<p></h3>
     Perhaps the most damning flaw of the traditional Intellectual Property
system in the
Information Era stems from its definition of information itself.  As
information becomes freed from
tangible shells such as  books or  widgets, it poses serious challenges to the
traditional Intellectual
Property system, which is based on the assumption that ideas are solidified in
tangible products.   The
beauty of Madison's "convenient coincidence" was that the Intellectual
Property system was less
about ideas as it was about tangible products.  A creator got paid for his
ability to transform an idea
into a marketable product.  Since ideas and products were realistically
inseparable, there was no
problem.  Ideas, by way of products, could be priced, sold, owned, and
hence could be disseminated
for the good of the public.
   <p>  Now, however, intangible information is being freed of its tangible
product.  In cyberspace,
information takes on a more fluid digital form.   As this occurs it becomes
necessary to understand
information in its natural state, rather than as a tangible product, because in
its pure form,
information has various properties which contradict certain givens of the
market and resist
commodification.
     <p>Unlike "data," information is more of an activity than a "thing"; 
it is a process which happens in the
nexus between minds;  it is experienced rather than possessed;  it is
something that happens "to" you.  
Hence, the ownership of pure information becomes problematic.  How can
one own a constantly
evolving process?
  <p>   Further, unlike tangible property, information stays with and affects
everyone who comes in
contact with it.  That is, it is not something you can 'give away'.  People can
gain information from
you, but they cannot deprive you of it; you'll always have the information. 
Even if you "forget" it,
your synapses have been irrevocably sculpted.  Unlike a horse which you
cannot ride once you sell,
the information you acquire is always yours no matter how many people you
share it with.  Hence,
information defies traditional market distribution.  Rather, it spreads like a
virus, a complex and
unpredictable fractal.  
     <p>Also, information has a tendency to "leak".  That is, it "wants" to 
move and change.  John Perry
Barlow quips, "Trying to stop the spread of a really robust piece of
information is just as easy as
keeping killer bees south of the border."  And like a great telephone operator
game, information will
change as it moves.  As in the days of old, information will evolve with each
telling and each
interpretation.
  <p>   Finally, there is no way to easily determine a set value for 
information. The value depends on the
case and is relative depending on time and distance from the source.  For
instance, last week's second
hand stock information is of little value to today's broker though it may be
very valuable to some 21st-
century anthropologist.  Similarly, familiarity can be more valuable than
scarcity.  Unlike typical
commodities, information gains in power the more it is spread.  As the
Japanese lean production
companies have learned, in the Information Era, market share is often more
important than straight
profit. <h3>
    <p>              THE ANACHRONICITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
<p></h3>
        "The riddle is this: if our property can be infinitely reproduced and
instantaneously          
        distributed all over the planet without cost, without our knowledge,
without its even 
        leaving our possession, how can we protect it?  How are we going to
get paid for the 
        work we do in our minds?  And if we can't get paid, what will assure
the continued 
        creation and distribution of such work?" - John Perry Barlow Selling
Wine Without 
        Bottles
   <p>  It is clear that the demands on Intellectual Property policy are 
changing. The tools for creating
and marketing are changing, the importance of information in economic and
social life is changing,
demands on enforcement are changing, and the very philosophic givens of the
Intellectual Property
system are changing.  From all sides of the Intellectual Property issue, actors
are calling for
change.  
    <p> New groups demand proper representation.  Software developers argue,
for example, that
computer programs represent a new class of "functional works" which use
information to describe a
process as well as implement the process.  Though copyright might
legitimately cover description of a
process, copyright cannot legitimately cover the functional aspect of
functional works.  That would be
like protecting a cake recipe such that no other cook could bake the cake. 
Yet, how do you isolate the
descriptive aspects and the functional aspects of computer programs? 
Programs are both symbolic
and functional in nature.  
   <p>  Meanwhile, old groups like publishers continue to clamor for stricter
protection.  John Perry
Barlow reports that last fall a group of music publishers sued Compuserve
"for it having allowed its
users to upload musical compositions into areas where other users might get
them" even though
Compuserve had no realistic way of monitoring this.
     <p>Typically, Congress has relied on the marketplace to solve 
Intellectual Property problems.  
This option has worked well so far.  For instance, though the introduction of
radio severely limited
copyright enforcement by dispersing a performance over a wide area (making
collecting at the door
virtually impossible), the marketplace created the system of advertiser
support, commercials, to
resolve the problem.  Commercials provided both a means to grant free
service to the public and a
means for providing incentives to creators.  Creators, publisher, and
distributors didn't really care
that Radio, and later Television, created wholesale copyright theft daily,
because they got paid
regardless.  Similarly, the music industry adopted the royalty system in the
form of ASCAP to provide
payments for radio play.  
    <p> Further, publishers have tried to manipulate public opinion by 
alerting the public to the
illegality or immorality of Intellectual Property theft whether with FBI
notices or stickers or by
playing on customers' sense of fairness by stressing that Intellectual Property
theft takes money out of
the pockets of the artists who are giving so much pleasure to their audience.
    <p> Further, companies have used their own technological weapons.  These
technological measures
fall into three general categories.  Companies might develop locks,
scrambling or encryption.  For
example, video publishers scramble videos to confuse the automatic gain
controls of VCRs such that
copies are marred with visual irregularities.  The idea is that copy is less an
issue when copies are
useless to the copier.  Companies can also use technology to monitor
information flow.  That is,
companies can "listen in" and check for Intellectual Property theft.  Finally,
companies, as in the pay
per view case, can provide proprietary channels of distribution such that only
those who pay can get
access to works.
 <p>  There are several advantages to the marketplace approach of course. 
Firstly, The marketplace is
more flexible than the government and can respond much more rapidly to a
fast-moving market. 
Further, reducing the government role avoids costly bureaucracies and
enforcement programs.  
    <p> However, marketplace solutions are far from ideal.  Firstly, they 
put much demand on the
marketplace   By as early as 1984, for example, Warner Communications
already reported losses of
2.75 billion dollars in home taping.  Technology may prevent some
Intellectual property theft, but it is
always vulnerable to the diligent hacker or the ex-cable employee going door
to door offering to
"hook you up for a small cost."  Further, technological measures are costly. 
In determining whether
technological protection is profitable, one must consider how much theft it
prevents compared to the
cost of its implementation. And finally, technological protection may just not
work, or be outdated
rapidly.   
    <p> Further, solutions acceptable to the market need not correspond 
with the interests of the public. 
For instance, though the electronic surveillance of monitoring broadcasts has
been upheld in the
courts so far, it raises serious concerns about privacy.  As information
technologies merge such
varied activities as education, entertainment, medicine, and commerce,
privacy invasion takes on a
new and worrisome meaning.  Who will protect consumers from the all
powerful eyes of monitoring
agencies?  
    <p> Also, there are concerns about the relationship between large and 
small companies in the
marketplace.  The League for Programming Freedom argues, for example,
that the scope of interface
copyright, is so vague and potentially wide that it will be difficult for any
programmer or small
company to be sure of being safe from lawsuits from larger well-established
companies.  Customers
and investors often avoid companies that are targets of suits; an eventual
victory may come years too
late to prevent great loss or even bankruptcy.  Since this tendency is well
known, big companies often
take advantage of it by filing or threatening suits they are unlikely to win. 
Meanwhile, smaller
companies don't have the capital or time to invest in costly patenting of their
own.
    <p> Similarly proprietary schemes like pay per view threaten to 
discriminate against people who
cannot afford the services.  If information becomes accessible only to the
rich, the Information Era
will be severely crippled in its ability to better our society.  Information,
which is crucial to our
lives, must remain accessible to all lest we add another weapon to the
arsenal of discrimination.
   <p>  Relying on the market is clearly a dangerous policy decision.  
Though we must provide
incentives for creators and maintain a healthy market, new policy directions
may better serve our
needs than traditional, anachronistic Intellectual Property policy.
<p><h3>
                    DEVELOPING INFORMATION AGE POLICY
<p></h3>
        "...the intellectual property system may no longer serve social, economic
and 
        political goals...in an information age, given the enhanced value of
information 
        in all realms of life...Congress could use policy mechanisms other than
granting 
        of intellectual property rights to foster some goals not supported by the
present 
        system." - OTA report on Intellectual property in an Age of Electronics
and 
        Information
   <p>  In attempting to solve the problem of an anachronistic policy, we can
either amend the policy
so that it can be made to address new demands and strike a new balance
between forces in society,
or we can discard it and start afresh with new policies designed to cope with
new problems.  In the
case of Intellectual Property we must consider both. <p>
                                                      Rely on Amendment.
<p>     In addressing the needs of the Information Era, Congress could amend
Intellectual Property policy
by modifying portions of the existing law in hopes that, new technological
dilemmas could be solved
by making the present law more appropriate.  In fact, Congress has used the
amendment strategy
before.  In 1976 the Copyright Act attempted to solve the problem of rapid
technological advancement
by making copyright "technologically neutral".  "Copyright protection
subsists" it explains "in original
works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, not known
or later developed, from
which they can be perceived, reproduced or otherwise communicated, either
directly or with the aid
of machine, or device."
   <p>  Amendment to Intellectual Property law may also be appropriate in
solving some specific
problems posed by technology.  For example,  a common theme in the US
Patent and Trademark
Hearings on Patent Protection for Software-Related Inventions last February,
was the need to reduce
the protection period mandated by Intellectual Property legislation.  Jim
Warren of Autodesk argues
for example, that 17 year software patents are unreasonable in an industry
where significant
innovation can be created in months, where most innovation has minimal
cost, where manufacturing
and distribution are trivial, and where the life of products may be only a few
years.
     <p>However, as we saw in the previous sections, in total, the 
problems of information technology are
not problems of degree but  problems of kind.   Accommodation by
amendment can only be a
temporary solution because it fails to resolve fundamental problems created
by new technologies
and new methods of creation.   Since the problems lie at the conceptual core
of Intellectual
Property policy, amendment is only a band-aid approach to the problem.
   <p>  However, such a band-aid approach may be appropriate in the 
transition between the
Industrial and Information Eras.  If there is a moral for us in the story of the
Statute of Anne, it is
that we cannot simply switch policy tools without affecting major social
upheaval.  In forming policy
we must both accept the needs of the present and future as well as respect the
needs of the past. 
Specifically, we can use, policy decisions to make the transition easier.  In
providing short term
relief, there are at least three possible directions Congress could take.
     <p>Firstly, if Intellectual Property is once again considered policy 
rather than natural right, the
government could more easily protect some ideas and not others.  For
example, because the effects of
information technology vary, there are some industrial sectors which need the
Intellectual Property
protection.  For these industries, the traditional Intellectual Property system
works just fine.  For
example, small biotech companies which need large sums of capital for
development and testing, rely
on the patent system to raise money to be reinvested.  
   <p>  Hence, a transition commission to determine which industries need 
what incentives might be
appropriate.  Such a transition commission is suggested by the OTA and
could assume 1) rule making
and determination of rates such as compulsory license fees, 2) administration
of sui generis protection
schemes that fall between copyright and patent protection, 3) collection and
analysis of information
on markets and damages, solicitation and analysis of industry viewpoints, and
solicitation and
analysis of the public's views of their access to information goods and
services, 4) policy planning
and research on technological developments and their effects on the
intellectual property system, and
5) advice to Congress on developments in intellectual property and suggest
legislation as needed.
     <p>Secondly, the present marketplace needs time and stimulus to 
retool.  For example, though
traditional publishing companies are waning in usefulness, they represent a
huge interest group which
as in the days of the Statute of Anne, has the power to drag everyone down
with it.  Like the defense
industry in the post-Cold War world, we must find a place for publishing
companies and other
institutions like them in the future.  In helping the market retool, we must
consider the new needs of
the Information Era and how those industries could meet those needs.  One
possibility might be for
publishing companies to become facilitating groups rather than distributing
groups using their own
ideas, skills, infrastructure, organization, connections, and networks to bring
artists together and help
in efficient, cost sharing marketing and distribution.  The government's role in
facilitating market
transformation might involve tax incentives or other changes in industrial
policy like antitrust
legislation.
   <p>  Finally, in periods of transition, we can assume strain on the 
system for the artists and public as
well.  During periods of strain, the government has a role in relieving
hardship.  Specifically, in times
of market failure, the government can step in.  Such involvement might come
in the form of  greater
support of the arts and creative process through grants and support programs.
   <p>  However, Congress should realize that short term amendment approaches
are only transitional.
Though Congress may act now to ease the burden of transition, it must be
prepared to reconsider
these actions within the next decade as information technologies continue to
advance and expand
the distance between society and Intellectual Property policy.
      <p>                                Future Alternatives to 
Intellectual Property.
    <p> In the long term, we must look to a new information paradigm.  
However, because the boundaries
of the new era are still hazy, we should take our time and decide between
policy options carefully. 
To do so, we should first identify all the important components of the policy
environment and then
develop policy with them in mind.  
       <p><br>    - In the dissemination of ideas we can identify two 
primary groups;
                   Information policy must carefully balance the needs of both the
public and the 
                  creators in order to achieve maximum efficiency.  
      <p><br>  - We can also identify three goals of Information policy;  
                 Firstly, policy must seek to advance the public good through the
support  of its 
                artists and inventors.  Secondly, policy must respect its context by 
balancing the 
                needs of the public, the creators, with their environment.  Finally,
creator's incentives, be     
                 they monetary or social,  must be legitimate, dependable and
enforceable.
      <p><br> - Finally, there are two givens of the new policy environment;
                The Information Era is defined both by its fluidity and interactivity
and the fact that
               performance rather than product determines value.
   <p>  Given these environmental components, Congress might adopt a  minimal
approach to Intellectual
Property law.  That is, the government could back as far away from
Intellectual Property law as
possible by revoking the right of idea ownership.  Instead, Congress could
spend its energy affecting
policy, absolutely necessary for the continued creation of works.
   <p> This approach is particularly well suited for a fast changing 
technological environment in which
the basis for rewards are based on performance, rapid product cycles, and
market share rather than
unenforceable legal protection of tangible products.  Information would
remain as mobile as possible
and policy could adapt more readily than law to changes.  Instead of fighting
an uphill, and ultimately
futile battle against an evolving environment, the government could use
policy to stimulate creation
and protect against market failure.  
   <p>  For one, Congress could substitute other policy tools in place of
Intellectual Property rights like
economic incentives, subsidies or tax exemptions.  The ending of copyright
and patent filing and
litigation alone would have the added bonus of lessening the monetary
burden, especially on the small
entrepreneurial businesses.
   <p>  However, there are important drawbacks of the minimal system which
must be understood and
addressed.  First and foremost, there is the problem with political feasibility. 
 <p>However, by phasing
in policy over the transitional period, and by helping vested interests to
retool, political feasibility
could be greatly enhanced.  Further, the government should begin its own
"philosophical advertising
campaign" much like what the private sector does now in order to promote
mature use of modern
technologies.
    <p> Secondly, the minimal approach would entail risks to authorship and
publishing as we know it. 
However, we must understand that authorship as we know it is evolving.  In
the Information Era, it is
not who first came up with an idea, as it is what has been done with the idea
since then.  Performance,
not product, is the paradigm of the Information Era.  Information Era artists'
incentives stem not so
much from the transition of ideas into products as much as being able to add
value to existing
products.  It is not what you can "make" but what you can "do".
    <p> The fear that there will be no basis for rewards in the Information 
Era is based on the
misconception that data is the same as information.  "Data" is not information. 
Information is a
process.  Artists will get paid for what they can do with their data.  Such
payment includes both
monetary compensation and other rewards like a heightened reputation
making their services more
valuable and desired in the marketplace.   John Perry Barlow notes, "In
aesthetic information,
whether poetry or rock n roll, people are willing to buy the new product of an
artist, sight unseen,
based on their having been delivered a pleasurable experience by previous
work."
   <p> Yet evolution does not necessitate stability.  Given the increased 
value of performance, Congress
could refocus its energies towards other policies supportive of the new
environment.  For instance,
Congress should investigate ways in which trade mark law could be
enhanced so as to more
effectively protect one's name because one's name, or one's reputation, is
what performance seeks to
enhance and is the true basis for rewards in the Information Era.  Similarly,
just as the present market
and government has  waged a morality battle against the unauthorized copy of
protected works, the
government should campaign against plagiarism in the Information Era.
   <p>  Finally, we must take care to facilitate new methods of collaborative
creation.  Such incentives
could firstly take the form of tax breaks or other economic incentives. 
Perhaps such economic
incentives could support "facilitating companies (the old publishers) who
would provide
infrastructure, organization, contacts and networks.  Secondly, the
government has the responsibility
to provide an "Open Platform" through which all members of the society can
internetwork and most
efficiently enhance the creative potential of the society.  In building the
information infrastructure, we
must take care to not to discriminate, and to make sure that all people have
equal access to the new
resources.  Finally, because the government is not the sole supporter of
creativity in our society, it
should provide incentive for private patronage and private investment in the
creation and
dissemination of ideas.  Such aid could be in the form of tax incentives for
private contributors or
matching grants for private groups.






<h3>
                                     POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
</h3>
     The Information Era represents novel change.  Congress should structure
policy to facilitate the
public interest in ways responsive to these changes.  Based on this study, I
recommend that the
Congress adopt these short term "relief" policies;
<br>          --- create a commission to deal with short term transition 
problems.
    +oprovide oincentive^^for anachronistic market iagents (like 
+publishing o(companies) @to 3oretool.
<br>          --- o&Increase government support of the arts and sciences 
through greater investments of public
                    funds.
I further recommend that the Congress adopts the following long term
policies;
    <br>      --- Dispense with traditional Intellectual Property policy.
        <br>  --- Support performance oriented policy and law.
        <br>  --- Increase support for artists and facilitate the emerging 
collaborative creative process.

<DD>The one you are probably looking for. This is the basic
    Unix text file version of BDGttI. If you are using DOS this
    will probably work for you too. If you have line length
    problems, get the ZIP'd version below. This file always
    contains the most current version of the text (&quot;fancy&quot; 
    versions such as PostScript, hypertext, etc., may be somewhat 
    older, as they take time to create after the text version is
    released.)
<DT><a href="netgd3_1.zip"><B>netgd3_1.zip</B></a>
<DD>A ZIP'd-up DOS text version of EGttI. Differs from
    netguide.eff only in that each line ends with a cr/lf
    character pair, instead of just lf. May make it easier to
    view it on a DOS system. 
<DT><a href="netguide_3.1.txt"><B>netguide_3.1.txt</B></a>
<DD>A link to netguide.eff for those that like long names.
    Incidentally, gives the current version number for
    your convenience. Especially intended for sysadmins
    and other Internet and FirstClass redistributors, as
    well as Mac and Amiga users (see also Other_versions/
    subdirectory for &quot;fancy&quot; formatted versions of the
    Guide.) 
<DT><a href="netguide.faq"><B>netguide.faq</B></a>
<DD>This is Joke's Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (FAQ)
    document about EGttI. It should answer almost any query
    about EGttI as it is very in-depth, covering the purpose,
    creation, and location of EGttI including all versions/

    This is used for mailing the guide from the netguide@eff.org infobot

    It is made publicly accessible for download as well, just in case
    someone finds a use for it in this condition.

<DD>Statement on cryptographic technology and
    the Internet, from Internet Architecture Board and Internet Engineering
    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;

    and criticizes Administration export policy.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515.letter"><B>hr_crypto_960515.letter</B></a>
<DD>Letter from Rep. Goodlatte (and over 20 other 
    Representatives) to Clinton Administration urging relaxation of crypto
    export controls and abandonment of Clipper III &quot;key escrow&quot; proposals.
    Also includes Goodlatte press release regarding the letter.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement"><B>hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement</B></a>
<DD>Brief EFF statement on the House 
    letter to Clinton demanding abandonment of &quot;key escrow&quot; and urging 
    relaxation of export controls. (Also includes a copy of the letter).
<DT><a href="s1726_96.bill"><B>s1726_96.bill</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Burns' May 2, 1996, encryption export 
    deregulation bill. As with the ECPA96 bill, co-sponsored by Leahy.
    This bill, known as the Pro-CODE bill, is the most pro-privacy, 
    pro-commerce, pro-Net bill to day, and essentially supercedes the ECPA96 
    and SAFE bills (stronger prohibition against forced key escrow, better
    export dereg, and does not create a new crime.) Need some final tweaking,
    but all in all a very solid piece of privacy legislation.
<DT><a href="eff_procode_ipc_goldkey_960502.announce"><B>eff_procode_ipc_goldkey_960502.announce</B></a>
<DD>EFF statement on S.1726, the
    Burns-sponsored Pro-CODE crypto deregulation bill, on the advent of
    the Golden Key encryption freedom campaign, and on the formation of
    the Internet Privacy Coalition.
<DT><a href="s1726_burns_960328.announce"><B>s1726_burns_960328.announce</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Burns' press release regarding his new 
    encryption export deregulation bill.
<DT><a href="s1587_96.bill"><B>s1587_96.bill</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Leahy's on a roll: Leahy and others introduced this new
    bill to partially deregulate encryption export, Mar. 5 96. - a promising
    move that is sure to raise the level of Congressional awareness of
    increasingly vital online security, privacy and commercial needs.
    Such a bill could also nail the coffin shut on hare-brained
    Administration schemes like &quot;key escrow&quot; (copies of all users' encryption
    keys held for the convenience of law enforcement.) Problems remain in
    the legislation, including unclear language in some areas, and the
    creation of a new felony of using encryption to thwart police
    investigation of a felony - tatamount to making it an extra crime to
    close the curtains when breaking the law. EFF is largely supportive
    of most of the provisions of the legislation. The bill also creates
    a legal infrastructure for key escrow, though it does aim to prevent
    the imposition of such a system. The House version, H.R. 3011, is
    considerably stronger in this regard.
<DT><a href="s1587_96_epic.analysis"><B>s1587_96_epic.analysis</B></a>
<DD>Electronic Privacy Info. Center's analysis of
    the ECPA96 bill.
<DT><a href="eff_s1587_030596.statement"><B>eff_s1587_030596.statement</B></a>
<DD>EFF's largely positive statement regarding
    Sen. Leahy's new &quot;Encrypted Communications Privacy Act&quot;. Some problems
    remain with the legislation, and it would be simpler and better for
    the industry and the public to deregulate rather than shift regulations,
    but the legislation is a major step forward and is certain to raise
    awareness in Congress of vital issues like digital commerce, Internet
    security, and online privacy.
<DT><a href="leahy_pgp_960502_net.letter"><B>leahy_pgp_960502_net.letter</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Leahy's open letter to the Net community,
    on PGP, encryption and new privacy legislation. This appears to be the
    first time any US Senator has publicly used the PGP encryption program.
<DT><a href="leahy_s1587_95_intro.statement"><B>leahy_s1587_95_intro.statement</B></a>
<DD>Sen. Leahy's introduction to his new
    [largely] pro-privacy, pro-encryption bill to reduced export
    restrictions on encryption. The bill, S. 1587, was introduced Mar. 5,
    1996.
<DT><a href="s1726_960513.alert"><B>s1726_960513.alert</B></a>
<DD>ACTION ALERT: Support new pro-privacy bill, the
    Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) bill, S. 1726.
    (May 13, 1996)
<DT><a href="senate_s1587_96.summary"><B>senate_s1587_96.summary</B></a>
<DD>Senate staffers' summary of Sen. Leahy's new
    Encrypted Commmunications Privacy Act, introduced Mar. 5, 1996.
<DT><a href="hr3011_96.bill"><B>hr3011_96.bill</B></a>
<DD>Rep. Goodlatte's &quot;Security And Freedom through Encryption
    (SAFE) Act&quot;, a pro-crypto, pro-privacy, pro-Net bill largely mirroring
    Sen. Leahy's efforts in S. 1587, but with stronger protections against
    imposition of key 'escrow' systems. Like Leahy's bill, this
    legislation (introduced Mar. 5 1996) creates a new, but fairly narrow
    felony of cryptographical obstructing justice in furtherance of a felony.

<DD>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology's
    analysis of recent US President Clinton's executive order, which
    moves to establish yet another version of encryption key &quot;escrow&quot;, as
    well as sets up a &quot;Crypto Czar&quot; - a new US official of ambassadorial
    stature. The message: The Admin does not intend to lose the Crypto
    War, and is ramping up its efforts to pull an end run around Congress,
    the public, and industry.
<DT><a href="961001_wh_clipper3.statement"><B>961001_wh_clipper3.statement</B></a>
<DD>Oct. 10 1996 Clinton Administration key 
    &quot;escrow&quot; and crypto export policy statement. White House say it will 
    allow export of 56bit (still very weak) crypto if the keys are &quot;escrowed&quot;
    in 2 years, and stronger crypto if it is escrowed now. Essentially
    no serious or meaningful change in the Admin's position.

    and David E. Colton, for the Progress and Freedom Foundation. HTML
    version available at http://www.pff.org/pff/encry.html at the PFF site.
    Co-author Keyworth was US President Ronald Reagan's scient advisor.
<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report</B></a>
<DD>May 1996 (pre-publication draft)
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of
    export restrictions. Of particular interest is NRC's end-run around the
    NSA's typical line of &quot;if you only knew what we knew...&quot;: NRC members
    obained security clearances and examined the classifed material, too, 
    and still came to the conclusion that export restrictions and imposed
    key escrow are not the solution. Unfortunately, report also calls for 
    key &quot;escrow&quot; to be explored at least for internal government use, among
    several other flaws (from our point of view), mostly minor. The end 
    result is a definitely pro-crypto, pro-privacy position, and this 
    report is likely to be highly influential on the crypto-policy debate.

    hypocritically-titled Clinton Administration key &quot;escrow&quot; scheme -
    the US government wants the keys to YOUR privacy. This time the impetus
    is coming from Interagency Working Group on Cryptographic Policy (IWGCP),

<DD>This is the transcript of a series of
    hearings held before a subcommittee of
    the House Comittee on Government
    Operations. It is especially interesting
    for the two items it includes in the
    report; one memo shows that the Office of
    Legal Counsel concluded that ITAR was
    unconstitutional, and some testimony
    indicates that the State Department and
    the President may have ignored possibly
    binding legal advice from the OLC.

<DD>Letter from State Dept.'s Office of 
    Defense Trade Controls (controled by the National Security Agency) 
    denying Phil Karn approval to export software that supports Triple-DES 
    encryption. Interesting especially for 3 reasons: The export has nothing 
    to do with public distribution, but was requested to provide security 
    for the foreign, but US-staffed and owned, branch of a US company; such 
    export denial was threatened if the X9 Committee which establishes 
    banking security standards settled on 3DES instead of Clipper - NSA is 
    making good on its threats; and the 3DES export denial portion of the 
    form response appears to be a standard part of the form now (in other 
    words, NSA/DoS may be routinely denying all 3DES exports.)

    Communications Privacy Act), Rep. Goodlatte (the Security And Freedom 
    through Encryption Act), Sen. Burns (the Promotion of Commercie 
    On-Line in the Digital Era Act), and numerous co-sponsors. Despite a few 
    problems, the very similar bills would relax export controls on 
    encryption, allowing the full fruition of online privacy, security, 
    authentication and commerce. They also take steps (strongest in 
    Burns' version) to prevent the mandating of &quot;key escrow&quot; systems.
<DT><a href="Bernstein_case/"><B>Bernstein_case/</B></A>

<DD>Directory of info on PETER D. JUNGER v. DEPARTMENT OF
    STATE, OFFICE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS, &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY case.
    Junger claims the ITAR and AECA export restrictions on encryption
    (particularly the absurdly broad definition of 'export', which includes
    &quot;disclosing&quot; to foreigners, unconstitutionally restricts Jungers First
    Amendment rights to teach a class in which cryptography is detailed, 
    if a foreign student is present.

<DD>May 1996 (pre-publication draft) 
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the 
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of 
    export restrictions. Unfortunately, report also calls for key &quot;escrow&quot;, 
    and buys into the government's wacky idea of a federally-controlled &quot;Key 
    Infrastructure&quot;, among other flaws. NOTE: This file is over 1 megabyte.

<DT><a href="alt_escrow_idea.debate"><B>alt_escrow_idea.debate</B></a>
<DD>Brief debate on two alternative key &quot;escrow&quot; ideas:
    proposal by Dave Staelin for a system in which users choose any crypto 
    but are required to retain copies of all keys used, said keys being 
    obtainable by subpoena or warrant; modified proposal by Ron Rivest, in 
    which copies of keys are held by a &quot;trusted&quot; third party who can be 
    subpoenaed or searched by court order, keeping the escrow &quot;feature&quot; but 
    removing the storage burden on the user. These proposals are followed by
    technical and (brief) legal critique by Matt Blaze, who points out
    fundamental problems in both systems, and finds them infeasible.
<DT><a href="clipper_nist.defense"><B>clipper_nist.defense</B></a>
<DD>1994 statement by NIST regarding key escrow and
    how it is intended to be &quot;voluntary&quot;. NIST maintains the same thing in
    1995, even though FOIA-obtained documents *prove* this is a lie! (see
    /pub/Privacy/Clipper/Clipper_FOIA/

<DD>&quot;Law Enforcement and The
    Architecture of Cyberspace -- Should the Cops on the Beat Design the
    Electronic Street?&quot;, article by David Johnson. Excerpt: &quot;The
    Administration has made its position clear: it will seek to
    encourage the use of the &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; and push for legislation that
    will require electronic communications systems to be designed to
    facilitate wiretapping and surveillance in real time...So we have a set
    of proposals that, in somewhat breath-taking fashion, claim for the
    cops not only the right to walk the beat but a privilege to say just
    how the street will be designed...But no such origin accounts for
    our best public spaces and I can tell you...that putting wiretapping
    at the top of the design priority list is a really dumb idea...&quot;
<DT><a href="denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article"><B>denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article</B></a>
<DD>Paper by Dr. Dorothy Denning
    that paints a picture of imminent &quot;crypto-anarchy&quot; disrupting society if
    all citizens are not required to turn over encryption keys to government
    (via governmental or corporate key &quot;escrow&quot; agencies.) Includes a 
    critique that illuminates many of the logic flaws and fallcies 
    necessary to support GAK (government access to keys) plans like those 
    advocated by Denning and the NSA. All in all, a very strange rant.

<DD>EPIC mini-alert, reporting that FBI 
    director Louis Freeh has already, as of Oct. 95, begun to attack

    the very similar bills would relax export controls on encryption, allowing

<DD>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology's
    analysis of recent US President Clinton's executive order, which
    moves to establish yet another version of encryption key &quot;escrow&quot;, as
    well as sets up a &quot;Crypto Czar&quot; - a new US official of ambassadorial
    stature. The message: The Admin does not intend to lose the Crypto
    War, and is ramping up its efforts to pull an end run around Congress,
    the public, and industry.

<DD>Oct. 10 1996 Clinton Administration key 
    &quot;escrow&quot; and crypto export policy statement. White House say it will 
    allow export of 56bit (still very weak) crypto if the keys are &quot;escrowed&quot;

    no serious or meaningful change in the Admin's position.

    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and 
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or 
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or

    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;

<DD>May 1996 (pre-publication draft)
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of
    export restrictions. Of particular interest is NRC's end-run around the
    NSA's typical line of &quot;if you only knew what we knew...&quot;: NRC members
    obained security clearances and examined the classifed material, too, 
    and still came to the conclusion that export restrictions and imposed
    key escrow are not the solution. Unfortunately, report also calls for 
    key &quot;escrow&quot; to be explored at least for internal government use, among
    several other flaws (from our point of view), mostly minor. The end 
    result is a definitely pro-crypto, pro-privacy position, and this

<DD>Bruce Sterling's renarks at Computers, Freedom 
    and Privacy Conference IV, Chicago, Mar. 26, 1994, on whether or not 
    threats to privacy posed by computerization are for real or not. Classic 
    quote: &quot;I've been asked to explain why I don't worry much about the
    topics of privacy threat raised by this panel. And I don't. One reason
    is that these scenarios seem to assume that there will be large,
    monolithic bureaucracies (of whatever character, political or
    economic) that are capable of harnessing computers for one-way
    surveillance of an unsuspecting populace. I've come to feel that
    computation just doesn't work that way. Being afraid of monolithic
    organizations especially when they have computers, is like being
    afraid of really big gorillas especially when they are on fire.&quot;

    lexicon is not a guide to scholarship. The Workshop Lexicon is a 
    guide (of sorts) for down-and-dirty hairy-knuckled sci-fi writers, 
    the kind of ambitious subliterate guttersnipes who actually write 
    and sell professional genre material. It's rough, rollicking, 
    rule-of-thumb stuff suitable for shouting aloud while pounding the

<DD>Testimony of Bruce Sterling, on the &quot;National

    1993. Excerpt: &quot;...However, it's a truism in technological
    development that no silver lining comes without its cloud.
    Today I'd like to mention two or three trifling problems
    that have come up that were not entirely obvious from the
    perspective of the early 1990s.&quot; Sterlings novel [pun intended] testimony
    is presented as the comments of a hypothetical NII worker from the 21st
    Century. This is probably the first time science fiction has been
    presented as testimony to a Congressional hearing.

<DT><a href="960724_isoc_crypto.statement"><B>960724_isoc_crypto.statement</B></a>
<DD>Statement on cryptographic technology and
    the Internet, from Internet Architecture Board and Internet Engineering
    Steering Group of the Internet Society (ISOC). Excerpt: &quot;The IAB and
    IESG are...disturbed to note that various governments have actual or
    proposed policies on access to cryptographic technology that either:
    (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or
    (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate
    mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or
    (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of
    the government or of some other third party; and/or
    (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only
    to specially authorized organizations.&quot;
<DT><a href="9606_pff_crypto.report"><B>9606_pff_crypto.report</B></a>
<DD>&quot;The Computer Revolution, Encryption &amp; True 
    Threats to National Security&quot;; report condemning Clinton Adminstration
    encryption export policy and key &quot;escrow&quot; plans, by G.A. Keyworth II 
    and David E. Colton, for the Progress and Freedom Foundation. HTML
    version available at http://www.pff.org/pff/encry.html at the PFF site.
    Co-author Keyworth was US President Ronald Reagan's scient advisor.
<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report</B></a>
<DD>May 1996 (pre-publication draft) 
    report by the National Research Council. Report strongly criticizes the 
    Clinton Administration's encryption policies, and calls for relaxation of 
    export restrictions. Unfortunately, report also calls for key &quot;escrow&quot;, 
    and buys into the government's wacky idea of a federally-controlled &quot;Key 
    Infrastructure&quot;, among other flaws. NOTE: This file is over 1 megabyte.
    See 9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz for a gzip-compressed version.
<DT><a href="9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz"><B>9605_nrc_cryptopolicy_draft.report.gz</B></a>
<DD>gzip-compressed version of above 
    NRC report (about 450K).
<DT><a href="alt_escrow_idea.debate"><B>alt_escrow_idea.debate</B></a>
<DD>Brief debate on two alternative key &quot;escrow&quot; ideas:
    proposal by Dave Staelin for a system in which users choose any crypto 
    but are required to retain copies of all keys used, said keys being 
    obtainable by subpoena or warrant; modified proposal by Ron Rivest, in 
    which copies of keys are held by a &quot;trusted&quot; third party who can be 
    subpoenaed or searched by court order, keeping the escrow &quot;feature&quot; but 
    removing the storage burden on the user. These proposals are followed by
    technical and (brief) legal critique by Matt Blaze, who points out
    fundamental problems in both systems, and finds them infeasible.
<DT><a href="clipper_nist.defense"><B>clipper_nist.defense</B></a>
<DD>1994 statement by NIST regarding key escrow and
    how it is intended to be &quot;voluntary&quot;. NIST maintains the same thing in
    1995, even though FOIA-obtained documents *prove* this is a lie! (see
    /pub/Privacy/Clipper/Clipper_FOIA/
<DT><a href="cops_net_architecture_johnson.article"><B>cops_net_architecture_johnson.article</B></a>
<DD>&quot;Law Enforcement and The
    Architecture of Cyberspace -- Should the Cops on the Beat Design the
    Electronic Street?&quot;, article by David Johnson. Excerpt: &quot;The
    Administration has made its position clear: it will seek to
    encourage the use of the &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; and push for legislation that
    will require electronic communications systems to be designed to
    facilitate wiretapping and surveillance in real time...So we have a set
    of proposals that, in somewhat breath-taking fashion, claim for the
    cops not only the right to walk the beat but a privilege to say just
    how the street will be designed...But no such origin accounts for
    our best public spaces and I can tell you...that putting wiretapping
    at the top of the design priority list is a really dumb idea...&quot;
<DT><a href="denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article"><B>denning_0296_cryptoanarchy.article</B></a>
<DD>Paper by Dr. Dorothy Denning
    that paints a picture of imminent &quot;crypto-anarchy&quot; disrupting society if
    all citizens are not required to turn over encryption keys to government
    (via governmental or corporate key &quot;escrow&quot; agencies.) Includes a 
    critique that illuminates many of the logic flaws and fallcies 
    necessary to support GAK (government access to keys) plans like those 
    advocated by Denning and the NSA. All in all, a very strange rant.
<DT><a href="epic_fbi_crypto_childporn.alert"><B>epic_fbi_crypto_childporn.alert</B></a>
<DD>EPIC mini-alert, reporting that FBI 
    director Louis Freeh has already, as of Oct. 95, begun to attack 
    cryptography as a hindrance to law enforcement with &quot;evidence&quot; that FBI 
    efforts were hindered by encrypted files in a recent child porn 
    investigation.
<DT><a href="ellison_key_escrow.paper"><B>ellison_key_escrow.paper</B></a>
<DD>&quot;The Government Doesn't Want Key Escrow&quot;, Carl
    Ellison. Demonostrates that what the govt. really wants is access to 
    citizen encryption keys, and that &quot;escrow&quot; is only one way to go about
    this.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515.letter"><B>hr_crypto_960515.letter</B></a>
<DD>Letter from Rep. Goodlatte (and over 20 other
    Representatives) to Clinton Administration urging relaxation of crypto
    export controls and abandonment of Clipper III &quot;key escrow&quot; proposals.
    Also includes Goodlatte press release regarding the letter.
<DT><a href="hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement"><B>hr_crypto_960515_letter_eff.statement</B></a>
<DD>Brief EFF statement on the House
    letter to Clinton demanding abandonment of &quot;key escrow&quot; and urging
    relaxation of export controls. (Also includes a copy of the letter).

<DT><a href="Clipper_Capstone_EES_Tessera_Skipjack/"><B>Clipper_Capstone_EES_Tessera_Skipjack/</B></A>
<DD>link to directory on Clipper, the
    first US government key &quot;escrow&quot; scheme, and related plans, including
    Capstone and Tessera, higher-speed versions of Clipper (All are based
    on the classified Skipjack algorithm, NIST's Escrowed Encryption Standard)
    Most of the action on this issue was 1993-4, with focus shifting to
    &quot;Clipper II&quot; and &quot;Clipper III&quot; in subsequent years. [Note: This directory
    is aliased to &quot;Clipper&quot; as well as the longer name, to save typing time
    if you happen to need to type the URL manually.]
<DT><a href="Crypto_bills_1996/"><B>Crypto_bills_1996/</B></A>
<DD>Directory of info on new (as of Mar. 96) pro-crypto,
    pro-privacy, pro-Net bills introduced by Sen. Leahy (the Encrypted
    Communications Privacy Act) and Rep. Goodlatte (the Security And Freedom
    through Encryption Act), and numerous co-sponsors. Despite a few problems,
    the very similar bills would relax export controls on encryption, allowing
    the full fruition of online privacy, security, authentication and
    commerce. They also take steps (stronger in Goodlatte's version) to
    prevent the mandating of &quot;key escrow&quot; systems.
<DT><a href="Clipper_II/"><B>Clipper_II/</B></A>
<DD>directory of info on &quot;Clipper II&quot;, the Clinton

    local/state level and in other countries than the US.
<DT><a href="G7/"><B>G7/</B></A>
<DD>directory of info on key &quot;escrow&quot;, crypto export/import, Internet 
    censorship, and other dangerous regulatory resolutions, coming from G7.
    G7 is the &quot;Group of Seven&quot; nations, including the US, Japan, Canada,
    France, UK, Italy, and Germany, and recently also including Russia,
