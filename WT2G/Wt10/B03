<TITLE>ELF and Magnetic Fields Position Paper</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
EXPANDED POSITION STATEMENT ON EXTREMELY LOW FREQUENCY AND MAGNETIC FIELDS</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
Nonionizing, electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies has long been acknowledged as a
potential health hazard.  Exposure limits have come from the American Conference of
Governmental Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Values (ACGIH TLVs), the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards, Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE), and the work of other organizations.  The American Industrial Hygiene
Association (AIHA) has published a series of "Nonionizing Radiation Guides" providing
information and guidance on the safe use of nonionizing radiation.  The primary proven
effect of exposure to this radiation is tissue heating, which, in turn, can lead to adverse health
effects when exposures are excessive.  However, in the extremely low frequency, or ELF
range (300 Hz and below) of electromagnetic energy, the uncoupled electric and magnetic
fields do not cause heating and so have not been thought to be capable of causing similar
adverse health effects.
<P>
At high intensities, ELF electric and magnetic fields have known effects on humans.  These
occur when the fields induce current densities above those typical in the body.  The exposure
limits of the ACGIH TLV and the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA)
guidelines are based on avoiding the effects first noticed as current densities increase above
endogenous levels, i.e. magnetophosphenes and electrophosphenes at about 10 mA/m2.  For
power-frequency fields (50/60 Hz), the ACGIH TLV is 25 kV/m for the electric field and 1
mT (10 G) for the magnetic field, neither level to be exceeded.  The IRPA values depend on
the length of exposure and range from 10 to 30 kV/m and from 0.5 to 5 mT (5 to 50 G) with
a limit of 25 mT (250 G) for limbs.  Few occupations have exposures approaching or
exceeding these limits.
<P>
Since about 1975, some laboratory studies using cells, tissues, and whole animals have
reported biological effects from exposure to ELF fields at intensities below those
recommended by the ACGIH and the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA). 
But virtually none of these laboratory results have been replicated in other, independent
laboratories and no accepted interaction mechanism to explain the laboratory observations has
been advanced.  These biological effects also do not necessarily translate into human health
effects.  Over the same time period, many occupational and community epidemiological
studies have suggested a statistically significant association between surrogates for field
exposure to ELF and a modestly increased risk of any of a variety of cancers (particularly
leukemias, brain cancers, and male breast cancer) and of adverse reproductive outcomes. 
Concurrently, however, many studies have not found statistically significant associations.  All
significant associations have been with exposure surrogates, not with measured fields.
<P>
The AIHA, through its Nonionizing Radiation Committee, is closely following developments
in the area of ELF field health effects.  At present, the AIHA finds that the lack of replicated
studies, an accepted interaction mechanism in the laboratory studies, and an absence of
significant associations with measured fields in the epidemiological studies, make it
impossible to come to a definite decision regarding the magnitude of health effects associated
with exposure to ELF.  Good industrial hygiene and public health practice suggests that when
there are conflicting data (as previously noted in this Position Statement) a cautious approach
is recommended.  The AIHA also supports the need for more research to close the current
knowledge gaps.
<P>
While additional information is developed, the AIHA finds it appropriate to fully characterize
field exposure levels in industrial environments; to provide workers with education and
training on the potential effects of exposure to ELF fields, current exposure guidelines, and
measures designed to protect them; and to follow the exposure guidance developed by the
ACGIH and the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA)/International
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).

<TITLE>AIHA Ergonomics White Paper</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
WHITE PAPER ON ERGONOMICS</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
Ergonomics is a multidisciplinary science that applies principles, based on the physical and
psychological capabilities of people, to the design of jobs, equipment, products, and
workplaces.  The goal is to optimize the interface between people and their jobs by designing 
tasks within workers' capabilities.
<P>
The benefits of well-designed jobs, equipment, product, and workplaces include: improved
quality and productivity with reductions in errors; enhanced safety and health performance;
heightened employee morale; and accommodation of people with disabilities to meet the
Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA) affirmative action requirements.
<P>
Industrial hygienists are concerned with the anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control
of all hazards in the work environment, including hazards related to occupational
musculoskeletal disorders.  Ergonomic design principles should be utilized by industrial
hygienists to ensure that the demands of a job do not exceed workers' capabilities.  Industrial
hygienists should apply the science of ergonomics to ensure a hazard-free work place.
<P>
Within the context of ergonomics there are several areas of interest to AIHA:
<UL>
<LI>a national ergonomics standard
<LI>video display terminal (VDT) legislation
<LI>use of back supports/belts and wrist orthotics as personal protective equipment (PPE)
</UL>
<P>
Lack of attention to ergonomic design principles has been linked to occupational
musculoskeletal injuries (1, 2).  Musculoskeletal injuries affect several million workers each
year with costs exceeding $100 billion annually (3).  Low back pain (LBP) episodes continue
to be the more severe and disabling form of musculoskeletal injuries among all industries (4). 
According to the National Safety Council, 22% of all occupational injuries in 1991 were back
injuries resulting from repeated twisting, bending, and lifting (5).  More recently, upper
extremity cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) have been associated with increasing
work-related disability in a wide range of occupations.  In 1991, according to the Bureau of
Labor statistics, CTDs accounted for 60% of all occupational illnesses (6).  The economic
and human cost to society, employers, and employees is very substantial.
<P>
In response to the increase in LBP episodes and CTDs, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) has issued heavy fines to employers for failing to address the hazards
associated with these disorders and, in some cases, have mandated programs to address these
problems (7).  Labor, government, and to some extent industry, are now advocating a
legislative approach to dealing with these issues.  Recently, OSHA issued an Advance Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking regarding "Ergonomic Safety and Health Management" (8), and
various state and local governments have issued legislation aimed at CTDs and VDTs (9). 
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is in the process of developing a voluntary
consensus standard for the control of cumulative trauma disorders.  AIHA has provided
comments on both the OSHA and ANSI documents.  These comments are attached as appen-
dices to this "white paper".
<P>
The current approach to dealing with musculoskeletal injuries is to conduct audits, then elimi-
nate all CTD and LBP risk factors from the workplace.  However, the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reported that there are currently no dose-response
relationships or validated exposure criteria for CTDs or LBP episodes (3).  Unlike
dose-response relationships for chemical hazards, the science does not support the
development of a specification-based standard for CTDs or LBP episodes.
<P>
CTDs and LBP have also been linked to workers using VDTs (10).  This has created a
concern that workplace design and equipment performance standards should be mandated. 
However, organizational and psychosocial factors may be equally as important as these
physical factors (10-17).  At this time, there is little data available to quantify dose-response
relationships for the physical factors, nor is there any data currently available to quantify or
qualify psychosocial or organizational factors and their dose-response or trigger levels. 
Therefore, a specification-based standard for workstations would not be supported by existing
scientific knowledge.
<P>
A parallel issue that has arisen out of the increase in CTDs and LBP episodes is the sale and
proliferation of back supports/belts and wrist orthotics as types of personal protective
equipment (PPE).  The purpose of PPE is to decrease the effect of physical hazards on 
workers, much like ear plugs attenuate the effect of noise on the human ear.  Review of
existing knowledge about how physical stresses associated with work cause or contribute to
LBP revealed that lumbar supports/belts do not function as PPE (18-19).  In addition, current
biomechanical and physiological theories do not predict such benefits (18).  These devices
have not been found to favorably affect disc compression, strength requirements, or energy
expenditure, and may have only minimal effects on the postural demands (14, 19).  A similar
analysis for upper extremity orthotics, such as wrist splints, wrist braces, or gloves, revealed
limited application of these devices as PPE (19).  Potential benefits, if any, may be balanced
or even overshadowed by potential adverse effects.  The only use of these devices supported
by the literature are as medical treatment devices prescribed by a health care provider to treat
a diagnosed condition; however, the effectiveness and safety of these devices in this context
in the workplace has not been established (19, 20).
<P>
AIHA believes that the control and elimination of occupational musculoskeletal injuries is a
top priority.  Ergonomics is a science that can be applied to the workplace to control hazards
that have been linked to the most prevalent musculoskeletal injuries; CTDs and LBP
episodes.  While addressing these issues will require the participation of health, safety and
engineering professionals, including industrial hygienists, the Association's position statement
on this issue will serve as the basis for AIHA's action on behalf of industrial hygienists and
those whom we serve.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>AIHA supports the development of a national health and safety standard which could
be used in developing comprehensive safety and health programs by employers.  Clearly, the
desire for a national ergonomics standard is driven by the occupational musculoskeletal
injuries; however, the science of ergonomics does not support a specification-based standard,
specific issue-based standard; e.g., VDT legislation to control CTDs.  However, the best
approach to controlling occupational musculoskeletal injuries would be a performance-based
standard.  OSHA's safety and health guidelines could serve as the model.  Employers with a
need to address specific CTDs or LBP episodes could supplement their programs by using
consensus guidelines aimed at specific ergonomic issues such as ANSI Z-365 regarding CTDs
or ANSI HFS 88-100 regarding VDT work stations.
<P>
<LI>AIHA supports continued corporate and governmental funding for research support of
ergonomics in the areas of:  identifying factors that place workers at greater risk, establishing
dose-response relationships; assessing multiple risk factors, including the impact of
organizational and psychosocial factors; developing validated assessment tools for quantifying
exposure; clarifying medical case definitions; and developing greater understanding of the
pathophysiology involved in CTDs and LBP episodes.  
<P>
<LI>AIHA does not support the use of back supports/belts and wrist orthotics for
prevention, but only when prescribed by Health Care Providers for treatment of specific
disorders.  There is insufficient evidence that these devices prevent CTDs or LBP episodes. 
Since these items have little to no valid application as a means of reducing worker exposure
to musculoskeletal stresses acting as PPE, emphasis should be focused on job design rather
than the worker when attempting to reduce injury.

<CENTER><H1>AIHA Risk Identification and Control Publications</H1></CENTER>
<HR>
<H2>Inorganic Lead Guidance Document</H2>
<H3>Leo C. Hearn, Jr.</H3>

Get the latest in inorganic lead guidance with this comprehensive, yet easy to use, manual. The
AIHA <I>Inorganic Lead Guidance Document</I> was first developed and used successfully by
a major international petroleum company seeking effective solutions to the complex inorganic
lead management problems faced by industry. It has been revised for a more general audience.
<P>
The manual allows industrial hygienists and occupational safety and health professionals to
implement a consistent approach for each task in the lead management process, accounting for
guidelines established by OSHA in its "Interim Final Rule for Lead Exposure in Construction."
<P>
Among the topics covered are: "competent person" designation; lead identification and
assessment techniques; exposure assessment and control; OSHA-mandated medical surveillance;
and environmental management issues (i.e., emissions to soil, groundwater, and air).
<P>
The manual is set up so it can be adapted for specific sites and projects. One section covers
task-specific exposure control strategies addressing 12 essential lead management issues. Each of
those ections is included on a 3.5-inch diskette that allows information to be amended for each
project, and as federal regulations change.
<P>
There also is a chapter on contract administration, which provides model specifications. The
information in this chapter is included on the diskette and can be amended for each project. Note
that any changes made must fall within appropriate federal and/or state regulations.
<P>
All this is available for only a fraction of what you would expect to pay. The manual comes in a
three-ring binder. Tabbed dividers separate each chapter, form, and appendix for easy reference.

<H2>Biosafety Reference Manual, Second Edition</H2>
<H3>AIHA Biosafety Committee</H3>

For a detailed look at biohazards in the workplace, the second edition of this important reference
manual is an essential addition to your technical library.
<P>
The manual, prepared by the AIHA Biosafety Committee, is intended to provide basic
information on biohazards and the control of biohazard exposures that can be applied despite the
occupational setting and  the biohazard involved. Bloodborne pathogens, tuberculosis, biogenic
toxins, and allergens are discussed in-depth.
<P>
Information is organized as follows: Three chapters deal with the types of responses generally
associated with exposure to biohazardous agents: infections, intoxications, and allergic
responses. Within those three chapters, there is more detailed information on either specific
biohazardous materials, environments, or pertinent sampling methodologies.
<P>
Two other chapters generically address control strategies and methods for the decontamination,
disinfection, sterilization, and handling of biohazardous waste.
<P>
Five appendices are included. One appendix is a detailed bibliography of biosafety literature, and
another is a book in of itself because it provides an example of a generic bloodborne pathogens
written exposure control program.
<P>
The other three appendices are titled: "Biosafety Level Criteria for Infectious Agents";
"Biosafety Level Criteria for Vertebrate Animals"; and "Biosafety Criteria for Large-Scale
Experiments and Manufacturing."
<P>
Figures and tables throughout help encapsulate important information.

<TITLE>Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
COMMENTS TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND
HEALTH</H2><BR>
IMMEDIATELY DANGEROUS TO LIFE OR HEALTH (IDLHs)
</CENTER>
<HR>
<H2>SUMMARY OF SUGGESTIONS:</H2>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) encourages NIOSH to support a program
to provide reliable respirator selection criteria for workers.  In order to avoid potential mis-application of IDLH values, AIHA suggests a change in the name of these values to reflect their
purpose, such as "Respirator Decision Logic Values" or "Respirator Selection Chemical Criteria
Guides".
<P>
To develop these values, AIHA recommends an approach that involves a review by a panel of
experts similar to that used in developing health-based criteria set by other organizations such as
the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshhold Limit
Values (TLVs), or the AIHA Workplace Environmental Exposure Levels (WEELs) and
Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPGs).  An excellent recent example is the
Community Emergency Exposure Guideline approach documented by the National Research
Council (National Academy of Sciences, 1993).
<P>
The procedures should allow for a critical review of all data (human and animal) relevant to
deriving the guides.  The final values should reflect a weight-of-evidence review of available
information and a scientific consensus.  Approaches using algorithms or formulas coupled to
testing data should be avoided.
<P>
Documentation supporting the approach used and containing the relevant data should be
published with the recommended values.
<P>
A good starting point for developing respirator selection criteria would be the AIHA ERPGs,
especially levels 2 and 3.
<P>
For community emergency planning we recommend that ERPGs be used, however if NIOSH
wishes to provide guidance in this area, this should be done as a separate effort from the
respirator selection program since different populations and purposes are involved and therefore
different criteria would be used.
<P>
<H2>SPECIFIC COMMENTS</H2>
<H3>1.   Use of IDLH Concentration Values</H3>

<B>a. Are there workplace situations in which IDLH values are used for the selection of
respirators?</B>
<P>
IDLH values influence the selection of respirators under non-emergency controlled conditions
when the value of the occupational exposure limit or guide is close to  the IDLH value. The use of
assigned protection factors for respiratory protection are utilized in the respirator selection
process until the IDLH value is reached. When the IDLH value is reached or exceeded, then it is
necessary to use respiratory protection which offers the highest level of protection.
<P>
The type of respiratory protection that offers the highest level of protection is a full facepiece
positive pressure or pressure demand SCBA or a supplied-air respirator equipped with a full
facepiece operated in a pressure demand or other positive pressure mode in combination with an
auxiliary SCBA operated in the pressure demand or other positive pressure mode. 
<P>
Selection of the type of respiratory protection used below the IDLH when the IDLH value and
the occupational exposure limit are close should be supported by an increase in the frequency of
monitoring or a higher level of engineering controls and preventative maintenance or both.  This
would provide the necessary level of confidence that the individual's potential exposure is being
controlled to the degree necessary.  
<P>Under non-emergency conditions where the level of air contaminant is not well controlled, the
potential for the air contaminant level to approach or exceed the IDLH value must be considered
during the selection of the respiratory protection to be used.  If the activities are similar enough to
permit the use of previously gathered monitoring data, then it may be possible to utilize respiratory
protection with lower levels of assigned protection factors where the exposure level is not expected
to reach the IDLH value. 
<P>
Under emergency conditions where the level of the air contaminant is not known or is considered to
be highly variable then use of respiratory protection that offers the highest level of protection is
necessary.
<P>
In addition to the above general situations utilizing IDLH values, some government regulations
specify the use of these values in determining the appropriate selection of personal protective
equipment.  In the hazardous waste remediation industry, IDLH values have been part of the
development of site health and safety plans required by both EPA and OSHA.
<P>
<B>b. For what purposes other than respirator selection are IDLH values used and for what purposes
could they be used? For example, IDLH values could be used in hazard analyses topredict the
consequences of a catastrophic release of a chemical(s) in the workplace or environment.</B>
<P>
Since IDLHs were developed assuming potential exposure to workers, these values should not be
used for evaluating potential exposures to the general population.  It should be clearly stated in the
Pocket Guide that IDLHs are  for use in selecting respirators in the workplace and not for evaluating
consequences of accidental catastrophic releases potentially involving community exposures.  For
community emergency planning we recommend that ERPGs be used, however if NIOSH wishes to
provide guidance in this area, this should be done as a separate effort from the respirator selection
program since different populations and purposes are involved and therefore different criteria would
be used. 
<P>
<B>c. Are there alternative respirator selection criteria that could replace the use of IDLH
concentrations?  Please describe fully such criteria and how they should be applied for respirator
selection.</B>
<P>
NIOSH should consider using Emergency Response Planning Guidelines developed by the American
Industrial Hygiene Association as a starting point for establishing IDLHs.  Depending on the final
definition for the IDLH (see comments below under section 2.a.i.), ERPG levels 2 and 3 should be
considered.  ERPG values are well documented and were established following a weight-of-evidence
review of all pertinent scientific data.  Another source of values is the Emergency Exposure Guidance
Levels (EEGLs) as developed by the National Research Council, although these were developed
primarily for military personnel.
<P>
<B>d. How would workplace safety and health programs be affected if NIOSH were to remove
IDLH values as an element in the NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic?</B>
<P>
The use of an IDLH value or similar guideline is an important part of the respiratory protection
selection process and guidance would still be needed.  Failure of respiratory protection at levels where
a worker's ability to escape is likely to be impaired or where irreversible health effects may occur from
a brief exposure is a critical work situation to consider.  If it is reasonably possible to experience these
levels, then the use of equipment with the highest assigned protection factor and designed for that
type of service should be selected. 
<P>
If NIOSH were to cease publication of the values, it is expected that the gap would be filled, where
possible, by the health and safety community.  The best information sources are those designed for
emergency exposure: ERPGs, SPEGLs (Short-Term Public Emergency Guidance Levels), and
EEGLs (Emergency Exposure Guidance Levels).  A similar hierarchy was published by the
Department of Transportation for use in emergency release scenarios in their 1990 Emergency
Response Handbook  (DOT 1990).   


<H3>2. Methods or Procedures That May Be Used to Establish an IDLH Value.</H3>
It is strongly recommended that NIOSH develop a scientifically based approach to establishing
IDLHs.  The approach should include a critical review of all data (human and animal) relevant to
establishing IDLHs.  Reliance on a simple algorithm-based approach (e.g., 0.1 x's the lowest lethal
dose appearing in the NIOSH Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances) is inappropriate and
should not be used. 
<P>
In developing IDLHs, human experience should be emphasized to the extent data are available. 
However, since this type of information is less commonly available, and, when available, usually only
for low level exposures, animal exposure data most frequently will form the basis for these values. 
The most pertinent data is derived from acute inhalation toxicity studies that have included clinical
observations, pathology, and analytical determinations of exposure levels.  Data using oral, dermal,
and intravenous routes of exposure are of limited or no value in establishing IDLHs.  Developing
IDLHs using data on   "physically analogous" substances should be limited to very specific cases
where the physical and chemical data clearly support such an approach.      
<P>
<B>a. IDLH Definition</B>
<OL>
<LI>Should one definition of IDLH be used by all Federal agencies (e.g., NIOSH, OSHA, MSHA,
and EPA) for all purposes to which the IDLH concept is applied (which may include more than
respirator selection)?
<P>
Acute exposure criteria are used for various diverse and different program areas by NIOSH, OSHA,
MSHA, and EPA.  Therefore, it is unlikely that one single definition can be developed that meets the
needs of all theses agencies.
<P>
For NIOSH's program of using IDLHs as respiratory selection criteria in the event of an accident in
the workplace, the term "immediately dangerous to life and health" is clearly inappropriate.  Terms
such as "Respirator Decision Logic Values" or "Respirator Selection Criteria Guides" should be
considered.  In addition, NIOSH needs to clearly establish the health effects endpoints which meet
the IDLH definition.  As an example, see the attached definitions for Emergency Response Planning
Guideline Levels 2 and 3.  
<P>
Since IDLHs are established considering potential exposure of workers, IDLHs should not be used
for evaluating the potential health significance of accidental releases which may impact the general
population (e.g., as needed by EPA for activities under Section 112 r of the Clean Air Act).  Rather,
Emergency Response Planning Guidelines developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association
are recommended for this application. 
<P>
<LI>Is an IDLH value based on a 30-minute exposure appropriate?  If not, what exposure period
should be used?
<P>
Assuming that the use of IDLHs are limited to use as respirator selection criteria in the event of an
accident in the workplace, as recommended, an exposure duration in the range of 15-60 minutes
(which includes the 30-minute duration) is reasonable.  In addition, the best available acute toxicity
data are in the 30-minute to 4-hour range.  Data for durations of less than 30 minutes are very limited
and are often of questionable reliability.
</OL>
<B>b. Methods of Establishing IDLH Values</B>
<OL>
<LI>Are the method used by the SCP as stated earlier optimal for establishing IDLH values?  What
other approaches could be used?
<P>
The methods described by the SCP, which can be characterized as an algorithm-based approach, are
inadequate and are not appropriate for  establishing IDLHs.  Algorithm-based approaches promote
the concept of using a single (often worst-case) study to establish a health criteria, excluding the
remainder of valuable scientific data.  It is recommended that NIOSH develop and apply an approach
which allows for consideration and critical review of all relevant scientific data available for
establishing IDLHs.  The approaches described by the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and the
American Industrial Hygiene Association (1992) are offered as examples.
<P>
<LI>What toxicological endpoints should be used to establish an IDLH value (e.g., cardiovascular
effects, eye irritation, neurotoxicity)?  How, if at all, should latent (i.e., long-term) effects such as
carcinogenicity or reproductive effects be used?
<P>
All toxicology data relevant to establishing IDLHs should be critically reviewed and considered
including data on systemic effects.  In many cases, the more commonly observed and immediate acute
toxic effects following single acute exposures such as severe sensory irritation and central nervous
system depression will be the endpoint critical to determining the IDLH values. However, for
chemicals which do not produce such effects or which produce these effects only at very high
concentrations, other toxicological endpoints may be determinant in establishing IDLHs.
<P>
For evaluating the potential significance of carcinogenicity on development of IDLHs, we recommend
using the procedure described by the National Academy of Sciences (1986) as a screening tool.  As
described by the NAS, an incremental risk in the range of 10-4 should be used when implementing this
procedure.  Use of an incremental risk in the range of those incorporated when deriving long-term
chronic exposure criteria (e.g., 10-6), as suggested by Alexeeff (1989), is inappropriate for deriving
acute exposure criteria.
<P>
<LI>What short-term toxicity data are needed for setting IDLH values?  What testing methods and
protocols should be applied to obtain these data?
<P>
In developing IDLHs, human experience should be emphasized to the extent data are available.  Such
data include reports of controlled exposures in humans, workplace exposure data, and accident case
studies.  However, it is critical that a careful review is undertaken of all human studies used in the
development of IDLHs.  Particular attention should be given to the methods used to determine
exposure levels.
<P>
Since human data are less commonly available and, when available, usually are only for low level
exposures, animal exposure data most frequently will form the basis for IDLHs.  The most pertinent
information is derived from acute inhalation toxicity studies that have included clinical observations,
histopathology, and analytical determinations of exposure levels. 
<P>
<LI>If lethal concentration or lethal dose data are used in determining IDLH values, what are the
minimum data needed to set IDLH values?  How should the various types of lethal dose data e.g.,
oral, intravenous) be used and how should uncertainty values be applied?
<P>
At a minimum, the full report of at least one (and preferably two) high quality acute inhalation studies
should be available for purposes of establishing an IDLH.  The studies should include reporting
clinical effects, pathological findings, and analytical verification of exposure levels.  The focus should
be on determining the exposure levels associated with the effects as described in the IDLH definitions
not just lethality. Use of multiple so-called uncertainty or safety factors normally associated with the
derivation of chronic exposure criteria is inappropriate for deriving acute exposure criteria.  
<P>
<LI>IDLH values derived by the SCP for ten substances are equal to the lower explosive limit(LEL)
for those compounds. If the LEL is less than the concentration that may impair escape or cause
irreversible health effects, should the IDLH value equal the LEL or should the IDLH value be set
solely on the basis of toxicological and health effects data without regard to the LEL?  If the LEL is
used to derive the IDLH value, as a safety factor, should the IDLH value be set so as not to exceed
some percentage of the LEL (e.g. 10%, 25%,)? If so, please explain the basis for the proportion of
the LEL recommended.
<P>
Since the proposed values would be used for respirator selection, criteria such as flammability or
explosibility should not be considered.  Factoring other safety concerns into respirator selection
obscures the intended purpose.  Flammability or the LEL should be mentioned in the supporting
documentation.  Perhaps the respirator values could be "flagged" when they exceed 10% of the LEL. 
This might alert the responder that hazards in addition to toxicity might determine the appropriate
response.  The value of 10% of the LEL is based upon OSHA's permit-required confined space
standard.   
<P>
<LI>Should IDLH values be calculated based on (1) the lowest exposure causing death, escape-impairing or irreversible health effects, or (2) the highest exposure not causing death, escape-impairing or irreversible health effects?
<P>
The focus should be on determining exposure levels associated with the health effects definitions for
the IDLH.  Escape-impairing symptoms and irreversible health effects resulting from a single
exposure should be considered in the development of IDLHs (see comments below in sections ix and
x).
<P>
<LI>Should the IDLH value be calculated as a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) of a predetermined
benchmark dose (e.g., LC50 or LC10)?  What fixed percentage and benchmark dose should be used? 
If several different lethal dose determinations are reported in the literature, should the lowest of
published benchmark doses be used to establish IDLHs?
<P>
It is strongly recommended that a simple algorithm- based procedure is not used to establish IDLHs. 
As described above, these procedures tend to center on use of a single (often worst-case) study and
exclude all other available information.  Simple use of an increment of an LD50 or LC10 is very
problematic.  This approach would not account for a potentially dramatic difference in the slope of
the dose response curves observed for different chemicals.  For example, chemicals exhibiting the
same median response can exhibit dramatically different responses at the lower end of the dose
response curve.  Chemicals with steeper dose response curves are considered more hazardous than
those exhibiting a more flat dose response curve.  Further, many chemicals have irritation thresholds
above which escape is impaired but below which safe exit is not impeded.  
<P>
It is strongly recommended that an approach involving use of the lowest published study is not used
to derive IDLHs.  In particular, if the Registry of the Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS)
is used as a resource for available toxicity data, all studies cited in RTECS should be critically
reviewed before they are used in determining IDLHs.  This data base is well known to contain
numerous transpositional and other types of errors.  In addition, RTECS should not be viewed as an
all-encompassing compilation of available toxicity data.  Efforts should be made to obtain additional
toxicity data over and above those presented in RTECS.  Rather, an approach based on consideration
of all available relevant toxicological data should be used.  All relevant studies should be critically
reviewed, including the methods, results, and the human health significance of the reported findings. 
The final values should reflect a weight-of-evidence review and a scientific consensus.  
<P>
<LI>Should escape-impairing endpoints such as impaired visibility caused by dusts or mists,
disorientation, and nausea be used to determine an IDLH value?  If so, how should the IDLH value
be set using these criteria (e.g., what dust concentration should be considered as causing impaired
visibility)?
<P>
Assuming that IDLHs are to be used for selecting respirators in the event of an accident in the
workplace, escape-impairing effects are critical in establishing the IDLH. Available information on
such effects (e.g., levels causing severe respiratory effects and lacrimation) should be reviewed.  Again, the focus should be on determining the exposure levels associated with the IDLH definition. 
Use of a simple algorithm alone (e.g., 0.1 - 0.01 x the RD50) as recommended by Alexeeff (1989)
is inappropriate, especially when human data are available.  
<P>
<LI>Should dermal exposure to mists, vapors, or gases be considered in developing an IDLH
concentration?  If so, how should this be factored into the IDLH?  
<P>
Dermal data such as absorption or toxicity would not normally be used in respirator selection criteria. 
Rather, these data would be used in selecting protective clothing.  Perhaps a skin notation similar to
that used in the TLVs and RELs could be used to warn against dermal toxicity. 
<P>
<LI>How would animal toxicity data be used to identify the concentration which an "irreversible
health effect" occurs?  An escape-impairing effect?
<P>
All available data concerning potential systemic and escape impairing effects resulting from acute
exposures should be reviewed.  Following the review, the final IDLH value should reflect a weight-of-evidence determination and scientific consensus on the significance of various systemic effects in
determining the IDLH.

<TITLE>AIHA Position on Title Protection</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2><CENTER>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
POSITION STATEMENT ON TITLE PROTECTION FOR INDUSTRIAL
HYGIENISTS</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) endorses a proactive approach on the
issue of professional regulation.  AIHA recommends and supports adoption of state legislative
and regulatory language to afford "title protection" to the profession of industrial hygiene.  Title
protection defines titles and definitions used by the profession, establishes legal recognition for the
profession, and has the state legally protect the IH titles.  These IH titles may be used only by
those who meet the criteria outlined in the definitions that are part of title protection legislation.
<P>
AIHA further recommends that proactive efforts on behalf of IH title protection assure that
other professions are not excluded from practicing their profession as long as they do not
misrepresent themselves by falsely claiming to possess IH titles.  This proactive approach shall
also include opposition to legislation and regulations that attempt to limit or exclude industrial
hygienists from practicing their profession.
<P>
AIHA will assume a lead in promoting title protection for the profession through its Local
Sections and State Government Affairs Organizations.  Through the Professional Regulation
Steering Committee, or other appropriate means, AIHA will coordinate its activities with the
American Academy of Industrial Hygiene, American Board of Industrial Hygiene and American
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.  AIHA supports reciprocity agreements
among states for industrial hygienists working in multiple states.
<P>
AIHA also supports efforts to have the profession of industrial hygiene recognized in federal
legislative or regulatory language.<BR>
<P>
<B>Adopted by AIHA Board of Directors:  March 22, 1994</B><BR>

Minimum considerations to be made in determining priorities for monitoring worker exposures
are highlighted. Based on the "homogeneous exposure group," the strategy focuses on basic
characterization, qualitative risk assessment and priority setting, monitoring, interpretation and
decision making, recommendations and reporting, and evaluations.
<P>
Multiple flow diagrams provide a clear, overall view of the strategy and close examination of
each of its components. Six appendixes provide a model exposure assessment and basic and
advanced statistical tools to assist in decision making.

<TITLE>AIHA Government Affairs Update</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H1>AIHA Government Affairs Update</H1><BR>
November 15, 1996</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>LET'S DO IT ALL AGAIN!</H2>
Voters around the country have sent a message that many interpret to mean "We like things the
way they are."  The White House stays in the control of the Democrats, the Senate Republican
majority is increased by two, (55-45), and the House remains in control of the Republicans, albeit
a smaller majority (approximately 20 votes).
<P>
What will all of this mean for occupational health and safety?  Insiders offer this early analysis of
what to expect.  In the House, look for the Republicans to again take a look at OSHA reform. 
However, many feel that any serious legislative measures will have to be more in line with the
last Ballenger bill rather than the earlier version. The last version is a somewhat more moderate
attempt to "reinvent" the agency.  Others claim the House will increase its OSHA oversight
activity to be sure the agency continues its "partnership" approach. As for the Committee
makeup of the House, little, if any, change is expected as nearly all members were re-elected.
<P>
<H2>ERGONOMICS</H2>
As for another ergonomics rider, don't bet on it.  The Republicans will likely sit back and see
what the agency does with the issue before any attempt is made to bar continued development of
an ergonomics proposal.  Even if the Republicans think a rider is necessary, it is doubtful they
will tackle the issue until the 1998 fiscal year appropriations process.
<P>
<H2>RISK ASSESSMENT</H2>
Risk assessment is likely to be on everyone's agenda.  Numerous attempts were made in the last
session of Congress, with some small progress, but the issue remains an important one for many
members of Congress. 
<P>
<H2>SENATE COMMITTEE ON LABOR & HUMAN RESOURCES</H2>
Little activity on occupational health and safety issues is expected to start in the Senate.  Many
will wait and see what the House will do.  One major change will be in the committee structure. 
With the retirement of Senator Nancy Kassebaum, a new chairman will take over the Senator
Labor and Human Resources Committee.  Leading candidate is Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont. 
It is much too early to determine how this will change the view on OSHA reform although
Jefferds is considered somewhat more liberal than Kassebaum in his views.
<P>
<H2>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR -- OSHA</H2>
On the agency front, insiders are waiting to see who the President will nominate to fill the
position of secretary of labor following the announcement that Secretary Reich will be departing. 
Most don't expect the President to even consider this cabinet position until sometime after the
holidays.  Will Joe Dear stay on at OSHA?  Most believe Dear would like to stay on at OSHA
and continue his pursuit of reinventing the agency and building a better partnership between
labor and industry/business.  But the swift announcement of the departure of Reich will put
everyone on edge at OSHA.  No one wants to push too hard for programs that a new secretary of
labor may not find appealing.  Once again, the word is that issues must take a back seat as
politics plays itself out.
<P>
<H2>OSHA SIGNALS 1997 PRIORITIES</H2>
Despite the uncertainty of the leadership of OSHA, here is the latest on some of the issues being
discussed at OSHA:
<P>
<B>Ergonomics.</B>  OSHA says that ergonomic hazards are the major workplace problem
today.  Dear has indicated this is a top priority of the agency.  But it is unclear whether OSHA
will float the draft ergonomics standard developed last year.  There is talk they may start
completely over, offer voluntary guidelines or just push a public education campaign.  In a
meeting on November 13, Dear stated it is his intention to move forward with a balanced
approach and consult with all stakeholders.  Dear says he will not rush out with a proposal.  Look
for OSHA and the stakeholders to take a very cautious approach with this issue.
<P>
<B>Health and Safety Program Standard.</B>  This is the second top priority for OSHA in
1997.  The purpose of this standard is to set minimum criteria for safety and health programs that
would be required of all employers.  OSHA has stated it hopes to have a draft discussion
document out sometime after the first of the year.  Discussions are still ongoing about assuring
that construction, maritime and general industry all meet the same minimum criteria.  The
construction industry has put together a draft proposal, but this is on hold because the general
industry draft is not finished.  Dear maintains that he wants this program to focus on a
partnership approach rather than an enforcement approach.
<P>
<B>Recordkeeping Rule.</B>  OSHA has announced it will propose its recordkeeping rule in
January of 1997, but they are also announcing that employers will not likely be required to
comply until January of 1998.  The reasons for this time line are obvious.  Even if OSHA
announces the rule in January, it must then go to the Office of Management and Budget for
review.  OSHA hopes to send it to OMB on April 1.  OMB has 90 days to review.  Then it must
be sent to the states no later than July 1, because the states have six months to adopt the rule. 
This provides an effective date of January 1, 1998.  There are many who doubt this time line will
be met.
<P>
<B>Indoor Air Quality.</B>  No one is even trying to disguise this issue.  Nearly everyone has
announced that the IAQ regulation is on hold indefinitely.  OSHA claims it is having a difficult
time reading the more than one hundred thousand pages of comments on the proposal.  But it is
in no hurry, with Congress threatening oversight hearings on any final proposal.
<P>
<H2>AIHA TO DISCUSS OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY PRIORITIES WITH
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS</H2>
AIHA is playing host to a meeting in early December of more than 20 invited organizations to
discuss issues of mutual concern in the 105th Congress.  This is AIHA's attempt to see if it is
possible for like-minded groups to form some sort of working group to provide a more united
effort on issues of concern in the new Congress.  Most organizations understand that working
individually is not going to accomplish much, but together we may be able to impact more of the
issues.  Future updates will report on any progress.
<P>
<H2>NORTH CAROLINA BECOMES NEWEST SGAO</H2>
The state of North Carolina has been officially recognized by AIHA as the newest state
government affairs organization (SGAO), making it the 13th SGAO.  The North Carolina
Industrial Hygiene Council hopes to press for title protection legislation in the 1997 state
legislative session.
<P>
The issue of title protection seems to remain on the agenda for many SGAOs and local sections
in 1997.  AIHA is aware of at least eight states where legislation is being drafted for introduction
in 1997.
<P>
<H2>STATE OSHA PROGRAMS</H2>
There are currently 23 States and jurisdictions operating complete state plans covering both the
private sector and state and local government employees; and two which cover public employees
only.  Eight other states were approved at one time but subsequently withdrew their programs. 
AIHA receives requests throughout the year to provide information on these state plans.  Should
you wish a copy of  the latest information on the various state plans, please contact Anna-Marie
DiPasquale in government affairs.

<TITLE>AIHA Government Affairs January Update</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H1>AIHA Government Affairs Update</H1><BR>
January 30, 1997</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>The Party's Over - Back to Business in Washington</H2>
With the second inaugural of President Clinton behind us, the ethics case against Speaker Gingrich
somewhat concluded, and most of the President's cabinet named, it's time to get back to business in
the nation's capital.  But just how much business will be conducted remains to be seen.
<P>
The Republicans still hold a lock on Congress for the next two years, and seem to have toned
down their efforts to dismantle the government.  The Democrats have learned it is very difficult to
work from a minority position and are still attempting to provide focus to their efforts.
<P>
What does this hold for occupational health and safety issues and what is taking place today?
<P>
<H2>CONGRESS</H2>
<B>OSHA Reform Legislation</B>
<P>
Most insiders believe that OSHA reform legislation will not be a major item in the 105th Congress. 
On the Senate side, the new chair of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee is Senator
Jim Jeffords of Vermont.  Senator Jeffords is much more moderate in his views on OSHA reform
and has stated the full Labor Committee will probably not be considering OSHA reform. 
However, he has created a subcommittee that would oversee health and safety issues and
appointed Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee as Chair.  In addition, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
has appointed a workplace issues task force, led by Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri.  It is
unclear whether or not this task force will address OSHA reform legislation, but if the issue
appears in the Senate, it would make sense to have it come from this task force.
<P>
In the House, the status quo reigns.  Rep. Cass Ballenger is again in charge of the subcommittee
overseeing OSHA.  Rep. Ballenger is expected to introduce some form of OSHA reform
legislation, albeit a more moderate approach than his measure last time around.  What is more
likely is that the House will keep a close eye on OSHA through oversight hearings.  Rep. Peter
Hoekstra will probably lead this effort.  Bottom line is that OSHA reform legislation will be
difficult to pass in the 105th Congress, especially since no one seems to have the issue at the top of
their agenda.
<P>
<B>Regulatory Reform / Risk Assessment</B>
<P>
Interest in regulatory reform and risk management/cost benefit analysis in particular, has been
expressed by both the House and Senate.  In the House, you can expect to see extensive use of the
oversight process to highlight the concerns with the inefficiencies of the current system.  In the
Senate, Senator Lott has spoken in favor of a regulatory reform initiative.
<P>
Just this week, at least two major meetings were held on the Hill to discuss the issue of risk
assessment and regulatory reform.  It is still too early to determine if this is just talk or if the issue
will become one with teeth in it.
<P>
<B>Small Business Assistance</B>
<P>
As promised, Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York has reintroduced his measure to provide
regulatory assistance for small business concerns.  Important to the IH profession is a section that
would allocate a small percentage of funds from the Department of Labor to assist small
businesses in learning how to comply with federal regulations, i.e., OSHA.  AIHA's interest in this
measure is to see that if such a program is enacted that individuals providing this education,
training and one-on-one counseling are competent occupational health and safety professionals. 
AIHA will be meeting with Rep. Solomon's staff in early February to show our support and
interest.
<P>
<B>Ergonomics</B>
<P>
While most of the discussion on ergonomics is taking place over at OSHA, some members of
Congress are still watching this issue very carefully.  In the 104th Congress, there was one
appropriations rider banning OSHA from publishing an ergonomics standard.  A second attempt at
renewing this rider failed on a very close vote.
<P>
Despite losing this battle, Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas may attempt to again place some sort of
rider on OSHA to keep them from drafting an ergonomics proposal.
<P>
<H2>ADMINISTRATION</H2>
<B>Occupational Safety and Health Administration</B>
<P>
A somewhat clouded agency at the present time.  With sudden resignation of Joe Dear in
mid-December, and a new Secretary of Labor still awaiting confirmation hearings, you could say
that OSHA is on "cruise control" for the time being.  Secretary of Labor-designee Alexis Herman
has provided no hints on what her choice may be for OSHA Administrator.  Acting Administrator
Greg Watchman has been told to be prepared to stay in his position for several months, perhaps
well into summer, before a new Administrator is chosen and confirmed.
<P>
What this means is that OSHA will tread carefully on any issue that may raise the ire of business,
labor or the Congress.  The top two priorities announced at OSHA are the ergonomics standard
and the health safety program standard.
<P>
<B>Ergonomics Standard</B>
<P>
Despite all of the recent "movement" on this issue, most insiders believe this issue will not make
its way to the forefront anytime soon.  Outgoing Secretary of Labor Reich and Joe Dear both stated
that an ergonomics standard is "years away from completion".
<P>
<B>Health and Safety Program Standard</B>
<P>
This is the one issue that may take center stage.  While controversial, it is something that Acting
Administrator Watchman has a special interest in.  Most parties agree the concept is a good one
and this may be the only thing OSHA seriously tackles in 1997.
<P>
<B>Reinvention</B>
<P>
Vice President Gore has signaled his intention to support OSHA in its reinvention initiatives and
this will continue in 1997.  Mr. Watchman has indicated he will continue to move forward with
this initiative and it is hoped that Ms. Herman also supports the effort.
<P>
<H2>STATE ISSUES</H2>
In the states, the major issue for occupational health and safety continues to be the issue of
professional recognition.  With enactment of a title protection law in New Jersey in December,
there are now eight states with some form of professional recognition/title protection laws on the
books.  In early January, Nebraska became the first state to introduce a title protection bill in 1997. 
Colorado has introduced a bill that would allow CIHs to be qualified to bid for state contracts,
placing them on the same footing with professional engineers and architects.
<P>
Many states are also expected to consider legislation addressing the issue of lead-based paint
abatement.  AIHA will be contacting many states to request that CIHs be provided an exemption of
mandated training courses and simply be allowed to take an examination to prove their
competency and qualifications for lead-based paint abatement.
<P>
<H2>AIHA BOARD IDENTIFIES TOP ISSUES FOR 1997-1998</H2>
In mid-December, the AIHA Board of Directors approved the top ten proactive issues of the
association for 1997-1998.  These issues were chosen by AIHA members in a survey lat fall.

</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H1>AIHA Ergonomics Guide Series</H1></CENTER>
<HR>
Each guide in this series will aid professionals in evaluating and improving working conditions.
A list of references is included in each guide; figures and illustrations are included where
appropriate.
<P>
<H2> Cumulative Trauma Disorders of the Hand and Wrist, An Ergonomics Guide</H2>
<H3>T.J. Armstrong and E.A. Lackey</H3>
This guide provides a revealing look at cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) and reviews
workplace risk factors that might lead to CTDs of the hand and wrist. The guide's primary
concern is prevention of CTDs through control of occupational factors. Mechanisms by which
CTDs develop are detailed, as are some of the industries and occupations in which they occur,
some of the likely nonoccupational and occupational causes of CTDs, and thorough steps for
analyzing and designing jobs. A series of diagrams and drawings are included.
<P>
CTDs are a family of muscle, tendon, and nerve disorders that are caused, precipitated, or
aggravated by repeated exertions or movements of the body. Among the examples discussed in
the text are carpal tunnel syndrome, deQuervain's disease, epicondylitis, trigger finger, hand-arm
vibration syndrome, tendinitis, and tenosynovitis.

<H2> Dynamic Measures of Low Back Performance, An Ergonomics Guide</H2>
<H3>W.S. Marras, J.D. McGlothlin, D.R. McIntyre, M. Nordin, and K.H.E. Kroemer</H3>
This guide discusses ergonomic considerations of low back disorders, perhaps the most common
and costly injuries facing society today.
<P>
It is still difficult to evaluate low back disorder risk in the workplace from an ergonomics
standpoint, but this guide provides scientific perspectives on various techniques for measuring
low back musculoskeletal motor performance. Objectives of a low back assessment are compared
with a respective testing technique. The tradeoffs of each are discussed.
<P>
Marras et al. have compiled an indispensable tool for ergonomists and other health professionals
responsible for maintaining a safe and comfortable workplace. As the guide points out, by 
anticipating how the low back will react in certain situations, professionals can take steps to
prevent disorders before they occur.

<H2> An Ergonomics Guide to VDT Workstations</H2>
<H3>C. Grant and M. Brophy</H3>
A growing concern in the workplace today is making sure VDT workstations are properly
designed against ergonomic risks. This guide, the latest in AIHA's Ergonomics Guide Series,
examines this critical area. Christin Grant and Mary Brophy cover in detail cumulative trauma
disorders, back risks, eyestrains, physical agents, and psychological stresses associated with
VDT work. The second part of the guide discusses available controls to eliminate or at least
contain these ergonomic risks.
<P>
Three appendixes help capsulate critical information. Appendix A provides a checklist of
VDT-related risks and suggested interventions. Appendix B lists step-by-step solutions for
properly adjusting one's workstation. Appendix C offers a list of related standards, guidelines,
and resources.

<TITLE>Analysis of EPA's Lead Rule</TITLE>
<HEAD>

<BODY>                                
<H1>LEAD: REQUIREMENTS FOR LEAD-BASED PAINT ACTIVITIES IN TARGET
HOUSING AND CHILD-OCCUPIED FACILITIES</H1>

<H2>FINAL RULE<BR>
ANALYSIS OF SECTIONS 402 and 404 BY AIHA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS</H2>

September 12, 1996


<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
On October 28, 1992, the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X)
became law.  This law amended the Toxics Substances Control Act (TSCA) by adding a new
title to TSCA directing the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations aimed at
fulfilling the purposes of Title X.  In passing the law, Congress mandated that EPA promulgate
the regulations no later than April of 1994.
<P>
Due to delays, the rule was not proposed by EPA until September of 1994.  Following a period
of time for stakeholder meetings and written comments, EPA finalized the rule on August 29,
1996.
<P>
Two sections of Title X were the focus of the EPA final rule on lead.  One is section 402, Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification, which directed EPA to promulgate a final
regulation to govern the training and certification of individuals engaged in lead-based paint
activities, the accreditation of training programs and standards for conducting lead-based paint
activities; and section 404, Authorized State Programs, which provides that any State may seek
to administer and enforce the requirements established by EPA.
<P>
AIHA had a substantial interest in this rulemaking.  Because of the well-known problems
encountered by previous EPA rules governing the abatement of asbestos and the burden placed
on the industrial hygiene profession to become recognized as qualified to conduct asbestos
abatement activities, AIHA spent a considerable amount of time and effort to see that the final
rule on lead abatement did not follow the same path.  In addition to numerous meetings with
EPA personnel, AIHA submitted official written comments to the Agency on November 7, 1994. 
On December 14, 1994, AIHA submitted an addendum to the Agency in response to their request
for additional information from AIHA.  AIHA also enlisted the efforts of the membership to
contact the Agency with written comments on the proposed rule.
<P>
Now in possession of the final rule, AIHA government affairs staff has compared initial AIHA
comments on the proposal with language in the final rule.  The final rule is very complex and
covers many aspects of lead-based paint activity.  This analysis only attempts to cover sections of
the rule impacting the training and accreditation of individuals involved in lead activities.
<P>
<h2>FINAL RULE ANALYSIS</h2>
<P>
<B>1.  PURPOSE OF FINAL RULE</b><BR>
The final rule is intended to ensure that individuals conducting lead-based paint inspections, risk
assessments and abatements in target housing and child-occupied facilities are properly trained
and certified and that training programs providing instruction in such activities are accredited.
<P>
One principal change in the final rule is the Agency's decision to delay promulgation of training
and certification requirements and work practice standards for individuals and firms conducting
lead-based paint activities in public buildings (except child-occupied facilities), commercial
buildings, superstructures and bridges.  There were several reasons for this decision.  Because the
final rule is now more limited, the impact on the profession of industrial hygiene is somewhat
limited.  It is assumed that fewer AIHA members will be participating in lead abatement
activities if the activity is only to be carried out in targeted housing and child-occupied facilities.
<P>
<b>2.  WORK DISCIPLINES</B><BR>
The final rule identifies five distinct work disciplines: inspector, risk assessor, supervisor,
worker, and project designer.  This has been clarified since the original proposed rule.
<P>
<b>3.  TRAINING MANAGER, PRINCIPAL INSTRUCTOR</b><BR>
Individuals involved with the training program must meet minimal qualifications.  In addition to
teaching experience, the individual must have a bachelor's or graduate degree in building
construction technology, engineering, industrial hygiene, safety, public health, education,
business administration or program management or a related field; or meet minimal experience
guidelines.  Included in these guidelines are demonstrated experience in occupational safety and
health, or industrial hygiene.
<P>
AIHA would have preferred to have had the instructor or training manager be limited to
education and experience qualifications in occupational health and safety, or industrial hygiene. 
However, the Agency at least recognized the profession in the final rule.
<P>
<b>4.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS</b><BR>
The final rule contained some major changes to this section.  AIHA, and others, had commented
that a 40-hour training course for many of these work disciplines was unreasonable, especially
for those with some experience and knowledge of lead abatement activity.  Within the final rule,
the courses were made more modular in their design, eliminating potential redundancies in the
course curricula, and the course length was shortened.
<P>
The inspector course is now a minimum of 24 hours, with a minimum of 8 hours devoted to
hands-on training.  The risk assessor course is 16 hours, with 4 hours of hands-on training.  The
supervisor course is 32 hours, with 8 hours of hands-on training.  The project designer course is 8
hours.  The abatement worker course is 16 hours, with 8 hours of hands-on training.  For each
course, the program shall conduct either a course test at the completion of the course, and if
applicable, a hands-on skills assessment, or in the alternative, a proficiency test for that
discipline.
<P>
<b>5.  REFRESHER TRAINING COURSE</b><BR>
The final rule authorizes training programs to seek accreditation to offer refresher training
courses in all disciplines.  Each refresher course, except for the project designer course, shall last
a minimum of 8 training hours.  The project designer course shall last a minimum of 4 hours.
<P>
The proposed rule required that anyone wishing to provide a refresher training course must first
have an accredited training program.  AIHA objected to this requirement, stating that AIHA
should be allowed to develop a refresher course for our own membership without having to
accept others in our training program.  The Agency stated that even though a small majority of
commenters preferred the proposed rule approach, the Agency was changing this in the final rule. 
One of the reasons for the change is that the Agency recognized that under the grand fathering
provisions (discussed later) there is likely to be a high level of demand for refresher training. 
AIHA is very pleased with this approach.  AIHA actually submitted a summary of what a
refresher course could look like and the Agency cited this submission in their comments about
changing the proposal.
<P>
<b>6.  ALTERNATIVE TRAINING</b><BR>
An additional change to the final rule is the allowance for alternative training methods.  The final
rule permits the use of alternative training techniques (e.g., video training, computer-based
training, at-home study programs) as a supplement to the hands-on skills assessment or as a
substitute for the lecture portion of the training course.
<P>
AIHA, along with many other commenters, requested this alternative training approach.  AIHA
also supported maintaining the hands-on skills assessment portion of the training.
<P>
<B>7.  EXAMINATION PROCESS</b><BR>
The final rule is not entirely clear on who provides the end-of-training certification examination. 
In several places, the rule mentions the exam provided by the training provider, while in other
sections it mentions a "third-party certification exam".  AIHA supported the third-party approach
to assure the quality and integrity of the examination process.
<P>
<B>8.  RECERTIFICATION</b><BR>
The final rule changes the recertification interval from a period of 3 years to 5 years, for
individuals who have passed a proficiency test as part of their training.  The Agency agreed with
AIHA and others that individuals already deemed competent and qualified will require less
frequent re-training.
<P>
<B>9.  TRAINING, EDUCATION AND/OR EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS</b><BR>
This is the section where AIHA and many others attempted to have the Agency exempt from
training individuals already deemed qualified (e.g., certified industrial hygienists, professional
engineers).  Some professions requested blanket exemptions, others like AIHA requested partial
exemptions.  AIHA requested that a certified industrial hygienist with 1 year of experience in
lead abatement should be allowed to forego all training and proceed directly to the examination
stage.  AIHA requested that a certified industrial hygienist with no experience in lead abatement
should be allowed to simply attend a one-day refresher course and then proceed directly to the
examination stage.
<P>
In general, the Agency agreed that the basic work experience and/or educational requirements of
many nationally recognized certification programs either meet or exceed the experience and/or
educational prerequisites in the final rule.  However, the Agency disagreed that this experience
and education alone ought to be sufficient for the purposes of certifying individuals in lead
abatement activities.  The Agency went so far as to say that "none of the commenters provided
the Agency with evidence of a currently available training course and/or module that expressly
addresses lead-based paint activities as part of their professional certification process. 
Furthermore, commenters did not present evidence that their certification programs included
hands-on instruction in the conduct of lead-based paint activities".  Therefore the final rule does
not provide for any training exemptions.  The Agency went on to say that it was willing to work
with professional organizations and other groups that want to develop training courses for their
members, and of course, the final rule does contain a "grand fathering" section (discussed later).
<P>
<B>10.  REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION</b><BR>
AIHA hoped to convince the Agency that individuals seeking to become certified should meet
minimum educational and/or experience requirements.  While the Agency recognized
certification as an industrial hygienist as one of the professions requiring no experience, the final
rule still allows for individuals with a high school degree and at least 3 years experience to attend
the training course and become certified.
<P>
<B>11.  GRANDFATHER CLAUSE</b><BR>
In early drafts of the proposed rule, the Agency made no mention of certification based on prior
training.  The proposed rule contained a grandfather clause and the final rule also contains a
grandfather clause.  AIHA, and others, worked hard to have some type of certification procedure
put in place for individuals already considered qualified.  While the final rule did not produce
everything AIHA requested, it does provide an alternative method.
<P>
The final rule states that any individual who received training in a lead-based paint activity
between October 1990 and March, 1999 is eligible for certification.  The individual must meet
the same education and/or experience requirements, successfully complete an accredited
refresher training course and pass a certification exam administered by EPA.  The individual
would be exempt from having to attend the classroom instruction, other than the refresher course.
<P>
<B>12.  STATE PROGRAMS</b><BR>
The final rule authorizes states to adopt their own lead-based paint abatement program, so long
as the program is at least as protective as the Federal program.  During discussions about this
provision, there was considerable confusion about what the phrase "at least as protective as"
meant.  Some thought a State program had to be identical to the federal program.  Others thought
there was some room for flexibility.  All agreed it needed some clarification.
<P>
The final rule states that a state program does not need to be identical to the federal program. 
While individuals still must be certified under any State program, if the State can demonstrate
that their requirements are at least as protective as the federal requirements, the Agency will
consider approving the program.  This flexibility allows AIHA and others to approach individual
States in an attempt to achieve greater recognition for the competence and qualifications of the
industrial hygiene profession.  Of course, it also allows the states to make the requirements even
more stringent.
<P>
<B>13.  LABORATORY RECOGNITION</B><BR>
The final area of considerable interest to AIHA pertains to use of a recognized laboratory to
conduct the analysis of lead samples.  The final rule defines a recognized laboratory as an
environmental laboratory recognized by EPA pursuant to TSCA section 405(b) as being capable
of performing an analysis for lead compounds in paint, soil, and dust.  AIHA supported inclusion
of this definition in the final rule.  AIHA is one of only two accrediting authorities approved by
EPA to recognize laboratories capable of conducting this analysis.

<TITLE>AIHA Comments on ASHRAE Proposed Revision to Standard 62</TITLE>
<HEAD>

<BODY>                                
<H2><CENTER>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
COMMENTS ON ASHRAE PROPOSED REVISION TO<BR>
STANDARD 62</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<HR>

The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) is pleased to provide comments to
ASHRAE regarding the proposed revision to Standard 62. AIHA is the world's largest association
of industrial hygienists and others in the occupational health community with a membership
exceeding 12,000. AIHA members are frequently asked to provide their expertise relating to
indoor air quality.
<P>
The ASHRAE standards, particularly Standard 62, are often relied upon by AIHA members.
Accordingly, changes to this standard impact our members significantly in the course of their
professional practice. AIHA applauds the efforts of the committee and recognizes the difficult task
faced in revising this important consensus standard.
<P>
The comments submitted by AIHA were prepared by the AIHA Indoor Environmental Quality
(IEQ) Committee Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee. Additional comments were prepared by
members of the AIHA Technology Committee, Noise Committee, Biosafety Committee and
Workplace Environmental Exposure Levels Committee, as well as input and oversight by several
members of the AIHA Board of Directors.
<P>
<U>In accordance with the ASHRAE comment procedures AIHA respectfully must disapprove of
the revised Standard as presently proposed. </U>The reason for AIHA's disapproval is that many
of our comments should be essential elements of the standard. Several comments which apply to
the revised standard as a whole are listed below. The remaining comments follow, arranged by
section number and the appendices.
<P>
<B>Overall Comments:</B>
<P>
The Standard is overly complex and needs substantial editing or rewriting to make it more usable.
One solution may be to rewrite the Standard with code language on the left side of each page and
practice language on the right side of the page. The addition of common examples in the manner
used by the National Institute for Building Sciences (NIBS) would be helpful. Additional
definitions for all new terms and clarification of some currently vague definitions are also
necessary.
<P>
As presently proposed, the Standard does not address provisions for recognizing IAQ problems,
including test methods. The Standard also does not address training provisions or qualifications for
professionals applying the standard.
<P>
The Standard should state clearly that acceptable ventilation is only one component to providing
acceptable indoor air quality to building occupants. Other elements such as custodial practices
clearly impact indoor air quality but are not addressed by this standard.
The use of carbon dioxide measurements as an IAQ investigative tool, with appropriate language
concerning its use, should be reinstated in Standard 62.
<P>
<H2>Section 1. Purpose</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
The Standard should specifically mention that the purpose of the standard is not to specify
methods for source management or control in industrial facilities.
<P>
<H2>Section 2. Scope</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
The Standard should include a statement that control of contaminants in industrial workplaces is
not included in the scope of the standard.
<P>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
21  The first sentence in this statement includes commercial, institutional and residential buildings.
However, the second sentence indicates that "Principles contained in this standard may also be
applied to other spaces intended for human occupancy". Not excluding industrial facilities may
cause some designers to apply the dilution ventilation principles to industrial or light
manufacturing facilities where source controls would be more effective and less costly; and where
the dilution ventilation, as described in the standard, may be inadequate.
<P>
<H2>Section 3. Definitions</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
This Standard introduces many new terms such as MSR and VOT to replace terms commonly used
such as QSA and QOA. We recommend that commonly accepted terms be used where possible. If
this is not possible, all new terms (e.g., DVR, MSR, VOT, transfer air, Eac) should be defined.
<P>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
The definitions of <I>acceptable indoor air quality</I> and <I>acceptable perceived indoor air
quality</I> need to be more tightly defined. The terms <I>substantial majority, no dissatisfaction,
not likely to be, known contaminants,</I> and <I>significant health risk </I>are vague.
<P>
<I>Air change rate:</I> It is unclear whether <I>the air flow rate</I> includes only outdoor air,
or may include recirculation of transfer air.
<P>
<I>Exhaust air</I> is specifically defined as being mechanically exhausted. Infiltration and
exfiltration are defined as <I>leakage through unintentional openings.</I> A specific definition
of <I>relief air</I> should be included to cover all of the means by which air can move through
the building envelope. This concept should be used throughout the standard.
<P>
<I>Source:</I> "Water and/or moisture" should be added as potential source(s) of indoor air
contaminants.
<P>
<H2>Section 4. Application & Compliance</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
The application of this Standard is determined by classifying a building (or area of a building) by
use. This may be difficult to do in practice because many buildings are, in fact, mixed use. The
flow diagram on page 4.2 (Figure 4.1) only provides three choices: industrial, commercial and
industrial, and residential. There is no path for mixed-use buildings. Two examples of the
difficulties raised are as follows:
<P>
1. One of the major work trends of today is the shift of individuals to working at   home. If
someone adds a home office to their residence, do they now need to   meet the commercial
requirements? What about a forward-thinking developer   who wants to build housing specifically
tailored for individuals running home-based businesses--what requirements should the developer
be required to meet?
<P>
2. Companies conducting industrial operations often place the offices of certain   staff workers
(e.g., process engineers) in areas of their industrial facilities. What   requirements should be met?
<P>
It is not entirely clear why there is a distinction between commercial and institutional and
industrial buildings as to the need for acceptable indoor air quality for the individuals working in
these buildings. It is not clear what operations are to be considered commercial versus industrial
(e.g., assembly is often an industrial operation).
<P>
As written, the standard does not permit partial compliance. Since many building owners will
voluntarily attempt compliance for existing buildings, partial compliance (i.e., by section) should
be permitted or encouraged.
<P>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
Figure 4.1 Compliance Flow Diagram--The path for residential buildings states the requirement is
to "Design, construct <I>and operate</I> per Section 9." It is likely to be very difficult (not to
mention politically unacceptable and an invasion of personal privacy) for municipalities to attempt
to require individuals in their private homes to operate their systems to the requirements. It is
advisable to limit the requirements relating to ventilation systems <I>operation</I> to multi-unit
dwellings and only then to the ventilation systems which are actually controlled by a building
manager (rather than individually controlled by individuals residing in the building).
<P>
<H2>Section 5. General Requirements</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
Consideration should be given to retaining the bracketed explanatory notes in some form. The
notes are very helpful in explaining the goals the committee was attempting to achieve and in
helping readers of the document gain a better understanding of the standard itself. Also, it might be
a good idea to keep the shaded portions of the standard where they are or provide an explanation
as to where they may be conveniently accessed. This is a very complex standard and any
information which will assist the reader in understanding, interpreting, and properly applying the
standard is highly recommended.
<P>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
Shaded Introduction: add "and to insure thermal comfort of occupants." at the end of the first
sentence.
<P>
5.1(G) Documentation should include applicable non-code consensus standards and guidelines,
such as NFPA 45 and ANSI Z9, as appropriate.
<P>
5.1(I) The term "sequence of operation" should be included after "description of ventilation system
controls,"
<P>
5.4 The separation of air into the 5 classes leaves much to the interpretation of the user. The
proposed standard allows for recirculation of laboratory air, including fume hoods. No mention is
made of the ANSI Z9.5 standard for laboratory ventilation, the recirculation of air criteria of
NIOSH or OSHA requirements for laboratories. Coverage of chemical laboratories already
covered by ANSI Z9.5 should be eliminated.
<P>
5.4.2.4 - Class 4 Air: Under exceptions 1. - If certain areas where chemical exposures are expected
to produce Class 4 air, a "buffer area" between the positively pressurized area and the occupied
adjacent areas should be installed to prevent infiltration of the Class 4 air into these adjacent areas.
<P>
5.6.6 - Minimum Air Cleaning and Filtration: If the new filter rating of 60% per ASHRAE 52.2 is
equivalent to a 25% to 30% dust spot rating, the minimum filter efficiency may be on the low side
for certain applications. It is not unreasonable to specify a dust spot rating of 50% or better. The
standard should require some type of expandable filter brackets (channels) which would
accommodate a higher efficiency filter at a later date if the facility manager wishes to upgrade the
filtration. The expandable bracket could also lessen "filter blow by" effect.
<P>
5.6.11.2 Due to the toxicity and lack of warning properties presented by carbon monoxide, any
carbon monoxide based demand controlled ventilation must be equipped with redundant sensors,
controllers and control devices.
<P>
5.7 Shaded area. 2nd sentence: Change "Acceptable" to either "Unacceptable" or  "Unhealthy" to
clarify this statement.
<P>
<H2>Section 6. Design Ventilation Rates</H2>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
6.1.2 The Standard as followed by designers will consistently result in the minimum ventilation
rates for buildings. Guidance should be provided in the standard when more than the bare
minimum might be appropriate, and the potential problems when designing only to meet the
minimum rates.
<P>
6.1.3.1 Simple System Procedure. The Standard states that ventilation rates prescribed by this
procedure are intended to dilute and exhaust odorous bioeffluents from occupants and a moderate
amount of odorous and sensory irritant contaminants from other types of sources common to that
type of space. A statement defining what is considered a <I>moderate amount</I> of odorous and
sensory irritant contaminants will help clarify the intent of this procedure. The standard should
more clearly define when recirculation of air containing odors or hazardous contaminants is
permitted and when it must be totally exhausted; filtered/cleaned and recirculated; or recirculated
without filtration or cleaning. The term <I>harmful contaminants</I> also requires definition.
<P>
6.1.3.2 Prescriptive Procedure. As in paragraph 6.1.3.1 above defining the terms <I>moderate
amount</I> and <I>harmful contaminant</I> would clarify the intent of this procedure.
<P>
Table 6.2 (page 6.8): The default values are not universally accepted, yet are expressed as single
numbers. A range for these default values should be reported.
<P>
6.4.2 Comfort Criteria. The Standard does not mention the test methods for determining materials
and furnishings emission rates in support of using lower design ventilation rates than the outdoor
air requirement per unit area listed in Table 6.1. Establishing standard test methods for developing
emission rate data will facilitate comparison of data from different test labs. Consideration should
be given to test methods developed by ASTM Committee D22.05.
<P>
<H2>Section 7. Construction and System Start-up</H2>
<B><I>7.1 Construction Phase</I><BR>
General Comments:</B>
<P>
Many health-related IAQ problems occur during construction, renovation and remodeling in
occupied buildings. The provisions to isolate major construction areas are strongly supported in
this regard.
<P>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
7.1.1 Reasonable HVAC filtration should be in place at all times, including construction.
<P>
7.1.2 Replacement of water-damaged insulation before final construction is justified in order to
control potential microbial contamination.
<P>
7.1.3 The general concept of isolating major construction areas from occupied space is supported
with the understanding that implementation will be based on site-specific circumstances. For
example, the most stringent containment is needed where hazardous materials or very sensitive
occupants are involved. Critical but not continuous barriers may be sufficient when an entire floor
is being renovated. Similarly, capping or filtering of the return air should be a system-specific
decision. The SMACNA 1995a document referenced provides guidance on available options for
implementing this section.
<P>
7.1.4 Notifying the HVAC operator of renovation or construction activities is important in any
building, whether occupied or not.
<P>
<B><I>7.2 and 7.3 System Start-Up and Documentation</I><BR>
General Comments:</B>
<P>
Many IAQ problems are caused by HVAC systems which are not operating as intended due to
deficiencies in air balance, controls operations, and sanitation. Systems should be closely checked
in these areas following both new construction and major renovation. Requirements for testing,
inspecting, and documenting all appear to be reasonable and justified.
<P>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
7.2.1 The balancing provision is supported and appropriate.
<P>
7.2.2 While the concept for testing drain pans is good, the measurement of residual water can be
difficult and subjective. Perhaps the two inch spot of water criterion could be rewritten in more
general language or as an example for guidance only.
<P>
7.2.3 Duct inspection and filter change is appropriate.
<P>
7.2.4 While a 48 hour purge after construction is ideal, it is often not critical to health protection
and may not be practical in some situations. More flexibility is suggested in implementing this
provision. Alternatives include continuous (overnight) ventilation for a period after the space is
occupied or starting up ventilation earlier in the construction area, but after activities producing
significant odor and dust are completed. A purge at this time would help accelerate off gassing
while allowing occupancy to occur sooner. While negative pressure might be more difficult to
achieve at this time, a waiver should be considered if no detectable odor, dust or hazardous
materials will migrate to occupied space.
<P>
<H2>Section 8. Operations and Maintenance Procedures</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
The requirements for Operations and Maintenance Procedures appear appropriate for commercial
buildings, however guidelines for training of the responsible person who will oversee this program
should be added along with a section describing how a response to an IAQ concern should be
addressed.

<P>
<H2>Section 9. Requirements for Residential Buildings</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
The minimum ventilation requirements for residential buildings, including the outside air
requirements, appear appropriate for these structures.
<P>
9.1.2 Local Exhaust Requirements. The minimum requirements in Table 9.1 are appropriate.
However, the requirement for installed mechanical exhaust systems to achieve the minimums is
not appropriate for all climates. Areas where indoor temperature modification is not necessary for
comfort and where passive ventilation adequately supplies the minimum exhaust rates should not
be required to install mechanical systems.
<P>
9.1.3 The term <I>occupiable floor space</I> is vague when applied to residential buildings. A
note explaining whether basements, attics, closets, garages, enclosed porches, etc.  constitute
<I>occupiable floor space</I> would be helpful. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) may
have definitions appropriate to adopt.
<P>
9.2.4.3.2 The sound ratings for kitchen exhaust fans should be restated as guidance  rather than a
mandatory element of the standard.
<P>
9.2.4.5 We strongly support the requirement for providing instructions on the proper operation and
maintenance of ventilation systems in residential buildings to the owner and occupant.
<P>
<H2>Section 10. Normative References</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
Consider adding the American Conference of Governmental Hygienists (ACGIH)<I> Industrial
Ventilation Manual</I> as a source for local ventilation alternatives to dilution ventilation.
<P>
<H2>Appendix A.1: Rationale for Prescriptive Outdoor Air Rates [Informative]</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
Since the rationale for the prescriptive air supply rates references lab and field studies wherein an
80% satisfaction rate for both adapted and unadapted persons, some thought and consideration
ought to be given to incorporating the European concept of designing for a desired satisfaction
percentage. Perhaps this could be considered as an alternate option for the designer.
<P>
<H2>Appendix A.2: Rationale for Minimum Supply Rates [Informative]</H2>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
Second paragraph, 1st sentence: Change "allergic" to "allergenic"
<P>
Second paragraph, last sentence: Change "health care patient treatment spaces" to "patient
treatment areas in health care facilities"
<P>

<H2>Appendix A.3: Determination of Simple Systems Requirements [Informative]</H2>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
Equation A.3-4: define the rating method for a "minimum filter efficiency at 3 microns of 60%."
<P>
<H2>Appendix B: Analytical Procedure [Informative]</H2>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
B.1 Ventilation to Meet Health Criteria. The Standard provides guidance on obtaining source
emission rates. These rates may be obtained from the manufacturer, literature searches, or by
testing the source material. The Standard makes no mention of test methods for determining
emission rates. Establishing standard test methods for developing emission rate data will facilitate
comparison of data from different test labs and manufacturers. Consideration should be given to
test methods developed by ASTM Committee D22.05.
<P>
<H2>Appendix C: Air Quality Guidelines [Informative]</H2>
<P>
Paragraph 2. This paragraph discusses guidelines for application of ACGIH threshold limit values
(TLV) to indoor air contaminants. Since the user of this appendix will more than likely be
unfamiliar with the ACGIH TLV's or the basis on which they are established, include the following
information: The basis on which the TLV values are established may differ from substance to
substance; protection against impairment of health may be a guiding factor for some, whereas
reasonable freedom from irritation, narcosis, nuisance, or other forms of stress may form the basis
of others. This allows the user to make an informed decision as to the applicability of this data to
the design issue of concern.
<P>
Paragraph 3. At the conclusion of this paragraph the following wording should be included: The
levels (concentrations) listed in Table C-1 may not accommodate a significant percentage of the
building population in all instances. In such cases, more stringent criteria may be appropriate.
<P>
The inclusion of guidelines employing numerical values will undoubtedly be interpreted as
pass/fail standards. Therefore, we recommend that the following be inserted:
<P>
"These values are intended for use by professionals with appropriate training and  experience.
These limits are not to be used to distinguish safe levels or to define a  relative index of toxicity."
<P>
<H2>Appendix D: VOC Concentrations, Emissions, Data, and Ventilation [Informative]</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
The appendix is a good overview of studies concerning volatile organic compounds and their
health effects.
<P>
<H2>Appendix E: Acceptable Perceived Indoor Air Quality When Smoking is Permitted
[Informative]</H2>
E.2.1. It would be helpful to make a reference in this section to E.4.2, <I>Design Smoking
Density,</I> which provided assumptions upon which to base the design.
<P>
E.3.1.3 Wording about how this over-pressure is to be achieved would be helpful. It is intended
that this be achieved through exhaust ventilation in the smoking and smoke-exposed zones, or
through the general ventilation system itself?
<P>
The dilution volume required appears excessive. A typical room measuring 20 feet by 20 feet with
10 foot high ceilings would require a complete air change for each cigarette smoked in order to be
acceptable by unadapted non-smokers.
<P>
A reference for the dilution volumes should be given.
<P>
<H2>Appendix F1: The Relationship Between Carbon Dioxide, Perceived Air Quality, and
Ventilation Rates [Informative]</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
This appendix provided use information related to the limitations of using carbon dioxide
measurements for evaluating indoor air quality and ventilating. However, the appendix fails to
recognize that carbon dioxide measurement can be a useful tool when performed properly by a
skilled practitioner. The use of carbon dioxide measurements must be reinstated.
<P>
<H2>Appendix F.2: Requirements for CO2 Demand Controlled Ventilation System
[Normative]</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
Many of the assumptions strongly criticized in Appendix F.1 to rationalize limiting the use of CO2
measurements (e.g., adequate mixing of room air) are used in Appendix F.2. This is inconsistent.
The limitations for a CO2 demand controlled ventialtion system are not clearly addressed.
Literature references must also be provided demonstrating the system's effectiveness.
<P>
<H2>Appendices G.1, G.2, and G.3</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
Appendix G.1 clarifies the relationship and differences between ventilation and air change
effectiveness. The Appendix correctly notes that many factors are responsible for achieving
effective HVAC and air change performance. The Appendix also properly notes that more
research is needed in this area.
<P>
Appendix G.2 defines terms and equation variables and derives appropriate equations necessary to
prevent either under or over ventilating multiple spaces. The goal is to assist the designer in
determining minimum ventilation rates.
<P>
Appendix G.3 provides the guidelines for applying the procedures derived in G.2. It is helpful in
that the information supplied assists the designer im making certain assumptions necessary for
implementing the procedures defined in G.2 and for applying the procedure correctly and selecting
the appropriate parameters.
<P>
All three appendices are necessary for assisting one to understand better the terms, definitions, and
requirements for designing and achieving effective HVAC performance and air change efficiency.
<P>
<H2>Appendix H: Rationale for Pre-Occupancy Ventilation [Informative]</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
This appendix provides guidance for startup of building ventilation so that VOCs emitted by
facility components are sufficiently diluted to maintain acceptable IAQ during initial occupancy
and throughout the day. Although ventilation lead time may not be justified by health research on
VOCs, it is reasonable, however, in terms of odor control and comfort.
<P>
State that earlier HVAC start-up may be needed to maintain building temperature  and relative
humidity. Outside air is not necessarily needed for this purpose.
<P>
The equation used assumes an overnight shutdown and a constant volume system.   More lead
time might be needed on a Monday morning or where VAV systems  are involved. The calculation
should either add a safety factor or provide  examples showing common exceptions.
<P>
Many users may not have the background to evaluate VOC loading from building  sources. They
should be encouraged to seek the assistance of professionals with  this expertise.
<P>
<H2>Appendix I: Depressurizations Measurement for Combustion Appliances
[Informative]</H2>
The appendix contains a protocol for measuring the potential combustion appliances in a residence
to operate under conditions of back draft, drawing combustion products into the living space. The
protocol is clear and appropriate.
<P>
<H2>Appendix J: Procedures for Verifying Ventilation Design Parameters [Informative]</H2>
J.1 Suggest title of the section J.1 be changed to "COMMERCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL
BUILDINGS," otherwise it could be inferred that institutional buildings such as schools and health
care facilities are not covered in this section.
<P>
J.1.1. States that outdoor air flow rate into an air handler can be determined by multiplying total air
flow rate with percentage of outdoor as calculated by "temperature or tracer gas balance "
<P>
Use of temperature differences in supply, return and mixed air streams appears to conflict with the
shaded informative language of 5.6.9.1 (p. 5.16) in which it is stated that using temperature
measurement is "usually inaccurate" and "should not be used in this application." Since in many
situations access to the outdoor air intakes makes velocity measurements impractical, it therefore
appears that this paragraph essentially prescribes tracer gas testing. Can temperature differences be
used or not?
<P>
J.1.2 (second paragraph) States that "supply airflow rate to a space should be measured with a
velocity or velocity pressure traverse of the <I>outdoor air intake</I> ....". Measurement at the
outdoor air intake only works if the area in question is being provided 100% outdoor air (no
return) and there are no other losses between the air handler and the serviced zone. It appears that
this paragraph intended to require measurement at the <I>supply air outlet </I>in the space.
<P>
J.1.4 (second paragraph) States that exhaust airflow rate be measured with a velocity or velocity
pressure traverse of the <I>outdoor air intake</I> ...". It appears that this intended to require
exhaust measurement at the <I>exhaust fan.</I> Based upon J.1.1 in which tracer gas testing
appears to be preferred, and J.1.3 in which tracer gas testing is prescribed (air change
effectiveness), it may also be practical to also use tracer gas testing (via constant injection method)
for the exhaust measurements required in J.1.4. Suggest that language be placed in this section
allowing for this. The standard does not account for air exfiltration which may occur through
building leakage in a manner similar to the way it accounts for air infiltration.
<P>
J.2.4 Should read "This procedure applies to local exhaust ...." (insert "to" after "applies").
<P>
<H2>Appendix K: Alternative Compliance Section for Building Codes</H2>
<B>General Comments:</B>
<P>
As the introductory paragraph of Appendix K notes "upgrading existing buildings to meet the
standard may be impractical." However, after stating this, Appendix K goes on to suggest that any
existing building should be required to meet the standard if the occupancy of a space changes,
different equipment is installed (unless it is of like size and kind) or an addition is constructed to
the building. It is not clear how these changes will make practicable (or even possible) for an
existing building to suddenly meet the requirements of the standard. Typically, ventilation systems
are an integral part of a building and cannot be easily changed.
<P>
For compliance (enforcement) purposes it would seem advisable to limit the applicability of this
standard to "new construction" and "building renovations" and to make each of these defined
terms. "New construction" could be defined to include both new buildings and additions to
existing buildings which are larger than x% of the existing building. "Building renovations" could
be defined to cover the circumstances where a building is completely gutted and re-built or
remodeled.
<P>
<B>Specific Comments:</B>
<P>
4.3.3.1 Alterations: General
<P>
The simple replacement of a building component or piece of equipment should not trigger the
applicability of this standard. Building owners should be able to upgrade their buildings and
equipment without triggering the need to comply with all the requirements of this standard. Since
complete compliance could be very expensive, this provision could have the unintended
consequence of discouraging the gradual improvement in the indoor air quality of a building
through incremental improvements to the building ventilation system. Conversely, building
owners should not be permitted to intentionally avoid compliance through a piecemeal approach to
renovation projects.
<P>
4.3.4 and 4.3.5 Repairs and Continued Use. These provisions should <I>not</I> be considered
advisory in nature. Instead, they should be moved to Section 4 so that it is clear that this Standard
does <I>not</I> apply to repairs, and existing buildings not undergoing extensive renovations or
additions.
<P>
<H2>Appendix L: Conversion Factors [Informative]</H2>
In the first line, "25C (77F)" should read "25C(77F)"
<P>
Under units for particles, "aerometric" should read "aerodynamic"
<P>
<H2>Appendix M: Controlling Microbial Growth [Informative]</H2>
This appendix provides a useful overview of the issues and design considerations related to
reducing microbial amplification in buildings.
<P>
<H2>Appendix N: Rationale for Exhaust Outlet Minimum Separation Distances
[Informative]</H2>
The information in this appendix is a useful adjunct to the document.

<TITLE>Global Hazard Communication White Paper</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
WHITE PAPER ON GLOBAL HAZARD COMMUNICATION</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To ensure optimum health and safety worldwide, AIHA believes there is
a need for harmonization of chemical hazard warning requirements and the development of a
global approach to hazard communication.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
It has been estimated that there are as many as 650,000 hazardous chemical products
marketed and distributed in the United States.  Although workers have the greatest potential
for exposure to these chemicals, and thus for experiencing adverse health effects, consumers,
emergency responders, transportation workers, and others are also at risk. The most
widespread regulatory approach for protection of these people is to require producers to
provide information so the potential for exposure is minimized and those working with the
products can protect themselves.
<P>
The United States is not the only country that has taken this kind of regulatory approach. 
Canada has adopted a similar Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS)
and the European Union has several directives that deal with this issue, addressing both
workers and consumers.  The United Nations' Committee of Experts on the Transport of
Dangerous Goods has made recommendations for labeling and marking of hazardous
materials in transit.  Other countries have requirements in this area as well, but the four
systems mentioned are considered to be the major ones in use.
<P>
An international mandate for harmonization of hazard communication requirements was
adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in
1992.  Under the terms of that agreement, an internationally harmonized system should be in
place by the year 2000.  An international coordinating group on harmonization has been
assigned the task of meeting that mandate.  Formed under the auspices of the International
Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS), this group is comprised of all of the international
agencies that have responsibilities in this area, as well as representatives of the four major
systems and other affected groups such as employers and employees.
<P>
Although all of these systems have the same general purpose protection of people who are
potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals their requirements differ.  In some cases, the
definitions of hazards are different. For example, because of varying flash point cutoffs a
chemical may be considered flammable in one country but not in another, or it may be
considered flammable for purposes of transport but not for purposes of worker protection. 
Different warning statements, symbols, colors, and other factors also contribute to a
patchwork of diverse and conflicting requirements, and unequal protection for users.
<P>
AIHA supports the processes and efforts of OECD/EPA, OSHA, ANSI, and other
organizations attempting to address technical and policy considerations and reach consensus
on a wide variety of hazard communication issues.  In order for hazards and safety
precautions to be understood worldwide, risk needs a common set of definitions, one set of
symbols, one set of safety and health phrases translated into different languages, and one
format for presentation.
<P>
The development of the European Economic Community (EEC), the implementation of the
NAFTA agreement, and an emphasis on global competition is expected to result in an
increasing growth of international trade.  The shipment of hazardous materials from country
to country presents the challenge of assuring that workers involved in the manufacture,
shipment, storage, and use of these products are able to recognize the hazards, and to
understand the steps they need to take to protect themselves from harm.
<P>
Industrial hygienists are environmental health professionals concerned with the anticipation,
recognition, evaluation, and control of all hazards arising from the workplace that may cause
sickness, impaired health and well-being, or significant discomfort and inefficiency among
workers or citizens of the community.  As one of the premier organizations of environmental
health professionals, AIHA is concerned with minimizing risk to workers and the general
public from adverse effects due to improper handling of hazardous materials.

<H3>Benefits of Global Hazard Communication</H3>
Consistent hazard definitions, labeling requirements, and MSDS requirements will result in a
multitude of benefits for people who may be potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals, as
well as for companies involved in international trade.  The benefits gained from the
development of global hazard communication guidelines include the following:
<UL>
<LI>Hazards and risks will be addressed consistently, regardless of their country of origin;
<LI>Comprehensibility will be increased due to consistency in the health and safety
messages conveyed on labels and in material safety data sheets;
<LI>International trade will be facilitated since one type of label, data sheet, and shipping
paper should suffice for all countries under a global system;
<LI>Emergency response will be facilitated with simplified written and pictorial
communication;
<LI>Hazards will be treated in a consistent manner;
<LI>Emerging nations will have a basis from which to develop their own regulatory
systems;
<LI>Costs of compliance and enforcement with regulatory requirements will be reduced;
and
<LI>Product liability risks will be better controlled.
</UL>

Many issues will need to be addressed in the development of a global hazard communication
guideline to ensure effective implementation.  AIHA wishes to comment on the following:
<UL>
<LI>Comprehension of Hazard Information
<LI>Consistency and Quality of Worker Training

<LI>Accuracy, Clarity, and Availability of MSDSs
<LI>Quality of Product Labeling
</UL>
<H3>Comprehensibility of Hazard Information</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>AIHA believes that all hazard information should be provided in the
primary language of the intended audience and in a format that is targeted to the audience's
educational and literacy level to increase comprehension of the
information.</BLOCKQUOTE>

All of the hazard information systems in existence are based on the assumption that users will
read and understand the information presented, and will modify their behavior to handle the
chemical appropriately.  Comprehensibility studies of these systems have not been conducted
to ensure that this is the case.  Warning statements and symbols have generally been selected
by technical experts or regulators with no particular expertise in training or communication,
and little research has been conducted to determine whether or not readers of hazard
information can understand what is presented.  Some of the aspects that should be considered
include the number of elements included on a label, and recognition and understanding of the
symbols and phrases used to convey hazard information.
<P>
Comprehension of hazard information is limited by the multiplicity of languages in
international trade.  Comprehension is limited further due to the number of functionally
illiterate people who come in contact with hazardous chemical products. The percentage of
workers who may not be able to read and comprehend the hazard warnings is quite high.  A
needs assessment should be done to identify the unique characteristics of each worker group. 
The hazard communication should be structured to address these needs.

<H3>Worker Education</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>AIHA believes that training methods should be performance-based,
creative, interactive, job- specific, and tailored to the language and educational level of the
worker.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Training is the key to worker protection.  However, there is a wide disparity in the quality,
content, and frequency of training in companies worldwide.  Limitations in measuring
comprehension of hazard information make it difficult to determine if the message is clearly
received by the worker.  Within the United States many workers are not adequately trained or
knowledgeable in the hazards of their specific jobs, evident by the fact that the training and
information portion of the hazard communication standard is the third most commonly cited
OSHA violation. Since many employees tend to rely on their supervisors for health and safety
information, management commitment is needed to ensure that supervisors are trained to
inform workers effectively on health and safety issues; that is, to translate the general
information from the MSDS to the practical considerations on the job. It is most critical in
smaller companies or those without health and safety professionals since there can be a lack
of understanding of the hazards by management.
<P>
AIHA recognizes that effective education is the key to ensuring that workers are informed of
the hazards of specific materials and of the protection needed to prevent illness and injuries. 
Individuals training the work force need to understand 1) the principles of adult education to
properly formulate, plan, and execute successful worker training, and 2) technical health and
safety information.  Training is most effective when it is keyed to the worker's specific job.
Training must involve seeing, hearing, and performing the actual steps required to provide
adequate protection. Chemical safety and health information should be incorporated into
process operating instructions. As a follow-up to the training, a demonstration of proficiency
beyond a written test can be an effective way to verify whether the message was understood
and implemented by the worker.

<H3>Accuracy, Clarity, and Availability of MSDSs</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>AIHA believes that the accuracy, clarity, and availability of MSDSs
need to be improved through a standardized format that focuses the user's attention on the
key protective information.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The accuracy and comprehensibility of MSDSs vary greatly, resulting in inadequate
communication of the true hazards to the worker.  Format variables have a significant
influence on the readability and understandability of an MSDS.  Well-arranged text not only
makes the document more inviting and physically easier to read but can aid the reader's
understanding.  Many of these factors are described in detail in the American Institutes for
Research Guidelines for Document Design.
<P>
The paperwork required to keep hard copies of material safety data sheets readily available
creates an administrative burden on managers and creates a obstacle to providing quick and
easy access to information.  The lack of specific requirements for MSDS form, format, and
content has led to an astonishingly wide diversity in data sheets.  This in turn has further
complicated employee training, understanding, and the ability to automate MSDS data
retrieval systems.
<P>
The role of the MSDS has expanded from health and safety to environmental and community
emergency response purposes. Consequently, the information contained within the data sheet,
as well as potential users, has increased significantly.
<P>
The ANSI Z400.1-1993 provides an example of an MSDS format that improves
comprehensibility and ease of use.  In this ANSI standard, various sections of the MSDS
have been related to specific target audiences.  For example, the Hazards Identification
section describes information of significant immediate concern to emergency response
personnel, including the material's appearance.  The Personal Protective Equipment section,
on the other hand, is identified as intended for employees, occupational health and safety
professionals, and emergency responders.  The ANSI standard in effect is becoming an
international standard.  It may be used in the United States and Canada to comply with their
standards. The European Union has adopted the same sections and headings, and the
International Labor Organization (ILO) has also endorsed them.  Although formal agreements
among the systems involved have not taken place, this voluntary effort has had significant
impact on encouraging clarity and compatibility in data sheets from different countries.

<H3>Product Labeling</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>AIHA believes that labeling of hazardous materials should include
standardized warning signs and pictograms that clearly depict the types and levels of hazards
in an understandable manner to ensure that workers are adequately alerted to the hazards of
the products with which they are working.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Labels can lack target organ information and often fail to describe the type of personal
protective equipment or other precautions a worker should take to reduce the potential for
exposure.  The development of a universal labeling system geared to providing hazard
information for various educational levels, literacy levels, and multilingual users would be
very useful in this regard. The reliance on pictograms should include information on target
organ effects, use of personal protective equipment, and other special hazards.

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

AIHA supports the development of global hazard communication guidelines including
consistent requirements for the classification of chemicals as to their hazards, labels, and
material safety data sheets. In addition, AIHA believes that recommendations for effective
training programs should be made available.  These guidelines should be adopted by all
nations to ensure that workers and the general public can protect themselves from exposure to
hazardous materials.  Although implementation of such a program will require the
participation of many parties, AIHA's position statement on this issue will serve as the basis
for the association's action on behalf of industrial hygienists and those we serve.

<H2>Industrial Hygiene Auditing: A Manual for Practice</H2>
<H3>AIHA Management Committee; edited by Alan J. Leibowitz</H3>
This long-awaited manual goes beyond theory in tackling one of the most crucial issues
occupational safety and health professionals face today: industrial hygiene auditing. Drawing
from practical, hands-on experience, the authors provide step-by-step guidance for workplace
evaluations.
<P>
The manual, edited by Alan J. Leibowitz, CIH, CSP, was prepared by the AIHA Management
Committee.
<P>
Industrial hygiene auditing encompasses a wide area. It includes evaluation of chemical,
physical, and biological exposures; the interaction of workers with machinery; and the effects of
the workplace on the environment. This manual compares specific audit areas with good practice
guidelines, rather than regulations or standards, because "good practice" should include
compliance with applicable regulations, and principles of "good practice" usually
are more constant than regulations.
<P>
Information is detailed in two ways. The main part of the manual is broken into five sections.
There is an overview of industrial hygiene audits and the reasons companies need to conduct
them. Subsequent chapters concentrate on preparing for audits, conducting them, knowing what
to audit, and managing post-audit activities.
<P>
In an easy-to-follow format, the auditing process is dissected thoroughly from beginning to end.
Questionnaires after each section encapsulate important information and serve as a handy
reference for review in the future.
<P>
Following the text are five valuable appendices, which can be used during several stages of the
audit. Readers are encouraged to make copies of the appendices for use in their own audits.
Appendix A is an example of a pre-audit questionnaire; Appendix B has examples of an
industrial hygiene auditing protocol and a health, environment, and safety program management
audit protocol; Appendix C provides examples of two exception reports; Appendix D lists
examples of proper wording for audit findings; and Appendix E has examples of program
evaluation forms. The appendices are included on a 3-1/2 inch PC-compatible diskette.

<H2>Exploring the Dangerous Trades:<BR>
The Autobiography of Alice Hamilton, M.D.</H2>
For the first time, this revealing autobiography by a remarkable forerunner of the industrial
hygiene movement is available through AIHA. Occupational medicine pioneer Alice Hamilton
tells in her own words how she helped change history and the reasons for her unprecedented
success in what was truly a male-dominated profession.
<P>
Dr. Hamilton, in whose name AIHA recently established an annual achievement award, was a
leading authority on lead poisoning and other industrial hygiene concerns years before AIHA
was even formed. But this book is more than just a narrative of her accomplishments in
occupational medicine; it provides insight into her personality, her humor, her beliefs and, most
important, her determination to make the world a better place.
<P>
Even today, 25 years after her death, Alice Hamilton's story remains as poignant as ever.

<H2>New Frontiers in Occupational Health and Safety: A Management Systems Approach and
the ISO Model</H2>
<H3>Edited by Charles F. Redinger and Steven P. Levine</H3>
This new book thoroughly examines an emerging international issue: development of the
occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS), which many experts believe will
help build a necessary global bridge between trade, environmental protection and sustainable
development.
<P>
The "management systems" approach to international organization and coordination is embodied
in ISO 9000, a standard created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
Various aspects of ISO 9000 are examined in this book and form the framework of the
discussion. The authors offer solutions that differ markedly from traditional command/control
methods of achieving health and safety goals, especially since command/control approaches are
increasingly under fire in this ever-changing international environment.
<P>
One chapter probes conformance of ISO OHSMS standards in public-sector procurement
specifications to the requirements of GATT/WTO. Another examines critical features of an ISO
9001/14001-harmonized health and safety assessment instrument.

<H2>Field Guide for the Determination of Biological Contaminants in Environmental
Samples</H2>
<H3>AIHA Biosafety Committee; edited by H. Kenneth Dillon, Patricia A. Heinsohn, and J.
David Miller</H3>
The proper collection, storage and transport of environmental samples for biological analysis is
an important responsibility for industrial hygienists and other health professionals. This new
book explores this field of expertise and offers advice and solutions to the problems facing
professionals working with biological contaminants.
<P>
This field guide, prepared by the AIHA Biosafety Committee, addresses the sampling of various
types of airborne and bulk (source) biocontaminants, including suspended biogenic dusts and
mists, surface swabs, and biologically contaminated bulk materials and fluids. Examined in the
guide are methods for sampling of viable and nonviable fungi and bacteria as well as substances
derived from them   including endotoxin and peptidoglycan from bacteria, and mycotoxins,
ergosterol and volatiles from fungi.
<P>
Also, techniques for the determination of specific antigens (e.g., mite antigens) are addressed.
Among the specific areas covered are diseases caused by bioaerosols, viable air sampling
instruments, legionella bacteria in air and water samples and allergens. There is also an extensive
glossary.
<P>
Although the primary emphasis of the application of these methods is the nonindustrial
workplace environment (e.g., office buildings), many methods can and have been applied in
industrial workplace environments such as composting, waste water treatment and wherever
animals are confined.

<H2>An Ergonomics Guide to Hand Tools</H2>
<H3>AIHA Ergonomics Committee; by Robert G. Radwin and Jonathan T. Haney</H3>
Ensuring that hand tools accomplish what they are designed to do without having a negative
impact on the worker's well-being is an important ergonomics issue. <I>An Ergonomics Guide to
Hand Tools</I> addresses this issue by discussing in detail the ergonomic concerns of hand
tools.
<P>
The aspects of hand tool ergonomics discussed in detail are optimization of force; distribution of
contact pressures; anatomical considerations; anthropometric considerations; and material and
weight for tools and handles. The guide is broken into three main areas: hand tool selection
criteria, manual hand tools, and power hand tools.
<P>
Addressed in the section on hand tool selection criteria are process engineering requirements,
human operator limitations, and workstation and task factors. The power tools section focuses on
weight, load distribution, and power lines; triggers; feed force and reaction force; handles; work
location; balancers, articulating arms, and other tool accessories; vibration; and acoustic noise.
<P>
Tables and figures round out the information provided, and there is an extensive list of references
for related review.

<H2>An International Review of Procedures for Establishing Occupational Exposure
Limits</H2>
<H3>Chemical Manufacturers Association and AIHA</H3>
International methods for instituting occupational exposure limits and their applicability to
rulemaking in the United States are examined in this new book, which was developed as a
two-part study by the Chemical Manufacturers Association. Part I of the book documents the
results
of the first half of the CMA study, which analyzed processes for setting occupational exposure
limits in 23 organizations in 15 countries. Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands,
the United Kingdom, and the United States are among those countries examined in Part I, with
AIHA, ACGIH and ANSI among the organizations surveyed within the United States.
Among the areas covered in each section are agent selection criteria and prioritization; scientific
basis; economic and technological feasibility; documentation/rationale; and review and approval
processes.
<P>
The second half of the CMA study, documented in Part II of the book, was conducted a year after
the first. It focuses on those countries with successful procedures that could be used for
rulemaking in the United States: Ontario and Quebec in Canada; the European Union; Sweden;
and the United Kingdom.

<H2>Field Guidelines for Temporary Ventilation of Confined Spaces<BR>
With an Emphasis on Hotwork</H2>
<H3>Mike Harris, Lindsay Booher, and Stephanie Carter</H3>
These field guidelines provide examples of techniques for successful ventilation of confined
spaces where hotwork such as welding or thermal cutting produces fumes and gases requiring
removal. Ventilation techniques described in this guide maximize effectiveness of confined space
ventilation and provide for compliance with relevant OSHA ventilation requirements for
hotwork. The format of the guide is designed to encourage use on the job site by project
supervisors and planners, industrial hygienists, safety professionals and others whose
responsibilities include ventilating confined spaces to eliminate or control atmospheric hazards.
This publication should be particularly useful as an educational tool for employees with limited
ventilation training. Examples in the field guidelines are oriented toward ventilation of vessels in
petrochemical plants, but they should be useful in virtually all facilities.

<TITLE>AIHA Position on Nat'l Env Lab Accreditation</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2><CENTER>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
POSITION STATEMENT ON NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY
ACCREDITATION</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<B>The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) is in full agreement with the
laboratory community that the existing system of laboratory accreditation in the United
States has a number of problems that need to be addressed.</B>
<P>
AIHA believes that some type of system is necessary to reduce the cost and time burden on
laboratories while assuring highest quality and national/international acceptance of test data.  A
proposed National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP) has been
suggested as a mechanism for the private and public sectors (including state and federal agencies)
to work together toward implementation of an environmental laboratory accreditation program. 
<P>
AIHA supports the goals of NELAP and believes AIHA accredited laboratories also support the
goals of NELAP.  AIHA supports:
<UL>
<LI>The expansion of the Standing and Administrative Committees to ten participants with the
five additional participants being from the contributors but without vote.
<P>
<LI>Submission to EPA of a letter from the NELAC Board of Directors requesting a two -year
Federal Advisory Committee Charter for environmental laboratory accreditation to provide
private sector consensus advice to the EPA Administrator and EMMC.
<P>
<LI>Open seating in all plenary sessions except in voting sessions where the members of the
House of Representatives and House of Delegates must be grouped for ease of tallying votes.  
</UL>
However, AIHA strongly objects to the exclusion of recognition of third-party accrediting
organizations.  The need for including private sector accrediting bodies includes the following:
<UL>
<LI>AIHA is already recognized as an accrediting authority as well as an accrediting body as part
of the National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program.
<P>
<LI>AIHA is recognized as an accrediting authority for industrial hygiene laboratories and
accredits the OSHA and NIOSH laboratories as well as several state (California Department of
Health Services, Commonwealth of Massachusetts) and other Federal agency laboratories.
<P>
<LI>AIHA does not believe that reinvention of systems already in place is necessary to
accommodate the requirements of NELAP.
<P>
<LI>AIHA believes NELAP is contrary to the Committee on National Accreditation of
Environmental Laboratories (CNAEL) recommendations, to establish <I>"a national
environmental accreditation program that has federal oversight and is implemented by the states
and/or third parties".</I>
<P>
<LI>AIHA believes that while the current political climate is to allow states to control their own
affairs (accreditation of laboratories), the current political climate also moves toward the goal of
less government involvement.  In this case, the private sector already has qualified and recognized
accreditation programs in place. These programs should be recognized.  NELAP places all control
in public sector agencies, rather than building upon existing, successful private sector programs.
</UL>
AIHA is not asking for exclusive rights to accredit laboratories.  However, AIHA believes that
third-party accreditation systems should be recognized on an equal footing with state
accreditation programs.  Therefore, <B>states adopting NELAP should recognize AIHA
accredited laboratories in the same way they accept other state-accredited laboratories.</B> 
AIHA is not opposed to federal government (EPA) oversight and approval of third-party
accreditation programs.<BR>
<P>
<P>
<B>Adopted by Board of Directors: March 16, 1995</B>

<H2>Particle Sampling Using Cascade Impactors: Some Practical Application Issues</H2>
<H3>AIHA Aerosol Technology Committee; edited by John Y. Young</H3>
This guide by the AIHA Aerosol Technology Committee provides practical application issues for
users of cascade impactors. It was developed as a handy reference ideal for in-the-field use,
where essential information must be available at the fingertips to avoid mistakes.
<P>
Although the cascade impactor probably is the most-used of several particle collection or
sampling devices, there still are a number of inherent problems in its use. Industrial hygienists
and other occupational health professionals need to understand those problems and take
necessary precautions. Obvious problems such as particle bounce and re-entrainment often occur
unnoticed, and systematic and random errors usually do not surface unless they are suspected and
investigated. The text addresses those concerns, offering practical solutions used by experts
throughout the field.
<P>
Among the issues discussed are: "Problems of Collection Efficiency Related to Leaks in the
Cascade Impactor"; "Significance of Distance Between Nozzle and Plate in the Cascade
Impactor"; and "Determining an Optimum Sampling Duration."

<H2>Confined Space Entry: An AIHA Protocol Guide</H2>
This AIHA Protocol Guide provides a model for fulfilling the minimum requirements and more
of 29 CFR 1910.146, OSHA's standard for permit-required confined spaces. OSHA requires an
employer to establish written requirements for practices and procedures that protect employees
from the hazards of entry into permit-required confined spaces, and guidance for fulfilling that
requirement is addressed in this handbook.
<P>
Nine appendices are included to help in designing an appropriate written plan. One appendix
includes sample permit entry forms; another addresses a confined space entry training program;
and another details confined space rescue procedures. A copy of the original OSHA standard also
is included.

<H2>Hazard Communication: An AIHA Protocol Guide</H2>

This AIHA Protocol Guide, the second in a planned series, addresses the requirements of 29 CFR
1910.1200, OSHA's hazard communication standard. All facilities will benefit from this
guidebook, but it is especially helpful for small employers. Even if your facility is not covered by
OSHA, the information in the guide is recommended good practice, developed by experts at
AIHA with background and training in hazard communication.
<P>
In 29 CFR 1910.1200, OSHA requires employers to establish a program to transmit information
on the hazards of chemicals to their employees by means of training programs, labels on
containers, and material safety data sheets. Implementation of a hazard communication program
such as the one modeled in this guide will help guarantee all employees the "right-to-know" the
hazards and identities of the chemicals with which they work, and it should reduce the incidence
of chemically related occupational illnesses and injuries.
<P>
Five appendices are included. There is training documentation, a list of states with
OSHA-approved hazard communication plans, and a copy of the original OSHA standard.

<H1>Communication and Training Methods Papers (7-12)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>7. Presenting Behavior-Based Ergonomics Remedies.</H2> 
<B>D. Groover</B>, Behavioral Science Technology, Inc., Ojai, CA<P>
This talk presents behavior-based applications to ergonomics challenges in 
the workplace.  The focus is on areas of natural overlap between 
behavior-based accident prevention and the special characteristics of 
exposure to ergonomic or cumulative trauma risks.  Relative to many other 
kinds of exposure, cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) are gradual in onset 
versus an obvious one-time occurrence of injury such as a cut, bruise, burn, 
etc.  CTD symptoms are often internal versus external; and consequently the 
symptoms are also often subjective (known only to the sufferer) rather than 
objectively present for observation by others.  Taken together, these three 
factors indicate the need for a different approach to incident prevention 
that the traditional approaches.<P>
The behavior-based approach to accident prevention can be very helpful in 
such a case.  At the heart of behavior-based ergonomics initiatives is an 
inventory of behaviors that are critical to reducing exposure to risk of 
CTDs.  The inventory is developed by site personnel from the company's own 
incident reports.  The focus throughout is on peer-to-peer observation and 
feedback about task-related behaviors that put workers at risk for CTDs.  
This moves the workforce discussion beyond attitudes and awareness to an 
ongoing careful consideration of the specific behaviors that either prevent 
or precipitate cumulative trauma at that site.<P>
The effect is that wage-roll personnel become highly attuned ergonomics 
"coaches" who help each other with their performance in advance of any 
symptoms, subjective or otherwise.  And although many CTDs are internal 
rather than external, the workforce is always directing itself by something 
that is external: observable task-related behaviors.  Finally, since the 
behavior-based approach works with the upstream measures or predictors of 
exposure before any incident occurs, this approach treats all safety 
performance as a cumulative thing.  For behavior-based safety, the near-miss 
or the first aid case represent very important data points.  Similarly, the 
behaviors that precede and predict CTDs are treated as ergonomics "near 
misses." 

<H2>8. The NIOSH Small Business Train the Trainer Program.</H2> 
<B>J. Zey</B>, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH; B. Hayes,  M. Colligan, Morehouse 
School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA<P>
Small businesses employ a large percentage of the United States workforce 
(5,000,000 work sites have 5 or fewer employees) but are under served in 
the areas of occupational safety and health.  Small businesses are not 
regularly inspected and have minimal access to occupational safety and 
health information.  This is an acute problem for minority small business 
owners.  NIOSH recently joined in a collaborative effort with the Minority 
Health Professions Foundation (MHPF) to provide occupational safety and 
health training to minority small business owners and managers.  Lack of 
safety and health information directed to small business is typically due to 
limited training funds and a lack of knowledge about available resources.  
NIOSH and the Minority Health Professions Foundation collaborated on a 
two-day train the trainer workshop.  The workshop participants included 
seven of the eight member institutions which compose MHPF and the 
Association of Minority Health Professions Schools.  In addition to normal 
course content, additional topics (e.i., advertising) were added to help 
ensure the success of subsequent programs.  Modules presented during the 
first day covered topics normally included in a small business program: 
preparing for OSHA inspections, hazard communication, and job hazard 
analysis.  Topics presented during the second day included marketing, 
effective presentations, psychological aspects of occupational safety and 
health training, and resource utilization.  Partners who were trained during 
the workshop agreed to host a one-day safety and health program for small 
business owners/managers in their area.  Through collaboration with the 
MHPF, NIOSH is reaching out to small business owners who are at high risk 
and least able to afford occupational safety and health consultation.

<H2>9. A System for Tracking Health and Safety Training of Construction and 
Industrial Maintenance Employees.</H2> 
<B>J. McCormick</B>, C. Williams, Brown & Root Industrial Services, Inc, 
Houston, TX<P>
The often transient nature of employees in the construction and industrial 
maintenance industries presents many challenges, one of which is the 
documentation and tracking of personnel training.  Many of the employees 
trained on a particular job site are transferred, or rehired within a short 
period of time on another job site.  Thus, the ability to determine training 
deficiencies and avoid training redundancies can increase productivity and 
help ensure that each employee is appropriately trained.<P>
Recognizing the benefit of tracking such records, one world-wide 
construction and industrial maintenance company developed a validated, 
user-friendly, internal computer database that can be accessed via personal 
computers at job sites with dial-in capability.  The system establishes a 
permanent training record that follows the employee from one job site to 
another.  The system provides a mechanism to track compliance with training 
required by state and federal regulatory agencies, regional safety councils, 
client companies, and internal company policies.  Training records are 
generated for each employee through the use of a uniform system of course 
codes, course descriptions, and a current employee database.<P>
The system can produce several different reports for analysis, including a 
deficiency report that is generated at the job site.  This report is also 
important to corporate personnel who monitor job site training levels.  In 
addition to the tracking of records, the system also provides an on-line 
source for over 1200 safety meeting topics and approximately 300 videos 
listed as available to enhance training courses.  In 1995, over 400,000 
individual training records will be recorded in the system, proving its 
usefulness.

<H2>10. An Evaluation of Computer Anxiety Related to Computer Aided 
Instruction in Health and Safety Training.</H2> 
<B>M. Brantmayer</B>, EG & G Technical Services of West Virginia, 
Morgantown, WV<P>
Successful training programs are able to increase student knowledge and 
influence behavior.  Current research suggests that some students may be 
unable or unwilling to use new self-paced computer-based multimedia training 
programs due to computer anxiety: fear of using a computer. A successful 
computer-based training program can overcome student anxiety by identifying 
and controlling its causes.<P>
The existence and degree of computer anxiety can be identified using a 
quantitative instrument called a Computer Anxiety Scale.  Further 
identification of the causes of computer anxiety can be ascertained through 
a qualitative survey employing an interview and a phenomenological 
analysis.<P>
This study measured the level and identified the causes of computer anxiety 
in six subjects prior to and after treatment.  A computer-based multimedia 
program covering the topic of hearing conservation was used as the 
treatment.  Computer anxiety was measured using a 20-item, four-point Likert 
scale survey and was found to remain unchanged after the treatment.  
Qualitative evaluation of computer anxiety consisted of a detailed interview 
and analysis after treatment.  A phenomenological analysis of this data 
identified eight domains or causes of anxiety including the time required to 
complete the training, user comfortability, attention holding, and computer 
skills.  In conclusion, computer anxiety has been shown to negatively affect 
performance and achievement on computer-based training programs.  The 
identification of the causes of computer anxiety is the first step in 
establishing a successful computer-based training program.  The use of a 
systematic approach to identify these causes focuses valuable resources 
where they can have an effect.

<H2>11. Updating the Hazardous Materials Identification System (HMIS).</H2> 
<B>K. Johnston</B>, Pratt & Lambert United, Inc., Buffalo, NY; W. Long, 
National Paint & Coatings Association, Washington, D.C.<P>
The Hazardous Materials Identification System (HMIS) is a voluntary 
communications compliance tool originally developed for the coatings 
manufacturing industry and now used by over 20,000 employers nation wide.  
The system uses colored labels, letters, numbers, and symbols to present 
acute and chronic health, flammability and reactivity health warnings, as 
well as to designate appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The 
labels work together with training and implementation materials as a 
complete system, assisting employers to develop and maintain comprehensive 
hazard communication programs.<P>
This hazard communication system has been in wide use for over 10 years.  
During that time the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) 
hazard communication standard has matured and evolved, requiring that HMIS 
be updated.  A group of users identified areas to be revised.  All 
modifications had to be made without significantly disrupting current users 
or the simplicity of the system.<P>
As a result, HMIS was recently modified to: 1) increase recognition of PPE 
icons and allow listing of alternate PPE combinations; 2) include an 
increased emphasis on chronic hazards that affect target organs (indicated 
by an asterisk); 3) make minor adjustments to the HMIS rating criteria, 
including a minor change to the dermal toxicity criteria and a revised 
inhalation toxicity rating criteria (for 4-hour LC50 data in mg/m3 units); 
4) update employee training materials; and 5) provide aids to improve user 
consistency in rating chemicals and implementing HMIS.

<H2>12. Evaluation of Hazard Communication Program in Taiwan.</H2> 
<B>C. Lu</B>, L. Sung, D. Yeh, J. Yu, Center for Industrial Safety and 
Health Tech, Chuntung Hsinchu, ROC, Taiwan<P>
In Taiwan, the hazard communication (HC) act has launched from 1992.  In the 
mean time, an implementation program including inquiry service, training 
courses, on-site instruction and experience exchange meetings was provided 
to the industry through a government funded project.  The objective of this 
study was to assess the performance of this program.  Two hundred 
seventy-two plants' safety and health professionals were surveyed by 
questionnaires to investigate the performance of MSDSs writing, hazardous 
material labeling, and hazardous material training in their plants.  Then, 
variance analyses was used to test the effects of the HC development 
program.<P>
The group of people who presented in the HC implementation program had 
better performance than the unpresented in MSDS preparing, hazardous 
material labeling, and training.  Moreover, there were statistically 
significant performance difference (p&lt;0.01) between these two groups.  
The result showed that the HC implementation program was effective.  
However, laboratory labeling and contractor training were not well 
performed in both groups.

<TITLE>Pollution Prevention and Toxic Use Reduction</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2><CENTER>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
POSITION STATEMENT ON POLLUTION PREVENTION AND TOXIC USE
REDUCTION</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
Pollution prevention and toxic use reduction are examples of fundamental industrial hygiene
professional practices, embodied in the AIHA mission statement of "<I>...anticipation</I>,
recognition, evaluation and control of environmental factors arising in or from the workplace that
may result in injury, illness, impairment, or affect the well-being of workers and members of the
community".  
<P>
<B>The AIHA supports pollution prevention practices because waste minimization or prevention
is a better solution to pollution problems than "end of the pipe" treatment.</B><BR>
AIHA believes that industrial hygiene experience shows worker and community health are best
served by not generating polluting waste.  As mentioned in the AIHA mission statement, if
workers and the community can be protected from harm through prevention, this is preferred over
other control measures. 
<P>
<B>AIHA supports Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) efforts to develop useful tools to
prevent pollution.</B><BR>
AIHA supports the Use Cluster Scoring Methodology and other tools if they are used within
limits intended, i.e., a gross or general means of gauging potential environmental risk and the
realization that these tools cannot substitute for detailed environmental risk analysis.  AIHA will
re-emphasize to EPA the importance of defining practical usage limitations of the Use Clusters
Scoring Methodology and other pollution prevention tools.  
<P>
<B>AIHA supports toxic use reduction through substitution of a less toxic material or through
process modification to use less toxic materials, as an important industrial hygiene measure to
control environmental health hazards.  
<P>
<B>AIHA accepts that all materials can be toxic under certain circumstances of human or
environmental exposure, and therefore total toxic chemical elimination is not achievable in our
society.</B><BR>
An achievable goal is the safe usage of all chemicals where they cannot be substituted, reduced or
eliminated in accordance with the industrial hygiene hierarchy of controls and good practices. 
Toxic use reduction is one of several important and useful ways to reduce human and
environmental risk.  The selection of risk reduction measures to use should be based on risk
assessment and an analysis of obtainable benefits from the environmental risk control options
under consideration.
<P>

<TITLE>NIOSH Repiratory Devices Proposed Rule</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
COMMENTS TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND
HEALTH</H2><BR>
CERTIFICATION FOR RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE DEVICES PROPOSED RULE
(42 CFR Part 84 - RIN 0905-AB58)</CENTER>
<HR>
The respiratory protection committee of The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA)
supports the development of updated standards for the testing and certification of respiratory
protection devices used in the workplace.  With the publication of the proposed rule 42 CFR Part
84,
the committee is supportive of the efforts of NIOSH to move forward in this area, and is
submitting
the following comments in an effort to assist in the development of sound standards directed
toward
improved understanding, use and protection of respiratory wearers in the workplace.
<P>
<H3>Modular Approach</H3>
The modular approach to upgrading respirator certification standards should provide benefits in
the
development of respirator performance requirements that reflect advancements in technology as
well
as the changing requirements of the user community and workplace activity.  However, there are
many important aspects of this type of process that have not been addressed which may cause
confusion and add cost in the workplace and difficulty in product development.  These aspects of
the
modular approach are identified individually in the following seven paragraphs.  The questions
relative
to each aspect reflect areas of needed definition in the proposed rule, and the suggestions reflect
proposals by the AIHA Respiratory Protection Committee for support to effective rulemaking.
<P>
<B>Module interface:</B>  Many modules will have effects on each other.  How will the
interface
be coordinated when a future module effects a previous module such as with assigned protection
factors or combination respirators?  What will be the grandfathering overlap?  How will the
consumer
maintain an up-to-date respiratory protection program, and at what additional cost?  What will be
the
effect on respiratory development when a future module may affect design requirements or earlier
modules?  Will this slow new product development or add cost to the user?  These questions
should
be addressed by NIOSH.
<P>
<B>Module development overlap:</B>  With the proposed schedule, there will be concurrent
work
on various modules at various times.  Are there available resources within NIOSH to maintain
progress and ensure timely completion?
<P>
<B>Schedule:</B> Has a formal schedule been developed with a committed completion date? 
The
AIHA Respiratory Protection Committee suggests a five year schedule requirement for
completion
to ensure limited user confusion as modules take effect, enable completion prior to obsolescence,
and
limit the potential cost burden associated with updating respirators.

<P>
<B>Development interface:</B>  As modules develop, will there be an opportunity for input
prior
to publication?  AIHA and other organizations are a valuable source of information regarding user
requirements and concerns, as well as workplace and laboratory studies.  The AIHA Respiratory
Protection Committee, for example, would be willing to provide support whenever possible. 
These
resources may assist in expediting module development.
<P>
<B>Additional modules:</B> A new separate module, specifically for the testing and certification
requirements of power air purifying respirators (PAPR) should be added to the schedule.  PAPR's
are
a specific class of respirators that have a broad base of styles for varied workplace requirements. 
Combination respirators, gas masks, and supplied air respirators also need to be identified in
module
schedule.
<P>
<B>International integration:</B> A plan should be outlined to reflect the goals of international
integration as the modular program progresses.  This plan should be included at the start of the
program.
<P>
<B>Phase-in period:</B> A commitment should be made to put all manufacturers on equal
footing
as, for example, simultaneous issuance of all approvals of applications received within a specific
time
period after promulgation.  This to limit confusion of the user, and avoid potential market
monopolization periods.
<P>
<H3>Interagency Coordination</H3>
The AIHA Respiratory Protection Committee recommends that respiratory protections related
rulemaking should be coordinated throughout the regulatory agencies of OSHA, MSHA, EPA,
NRC
and FDA.  This to provide uniform understanding in the workplace specifically in the areas of
selection, use limitations, assigned protection factors and fit testing.
<P>
<H3>Test Protocol</H3>
With particulate respiratory protection affecting the largest number of respirator wearers, and the
growing concerns in the healthcare industry, enhancements in the area of filter testing and
requirements are needed.  However, the protocol identified in the publication of the proposed rule
presents many concerns.  Specifically, the following sections need to be addressed:
<UL>
<LI>Paragraph 84.184(i).  Is the penetration measured by what the photometer sees, or by the
particle number ratio?  The particle size distribution will change some as it goes through the filter.
<P>
<LI>Filter tests with DOP or equivalent oil.  These test materials offer an opportunity to test
electrostatic filters to assure that the electrostatic charge is dependable over the life of the filter. 
The
residue these substances leave in the filter being tested often gradually discharge the electrostatic
charge.  A requirement for retesting each filter after an inactive interval, of 30 minutes for
example,
should be included in the protocol.
<P>
<LI>Paragraph 84.63(c).  With regard to the specific subsection, when NIOSH prescribes a new
test,
or modifies an existing test, it should be required to publish that test in the Federal Register with a
statement as to the circumstances in which the test will be required.  The concern is, should the
public
allow NIOSH to prescribe tests and revise those tests at will without review as required by the
Administrative Procedures Act?
<P>
<LI>With regard to hot and cold generated DOP, are independent studies available to show a
correlation between these aerosol tests?
<P>
<LI>Does the new test protocol establish a requirement for new equipment for the manufacturing
community?  Is this equipment readily and immediately available, and from more than one
manufacturer?  What additional cost will this requirement add to the user community?
<P>
<LI>What is the protocol for gas mask filter performance?
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Carbon Tetrachloride</H3>
Carbon tetrachloride now has limits in availability and for use in testing and is an animal
carcinogen that poses a hazard to laboratory personnel, yet continues to be referenced in the
proposal of 42 CFR 84.  Pentane, or correlated equivalents should be specified as currently
acceptable.
<P>
<H3>Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR)</H3>
PAPR testing requirements are ambiguous and difficult to follow.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> This module of 42 CFR 84 should only address the filtration
requirements of PAPR system filters.  PAPR system requirements should be addressed in a
separate
additional module specifically for PAPR performance testing and certification where all system
elements and requirements are included.  What follows are some of the concerns relative to PAPR
filter testing in support of the recommendation  for a separate PAPR module:
<UL>
<LI>A definition of loose-fitting and tight-fitting inlet coverings is supported, but a requirement
for multiple categories should be included.  This is to avoid a potential restriction limiting design
advancement and user benefit.  For example, hoods with bibs, hoods with suit tops, and hoods
without bibs.  When all designs are lumped together, they all receive the lowest assigned
protection factor.  ANSI Z88.2 1992 recognizes four types of PAPR'S, half mask, full facepiece,
loose fitting facepiece and hoods/helmets.  This is supported by the result of workplace protection
factor studies that have found differing levels of protection for these types of PAPR'S.  NIOSH
should add the ANSI definition of loose fitting facepieces to the proposed rule, and include loose
fitting facepieces as a separate category of PAPR's.  Paragraphs 84.171(a)(1), 84.175, 84.176,
84.179, 84.183(a) and 84.183(a) should be changed to reflect this requirement.
<P>
<LI>Breathing machine requirements for PAPR filter performance testing should not be required
in this module as the emphasis should be on filter performance not system performance.  Constant
flow filter performance testing, with specific minimum air flow requirements would be more
appropriate, efficient and less costly.
<P>
<LI>Air flow rate should be addressed.  Most PAPR'S with tight-fitting facepieces operate at a
steady flow rate of about 4 cfm.  At moderate to high workrates, the worker can overbreathe and
create a negative pressure inside the facepiece during inhalation.  Tests should be carried out at a
higher work rate equivalent, or a minimum flow rate of 6 cfm should be required.  Similarly, the
flow rate or work rate should be higher than 6 cfm or a minute volume of 40 liters for
loose-fitting head covers.
</UL>
<H3>Replaceable Straps</H3>
Paragraph 84.178 in the proposed rule does not recognize that not all respirator head harnesses
may need to be replaced as in the example of maintenance-free half mask respirators.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> This paragraph should be changed to state an exception in the cases
of single use respirators, or respirators designed not to be maintained by the user.
<P>
<H3>Applications</H3>
As written, the proposed rule would permit NIOSH, at will, to issue approval based solely on the
representation of the applicant.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  A requirement should be included in the proposed rule for NIOSH to
verify the submitted data within a specified, reasonable amount of time such as 90 days.  As a
public agency, NIOSH holds equal responsibility to all applicants and users.  Users should have
the confidence that all applicants are treated in the same manner, and certified respirators come
from uniformed procedures.
<P>
<H3>Filter Classification</H3>
To provide uniformity, and reduce user confusion, filter classification should follow the existing
structure of the European classification format.  As opposed to classifying filter by A, B, and C,
the classification should be 1, 2 and 3, with 3 being the highest efficiency in an effort toward
global harmonization, and in the spirit of NAFTA and GATT.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  Filter classification should be 1, 2, and 3, with 3 representing the
highest efficiency.  This relates to the European sequence but doesn't match it in that efficiencies
are not identical to P1, P2, and P3.
<P>
<H3>Efficiency</H3>
There is a concern that NIOSH is testing filters with the worst case aerosol, using unnecessarily
restrictive limits on the test and tight statistics.  This may be done for simplicity, but may make the
particulate respirator harder to use (breathing resistance) which, in turn, may potentially cause a
lowering of protection in the workplace.  In addition, these tight respirator requirements do not
relate to all workplace requirements, possibly causing workers to pay higher prices for a
respirator with greater performance characteristics than needed, or sourcing alternate respiratory
protection to meet their needs that may not meet NIOSH certification requirements.
<P>
Current respirators provide adequate filter efficiency as evidenced by the number of workplace
protection factor studies that have found average WPFs over 10.  In changing the filter test,
NIOSH is moving the least efficient respirator class from one that would test at 20 to 1%
penetration depending on the exact manufacturer (Jupuntich and Moyer references) to a class with
no more than 5% would provide for improved respirators with less of a burden on the people who
must use the respirators.  To get higher filter efficiencies will require that filters will have more
pressure drop that may increase leakage (Campbell reference), make them more uncomfortable
and less likely to be used properly resulting in an overall decrease in protection.

Society for Respiratory Protection, Prot.  2(2): 249-260(1984)

and Dioctyl Phthalate Aerosol Filter Efficiency as a Function of Particle Size and Flow Rate,

<P>
Campbell D.L.:  The Theoretical Effect of Filter Resistance and Filter Penetration on Respiratory
Protection Factors.  Journal, International Society for Respiratory Protection. 
2(4):198-204(1984)
<P>
A 10% filter penetration during testing is not an unreasonable limit for a respirator filter when the
test aerosol is considered.  For example, the sodium chloride aerosol is specified to have a count
median diameter of between 0.06 and 0.11 micrometers, with a geometric standard deviation less
than 1.86. It is highly unlikely that such an aerosol would occur outside the laboratory, so the
field performance of a filter that passes at 90% will always be more efficient than 90%.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  With published studies as support, and a relationship to the broad
workplace requirements referenced, the filter efficiency range should follow 99.97% for high
efficiency classification to 90% for the third classification, with a middle classification of 95%. 
This to provide an appropriate range and differentiation to meet the various needs of the
workplace including the healthcare setting.
<P>
<H3>Identification</H3>
Limited information regarding filter identification was provided in the proposed rule.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  To help simplify user selection and identification of the new classes
of filters, plain language labeling should be included.  Labeling should clearly state the certified
efficiency rating numerically, and include "solids" and "solids or liquids" spelled out on the filter,
filter package or respirator box.  In addition, it is believed that ANSI K13.1 is no longer
obtainable from ANSI, and this reference for color identification may need to be removed.
<P>
<H3>Instructions</H3>
Respirator instructions are an important requirement for the proper use and maintenance of
respirators, and should be properly reviewed in a sound respiratory protection program.  This area
is not specifically defined in regard to respirator certification requirements.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  It is strongly recommended that NIOSH include respirator
instruction review and responsibility as part of the respirator certification process.  A standard
format should be established for ease of user understanding and effectiveness.  This standardized,
simplified format should also include certification labeling again aimed at simplifying user
selections and use.
<P>
<H3>Fit Testing</H3>
Paragraphs 84.181 and 84.182 of the proposed rule proposes a tightness test using isoamyl
acetate. The purpose of this test is not given, and it is believed to be unnecessary, not
reproducible, provides no benefit and an additional cost burden to NIOSH.  This requirement has
prevented chemical filtration respirators from receiving particulate and chemical approval because
sufficient carbon to pass the fit test would require face piece modifications, therefore restricting
product development.
<P>
Respirator fit is an important factor in how a respirator fits an individual, so important that ANSI
requires that each person who will use a tight fitting respirator be fit tested at least once a year.
OSHA, in most of their substance specific standards, also requires that respirator users be fit
tested. However, the tightness test required by NIOSH as part of the certification process does
nothing to help assure an adequate fit.  Fit testing must be included as part of a sound respiratory
protection program, and must be done on an individual basis.  Prior testing during certification
will not assure that an individual receives an adequate fit, and may confuse the user into thinking
they have a respirator that is certified to fit.
<P>
Ensuring that a face seal has an ability to conform to a range of facial structures is a critical aspect
of respirator design, but requiring the use of isoamyl acetate may restrict technical innovation. 
Additionally, NIOSH, in this requirement, has not provided a test that can be reproduced by
others. No descriptions of the face sizes and quantities for the test (as in OSHA's lead standard),
no provision is given to determine if a person participating in the test can sense the presence of
isoamyl acetate that leaks into the respirator.  The test conditions vary between the two tests for
test time and test exercises.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  With an understanding of respiratory protection program
requirements, and the characteristics of various respirators relative to fit test agents, the isoamyl
acetate test should be deleted from the filter respirator certification proposal or replaced with a
more appropriate and scientifically supported test.
<P>
<H3>Assigned Protection Factors</H3>
Assigned protection factors are an important aspect regarding respirator selection.  They also can
be confusing to the user.  A specific module addressing assigned protection factors as outlined in
the modular schedule is needed.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> It is highly recommended that assigned protection factors (APF)
remain intact until the new procedures and soon-to-be proposed APF module is promulgated. 
This will minimize confusion and disruption of respirator practices that would have been placed
on respirator wearers had temporary APF's been adopted.  In addition, it is highly recommended
that outside resources be utilized when the APF module is developed.  The AIHA Respiratory
Protection Committee would welcome the opportunity to assist whenever possible.  In addition,
there are a great deal of independent workplace protection factor studies available for reference. 
Many of these were used by ANSI in the development of the protection factor table of the 1992
edition of Z88.2, American National Standard for Respiratory Protection.
<P>
<H3>IDLH</H3>
The definitions for "IDLH" and "not IDLH" in the proposed rule are not accurate and do not
cover many exposures.  For example, a nuisance dust exposure does not fit the definition of a "not
IDLH" exposure since it does not cause immediate physical discomfort or long-term effects.  The
definition for IDLH includes ..."conditions that...likely to have adverse effects."  This is a broad
definition of health effects and could include exposures to many chemicals not considered IDLH
such as toluene, where chronic exposures may result in nervous system damage.  Additionally,
allergens, regardless of how infrequently sensitization may occur, would fall under this definition
of IDLH.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  The ANSI definition of IDLH should be used, and the definition of
not IDLH deleted.  The ANSI definition of IDLH is: Immediately dangerous to life or health. 
Any atmosphere that poses an immediate hazard to life or poses immediate irreversible debilitating
effect on health.
<P>
<H3>HEPA filter requirements</H3>
The change NIOSH has made in classifying filters as replaceable and non-replaceable is
supported, thus eliminating the requirement that only high efficiency filters can be used for
materials with exposure limits less than 0.05 mg/mv.  Filters do not vary in filter efficiency based
on toxicological properties or regulatory requirements for exposure limits.
<P>
<H3>ANSI references</H3>
It is recommended that whenever the ANSI Z88.2 document is referenced in the proposed rule
that the 1992 edition is the edition of reference, not the 1969 document as proposed.
<P>
<H3>NIOSH and MSHA Memorandum of Understanding</H3>
The proposed rule references a memorandum of understanding that is being developed between
NIOSH and MSHA that will affect administrative matters related to respirator approval.  It is
unclear if this memorandum will have an effect on this notice of public rulemaking.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> The public should be permitted to review and comment on this
memorandum of understanding during this comment period.
<P>
<H3>User Notice</H3>
The proposed rule states a respirator user's notice will accompany the publication of this new rule. 
This user's notice provides great concern due to its potential to be looked as as part of the
rulemaking, therefore not subject to public review or comment.  The potential for the notice to
contain revised APF values and other selection criteria, which may greatly confuse the worker and
disrupt existing workplace respiratory protection programs, would cause unnecessary cost and
burden in the workplace when an APF module is scheduled for later this year.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> It is highly recommended that if a respirator user's notice is to be
published, it is open for review and comment prior to publication.  To best support the needs in
the workplace, a user's notice should be developed with input from the user, manufacturing and
regulatory groups.  The notice should be user friendly and assist in areas of selection not covered
in the regulation, such as what class filter respirator to select for fibers such as asbestos, or
hazards no longer identified such as paint spray and pesticides.
<P>
<H3>Grandfathering</H3>
Grandfathering is an important aspect of this regulation and leaves a great deal of concern.  A
two-year grandfathering provision and an immediate conversion to 42 CFR 84 filter performance
test appears to be somewhat short-sighted.  Following are the areas that must be addressed:
<UL>
<LI>Applications for filter respirator approval having a requirement to meet 42 CFR 84
performance testing 30 days from rule publication provides little or no time for product
development activities, performance testing or user needs analysis, much less new testing
equipment procurement, provided it is available.  In addition, this immediately cuts out new
respirators currently in the development pipeline that may provide a benefit to today's worker.
<P>
<LI>A two-year limit on the sale and distribution of currently certified respirators does not
provide enough time for NIOSH to process the applications for certification it will receive based
on the current time requirements for respirator certification.  This potentially sets up an extreme
limitation on respirator selection capability for the worker, compromising safety and adding
burden and cost to respirator program administrators.
<P>
<LI>Disallowing extensions of approval to 30 CFR 11 certified filter respirators will immediately
eliminate enhancements in design of current respirators in the workplace, and potentially cut off
the supply of respirators in the workplace if the respirator manufacturer experiences a change in
components or obsolescence by a supplier.  This may add cost and burden to the workplace or
compromise safety and health protection.
<P>
<LI>Limiting distribution in the grandfathering proposal may restrict the availability of respirators
to the workplace as distribution; manufacturing and users will want to limit the cost impact of
inventory becoming obsolete.  This may cause a safety risk should a sufficient supply of new
certified respirators not be available on storeroom shelves.
<P>
<LI>No provision has been given to the grandfathering relationship with respirators affected by
future modules that have already been redesigned to meet the earlier modules.  This may limit the
development of advanced respirator designs until later modules are published due to the risk of
design change requirements.
</UL>
<B>Recommendation:</B> Due to the range of unknowns, and the changes that must occur at
the user, manufacturer and regulatory levels, along with the need to maintain user protection
without undue burden, it is recommended that a four-year grandfathering provision for the sale of
respirators by manufacturers, and a two-year limitation for extensions of approval for 30 CFR 11
filter respirators be incorporated into the regulation.  A four-year grandfathering provision is
shorter than previously accepted by NIOSH, follows examples set by the European regulatory
community, and sets a standard for future modules that may be more complex such as self-
contained breathing apparatus performance.  A two-year limitation of extensions of approvals
takes into account certification backlog, product upgrades and component changes, and broad
based research and development work.  Should the pipeline become filled with 42 CFR 84
certified respirators in a shorter period of time, user selection and manufacturer marketing will
create swifter conversion.
<P>
<H3>Cost</H3>
When evaluating cost impact of the proposed rule, various areas must be addressed for impact
analysis.  With many potential variables remaining undefined, it is difficult to comment on specific
aspects of a cost impact.  From the users standpoint, if new testing procedures are going to cause
a major change in respiratory protection programs, the benefits of the changes should be weighed
against potential burdens on employers in terms of increased cost of respirators, and increased
training requirements, etc.  In regard to manufacturing, the cost of new equipment, additional
R&D, supplier procurement and plant retooling must be evaluated to determine the cost impact
on the price of new respirators made available.  Additionally, the cost to the government should
be evaluated including additional equipment, administrative requirements, testing requirements
and resources.
<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> NIOSH's detailed cost impact analysis, utilized to arrive at the figures
presented in the proposal, should be made public for review and comment.
<P>
<H3>Third Party Certification</H3>
It is recommended that NIOSH incorporate a third party respirator certification program as part
of the modular development of 42 CFR 84.  This would provide for an expedited respirator
certification process enabling the swifter availability of enhanced respiratory protection devices to
the user, and lessen the burden on government agencies allowing for increased administrative,
enforcement, research and rulemaking activities, all of which would add benefits to the worker. 
This recommendation has been made previously (Corn and Brief and other), and can be shown to
be effective by the example of the advancements in SCBA performance through the third party
certification program of the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA).<BR>

<H1>Industrial Hygiene General Practice II Papers (290-301)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>290. Adaptive Readiness: Broadening the Window of Least Exposure.</H2>
<B>D. Groover</B>, Behavioral Science Technology, Inc., Ojai, CA<P>
Imagine a workplace where rookie and veteran employees alike are able to 
respond appropriately and immediately to safety challenges as they arise. 
This ability is known as adaptive readiness, and it is more specific than 
some vague "safety awareness."<P>
The first condition necessary to achieve this state is that employees be able 
to identify site-specific hazards associated with their jobs. Next, they must 
know which behaviors put them at risk and which are critical to their 
well-being.  Finally, they must have a system or process that allows and 
encourages continuous improvement and which provides a scientific system to 
measure it.<P>
While learning new skills and procedures, new employees generally have a 
certain level of anxiety at first.  Veteran employees, on the other hand, may 
have become complacent.  Each of these is a potentially high-risk group, at 
first because lack of knowledge, the second because  of apathy or having 
become accustomed to unsafe practices.  They are like the extremes  on a 
continuum.  In between these points is the "window of least exposure," the 
period when employees are in a state of adaptive readiness because they know 
their jobs but are not on "automatic pilot." The purpose of this talk is to 
show how this normally narrow window can be broadened using behavior-based 
methods.<P>
Safety professionals, frustrated by lack of improvement from their pep talks, 
slogans, incentives, etc., find that adaptive readiness is an effective 
approach because it works with the employee learning curve and strengthens it 
for continuous improvement in safety performance.

<H2>291. Occupational Noise Exposure of Operators of Heavy Trucks.</H2>
<B>B. Seshagiri</B>, Human Resources Development Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, 
Canada<P>
Over 400 full-shift measurements have been taken of noise exposure of 
operators of heavy trucks across Canada, covering a variety of environmental 
conditions, routes, type of truck, etc. The tests were classified into two 
categories: long-haul, and pick-up and delivery.  Within each category, the 
tests were sub-divided into four groups:<P>
Phase 1: Windows closed, radio and/or CB not operating.<P>
Phase 2: Windows closed, radio and/or CB operating.<P>
Phase 3a: Driver's side window open, radio and/or CB not operating.<P>
Phase 3b: Driver's side window open, radio and/or CB operating.<P>
A very limited number of tests were conducted on extra long-haul or sleeper 
runs.  Noise dosimeters were used to take all measurements.<P>
The tests very clearly revealed that opening the driver's side window and 
operating the radio resulted in the highest exposure.  Operating the truck 
with the window closed, and using the radio at relatively low volume setting 
resulted in exposures well below 90 dBA.<P>
Time weighted average sound levels are presented for each category and group, 
using both the 3 and the 5 dB exchange rates.

<H2>292. Target Vehicle Health Hazard Assessment.</H2>
<B>J. Soyak</B>, P. Crawford, J. Gaughan, J. Mazur, Pacific Environmental 
Services, Inc., Herndon, VA<P>
A health hazard assessment was conducted on target vehicles used on firing 
ranges at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to identify potential health and 
safety hazards for vehicles prepared as "environmentally safe" targets, 
impacted targets immediately after range testing, and old target vehicles 
awaiting disposal.<P>
The sale of unserviceable target vehicles as scrap metal was suspended by the 
Defense Reutilization and Marketing Organization (DRMO) in 1991 due to the 
presence of radium, unexploded munitions, petroleum products, friable 
asbestos, and other hazards.  Given the concern over these potential hazards, 
interviews were conducted, vehicle storage yards and firing ranges were 
inspected and sampling was conducted on M-60 tanks as they were being 
prepared as environmentally safe targets and after being hit on the firing 
ranges by Maverick air-to-ground missiles to identify contaminants and their 
concentrations.<P>
The hazards associated with the M-60 tanks were asbestos, heavy metals from 
oxidized paints, noise, radium, and petroleum products. The hits from 
Maverick missiles resulted in combustion products containing toxic substances 
and physical hazards from torn and jagged metal surfaces. Wipe sampling 
results indicated the presence of asbestos fibers, heavy metal residues, and 
petroleum naphthas. Trace amounts of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons 
(phenanthrene and benzo (a) anthracene), ploychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins 
(PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF)were identified in a black 
tarry soot.<P>
Personnel coming into physical contact with these surfaces can contaminate 
skin surfaces and outer work clothing.  These exposures can be minimized by 
changes in work practices, use of portable hand washing facilities, and the 
use of appropriate PPE.

<H2>293. Evaluation of the Implementation of Asbestos Operations and 
Maintenance Programs in New Jersey Schools.</H2>
<B>J. Kominsky</B>, Environmental Quality Management, Inc., Cincinnati, OH; 
R. Freyberg, G. Centifonti, D. Gerber, New Jersey State Department of Health, 
Trenton, NJ<P>
The Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) required all schools to 
develop and implement an asbestos management plan (AMP). The key component of 
the AMP is the operations and maintenance (O&M) program.  A study was 
conducted to evaluate the implementation of asbestos O&M programs at 10 sites 
representing eight New Jersey schools. The evaluation included aspects 
required by AHERA as well as those recommended in EPA guidance. Each school's 
O&M program and compliance with their program during part O&M activities were 
documented. In addition, ten ongoing O&M activities were documented to 
determine the impact of activities on airborne asbestos levels and to 
determine compliance with the O&M program during these activities. Airborne 
asbestos levels were measured using TEM before and during each activity. They 
were analyzed using PCM for comparison with the OSHA PEL.<P>
Overall, schools were not implementing all the elements of the O&M program. 
Schools performed more O&M program elements required by AHERA and those 
recommended in EPA guidance. The percentage of performance responses given by 
the schools indicate that the elements of the O&M program performed (52%) was 
higher than those provided by the worker or contractor performing the 
activity (35% and 22% respectively). Increases in area asbestos levels (by 
TEM) were observed during five of the ten O&M activities evaluated, however, 
none of the total fiber levels (by PCM) exceeded the OSHA PEL. This study 
underscores the importance of a thorough O&M program and the effective 
communication and implementation of all program elements.

<H2>294. Development and Implementation of a Workplace Violence Prevention 
Program.</H2>
<B>V. Kennedy</B>, UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA<P>
Within the increase in workplace violence and the recognition by OSHA and 
other public health agencies that workplace violence is an occupational 
hazard, industrial hygienists and safety professionals are being called on to 
help develop and implement workplace violence protection programs.<P>
California has passed Assembly Bill 508 (AB 508), Hospital Security, which 
requires health care providers to complete a facility-specific security 
assessment, develop security operational procedures, and provide training to 
employees regarding specific security issues. In addition, CAL OSHA has 
issued, "Guidelines for Workplace Security, " and may in fact cite employers 
under the Injury and Illness Prevention Regulation or the General Duty 
Clause.<P>
A Security Planning Committee with multi-departmental representation was 
established to oversee security assessment activities.  Membership included 
Administration, the Emergency Room, Human Resources, Nursing, Police, 
Security, Health and Safety. The committee's charge was to identify and 
prioritize groups requiring training, review the facility assessment and 
provide recommendations to Administration for approval and funding.<P>
First, a security assessment and perception questionnaire was distributed to 
the staff to help identify safety concerns and program deficiencies. In 
addition, a facility physical assessment was performed to locate vulnerable 
access points. Finally, a review of past violent acts by employees, patients, 
and visitors was conducted in an effort to find trends or contributing 
factors to violent acts.<P>
Based on the potential for violence, functional departments were divided into 
one of three categories. Each category received a different, specific level 
of training tailored to meet their needs.

<H2>295. Monitoring Surface Contamination in the Workplace.</H2>
<B>J. Stancliffe</B>, J. Wheeler, Health and Safety Laboratory, Sheffield, 
United Kingdom<P>
Increasing interest in controlling total workplace exposure to hazardous 
substances has made it necessary to examine the contribution made by 
contaminated surfaces.  Dermal exposure to surface contamination can 
contribute significantly to total worker exposure and in some instances may 
be the principal route for chemicals entering the body. Contaminated surfaces 
can affect workers through ingestion (via hand to mouth contact) or by direct 
percutaneous absorption.<P>
One adhesive tape, two manual and two "semi-automatic" wipe methods were 
assessed for their overall efficacy for field use.  The design criterion of 
both "semi-automatic" wipe methods is to reduce operator induced variability 
and to improve contaminant recovery performance.  Visits were made to five 
metal processing facilities and particulate contamination was sampled from 
six locations at each site.  Wiping locations were chosen for their potential 
as points of worker dermal contact and also to represent a range of surface 
characteristics.  Measurements of the level and nature of the surface 
contamination were also made using a portable x-ray fluorescence (XRF) 
monitor.  Wipe samples were analyzed using Atomic Absorption 
Spectrophotometry (AAS).<P>
In sampling loose surface particulate contaminants in both the adhesive tape 
and "semi-automatic" methods are generally more efficient and less variable 
in operation than the manual wipe methods. The use of a portable XRF to 
identify highly contaminated surfaces prior to a more rigorous assessment 
presents a clear advantage when focusing resources. The "semi-automatic" wipe 
methods are limited in application to level, near horizontal surfaces, while 
the adhesive tape method is easier to use, more flexible, and may be applied 
to irregular objects and to vertical surfaces. It is therefore more suitable 
for field use.

<H2>296. Comfort Posture Definition Using Computer Aided Design Techniques.</H2>
<B>A. Coblentz</B>, B. Caceres, G. Ignazi, R. Mollard, Laboratoire 
D'Anthropologie, Appliquee, Paris, France<P>
Industrial requirements and computer techniques advances widely use the 
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) in the early stages of the design process. Using 
virtual environments, CAD analysis replaces traditional mock-ups and reduces 
the global cost to perform a study.<P>
Our laboratory has developed a human body modelling application called 
ERGOMAN. This application increases geometrical human models representative 
of various populations using the international biometric data bank ERGODATA. 
Once defined, one of several mannikins can be put in different positions by 
the user, respecting anatomical norms on less discomfort angles. This 
theoretical information is not sufficient enough to determine a posture 
because it is related with a multitude of other factors than anthropometrical 
reasons like, for example, operator task, level of experience, relations with 
the other persons or health of the operator, etc.  Presently, it is assumed 
that holding a position for a long period can have a relation with 
musculoskeletal disorder. In fact, muscles in charge of maintaining a posture 
tire because they have not enough time to relax and recover their energy. For 
this reason, a posture is now considered acceptable when it favors the 
muscular recuperation and induces variations in operator position.  This 
supports the need to make a good analysis of task to determine the kind of 
movements that the operator needs to do to modify position and relax 
principal muscles.<P>
We conclude that comfort sitting depends on opportunities for significant 
changes of position.  In a workplace design, the task analysis is the more 
informative source to make a good evaluation because it guides the 
disposition of the different elements conforming the future workplace. 
However, it is necessary to respect anthropometrical rules to design the less 
discomfort postures. 3-D human body models as ERGOMAN available on CAD 
software are well adapted to achieve predefinitions of workplaces after 
checking different aspects: volume of activity, mean posture, reach area 
capabilities, fields of view.

<H2>297. Study of Nerve Function Related to Occupational Repetitive Motion 
Injury and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.</H2>
<B>A. Bartol</B>, USDOL/OSHA, Wilkes Barre, PA; L. Levin, Temple University, 
Philadelphia, PA<P>
The current diagnostic method for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is nerve 
electrophysiological function testing on the sensory and motor branches of 
the median nerve. A slowed nerve conduction establishes a positive diagnosis. 
This study utilized a portable sensory nerve function instrument called a 
Neurometer <I>TM</I> Current Perception Threshold (CPT) to measure employee 
nerve function before and after a work shift for employees performing daily 
repetitive and/or forceful hand motion.  A change in nerve function has been 
demonstrated to be indicative of the development of CTS.  This study proposes 
to demonstrate whether a measurable change found during the work shift could 
be useful in assessing job stressor and employee nerve function. A measurable 
change in nerve function would also confirm the concept of dynamic CTS.<P>
The Neurometer <I>TM</I> CPT was used to evaluate three distinct 
subpopulations of nerve fibers within each sensory nerve by performing double 
blind tests at three frequencies (5Hz, 250Hz, and 2KHz) on the index finger 
of each hand.  Values were then compared to normative data provided by the 
manufacturer of the Neurometer <I>TM</I> CPT. The measurements were also 
correlated with job task data from an employee questionnaire.<P>
A significant shift in CPTs was not found when comparing pre-work shift to 
the post-work shift levels; however, employees who were experiencing symptoms 
related to the development of CTDs did exhibit CPTs which were statistically 
different from employees who were not experiencing symptoms related to CTDs. 
The differences were noted in 3 of the 4 analyses recorded at the 2K 
frequency.

<H2>298. Pinch Grip in Roller-press Die Design.</H2>
<B>A. Freivalds</B>, C. Osinski, Pennsylvania State University, University 
Park, PA<P>
Roller press operations in the cutting of leather or cloth require the 
operators to handle fairly large and heavy dies using only five-finger pinch 
grips. To minimize the likelihood of cumulative trauma disorders in these 
workers, it is important to determine the ideal configuration of the inner 
cross bars of the die to maximize pinching capability, both in terms of pinch 
span as well as pinching forces. Two experiments were conducted on ten 
subjects with an experimental die with cross pieces adjustable both in span 
as well as the angle of orientation.<P>
Experiment 1 examined optimal pinch span by measuring maximal voluntary pinch 
forces at six pinch spans: 1.27, 3.81, 6.35, 8.89, 11.43, and 13.97 cm. The 
average pinch force values were consistently higher for the narrow spans 
(1.27, 3.81, 6.35, and 8.89) than for the wider ones (11.43, 13.97). As a 
result the four narrower spans were further studied in Experiment II with the 
addition of a second variable, the angle of orientation at four levels: 90 
degrees (vertical), 75 degrees, 60 degrees and 45 degrees. The minimum pinch 
forces (or least stress on the subjects) were achieved at a span of 3.81 cm 
and angle of 45 degrees.  Furthermore, the pinch forces increased as the 
angle became more vertical and span increased. The resulting design 
implements an ideal pinch span and cross-bar angle to minimize required pinch 
forces and resulting stress on the operators in roller-press die handling.

<H2>299. The Range of GSD 8-Hour Values in Long-Term Exposure to Chronic 
Toxic Agents.</H2>
<B>T. Scheffers</B>, DSM, Geleen, the Netherlands<P>
To establish the range of the geometric standard deviation (GSD 8 hour) 
values of time-weighted average (TWA 8 hour) concentrations in long-term 
occupational exposure, different sources have been explored.<P>
In the peer review literature and in the European Occupational Exposures 
Database hardly any information is available on exposure distributions of 
long-term sampling plans. Reported GSD<I>8 hour</I> values vary between one 
and more than ten, even if the "between worker" exposure variability is taken 
into account. GSD<I>8 hour</I> values of less than two are often scarcely 
documented associated with limited sample size, limited lognormal 
goodness-of-fit and/or biased methods used to handle data outside the 
detection range.<P>
In the Netherlands several long-term exposure assessment programs have been 
carried out on chronic toxic agents in order to establish the baseline 
occupational exposure or to control the long-term compliance. From these 
programs long-term GSD<I>8 hour</I> values were calculated using data series 
which 1) had a lognormal distribution (to exclude relevant between-worker 
exposure variability); 2) included at least 20 measurements; 3) were sampled 
using a random or stratified sampling plan over at least a three-month 
period; and 4) did not show a uniform trend in time. If the outcome lay 
outside the detection range, then lognormal probability regression was used 
to estimate the GSD. In the large number of data series analyzed the ratio of 
the 5 percentile and 95 percentile TWA<I>8 hour</I> was always at least 10, 
which corresponds to a GSD<I>8 hour</I> of at least two.<P>
The available data suggest that, in general, the long-term exposure 
distribution, even of workers in similar exposure situations, is 
characterized by a GSD<I>8 hour</I> of at least two.  One should take this 
information into account when deriving eight-hour industrial hygiene limit 
values from long-term no-effect levels or occupational risk levels (in the 
case of genotoxic carcinogens).

<H2>300. Revitalizing the Utility Market Through High Performance Disposable 
Clothing.</H2>
<B>T. Carroll</B>, Kappler Safety Group Research & Development, 
Guntersville, AL<P>
Much of the focus on protective clothing has historically been on the 
complex, colorful, high barrier, limited use and reusable protective fabrics. 
Manufacturers, distributors, and standards organizations seem biased toward 
these markets since they typically involve more hazardous chemicals and 
exposure scenarios as are found during emergency response.  Ironically, the 
lion's share of the protective clothing market has been reserved for the less 
impressive disposable garments used in general industry.  Consequently, 
protective garments at the "low-end" of the protection spectrum have been 
relegated to a commodity-like status -- quite unfair considering the scope 
and significance of the expected use scenarios.<P>
The disposables' market is seeing a revitalization fueled by the development 
of novel protective fabrics and test methods, as well as activities within 
EPA and the international standards community.  Work is ongoing to develop 
test methodologies that evaluate the comfort and performance of garments that 
are typically worn for extended periods, often in hot and humid environments. 
A new class of disposable fabrics is emerging that can offer improved 
protection against dirt, dusts, paint spray, and light chemical splash. The 
greatest advantage of these new materials is their enhanced comfort through 
breathable films, membranes, and modified fiber structures.<P>
In the U.S., these garments are being evaluated using tests, such as the 
water vapor transmissions test that evaluates fabric breathability and the 
"sweating mannikin" that assess overall garment comfort.  The Committee on 
European Normalization (CEN) is only months away from finalizing 
certification standards targeted specifically to utility garments. These 
standards will evaluate garment fabrics and construction to a variety of 
challenges including chemical splash and particulate attack.  This new class 
of high performance disposable clothing may allow employers to "down-grade" 
from more expensive, less comfortable fabrics while lowering overall 
protective clothing costs.

<H2>301. Permeation Measurement of Protective Fabrics by Electrobalance.</H2>
<B>L. Monteith</B>, University of Washington, Seattle, WA<P>
The literature for the permeation of pure solvents through the fabrics for 
protective garments is available, but information on mixtures is difficult to 
find. The previously reported permeation cell with electrobalance monitoring 
can give the permeation rates rapidly for an endless variety of solvent 
mixtures and fabrics.<P>
The permeation cell is mounted on the electrobalance and the weight of the 
cell is continuously monitored.  The rate of weight loss is directly related 
to the permeation rate. Previous papers described our use of the technique to 
determine the permeation of glove materials by solvents. The technique 
applies equally well to the permeation of protective fabrics.<P>
The data for pure solvents cannot always be used to predict the permeation 
rates or breakthrough characteristics  of their mixtures.  Commonly used 
mixtures were tested for four types of protective fabrics. The electrobalance 
technique has been found to quickly provide reproducible and accurate rates 
and times.

<H2>35. Improving Health and Safety Programs Overseas Through Auditing.</H2> 
<B>U. Kim</B>, EEI Corporation, Potomac, MD<P>
During a two-month US-AEP fellowship, I conducted health and safety program 
audits of six facilities at Samsung Corporation.  The audit helped identify 
the strategy to upgrade their corporate safety and health program to US 
Fortune 500 level.<P>
It was evident that each company operated and developed their safety and 
health programs independently, thus leading to inconsistency in the level of 
health and safety programs corporate-wide.  The inconsistency is also 
evident in U.S. Fortune 500 companies, especially after mergers and 
acquisitions; therefore, it is not just an overseas issue.  To achieve 
consistency corporate-wide, audits are a fundamental tool to present 
corporate-wide picture, to compare member company programs qualitatively, 
and sometimes quantitatively, and to set prioritized action plan to achieve 
corporate-wide health and safety goals.<P>
The audit revealed helped identify the factors that are usually associated 
with the type of program a facility would have.  Some of the key factors 
are: (1) the age of the facility; (2) independent or joint venture status 
with foreign companies, typically German, Japan, and/or the U.S.; (3) type 
of manufacturing operation, and the (4) diversity of products made.<P>
The recommendation from the audit to upgrade to U.S. Fortune 500 company 
standards consisted of three essential target issues.  The auditing results 
identified program issues grouped as primary or secondary based on 
professionally judgment for the gravity of safety and health emergency 
potential if left unchanged.  Second, management and operation integration 
strategies were identified such as integration of safety and health in labor 
management and cost accounting. Third, to achieve a raised awareness of 
safety and health in all employees, at home, at work, and in their 
community, is probably the most challenging and will require constant and 
continual indoctrination at every level of the organization.

<H2>36. Joint Review of Occupational Exposure Limits: A First in Quebec.</H2>
<B>C. Lemieux</B>, CSST-Quebec, Canada<P>
In Quebec, responsibility for occupational health and safety is shared 
jointly by employers and workers.  This joint responsibility is an integral 
part of the Act respecting occupational health and safety and is built into 
the very structure of the CSST, the agency responsible for its 
implementation.  In fact, the Act establishes mechanisms for workers and 
employers that allow them to play a role in achieving the objective of the 
Act, which is to eliminate hazards to workers' health and safety at source. 
In addition, the CSST's Board of Directors is made up of employer and union 
representatives who, together with the government-appointed chairperson, 
determine the direction and administration of occupational health in Quebec. 
The regulatory review is carried out in this context of joint 
responsibility: a technical committee reporting to the Board of Directors 
and made up of employer and union representatives was mandated to review 
the exposure limits, which had not been reviewed since 1980.  The 
committee's work lasted three years and consisted in reviewing all 
substances and their standards, by comparing the standards in effect in many 
countries and unanimously adopting the limits that would best protect 
workers' health, within Quebec context.  The new list of air contaminants 
now comprises 674 substances, including 90 new substances and nearly 100 
reduced standards; a new classification of carcinogens was also presented: 
published in 1994, the new air contaminant standards become effective in 
September 1995. One important achievement was the creation of a standing 
committee, which will be responsible for the publication of a revised list 
every two or three years. Hence, this constitutes not only the first review 
of occupational exposure limits in Quebec, but also an initial step toward 
improving workplace regulations in cooperation with the main parties 
concerned-workers and employers.

<H2>37. Practice of Industrial Hygiene in Korea.</H2> 
<B>N. Paik</B>, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea<P>
Korea has rapidly been industrialized during the last 30 years.  Various 
industries, such as rayon, steel, shipbuilding, automobile manufacture, 
electronics, construction, and mining have been developed.  During this 
period, the workers' exposure to harmful agents were virtually ignored by 
both the government and industrial employers.  Therefore, many cases of 
occupational diseases have been reported. <P>
Recently, the Korean government, industrial employers, trade unions,and the 
public began to recognize the importance of industrial health.  In 1981, the 
Korean government published the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which 
requires the employer to provide overall industrial health services.  These 
requirements have not been properly enforced owing to the lack of qualified 
industrial health professionals.<P>
Various industrial hygiene programs in Korea have currently been developed. 
In 1990, the Korean Industrial Hygiene Association (KIHA) was founded and 
the Korean Industrial Hygiene Journals have been published periodically.  
There are approximately 450 registered members although highly qualified 
personnel is approximately 50.  The number of IH laboratories is also 
increasing rapidly.  The Quality Control (QC) Program was established to 
improve the analytical performance of IH laboratories by the government in 
1992.  The Korean QC Program evaluates IH laboratories twice a year, 
determining the accuracy of the analysis of metals and organic vapors.  The 
analytical performance of the Korean IH laboratories has been greatly 
improved during eight rounds.  We expect that Korean IH will be greatly 
improved because many Korean industries recently began to recognize the 
importance of industrial hygiene.

<H2>38. Assessment of Occupational Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Vapor 
Exposure to Petroleum Refinery and Transportation Loading Rack Facility 
Employees.</H2> 
<B>K. Ziegle</B>, Amoco Oil Company, Salt Lake City, UT; P. Barrier, J. Lee, 
D. Lillquist, Univ. of Utah-Rocky Mountain Center, Salt Lake City, UT<P>
The use of oxygenated gasoline is required for metropolitan areas which 
exceed the carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment standard as specified by the 
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Many petroleum refineries blend methyl 
tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) with gasoline to make oxygenated fuel which 
burns cleaner and reduces CO emissions from motor vehicles' exhaust. MTBE 
has a low acute toxicity ranking and is only mildly irritating to the eyes 
and skin. Excessive vapor inhalation causes depression of the central 
nervous system.  The chemical is not genotoxic and is not believed to be a 
carcinogen.  This assessment was conducted to monitor airborne MTBE 
occupational exposure to petroleum refinery and transport loading rack 
facility employees at one location.  The 47 time-weighted averages (TWA) and 
short-term exposure levels (STEL) personal air samples collected did not 
exceed the American Industrial Hygiene Association workplace environmental 
exposure level of 100 ppm for an 8-hour TWA.  The 38 personal STEL samples 
collected ranged from &lt;0.89 to 35 ppm with a geometric mean of 2.4 ppm.  
The nine personal TWA samples ranged from &lt;0.042 to 1.7 ppm with a 
geometric mean of 0.58.  This study found that minimal occupational 
exposures to MTBE occurred when fugitive emissions from operating equipment 
were limited, leaks and spills during product transfer were minimized, and 
mechanical equipment was thoroughly depressurized and purged before allowing 
the equipment to be repaired.

<H2>39. Exposures and Health Effects: An Industrial Hygiene Evaluation of 
Workers at a Sodium Azide Production Plant.</H2> 
<B>E. Esswein</B>, D. Trout, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Sodium Azide (NaN3) is a toxic chemical used as a preservative for 
biological tissues, in fertilizer and explosives manufacture and as 
principle gas-generating agent used to inflate automobile supplemental 
restraint systems (SRS) or airbags.  Worldwide use of airbags is expected 
to increase demand for NaN3, especially so in the U.S. Headache, 
hypotension, and tachycardia are known health effects, however little 
information currently exists to document or describe occupational 
exposures.<P>
NIOSH received a confidential request for a health hazard evaluation (HHE) 
from employees at a NaN3 production plant concerning health effects possibly 
relating to exposures from NaN3 and a hydrolysis product, hydrazoic acid 
(HN3).  Initial area samples in the packaging area of the plant revealed 
concentrations of 1.0 to 7.5 mg/m&#179; for NaN3 and 0.45 to 2.81 ppm for 
HN3. Twenty-nine PBZ samples collected during a follow-up investigation 
ranged from no detected to 1.7 mg/m&#179; for NaN3.  Hydrazoic acid PBZ air 
concentrations ranged from not detected to 1.1 ppm.<P>
Seven (24%) NaN3 air concentrations (total particulate and vapor azide 
concentrations) exceeded the NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) of 0.3 
mg/m&#179; (ceiling limit) and 4 (14%) of the samples for HN3 exceeded, or 
were at, the REL of 0.1 ppm (ceiling limit).  One air sample collected 
inside a supplied air helmet used for respiratory protection revealed HN3 
greater than concentrations measured on the workers' lapel (0.13 ppm vs. 
0.05 ppm).  Seventy-five percent of the PBZ exposures exceeding NIOSH RELs 
occurred during packaging and reblending operations.  This HHE documents 
occupational exposures not well chronicled in a potentially expanding 
portion of the chemical industry.

<H2>40. Comparison of Sensory Irritation Properties of Thermal Decomposition 
Products Versus Those of Known Irritants.</H2>
<B>M. Schaper</B>, K. Detwiler-Okabayashi, University of Pittsburgh, 
Pittsburgh, PA<P>
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polypropylene homopolymer (HP), 
polypropylene copolymer (CP), and plasticized polyvinylchloride (PVC) are 
widely used in industrial molding processes.  When these thermoplastic 
resins are heated, they may release thermal decomposition products (TDP) 
which become airborne.  Thus, there is potential for inhalation exposures to 
occur in the workplace.  In the present study, each of the above 4 polymers 
was heated for 30 minutes to generate TDP.  Using a previously developed 
mouse bioassay, the sensory and pulmonary irritating properties of these TDP 
were evaluated.  The principal effect of such inhalation exposures was 
sensory irritation.  Decreases in respiratory frequency (f) occurred that 
were dependent upon the airborne concentration of TDP to which the animals 
were exposed. Using mean decreases in f, a concentration-response 
relationship was developed for TDP from each resin.  From these 
relationships, the concentration of TDP producing a 50% decrease in f 
was obtained (RD50).  On the basis of RD50 values, the relative potency (as 
sensory irritants) of TDP was HP CP&gt;PVC&gt;ABS. RD50 values for these TDP 
were then compared to those known for sensory irritants.  The potency of TDP 
from HP, CP, PVC, and ABS was similar to that of chemicals such as acrolein, 
chlorine, a-chloroacetophenone, o-chlorobenzylidene malonitrile, 
formaldehyde, and 2,4 toluene diisocyanate.  An occupational exposure limit 
(OEL) was suggested for the TDP of each resin by multiplying the RD50 by 
0.03.  This yielded OELs of 0.08, 0.11, 0.35, and 0.63 mg/m&#179; for TDP 
from HP, CP, PVC, and ABS, respectively.  Currently, there are no threshold 
limit values (TLVs) for these TDP.  However, our suggested OELs are 
consistent with TLVs for known sensory irritants of similar potency.  This 
approach could be used to evaluate the irritancy of TDP from other 
thermoplastic resins and to develop OELs for their TDP.

<H2>41. A Mysterious Yellow-White Paste: Evaluation of an Unanticipated 
Contaminant.</H2>
<B>S. Ahrenholz</B>, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
A contaminant unexplained by the composition of materials used in a process 
for 40 years exemplifies the challenge of industrial hygiene.  Process 
maintenance workers encountered a previously unobserved foreign deposit 
responsible for fouling instrument lines during a process equipment repair.  
The line was clogged with a pale yellow-white viscous material that emitted 
green smoke upon exposure to ambient conditions.  Laboratory analyses of the 
residual deposits by the site identified the presence of arsenic containing 
compounds.  Subsequent investigation by the company disclosed the mechanism 
by which arsenic was thought to have been introduced into the primary feed 
material, uranium hexafluoride, used in the process.  Worker concern 
regarding the toxicity of this newly identified contaminant, the adequacy of 
exposure protection measures, and desire for evaluation of worker exposures 
prompted a request for a health hazard evaluation. This involved an exposure 
assessment of workers performing maintenance procedures on process equipment 
at locations where arsenic compounds were suspected to concentrate.  NIOSH 
Analytical Methods 7901 and 6001 were used in series to assess personnel and 
area airborne arsenic concentrations.  Sample results for total arsenic 
ranged from below detectable levels up to a maximum of 109 &#181;g/m&#179;.  
Calculated eight-hour TWAs were all below the OSHA PEL of 10 &#181;g/m&#179; 
but several exceeded the NIOSH ceiling REL of 2 &#181;g/m&#179;.  These 
results generally confirmed previously collected company exposure data.  
Anti-contamination protective clothing and airline respirators provided for 
protection against radiological contaminants were considered sufficient for 
the immediately exposed workers.  An additional concern was that the release 
of equipment under radiological contamination guidelines may not prevent 
exposure to arsenic compounds during subsequent work.  Recommendations to 
further enhance worker protection were provided.

<H2>42. Total and Respirable Dust Exposures in the Carbon Black 
Manufacturing Industry.</H2>
<B>H. Muranko</B>, Muranko & Associates, Scottsdale, AZ; R. Smith, Franklin, 
MI; T. Hethmon, Phelps Dodge Corporation, Phoenix, AZ<P>
This report summarizes the results of an industry-wide exposure assessment 
study conducted within a prospective cohort epidemiologic study of carbon 
black workers in the United States being conducted under the auspices of the 
Carbon Black Industry Committee for Environmental Health (CBICEH).  This is 
the fourth such survey performed in the last 15 years involving all of the 
major carbon black manufacturers in the U.S. In addition to updating the 
historical average total carbon black dust exposures for production, 
maintenance, materials handling, and laboratory job titles, this study also 
included the first comprehensive evaluation of respirable dust exposures to 
carbon black workers.<P>
Using a randomized study design to identify the highest 10% of exposures 
with 95% confidence with each job title, 1488 samples were collected (n=723 
total; n=765 respirable) at 17 carbon black manufacturing plants.  This 
included 608 simultaneously collected total and respirable dust sample 
pairs.  Total dust samples were collected in accordance with NIOSH 5000 
while the respirable dust fractions were sampled using NIOSH 0600 modified 
using the BGI-60 cyclone operated at 2.2 L/min with a predicted D50 of 4.5 
&#181;m.  The distribution of both total and respirable dust fractions was 
lognormal with an overall total dust geometric mean of 0.36 mg/m&#179; (95% 
confidence interval = 0.34 - 0.39 mg/m&#179;; range 0.01 - 16.30 mg/m&#179;), 
and an overall geometric mean for respirable dust of 0.19 mg/m&#179; (95% 
confidence interval = 0.18 - 0.20 mg/m&#179;; range = 0.01 - 7.22 
mg/m&#179;). There was good agreement between job categories as indicated 
by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p&lt;0.0001).  Material handling jobs yielded 
the highest dust concentrations, a finding consistent with the last 
industry-wide sampling study in 1979-1980. However, the geometric mean 
exposure for materials handling jobs has decreased by more than 62% since 
that study.  Similar results were determined for the other major job 
categories: maintenance, production, and laboratory. The mean ratio of total 
and respirable results for the matched pairs was 0.56 (respirable/total) 
with a standard deviation of 1.78 and a range of 0.00-32.67.  The 
correlation coefficient for all matched pair samples was 0.69 (r) with a 
coefficient of determination of 0.47 (R&#178;).  These data indicate that a 
significant predictive relationship exists between total and respirable 
carbon black concentrations and that this relationship may be used to 
retrospectively estimate the respirable fraction of historical total dust 
data collected under similar conditions.  It is concluded that personal 
exposures to total dust during carbon black manufacturing are declining over 
time and that the collection of respirable dust fractions provides a 
toxicologically meaningful measure of potential dust exposure to carbon 
black workers in the U.S.

<H2>43. Ethylene Oxide Exposures from a Secondary Source in a Facility 
Manufacturing Medical Products.</H2>
<B>G. Hadwen</B>, Environmental Health & Engineering, Inc., Newton, MA<P>
Ethylene oxide (EO) exposures have been typically associated with proximity 
to sterilization equipment within a medical care facility.  However, workers 
involved in manufacturing can have significant exposures from handling 
sterilized product.  A study of EtO exposures was undertaken among workers 
at a manufacturing facility producing medical products, receiving sterilized 
product from an outside vendor.  After sterilization, the product is 
delivered to the manufacturer's facility and kept in a quarantined area of a 
large warehouse.  The product is typically received on site one to three 
days after sterilization.  Typically, three workers sort and inspect this 
product for damage and to verify product quantities.  The product is held in 
quarantine for one to three weeks until the sterilization has been 
determined to be effective.  It is then shipped to customers.<P>
Since 1992, more than 40 long-term personal exposures and more than 50 
short-term personal exposures have been measured within this facility.  
Samples were collected quarterly, and measured both by the NIOSH method for 
EtO and with passive EtO badges. The average long-term exposure was 0.2 ppm. 
Short-term samples averaged 0.9 ppm and reached a maximum of 2.7 ppm, never 
exceeding the OSHA STEL of 5.0 ppm.  Of the long-term samples, 20% exceeded 
the OSHA action level of 0.5 ppm, but all were below the OSHA PEL of 1.0 
ppm.  All exceedances of the action level occurred during February, March, 
or April.  Data was also collected on quantity of product present during 
sampling and days since sterilization of product present.

<H2>44. Assessment of Exposure to Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide at Eight 
Pulp and Paper Mills in the United States.</H2>
<B>H. Poovey</B>, R. Gibson, H. Glindmeyer, R. Rando, Tulane Medical Center, 
New Orleans, LA<P>
The  ability to simultaneously detect chlorine and chlorine dioxide in the 
workplace where there is concomitant exposure has become a concern of the 
pulp and paper industry due to a change from the use of hypochlorite to 
chlorine dioxide in the bleach process.  The recent development of a passive 
sampler for chlorine and chlorine dioxide has allowed personal exposure 
monitoring for chlorine and chlorine dioxide to be conducted in the 
workplace.  Personal exposure monitoring was conducted at eight paper/pulp 
mills which had undergone conversion to the chlorine and chlorine dioxide 
bleaching process.  Samples were collected using a 37-mm modified Tulane 
passive sampler containing a phosphate buffered iodide collection medium and 
analyzed on a non-suppressed ion chromatography system.  Analytical limits 
of detection for chloride and chlorite, the representative ions for chlorine 
and chlorine dioxide, were estimated to be 0.16 &#181;g/mL and 0.13 
&#181;g/mL, respectively.  For the 37-mm modified Tulane passive sample with 
a final volume 5mLs of absorbing media and eight hours of exposure, this 
would correspond to air concentrations of 10 ppb for both chlorine and 
chlorine dioxide.  At each mill, a total of nine work shifts were monitored 
over a period of five work days.  On each shift approximately ten workers 
from various areas of the plant were monitored for exposure.  A total of 658 
full shift personal exposure samples were collected at the mills.  Of these, 
136 (21%) had detectable levels of chlorine and 36 (6%) of chlorine dioxide. 
Of those samples with detectable levels of chlorine, the geometric mean (GM) 
was 39 ppb with the highest individual level at 1138 ppb.  For chlorine 
dioxide the GM was 31 ppb with the highest individual level at 293 ppb.  
While there were exposures greater than the PEL to both chlorine, 0.2% and 
chlorine dioxide, 0.9%, the overall GM for each was significantly below the 
respective PEL.  This would indicate that the conversion to the chlorine 
dioxide bleaching process has not resulted in a significant increase in 
occupational exposures.

<H2>45. Practical Aspects of Performing Industrial Hygiene Surveys at 
Embalming Operations.</H2>
<B>R. Higley</B>, G. Gruenwald, Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, Tustin, 
CA<P>
Formaldehyde exposure at embalming operations can be significant to 
embalmers, assistants, and cosmetizers.  Very little has been written in the 
technical literature regarding not only actual exposure data, but also 
practical advice on solving some of the unique sampling challenges faced 
during these surveys.<P>
A series of industrial hygiene surveys were conducted at six different 
mortuaries.  The study involves data collected over several years and under 
a variety of case conditions (intact body, autopsied, etc.). Results 
indicated average levels during embalming to range from 0.21 ppm to 0.35 ppm 
of formaldehyde.  Increased levels (0.40 ppm) can be expected during more 
difficult procedures and autopsied cases.  Some residual formaldehyde 
exposures ((0.10 ppm to 0.21 ppm) exists in adjacent areas, such as 
cosmetizing and body dressing and casketing areas.<P>
Control measures and alternatives include substitution, lateral slotted 
exhaust or down draft tables, among others.  Some of these controls have 
already been tried but in general, it appears that the industry is rather 
traditional in the current use of formaldehyde and existing ventilation 
controls along with administrative practices and use of personal protective 
equipment.  Use of ion generators has been explored by some.<P>
Besides obtaining exposure data, special practical and logistical 
considerations need to be addressed when conducting these unique surveys.  
Preparation work should consider the availability of sufficient cases to 
obtain valid data.  The type of case (intact, autopsied, or traumatized) 
determines the complexity and length of exposure and available sampling 
time.<P>
When actually performing the survey, the industrial hygienist needs to plan 
his/her strategy around the location of the embalming room, body holding 
area, and cosmetizing/dressing area.  Due to the uniqueness of the 
operations, attention needs to be given to suitable areas for setup and 
calibration as well as other sampling and decorum considerations.<P>
Besides formaldehyde exposures, other exposures such as the use of alcohols 
and other disinfectants need to be addressed.  Of course, ergonomic 
exposures from lifting, moving, and transporting the bodies are of utmost 
importance.

<H2>46. Problems Associated with Measurement, Data Interpretation, and Risk 
Assessment Modeling of Post-Remediation Residual Radiation Levels Near 
Background.</H2> 
<B>E. Walker</B>, Bechtel Environmental, Inc., Oak Ridge, TN<P>
Proposed federal regulations by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the 
Environmental Protection Agency for cleanup criteria to be applied to 
radiological remediation activities have been set at 15 rem/year above 
background.  Background radiation measurements have been evaluated to 
determine required detector sensitivities, data conversion factors, and 
dose-risk modeling factors to demonstrate compliance with the proposed 
regulations.  The evaluations considered the currently accepted ranges for 
the detectors, the sensitivities of the measurement protocols, the 
variability range of natural background, and the variations resulting from 
source-detector geometries.  Problems that contribute to appropriate data 
conversion include lack of rigorous calibration requirements at radiation 
levels near background, and inconsistencies between calibration source 
characteristics and the post remedial source matrix.  The ability to apply 
dose-risk models to demonstrate compliance with the proposed regulatory 
criteria is confounded by the use of different factors and different models 
by the different regulatory agencies.  Because of the above mentioned 
factors, it is not clear at time that compliance to the proposed cleanup 
criteria can be demonstrated absolutely to criteria that is within the 
variations of the natural background at any given location.

<TITLE>AIHA Position on Risk Assessment Provisions of S.171</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2><CENTER>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
 EXPANDED POSITION STATEMENT ON RISK ASSESSMENT PROVISIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT ACT (S. 171)</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) supports the use of risk assessment,
when conducted with good scientific principles, as the basis for risk management.  The AIHA believes
the process of risk assessment can advance the protection of human health and safety, and the
environment.
<P>
The AIHA supports Section 122 and Section 123 of Senate Bill 171, the Department of the
Environment Act, as amended.  Comments with respect to Sections 122 and 123, known as the
Johnston Amendment:
<P>
Section 122:   This section directs the Office of Environmental Justice within the             Department of the Environment to address environmental equity issues.
<P>
          The AIHA recognizes that there may be sub-populations which are at
          increased risk of occupational and environmental exposures to
          chemicals due to social, cultural, and economic factors.  The process
          of performing risk assessment, as outlined in this section, is a valuable
          tool in identifying these at-risk populations.  Management of these
          risks, however, involves issues that go beyond the scientific and
          technical aspects.
<P>          
        Section 123:   The "Human and Safety or the Environment Final Regulations" section             requires risk assessment, cost of implementation, comparative analysis of            the risk, and certification that the risk estimate and the analysis are supported by the best available scientific data.
<P>
          The AIHA supports the risk assessment process, and believes that it
          should be conducted with the best available scientific data.  AIHA
          further believes that risk assessment is an uncertain process and that
          this uncertainty should be addressed and communicated.  AIHA is in
          agreement with "comparative analysis" as long as the scientific basis
          for the risk scenarios being compared are similar in nature.  AIHA
          believes that the estimation and analysis should be based on the best
          available scientific data.
<P>         
<B>Adopted by Board of Directors:  October 4, 1993</B>

<TITLE>AIHA Position on Total Human Exposure</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2><CENTER>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
POSITION STATEMENT ON TOTAL HUMAN EXPOSURE</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) believes that accurate assessment of Total
Human Exposure (THE) can have a significant and positive role on society's efforts to improve
public health and the environment.
<P>
People can be exposed to environmental hazards through contact with a wide variety of media,
such as air, water, food and soil.  The contaminants can then enter the body via a single route or
any combination of routes: inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption.  Managing the resulting health
risks requires an integrated and comprehensive assessment of environmental transport, human
exposure (occupational and nonoccupational) and human uptake of these contaminants.  The
concept of Total Human Exposure (THE) has been gaining increasing prominence as a means to
achieve this goal.  Many tools are used in the THE process including:  personal monitoring,
human exposure-activity models, micro-environmental investigations, biological dose evaluation
methods, predictive exposure modeling and statistical analyses.
<P>
AIHA supports THE concepts and supports industrial hygienists' contribution to future
developments in this arena.
<P>
AIHA believes:
<OL>
<LI>Traditional industrial hygiene concepts for assessing occupational exposure and developing
methods for anticipation and recognition of nonoccupational stressors are applicable in total
human exposure assessments.
<P>
<LI>As permissible air exposures standards shift downward, the exposures via other routes may
contribute a greater proportion of the total dose.  Thus, a total accounting of dose via all media
and exposure routes becomes even more important.
<P>
<LI>Total Human Exposure assessment is an appropriate tool for improving risk evaluation and
risk management for workers and the general population.
<P>
<LI>Quality assurance is important in Total Human Exposure assessment and should include
evaluation of potential inaccuracies, uncertainties, and confidence intervals, so that the validity of the result is understood.
<P>
<LI>Information and data used in THE assessment requires further development.  Needs exist for more measured data on the contributions of air, food, water, and soil; combination of exposure through dermal, inhalation and ingestion routes; and home, recreational and other
nonoccupational exposure to the total dose of harmful agents experienced by an individual.  Time-activity data associated with measured occupational and nonoccupational exposures is also needed.
<P>
<LI>Total Human Exposure assessment, as well as risk evaluation, risk management and risk
communication, requires further research and development in the areas of:
<UL>
     <LI>The role of individual susceptibility factors.
     <LI>The role of multiple agent low level exposures.
     <LI>The application of physiological media-based measure of exposure such as biological
exposure indices.
     <LI>The use of mathematical simulations and analyses.
     <LI>The enhancement of communication of all aspects of worker and public exposure to
workplace and environmental contaminants.
</UL>
</OL>

<TITLE> Record Occupational Injury and Illness Comments</TITLE>
<HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION COMMENTS TO THE
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION<BR>
DRAFT PROPOSED RULE<BR>
RECORDING, REPORTING OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES AND ILLNESSES</H1>
<P>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) supports OSHA's efforts to draft a new
and more useful rule.  Existing reporting and recording procedures do not provide reliable and
consistent occupational illness statistics.  AIHA believes that the OSHA Log should help OSHA
to focus individual inspections and to manage its resources, assist employers to manage safety
and health, help employees and their representatives to be informed and monitor workplace
safety and health, and provide more reliable injury/illness statistics.
<P>
AIHA herein provides comments with recommendations to the draft proposed rule's objectives
and its impact on industrial hygiene, occupational medicine, occupational illness management,
and computerization of data.
<P>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) expresses its appreciation to the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for the opportunity to provide
comments on OSHA's draft proposed rule for recording and reporting occupational injuries and
illnesses, sent to stakeholders and published in the BNA OSHA Reporter.
<P>
AIHA invites OSHA to consider this a dialogue and welcomes the opportunity for continued
discussion.  Please contact O. Gordon Banks, Executive Director, at (703) 849-8888.
<P>
This document was prepared by an expert task force gathered from AIHA's Management,
Occupational Epidemiology, Social Concerns, and Occupational Medicine committees.  Laura B.
Newton, CIH, served as Task Force Chair and Gayla J. McCluskey, CIH, served as Board
Coordinator.
<P><h2>Positive Comments</h2>
AIHA reviewers noted the following positive aspects of the draft proposed rule:<BR>
<UL><LI>The elimination of the term "lost workdays" and the calendar method of calculating
days-restricted-and-lost should reduce confusion.
<LI>The addition of a clear definition of bloodborne pathogens exposure is a welcome addition.  
<LI>The 8x11-sized page is considered an improvement, provided that adequate margins are
maintained.</UL>
<P>
<h2>Comments Related to the Objectives of the Proposed Rule</h2>
Comment:  AIHA believes that the OSHA Log serves not only as a tool for OSHA to focus
individual inspections and to manage its resources, but also:<BR>
<UL><LI>serves as a tool for employers to manage safety and health,
<LI>serves as a tool for employees and their representatives to be informed and monitor
workplace safety and health, and
<LI>can provide more reliable injury/illness statistics through consistent recording and clearer
rules.  Existing reporting and recording procedures do not provide reliable and consistent
occupational illness statistics.</UL>
<P>
Recommendation:  OSHA's proposed rules should be designed to meet the above objectives.  It
should have a goal of providing better occupational disease statistics for increased utility in
disease identification and prevention.

<h2>Comments and Recommendations Related to Industrial Hygiene (IH)</h2>
Comment:  There is no reference to IH sampling and measurement data.  If it is not attached to or
referenced on the OSHA 301 form, it may be difficult to locate during a review of a specific
injury/exposure case.
<P>
Recommendation:  AIHA proposes that IH sampling and measurement data be
referenced--or attached-- to the OSHA 301 form.
<P>
Comment:  A document, "Key Data Elements for Occupational Exposure Database," is being
jointly developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)
and AIHA.  It will cover how to assess and record exposure assessments.
<P>
Recommendation:  OSHA should consider incorporating, or making its rule compatible with, the
ACGIH/AIHA document.
<P>
Comment:  AIHA is concerned that OSHA appears to be changing the OSH Act of 1970 by
redefining the criteria for recording occupational illnesses.  Specific concerns include:<BR>
<UL><LI>By requiring medical diagnosis or treatment, or the presence of symptoms for more
than 48 hours before work-related symptoms become recordable, employees' subjective
symptoms such as malaise, headache and nausea, when clearly linked to the workplace, would no
longer be recordable in the OSHA Log.
<LI>The 48-hour duration criteria is not consistent with known contaminant-related symptoms
such as carbon monoxide poisoning, heat stress or solvent overexposure and is not helpful in
determining recordability.  An employee's subjective complaint can provide an early warning
system for a problem and should be given serious attention before more serious illness or disease
is manifested.
<LI>IH training courses such as Hazard Communication are geared toward educating the
workforce to recognize and report symptoms of overexposure, presumably for disease
prevention.  As industrial hygienists, we do not want this information to be de-emphasized or
lost.</UL>
<P>
Recommendation:  OSHA should consider the impact of the 48-hour rule on the need for disease
recognition and prevention.  Clarifying guidelines should be included in the rule with the goal of
consistent reporting between them.
<P>
Comment:  It was not clear to AIHA reviewers that Appendix B is not limited to recording only
those substances listed.
<P>
Recommendation:  The proposed rule should prominently state that conditions not on the
list that meet other recordable conditions are recordable.  OSHA should also consider
adding toluene diisocyanate (TDI) to Appendix B with defining criteria as a sensitizing
agent.
<P>
<h2>Comments and Recommendations Related to Occupational Medicine</h2>
Comment:  The question was raised, How will acute vs chronic conditions be captured on the
revised OSHA Log?  Accute and chronic conditions have different causation, management, and
tracking parameters.
<P>
Recommendation:  OSHA should use the recording of chronic and acute conditions.
<P>
Comment:  Thirty days is too short for closure on a single injury/illness case.  For
example, musculoskeletal injuries and illnesses in physical therapy may have longer than
a 30-day period between physician evaluations.
<P>
Recommendation:  OSHA should use the medical provider's clearance for closure and for
return to full work capability.
<P>
Comment:  Recording tetanus shots/boosters and prophylactic antibiotic treatment would
lead to an increase in recordable incidents which may not have been otherwise severe
enough to be recorded.  This may discourage employers from sending injured employees
for medical evaluations and care for borderline cases.  Most cases requiring a tetanus
shot/booster and prophylactic antibiotic treatments are already recordable under the
definition of recordable.
<P>
Recommendation:  Tetanus shots/boosters and prophylactic antibiotic treatment should
not be considered as medical treatment and therefore recordable.
<P>
Comment:  It is probably not advisable to try to capture mental illness until work-related
criteria are clearly defined.  Currently, it is too difficult to tie mental conditions to the
work environment versus other contributing factors.
<P>
Recommendation:  OSHA should reconsider the inclusion of mental illness as recordable.
<P>
Comment:  Clear criteria is lacking for determining work relatedness to homicide and
violence.
<P>
Recommendation:  The non-work-related exclusion for homicide and violence should go
beyond the immediate family, since ex-spouse, dating relationships, and drug use may
account for many cases.
<P>
Comments and Recommendations Related to IH Management
<P>
Comment:  There is concern that combining the illness and injury sections of the OSHA
Log would:<BR>
<UL><LI>reduce utility of the log, particularly at the plant level, making trends harder to
identify through visual inspections by OSHA, employees and anyone without computer
analysis capability.
<LI>make it difficult to discern illnesses and injuries,
<LI>make it difficult to discern between chronic and acute events,
<LI>confuse management about changes in number and types of cases, and
<LI>possibly make it difficult to track illness and injury issues in the future.</UL>
<P>
Recommendation:  OSHA should consider the pros and cons of combining the illness and
injury sections of the OSHA Log.  AIHA suggests OSHA consider three separate pages,
one each for injury, illness, and special/abnormal test result cases.
<P>
Comment:  It is not clear how abnormal lab tests (such as elevated liver function results)
will be recorded.  Also, if there is an increase in blood levels that are still below the
recordable blood level, these may still be of concern to management.  Perhaps significant
changes could trigger recordability.
<P>
Recommendation:  OSHA should consider the issue of abnormal (but not excessive) test
results.
<P>
Comment:  Proposed changes to OSHA recordkeeping will increase the number of
recordable injuries and illnesses.  This could effect ongoing statistical studies. 
<P>
Recommendation:  Transition surveys should be conducted to compare data before and
after so that macro uses of data are not adversely affected.  A prominent statement should
be included that increases are due to different rules of recordability so that OH&S
professionals are not blamed for increases in numbers of reported incidence.
<P>
Comment:  The decision tree for first-aid versus medical treatment, and for recordability
in general, is not clear.
<P>
Recommendation:  The decision tree for first-aid versus medical treatment should be
generalized and simplified.  A standardized logic should be included in an appendix but
not be mandatory.  OSHA should also consider a computerized approach.
<P>
Comment:  Exempting some industries from the recordkeeping requirements may present
problems.  Occupational hazards are present in all industries and very hazardous
occupations may be nested with "safe" SIC code designations.  Changes in the nature of
OH&S (such as ergonomics of materials handling and computers, IAQ, travel-related
injuries, burns and electrocutions in the fast food industry, and workplace violence),
affect increasingly diverse sections of the workforce.  These "unregulated" sectors need to
be made aware of their responsibility in these areas.  If an employer has few recordable
incidents, then maintenance of the OSHA Log will not present much of a burden.  AIHA
believes that OSHA's recordkeeping requirements can be used to identify problem areas
and allocate resources to address them.
<P>
Recommendation:  AIHA recommends extending regular OSHA recordkeeping
requirements to all establishments with more than 10 employees, regardless of industry or
SIC code.  OSHA should communicate all changes to newly affected industries and
provide sufficient resources to assist in their compliance.
<P>
<h2>Comments and Recommendations Related to Computerization of Data</h2>
Comment:  AIHA generally supports computerization of OSHA Log information.  Recognized
standardized codes, such as ANSI and/or ICD codes are available with computer "look-up"
tables.  The use of standardized codes would enable smaller firms to identify workplace trends
and better interpret and present data to employees and management through simple graphs. 
AIHA has concerns which can be addressed by following AIHA's recommendations, shown
below.
<P>
Recommendation:  OSHA should assure that computerization requirements:<BR>
<UL><LI>do not preempt existing company systems,
<LI>protect against falsifying or tampering with data,
<LI>protect against inadvertent loss of data,
<LI>provide security and confidentiality,
<LI>ensure only authorized access and release of data, and
<LI>recognize that some cases may remain open for long periods of time and      require many
updates.</UL>
<P>
OSHA should also look into optional coding systems, e.g., simple categories of body parts
injured, types of injuries, and so forth.  OSHA should provide criteria for the development of a
system, but not undertake the development itself.

<H2>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION COMMENTS TO THE
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</H2>

<I>PROPOSED INDOOR AIR QUALITY STANDARD</I> (59 FEDERAL REGISTER
15968-16039: APRIL 5, 1994)
<P>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) supports OSHA's overall approach to
regulating indoor air quality, including environmental tobacco smoke.  Whether OSHA
promulgates a single, integrated, indoor air quality standard, or two related standards, our
view of the substance of OSHA's efforts is the same.  For these comments, we will refer to
OSHA's efforts as resulting in a single standard, added to Parts 1910, 1915 and 1926 of Title
29 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
<P>
AIHA is focussing its comments on the following: applicability of the regulation; using a
performance-based standard; minimizing the regulatory burden; designing indoor air quality
compliance programs; health effects of building conditions and operations, such as in
building-related illnesses; environmental tobacco smoke; Implementing indoor air quality
compliance programs; fully assessing the impact of the standard; and several smaller, but no
less important, issues.
<HR>
<H3>APPLICABILITY OF THE REGULATION</H3>

<H4>APPLICABILITY</H4> AIHA supports having an indoor air quality standard
apply to all non-industrial work environments, as OSHA has proposed (par. (a)(1)).  AIHA
further supports applying environmental tobacco smoke provisions to all workplaces,
including the indoor and enclosed non-industrial workplaces OSHA proposes to cover (par.
(a)(2)).  AIHA believes that OSHA's actions on nonindustrial work environments are
especially important because of the large and ever-increasing number and fraction of
employees in the United States working in these environments (59 FR 16005-07).

<H4>INDUSTRIAL WORK ENVIRONMENTS</H4> It is difficult at many industrial
facilities to separate the control of process-related emissions (regulated, in many cases, under
other OSHA standards) and process-related temperature/humidity conditions from the
maintenance of acceptable indoor air quality as broadly construed under the proposed
standard.  As a result, AIHA believes it is premature to consider extending the proposed
standard to industrial work environments.

<HR>
<H3>USING A PERFORMANCE-BASED STANDARD</H3>
<H4>PERFORMANCE-BASED STANDARD</H4> AIHA supports the use by OSHA
of a performance-based approach rather than a chemical-by-chemical  one.  The experience of
industrial hygienists and others has shown that an integrated approach, involving chemical,
biological, engineering and ergonomic factors, is usually most appropriate for addressing
indoor air quality problems in non-industrial settings.  This integrated approach, furthermore,
tends to identify specific chemical sources of contamination, when these are the main
contributors to indoor air quality pollution, and helps characterize solutions to contamination,
such as engineering controls and process changes.

<HR>
<H3>MINIMIZING THE REGULATORY BURDEN</H3>
<H4>MINIMIZING REGULATORY BURDEN</H4> Similarly, OSHA should review
the details of its proposed standard to ensure that <I>essential</I> information and
actions are retained in the main text of the standard or placed in one or more
<I>mandatory</I> appendices, while <I>desirable</I> or <I>optional</I> indoor
air quality compliance plan or program elements are listed in the preamble or
<I>nonmandatory</I> appendices.  OSHA has, commendably, listed a range of important
potential plan and program elements.  It should, however, act cautiously in mandating their
use under penalty of law.  AIHA is including as part of these comments a summary outline
of the proposed standard, indicating the paragraphs it recommends be mandatory,
nonmandatory, or deleted from the final standard.  In the narrative portion of these
comments, we discuss elements which should be made nonmandatory or deleted, and the
revisions which may be appropriate.

<HR>
<H3>DESIGNING INDOOR AIR QUALITY COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS</H3>
<H4>IAQ COMPLIANCE PROGRAM</H4> AIHA supports requiring "nonindustrial
work environment" employers to have an indoor air quality compliance program, as proposed
by OSHA (par. (c)(1)).  As discussed below, AIHA is interested in OSHA's allowing
employers to implement this requirement in the most efficient manner.  Implementation of a
facility's <I>program</I> (par. (d)), which is to result from implementing its
<I>plan</I> (par. (c)(3)), should be the focus of OSHA's efforts.  OSHA's enforcement
strategy, including its compliance directives, should ensure that the paperwork does not
become its focus.
<P>
OSHA should incorporate flexibility for indoor air quality program implementation as long as
all employees within a covered facility are under the standard's umbrella of protection.  For
example, in a multi-employer facility, compliance could often be achieved efficiently by
having a single indoor air quality plan for the entire facility, rather than requiring each
employer to develop a plan independently.  The facility-wide plan would, in most instances,
be developed by the facility owner or manager.  In many cases, the remaining employers in
the facility would accept the facility-wide plan as is for their own use.  In many other cases,
the remaining employers would adapt the facility-wide plan to meet their corporate
requirements (such as by using their own inspection forms, incident response processes, or
procurement requirements).  In some cases, several or all of the employers would share in the
development of the facility plan.

<H4>DESIGNATED PERSONS</H4> The proposal would require that a person who is
"knowledgeable in the requirements of this standard and the specific building  systems" and
"who has been given the responsibility...to take necessary measures to assure compliance
with this" standard, including "implementation of the IAQ compliance program" be
"designated" (pars. (b),(c)(2)).  The proposal unnecessarily merges two distinct functions.
<P>
The first function is properly performed by a "designated person" responsible for ensuring
compliance with the standard.  Such a designated person must first know the requirements of
the standard; second, be generally familiar with the subject of indoor air quality; and third,
be responsible for implementing the facility's indoor air quality compliance program.  This is
the  appropriate role for a designated person, as used in the Environmental Protection
Agency's regulations under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA; 40 CFR
763.84(g)(1)).
<P>
The second function should be performed by a "competent person," as described below, who
may be different from the "designated person."

<H4>COMPETENT PERSONS</H4> Certain functions, specifically, being capable of
identifying indoor air quality hazards, and authorized to implement controls promptly,
proposed by OSHA to be performed by the designated person, should be performed by a
"competent person."  This competent person function is used in all of OSHA's construction
industry standards (29 CFR 1926.20(b)(2), 1926.32(f)); explicitly in OSHA's recent lead in
construction standard (29 CFR 1926.62(c),(e)(2)(iii)); and in the EPA's analogous "on-site
representative" in its Clean Air Act regulations for asbestos projects (40 CFR 61.145(c)(8)). 
An employer could have one or more than one competent person for a facility, depending on
its size, the time and location of construction, operation and maintenance activities, and other
factors.  On the other hand, the employer should have only one designated person for the
facility's indoor air quality compliance program, to keep the line of overall responsibility for
ensuring compliance with the standard clear.
<P>
An employer may be fortunate enough to have a person who is both  technically competent in
implementation of an indoor air quality control program, and in a position of organizational
authority to implement the standard.  Most employers will not.  The standard should separate
the roles of "designated person" and "competent person."  This would minimize the burden
on employers to either hire or contract for a person with both abilities or have to change the
lines of organizational authority and responsibility, when neither would be required if the
functions could be separated.  OSHA should recognize certified industrial hygienists and
other comparably qualified professionals as technically competent.  AIHA recommends
including this recognition in the descriptions of the designated person and building system
inspector functions, and, if identified explicitly as AIHA is proposing, the competent person
function.

<HR>
<H3>HEALTH EFFECTS OF BUILDING CONDITIONS AND OPERATIONS</H3>
<H4>SBS, BRI, COMFORT ISSUES</H4> The standard should clearly separate sick
building syndrome, building-related illness and thermal comfort issues.  The discussion of
sick building syndrome in the preamble of the proposal (59 FR 15970-71) is reasonable, and
could form the basis for developing a definition in the standard.  AIHA believes that distinct
definitions are needed because building-related illness has a sound scientific definition and
medical  etiology (par. (b); 59 FR 15971-73), but sick building syndrome does not.  A
non-mandatory appendix discussing the differences among sick building syndrome,
building-related illness, and comfort complaints, should be added.

<H4>DEFINITION OF BRI</H4> The discussion of building-related illness in the
preamble appropriately states that the illness involves conditions of known etiology
documented by physical signs and laboratory findings, with a demonstrated causal relationship
to the building environment (59 FR 15970).  It should be noted, however, that the preamble
discussion of building-related illness includes references to diseases (such as influenza,
rhinovirus, and colds) (59 FR 15972) associated with person-to-person contact and not
building-related illness per se.  The definition of building-related illness should be expanded
to state that it requires medical involvement for diagnosis and usually requires medical
intervention for resolution.

<H4>COMFORT ISSUES</H4> Thermal/humidity comfort issues should be explicitly
excluded from this standard.  The proposed definition of building-related illness of "specific
medical conditions of known etiology" (par. (b)) might inadvertently be interpreted as
including these comfort issues.  The standard should be based on preventing significant
impairment of employees' health and  should not include minimizing discomfort unrelated to
this goal.  Studies by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and others
have indicated that a large fraction (typically a majority) of complaints perceived by
employees as being related to indoor air quality are related to thermal/humidity comfort.  By
excluding these issues explicitly, OSHA would relieve employers, especially small businesses,
of a significant burden, without degrading the degree of protection of employees' health
provided by the standard.

<H4>RESPONSE TO BRI VERIFICATION</H4> Evaluation of the need to perform
alterations of building systems (par. (d)(12)) should be required only after medical
verification of complaints of building-related illness, not simply upon presentation of the
complaints.  Mandating a building system evaluation in response to every unverified
complaint would be burdensome and wasteful of efforts by employers and OSHA otherwise
needed for employee health protection.  Employers would be still able to evaluate their
building systems prior to medical verification.
<P>
The corresponding building employee information procedure (par. (g)(2)(ii)) should be
revised to refer to medically verified complaints of building-related illness.
<P>
Similarly, when an evaluation does show the need for altering building systems, the employer
should be able to attain the desired goal of protecting the health of employees by means other
than only those recommended by the evaluator (par. (d)(13)).  The employer should be
provided the flexibility to select among technically and economically feasible alternative and
effective solutions.
<P>
More generally, the proposed standard overemphasizes central ventilation systems in regard to
the issue of illnesses associated with employees' buildings.  These may result from, for
example, the type and/or concentration of emissions from process or non-process sources, be
they localized or widespread; from the timing of operations which could be adjusted so as to
reduce or avoid employee exposures; or from stressors unrelated to air quality issues, such as
ergonomic issues, including lighting, furnishings, work acceleration, or fixed or rotating shift
work, among many other examples.

<HR>
<H3>ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE</H3>
<H4>ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE</H4> AIHA is committed to its position
that all nonsmokers should be protected from involuntary exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke in their workplaces.  AIHA supports banning smoking or providing adequately
ventilated designated smoking areas, as OSHA has proposed (par. (e)(1)(i)).  The standard
should be uniformly applied to all workplaces, including the indoor or enclosed workplaces,
such as restaurants and bowling alleys, high-rise offices and hospitals, which OSHA proposes
to cover (par. (a)(2)).

<H4>ETS HEALTH EFFECTS</H4> It is clear that environmental tobacco smoke is an
eye and upper respiratory airway irritant, and can contribute to exacerbation of asthma and
increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.  In the final preamble and standard, OSHA
should further emphasize such effects in addition to the carcinogenicity of environmental
tobacco smoke in order to put into perspective the "risk of material health impairment."
<P>
The body of scientific evidence is sufficient to establish that environmental tobacco smoke
may produce a small excess risk of lung cancer in nonsmokers, as well as other deleterious
health effects.  This provides the scientific basis for OSHA to enact an environmental tobacco
smoke standard.  AIHA acknowledges that it is difficult to provide a numerical estimate of
the risk in the workplace under actual exposure conditions; OSHA used the scientific
information available to it in a reasonable manner.  However, this aspect of the effects of
environmental tobacco smoke may need further study by scientific bodies, such as the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, concurrent with implementation of the
standard.  In the preamble to the final standard, OSHA should discuss the uncertainty about
the magnitude of the lung cancer effect, and the even greater uncertainty about the estimates
of severe cardiovascular disease and other diseases.  Having hazard communication
information in the preamble and/or a nonmandatory appendix will help AIHA members and
other users of the standard to fulfill their responsibilities to workers, employers, and building
owners and managers regarding the risks of environmental tobacco smoke.

<HR>
<H3>IMPLEMENTING INDOOR AIR QUALITY COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS</H3>
<H4>RENOVATION AND REMODELING</H4> OSHA should provide, first, criteria
for scopes of work below which "renovation and remodeling" (pars. (b),(f)) are not covered
by the standard, and, second, scopes of work below which periodic, rather than
project-by-project notification is sufficient.
<P>
Below a <I>de minimis</I> level of activity, the risk of significantly degrading building
air quality (as contrasted with the quality of the air breathed by the mechanical or
construction workers, which is addressed by other OSHA standards) becomes minute, and the
full work plan development and building employee notification processes become
unnecessarily burdensome in relation to their potential benefit.  Similarly, for
routinely-performed activities between the de minimis level and the level of major renovation
or remodeling, periodic building employee notification, annually, for example, may provide
sufficient information to remind notified persons of indoor air quality issues and their  rights
thereto.

<H4>SCOPE OF NOTIFICATION</H4> OSHA should consider deleting, making
nonmandatory, or significantly restricting the proposal to notify building employees of
anticipated adverse impacts of renovation and remodeling on indoor air quality or workplace
conditions (par. (f)(3)(i)).  Health-related notification will be credible and beneficial in the
indoor air quality health arena only if the activity is likely to affect health; in such a case,
advance notification is appropriate.
<P>
Virtually all workplace activities, including, it must be said, occupancy of an area by
renovation or remodeling workers, introduce air contaminants into the workplace.  Mere
introduction of air contaminants, independent of type or level, does not warrant notification. 
OSHA should integrate its indoor air quality notification effort with that of its hazard
communication standards (including 29 CFR 1910.1200 and 1926.59).  As noted above,
general building employee information (par. (g)(2)(ii)) should similarly address medically
verified cases of building-related illness, not just complaints.
<P>
OSHA should similarly review the building employee notification proposed for the application
of "potentially hazardous chemicals" (par. (e)(4)), and consider deleting this provision.  The
quoted term is extremely broad, encompassing any concentration of any chemical identified as
hazardous under regulations of  OSHA,  EPA,  or the Departments of 
<P>
Health and Human Services, Transportation, Commerce, or Energy.  OSHA should consider
the likelihood of exposure and deleterious effects of hazardous chemicals in relationship to
their type and concentration when reviewing its notification proposal.

<H4>BUILDING HUMIDITY</H4> OSHA should remove an imbalance in the
treatment of buildings with mechanical, as opposed to natural, cooling systems.  It should
delete the proposed relative humidity requirement in mechanically cooled buildings
(par. (d)(5)), because concerns about mold growth, standing water and other major ventilation
system problems are already addressed on a performance basis in the proposal.  The proposed
standard already requires that the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system "operate up
to original design specifications" and that "mechanical equipment rooms...are maintained in a
clean condition," among other requirements (pars. (d)(1),(3),(8),(9)).  Were a specific
relative humidity range inherently injurious, such a level would appropriately be applicable to
all buildings, not just to those with mechanical cooling systems.  The text is unnecessary and
should be deleted from the standard.  OSHA may wish to discuss building humidity issues in
the final preamble and/or a nonmandatory appendix.

<H4>HVAC SYSTEM TESTING</H4> OSHA should relocate its wording on air quality
testing after routine maintenance has been performed on heating, ventilation and air
conditioning systems (par. (d)(6)) to a nonmandatory appendix or delete it.  The proposed
testing requirement duplicates other performance-based elements of the proposed standard on
preventive maintenance programs, response to employee complaints that may be related to
building-related illness, and other investigative measures.  In addition, there is not yet
scientific consensus on the use of 800 parts per million of carbon dioxide as the appropriate
indicator of ventilation performance, as opposed to use of some other level of carbon dioxide
or some other contaminants.  For example, microbial contamination of a ventilation system
can be significant even with a level of carbon dioxide well below the proposed criterion.  A
non-mandatory appendix could discuss the use of a variety of gaseous and particulate
contaminants, and of mechanical data, as indicators of ventilation performance.

<H4>MECHANICAL AREA CLEANLINESS</H4> OSHA should provide detailed
guidance (such as in an appendix to the standard, the final preamble, and/or its compliance
directives) on the meaning of the phrase "maintained in clean condition" as applied to
"mechanical equipment rooms and nonducted air plenums or chases that transport air"
(par. (d)(8)).  No microscopy, chemical or  biological analysis, or "white glove" surface dust
sampling should be required without medical verification of complaints and investigative
association of these illnesses with ventilation system performance.  Without such verification
and association, use of these techniques will yield overly conservative cleanliness criteria not
necessarily related to the protection of employee health.  OSHA's guidance should ensure that
protective and feasible cleanliness criteria related to identified health hazards to employees in
the facility are formally adopted and used in field practice.

<H4>MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION</H4> Microbial contamination (par. (e)(3)) not
linked by facility inspection and medical confirmation to building-related illness should be
addressed in a non-mandatory appendix.  In that appendix, it should be discussed as part of
indoor air quality compliance plan elements on inspecting, maintaining, operating and
managing ventilation and other building systems, and on developing checklists for the visual
inspection of building systems (pars. (c)(3),(d)).  Medically confirmed building-related illness
associated with microbial contamination should lead to facility inspection for relevant
microbial growth; such growth should be subject to control measures.

<HR>
<H3>FULLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE STANDARD</H3>
<H4>ECONOMIC IMPACT</H4> AIHA believes that the time and resources required
to implement the standard are significantly underestimated in the preamble (59 FR 16013-22). 
As discussed below, the proposed standard imposes excessive paperwork and  administrative
burdens, especially on small employers and small building owners and managers.

<H4>SCOPE AND RESOURCES</H4> OSHA's assumption "that 95 percent of all
establishments are required to develop the IAQ compliance program information" (59 FR
16014) appears quite reasonable.  On the other hand, estimates of time spent, wage rates, and
technical or administrative levels of persons involved with developing plans appear to be low. 
Considering training in the requirements of the standard, equipment (re-)familiarization,
inspection, review and verification of the accuracy of existing documents, and new document
preparation typically needed for developing the compliance program, the times should be
measured in units of days, not hours or minutes.

<H4>TIME</H4> For example, the time required to "compile and develop building
system operation and maintenance information" is likely to be much longer than "one hour,"
and much of the work may need to be done by a person at a higher wage rate than a
"technician."   For all but the smallest buildings, a day will be the least amount of time
required.  For complex or large buildings (such as those over 100,000 square feet), many
days will be required.  The related "managerial time" is likely to be much longer than the
"15 minutes" shown for all buildings.  On the whole, it is not unreasonable to increase the
time estimate by a factor of 8 to 16 from that shown, and for large buildings, even more.

<H4>WAGE RATES</H4> Many employers, both large and small, will address quality,
liability, and other concerns by having work proposed to be done by "technicians" performed
by industrial hygienists and other comparably  qualified professionals.  In comparison with
the staff technician's wage rate estimate shown, a staff professional's wage rate, including
overhead, may be double; for an external professional consultant, the effective hourly
consulting fee may well be at least triple the technician's wage rate, based on, for example,
surveys of AIHA members' incomes.
<P>
Similar underestimates of time and resources are found in the preamble elements on
implementing the indoor air quality program, such as for the operations and maintenance
program, and ventilation system maintenance workers' training.

<H4>RESOURCE EXPENDITURE</H4> Thus, AIHA believes that the overall resource
expenditure for implementation of the regulation in a technically practical and economically
feasible manner will be more than 10, and, perhaps more than 20 times that estimated.

<H4>LARGE EMPLOYERS</H4> While the largest employers and building owners and
managers may have compiled documentation meeting some of the proposed requirements and
will be able to allocate their compliance plan development and implementation costs over a
larger base of occupied space, they will still have to expend significant resources to meet the
specific requirements of the proposed standard.  OSHA should redouble its efforts to
minimize the paperwork compliance burden on large employers, building owners and
managers, and maximize the utility of the remaining requirements.

<H4>SMALL EMPLOYERS</H4> OSHA should especially consider ways to reduce the
paperwork compliance burden on the smallest employers and building owners and managers. 
For their small buildings or small leased spaces, they will have relatively high costs for plan
development and implementation, measured on an annual cost per square foot basis.  For
example, most small employers do not have building system drawings.  For such employers
in small buildings, these drawings would not generally be of great utility.  Similarly, the
additional information for the indoor air quality compliance program proposed to be retained
if available, should be listed and discussed in a non-mandatory appendix, rather than in the
text of the standard.  In addition, most small employers do not inspect or maintain their
facilities themselves, but contract for such work; they do not get detailed inspection and
maintenance records, and obtaining and retaining such records for at least three years, as
proposed, would be burdensome for them, as it would be for their inspection and
maintenance contractors.

<H4>RESPONSIBILITIES IN MULTI-EMPLOYER FACILITIES</H4> OSHA should
clarify responsibilities among different employers in multi-employer facilities.  OSHA's
explicit proposed inclusion of employers "who control the ventilation or maintenance of
premises...of other employers" is generally reasonable in this standard (par. (b)).  This
technique has limitations, however, as  discussed below, and should be used cautiously; it
should not be applied to other OSHA standards without extremely careful review.  In
particular, even in this standard, it is important to avoid unnecessarily holding liable
employers unable to affect the environmental control practices of other employers, even after
good-faith efforts to do so.  Three hypothetical cases will explore the problems in this area.
<P>
First, emissions from the housekeeping or maintenance activities of one tenant employer in a
facility may result in "hazardous...exposures" (par. (d)(4)) in the space of another tenant
employer, even if the facility's general  ventilation system is operating according to its
intended design and up to original code (par. (d)(1)).  The facility's owner or manager is,
under the expansive proposed definition of "employer," responsible for implementing "the use
of general or local exhaust ventilation" (par. (d)(4)), but may have no means in the lease
contract either to require the emitting tenant to change its work practices, or to renovate the
ventilation system and charge that tenant.
<P>
Second, an employer whose space is receiving "hazardous emissions," but which is unrelated
contractually or by ownership to the emitting employer, typically has no means of resolving
the problem short of relocating or taking legal action against the emitting employer, certainly
burdensome and often unsuccessful approaches.  Should a receiving employer be held in
violation of the indoor air quality standard in such a situation?
<P>
Third, many, if not most, leases give tenants no access to plenum spaces, mechanical spaces,
or mechanical drawings and manuals.  Most tenant employers would be in violation of the
proposed standard unless they could arrange with their lessor to make available the drawings,
manuals and other required information.  Being mandated to obtain this information, when it
is not already provided for in a lease, would place a tenant at a significant negotiating
disadvantage with the lessor.
<P>
AIHA hopes that these three and similar hypothetical cases may help OSHA to develop
precise and appropriately limiting wording in the final standard and guidance on using an
expansive definition of "employer."

<HR>
<H3>MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES</H3>
<H4>PRIVACY OF RECORDS</H4> OSHA should address privacy concerns about
making records, such as of employee complaints (par. (c(5)), available (par. (h)(5)).  It
should address privacy concerns on the transfer of these records when an employer goes out
of business (par. (h)(6)).  The case of not having a successor employer for an employer
which ceases to do business, which is omitted from the proposal, should also be addressed for
both procedural and privacy considerations.

<H4>ASBESTOS</H4> OSHA should also remove the discussion of asbestos
(par. (d)(8)) from this standard.  Asbestos management programs, possibly including
abatement elements, should be covered under OSHA's asbestos standards (29 CFR 1910.1001
or 1926.58).  Requiring encapsulation or removal of unencapsulated friable asbestos materials
in the ventilation system may not, according to EPA studies and policy, always be the most
appropriate response in each building.  In particular, air monitoring should not be used as the
single criterion to determine whether to abate asbestos materials; it is only one piece of
information that can be used in making this decision.

<H4>OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTANTS</H4> OSHA should indicate whether the
"outdoor air pollutants" in its definition of "air contaminants" (par. (b)) include pollutants
and concentrations for which standards have been set under the Clean Air Act.  AIHA is
concerned that employers might be held responsible for addressing national ambient air
quality standards (40 CFR 50) in their indoor air quality compliance programs.  Outdoor air
is taken into buildings, and, when concentrations of these pollutants are above their primary
national ambient air quality standards, they "may cause material impairment to employees"
(par. (b)).  As also discussed above, "outdoor air pollutants" may include those emitted by
other employers over whom a given employer has no control.  OSHA should address these
issues of jurisdictional overlap and of employer responsibility and authority clearly.

<HR>
<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
<H4>CONCLUSION</H4> The American Industrial Hygiene Association supports
OSHA's overall approach to regulating indoor air quality, including environmental tobacco
smoke, but recommends that OSHA address the cautions and suggestions we have provided. 
By doing so, OSHA should be able to promulgate and implement an effective indoor air
quality standard protective of the health of the nation's workers.

<P>
Dear Sir/Madam:<BR>
<P>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) expresses its appreciation to the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for the opportunity to provide
comments on OSHA's proposed indoor air quality standards of April 5, 1994.
<P>
AIHA is the world's largest association of occupational and environmental health
professionals.  The nearly 12,000 members of AIHA come from government, labor, industry,
academia and private business.  AIHA is the most diverse professional association dedicated
solely to the prevention of workplace fatalities, injury and illness.  AIHA's goal is to bring
"good science" and the benefit of its workplace experience to the public policy process
directed at worker health and safety.
<P>
AIHA supports OSHA's overall approach to regulating indoor air quality, including
environmental tobacco smoke.  Whether OSHA promulgates a single, integrated indoor air
quality standard, or two related standards, our view of the substance of OSHA's efforts is the
same.
<P>
If there is anything further our organization can do to assist in this worthwhile effort please
contact me.
<P>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>

<TITLE>AIHA Position on Recommended Criterion for Recording Occupational
Hearing Loss on OSHA Form 300</TITLE>
<HEAD>

<H2><CENTER>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
POSITION STATEMENT ON<BR>
RECOMMENDED CRITERION FOR RECORDING OCCUPATIONAL<BR>
HEARING LOSS ON OSHA FORM 300<BR>
(UPDATE OF 1987 AIHA POSITION ON NOISE)</CENTER></H2>

<HR>

This position statement was prepared by the Noise Committee of the American Industrial
Hygiene Association (AIHA) in response to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's
(OSHA's) request in the <I>Federal Register</I>, dated February 2, 1996, for comment concerning the
issue of appropriate criteria for recording occupational hearing loss on OSHA Form 300
(previously designated Form 200). The committee reaffirms the 1987 AIHA position, which was
at that time also approved by the board of directors of AIHA [Driscoll, DP and Morrill, JC
(1987), "A position paper on a recommended criterion for recording occupational hearing loss on
the OSHA Form 200," AIHAJ 48(11), A-714  A-716].<P>

<B>Recommended criteria for recording hearing shifts on Form 300</B><P>
     
AIHA's recommendation is to record confirmed (i.e., persistent) work-related OSHA
Standard Threshold Shifts (STSs) on Form 300. An STS is defined as a change from the baseline
audiogram of 10 dB or more in the average of thresholds at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz in either
ear, after adjustments for age correction. The mere fact of exposure to TWAs of 85 dB or greater
is <I>not</I> sufficient to confirm that an STS is work related; rather, the complete procedure outlined
on page A-715 of the 1987 position statement should be implemented. Also on page A-715 is
discussion of the importance of recording confirmed 10 dB work-related shifts even though they
may not represent compensable hearing loss.<P>

<B>Specific details regarding recordability of hearing shifts</B><P>

In the 1987 AIHA position, statements were made concerning the requirement for a 30-day
retest and presumption of a persistent STS in the absence of such a retest. Those statements were
based on the OSHA requirements in the Hearing Conservation Amendment pertaining to a retest,
potential notification of the employee concerning any hearing changes, and subsequent follow-up
[29 CFR 1910.95(g)(7)(ii)]. However, in the current OSHA proposal it would appear that all
shifts meeting the OSHA recordability criterion, confirmed or otherwise, are to be recorded on
Form 300, and then later lined-out if found <I>not</I> to be persistent. This urgency in recording shifts,
regardless of confirmation, does not appear justified, and creates additional burdens for the
employer. A more efficient and yet suitably protective and accurate approach is recommended as
follows:<P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Only</I> confirmed (i.e., persistent) work-related STSs are to be recorded on Form 300, unless
a follow-up audiogram is <I>not</I> administered as described in the following bulleted item. The
steps involving confirmation of STS and work relatedness include an optional follow-up
audiogram and the procedures summarized in the following section of this document, which
are described in greater detail on page A-715 of the 1987 position statement.<P>

<LI>If a follow-up audiogram is <I>not</I> administered within 30 days of the initial determination of
   the STS, or if the follow-up audiogram confirms the STS, then the shift is considered
   persistent, and if determined to be work related, must be recorded on Form 300.<P>

<LI>If a follow-up audiogram is given within 30 days of the initial determination of the STS that
   does <I>not</I> confirm the STS, nothing is to be recorded on Form 300.
</UL>
<P>

<B>Clarification regarding current OSHA proposal on work relatedness</B><P>
     
The current OSHA notice of proposed rulemaking appears to make the presumption of work
relatedness whenever an STS is detected, whether or not it is confirmed, as long as the employee
is exposed to TWAs "in excess of 85 dB." The AIHA position does not support this
recommendation, but rather requires confirmation of the persistence of the STS, as well as
consideration of the employee's prior occupational and nonoccupational exposure, evaluation of
calibration records and the audiometric environment, investigation of related activities and
personal medical conditions that could influence thresholds, and age corrections, before a hearing
loss is presumed to be work related. See page A-714 of the 1987 position statement for a
discussion of possible causes of a measured change in hearing, and page A-715 for suggested steps
to follow in the determination of work relatedness.<P>

<B>Procedure for lining-out STSs from Form 300</B><P>

It is widely recognized that many occurrences of STS will be temporary in nature. Therefore,
it is valuable to identify shifts in hearing while they are still temporary, so that follow-up action
can be taken before they become permanent. However, it is inappropriate to record such
temporary shifts as indicative of the occurrence of occupational illness. Furthermore, companies
are usually hesitant to record any incidents on Form 200 (proposed to be Form 300), even if
lining-out the event at a later date is an option. Therefore, the procedures in the preceding sections
are intended to avoid needless recording and line-outs. Despite these efforts, line-outs may be
necessary and should be permitted with the following stipulation:<P>

<UL>
<LI>At the discretion of the reviewing professional, within 15 months of the initial identification
   of the STS, any STSs that are <I>not</I> confirmed by subsequent retesting or otherwise found to
   be <I>not</I> work related, may be lined-out on Form 300. Documentation justifying line-outs must
   be provided and should be retained with the employees' records.
</UL>
<P>

The 15-month time frame was selected since employers are only required to test hearing on
an annual basis, and thus the recommended time frame should provide sufficient opportunity and
leeway to apply the results of a succeeding annual test to the final determination of persistence and
work relatedness.<P>


<B>Response to OSHA queries</B><P>

Implicit in the AIHA position are answers to other of OSHA's questions.<P>
 
<UL> 
<LI>The recommended recording criterion is 10 dB for reasons described in the 1987 AIHA
   position paper and in attachment #2. In brief, AIHA disagrees with OSHA's assertion that
   an extra 5-dB allowance is needed to account for audiometric variability. The AIHA
   guidelines for evaluating work relatedness take audiometric calibration shifts into account;
   such audiometric errors occur infrequently and should be avoided. Random measurement
   variability can be reduced through retesting, and AIHA's recommendation that only persistent
   confirmed shifts be recorded minimizes this problem. It is unfair to allow additional true
   hearing loss among employees in hearing conservation programs with stable data in order to
   account for data deficiencies in poorer programs.<P>
 
<LI>Baselines for Form 300 should either be the original audiogram or the revised baseline [as
   defined in 1910.95(g)(9)]. Although the OSHA criteria for revising baseline audiograms are
   general in nature, allowing a wide latitude of professional judgment, the results of a five-year
   effort of an ad hoc committee of the National Hearing Conservation Association (NHCA,
   March 1996) have recently led to specific consensus professional guidelines for baseline
   revision, that merit consideration.<P>

<LI>Presbycusis corrections should be permitted as described in the 1987 AIHA paper.
</UL>
<P>


<B>Supporting technical information</B><P>

Dr. Julia Royster has applied the calculation procedures of ANSI S3.44-1996 to compute
expected hearing loss resulting from typical occupational noise exposures, and she, along with
Mr. Andrew Stewart, has also analyzed a number of industrial audiometric databases. Their
observations and conclusions (supporting document #2 and #3) substantiate the recommendations
described above.<P>

<CENTER><H2>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
POSITION STATEMENT ON HEALTH CARE REFORM</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
Health Care Reform implies the restructuring of our nation's system of delivering health care
to the population.  Any version of health care reform may affect health care as it applies to
both occupational and non-occupational injuries and illnesses.  To the extent that health care
reform causes any impact on the delivery of occupational health, AIHA has a clear interest to
ensure it is a positive one.
<P>
Within the practical limits wherein AIHA may be able to influence change in health care
reform, two issues emerge as priorities:

<H3>Health Care Reform Should Describe and Endorse a High Priority for Preventive
Health Programs</H3>
In advocating a high priority on funding and facilitating preventive programs in health care
reform, we specifically note the important role of programs which address workplace and
environmental hazards.  Diseases related to these hazards result in significant health care costs
to individuals and society.  Health care reform should include increased funding and
facilitation of programs directed at the occupational health surveillance, maintenance of high
standards of industrial hygiene in all workplaces, and scientific research into environmental
and occupational health and safety.

<H3>Health Care Reform Should Include Proper Definition of Industrial Hygiene and its
Practitioners</H3>
Any version of health care reform has the potential to define health care services and
providers.  Included in those definitions should be the following, taken from 29 CFR
1910.20:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Health Professional"</I> means a physician, occupational
health nurse,
industrial hygienist, toxicologist or epidemiologist, providing medical or other occupational
health services to exposed employees.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Additionally, the following definitions should be incorporated:
<P>
<I>"Industrial Hygiene"</I> is the science and practice devoted to the anticipation,
recognition, evaluation, and control of those environmental factors and stresses arising in or
from the workplace that may cause sickness, impaired health and well-being, or significant
discomfort among workers and may also impact the general community.
<P>
<I>"Industrial Hygienist"</I> is a person having a baccalaureate or graduate degree from
an accredited college or university in industrial hygiene, biology, chemistry, engineering,
physics or a closely related physical or biological science who, by virtue of special studies
and training, has acquired competence in industrial hygiene.  Such special studies and training
must have been sufficient in the above cognate sciences to provide the ability and competency
to (1) anticipate and recognize the environmental factors and stresses associated with work
and work operations and to understand their effects on people and their well-being; (2) to
evaluate, on the basis of training and experience and with the aid of quantitative measurement
techniques, the magnitude of these factors and stresses in terms of their ability to impair
human health and well-being; (3) to prescribe methods to prevent, eliminate, control, or
reduce such factors and stresses and their effects.
<P>
<I>"Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH)"</I> is a person who has received the
designation Certified Industrial Hygienist by the American Board of Industrial Hygiene and
whose certification has not lapsed or been revoked.
<P>
Adopted by Board of Directors:  October 7, 1994<BR>

WHITE PAPER ON TOTAL HUMAN EXPOSURE
</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<H3>I. INTRODUCTION</H3>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) is the world's largest association of
occupational and environmental health professionals concerned with the protection of workers
and the public from chemical, physical and biological health hazards. The industrial hygiene
community has developed the art and science of exposure assessment over decades.  Professional
industrial hygienists have the expertise and knowledge to assist in assessing environmental
contaminant exposures from multiple routes and multiple media.  This document states AIHA's
support of the Total Human Exposure (THE) concept and outlines how AIHA and industrial
hygienists can contribute to its development.
<P>
People can be exposed to environmental hazards through contact with a variety of media, such as
air, water, food and soil.  The contaminants can then enter the body via a single route or any
combination of routes: inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption.  Exposure and body uptake are
ongoing processes that span a lifetime.  Minimizing the resulting health risks requires an
integrated and comprehensive assessment of environmental transport, human exposure and human
uptake.(1)  The concept of Total Human Exposure has been gaining increasing prominence as a
means to achieve this goal.  Early THE proponents postulated a  bubble around the human being,
and any pollutant contacting the conceptual bubble -- either through the air, food, water, or skin
surface -- was considered an exposure.(2)  Summation of the contributions from all of the possible
routes and media provides the total exposure assessment.   Many tools are used in the THE
process(3) including: personal monitoring, human exposure-activity models, micro-environmental
investigations, biological dose evaluation methods, predictive exposure modeling and statistical
analyses.
<P>
The concepts and techniques used in the THE concept are by no means new to the industrial
hygiene profession, which has long been concerned with methods of evaluating different routes
and sources of exposure that may contribute significantly to the total dose of a harmful agent
experienced by an individual.  Exposures to lead, noise, and many pesticides are but a few
examples where industrial hygienists have been concerned with total exposures in the past.

<H3>II.  TOTAL HUMAN EXPOSURE ISSUES</H3>
Recent important and comprehensive developments in THE concepts are of interest to industrial
hygienists. AIHA supports these concepts and their development.  Industrial hygienists should
contribute significantly and encourage developments in this arena.  Major issues include the
following:
<H4>1) INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE CONCEPTS AND METHODS ARE APPLIED IN  TOTAL
HUMAN EXPOSURE ASSESSMENTS</H4>
Exposure assessment has always been a central component of industrial hygiene practice.(4)  The
conceptual approaches, methods, and technology for the evaluation of workplace and
environmental exposures developed by our profession over the past several decades have direct
applicability in THE assessment.  AIHA believes the expertise of industrial hygienists can enhance
THE assessments and therefore encourages industrial hygienist involvement in THE efforts.<BR>

<H4>2) THE DOWNWARD TREND IN WORKPLACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL AIR
CONTAMINANT EXPOSURE LIMITS INCREASINGLY REQUIRES AN INTEGRATED
ACCOUNTING OF ALL EXPOSURE SOURCES</H4>
Permissible workplace air exposure limits are being driven lower by medical and other scientific 
discoveries, by changing tolerance for the effects of health stressors, and by regulatory action. 
This trend is unlikely to diminish in the future.  Already, for many agents, workplace air exposure
levels may approach nonoccupational exposure levels. As workplace permissible air exposure
standards shift downward, the exposures from other sources may contribute a greater proportion
of the total dose.  Thus, a total accounting of dose via all media and exposure routes becomes
even more important.
<P>
The shift in the United States toward a service economy is dramatically changing the character of workplaces.  People increasingly work in office-like environments, with a spectrum of exposures that are much closer to nonoccupational exposures than is the case in the remaining more industrial workplaces.  The explosion in research, concern and activity regarding indoor air quality in the past decade is a reflection of these changes, and is closely connected to the development of THE concepts.(5)  Industrial hygienists have been and will continue to be very active in the resolution of indoor air quality issues.
<P>
AIHA supports application of THE principles to provide the integrated occupational and
nonoccupational exposure data needed to better derive total dose assessments as occupational and nonoccupational exposure values converge. AIHA further encourages studies to evaluate worker and total family exposures as part of a comprehensive agent exposure assessment, evaluation, and risk management program.<BR>

<H4>3) TOTAL HUMAN EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT IS AN APPROPRIATE TOOL FOR
IMPROVING RISK EVALUATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT</H4>
Exposure assessment provides critical data for assessing the population health risks of exposure to environmental contaminants.  Adequate risk evaluation and  risk management decisions both
hinge on adequate exposure assessments.  THE is an important conceptual development since it
provides techniques for ascertaining the magnitude and variations in worker and public exposures. 
THE provides the techniques for capturing and considering the total exposures to environmental
contaminants and the variability of those exposures.  These aspects are important considerations
in risk evaluation and risk management processes.  AIHA strongly supports the use of THE
techniques in exposure assessments used for population health risk evaluations and risk
management.<BR>

<H4>4) QUALITY ASSURANCE IS IMPORTANT IN TOTAL HUMAN EXPOSURE     ASSESSMENTS</H4>
Total Human Exposure assessments generate data that may have wide application in risk
evaluation and risk management.  Good Exposure Assessment Practices have been published(6), which reinforce the need for quality assurance of the data and techniques in all exposure
assessments, including THE.  The quality assurance process should include evaluation of the
potential inaccuracies, uncertainties and confidence intervals, so that the validity of the result is
understood.  AIHA endorses use of certified laboratories for any analytical measurements.  AIHA
further supports application and/or development of quality assurance procedures for the
mathematical simulation (modeling) aspects and other components of THE assessments.<BR>

<H4>5) INFORMATION AND DATA USED IN TOTAL HUMAN EXPOSURE
ASSESSMENTS REQUIRE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT </H4>
While the techniques of THE have evolved and improved sources of applicable data are more
readily available(7), a need remains for more measured data on the contributions of dermal, food, water, soil, home and other nonoccupational sources of exposure.  In addition, time-activity data associated with measured occupational and nonoccupational exposure data are needed.  AIHA supports the development of these data and stands ready to contribute its vast expertise in
exposure assessment strategies, methods and technology to meet these goals.
<P>
One immediate need is to address the concern of home contamination by materials inadvertently
brought in from the workplace, potentially resulting in exposures to spouses and children.  Such
contamination is part of the broad range of total human exposures, and the participation of
industrial hygienists will be needed to address it effectively.<BR>

<H4>6) TOTAL HUMAN EXPOSURE, AS WELL AS RISK EVALUATION, RISK    MANAGEMENT AND RISK COMMUNICATION REQUIRES FURTHER RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT</H4>
Further development is needed for both the Total Human Exposure techniques and for the  use of THE in risk evaluation, risk management and risk communication.(3,8)  AIHA supports efforts to provide answers to such related areas, examples of which are:
<UL>
<LI>The role of individual susceptibility factors.  Health status, age, and genetic factors are
among those that may alter disease susceptibility.  These variables need to be considered in the
population-based health risk assessments. 
<P>
<LI>The role of multiple agent exposures.  Generally, little is known about the health effects of
multiple agent exposures, especially when different target organs or different mechanisms of
action are involved.  Risk evaluations are typically done for a single agent.  As exposure levels to a given agent decrease due to occupational and environmental controls, the relative effects of
combined agent exposures may become more relevant.
<P>
<LI>The application of physiological media-based measures of exposure.  Biological   exposure indices (BEIs) provide guidance on the acceptable limits for contaminants or their
metabolites in physiological media such as urine or blood.  BEIs are available for relatively few
agents.  Yet, physiological media-based measures may provide a better approach for determining the total dose to the receptor than will air concentrations or the integrated THE.  AIHA encourages further development of biological media-based measures of total dose in assessments of total exposure and encourages continuing development of BEIs.
<P>
<LI>The use of multiple conservative assumptions, default exposure scenarios, and  physico-chemical data.  In THE mathematical simulations and analyses, techniques have emerged to
evaluate the propagating effects resulting from multiple conservative assumptions on factors such as exposure intensity, exposure duration and exposure population numbers.9  Also, default
exposure scenarios may be easily modified to better capture the typical ranges and variability of
human exposures.  Data on physico-chemical process such as environmental persistence, bio-accumulation and degradation may now be considered more easily.  AIHA recognizes the need
for and supports further development of these and other good science principles in all THE
aspects.
<P>
<LI> Enhancement of Communication of risks.  Informing workers and the public about the risks
they encounter should be part of the exposure assessment/risk assessment plan.  THE can provide a better understanding of all aspects of worker and public exposure to workplace and
environmental contaminants and thus provide a basis for enhancing risk communication.
Successful approaches for risk communication that have evolved in recent years should be used.  Industrial hygienists have traditionally had major responsibilities and experience in hazard   communication and risk communication and are thus well-equipped to participate in the risk
communication process.  AIHA endorses its members' involvement in these efforts.
</UL>   

<H3>III.  CONCLUSIONS</H3>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association's mission involves the protection of worker and
public health through the anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control of environmental
hazards.  AIHA recognizes the importance of Total Human Exposure in fulfilling its mission and
therefore endorses both further research and wider application of  THE.  AIHA believes THE can
have a significant and positive role in our society's efforts to improve public health and the
environment.  AIHA further believes its membership provides unique capabilities in exposure
assessment and supports its members' further involvement in THE research and THE
applications.<BR>

<TITLE>Generic Exposure Assessment Standard</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<CENTER><H2>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
WHITE PAPER ON A GENERIC EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT STANDARD</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<H3>I. Introduction.</H3>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) is the largest international association
of occupational and environmental health professionals concerned with the protection of
workers and members of the community from workplace related hazards.  The industrial
hygiene community has developed the art and science of exposure assessment over decades. 
Professional industrial hygienists have the expertise and knowledge to assist in development
of a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Generic Exposure
Assessment Standard (GEAS).  As such, the AIHA supports the adoption of a performance
oriented GEAS to protect all workers from workplace exposure to biological, chemical and
physical hazards.
<P>
A performance oriented approach to a GEAS will encourage innovative and effective
assessments, minimize the duplication of existing government regulations, and ensure that
limited resources are most efficiently utilized to recognize, evaluate, and control hazardous
workplace exposures.  Exposure assessments incorporate many quality assurance practices
which provide a foundation for "continuous improvement".  A GEAS will promote good
industrial hygiene practices by complementing hazard communication activities and by
fostering the systematic evaluation of health risks.  
<P>
A GEAS would provide the elements and criteria for establishing effective occupational health
programs that would address specific health hazards.  Assessment strategies with performance
criteria will provide the basis for reviewing and auditing programs with all interest parties.
<H3>II.  Issues.</H3>
<EM>AIHA supports use of generic exposure assessment strategies to develop specific
employer programs that identify, evaluate and control biological, chemical and physical
hazards in the workplace.</EM>
<P>
OSHA has promulgated only a few substance specific standards, and there are no exposure
assessment requirements for more than 400 substances with permissible exposure limits and
thousands of other commercial substances.  AIHA believes a performance based GEAS will
lead to the anticipation, identification, evaluation, and control of many currently
unrecognized or un-evaluated health hazards in the workplace.  The goals of generic exposure
assessment strategies are to:
<OL>
<LI>Assess exposures of all workers and the community to all hazardous biological,
chemical and physical agents to determine the priority for response to further assess or
control the workplace hazards.
<P>
<LI> Gather qualitative and quantitative information to determine the acceptability,
un-acceptability, or uncertainty of workers exposures;
<P>
<LI>Perform exposure monitoring to evaluate uncertain exposures, collect baseline data,
perform compliance monitoring, assess the adequacy of control measures, and research the
harmful effects of workplace exposures;
<P>
<LI>Implement control plans to correct unacceptable worker exposures;
<P>
<LI>Document assessments, decision making, outcomes and the recommendations of
exposure assessment programs.
</OL>
<EM>AIHA supports utilization of professional judgment and good exposure assessment
practices by qualified professionals to design assessment programs and interpret exposure
assessment information.</EM>
<OL>
<LI>Basic Characterization - Qualitative and quantitative information is compiled during
basic characterizations of the workplace.  On-site surveys are necessary when assessing
various workplace factors which impact worker exposures.  The information includes
inventories of hazardous biological, chemical and physical agents, descriptions of processes,
operations, jobs/tasks, routes of exposure and control measures that impact worker exposures. 
In the case of chemical agents, possible routes of exposure include inhalation, skin
absorption, ingestion and injection.  If available, historical exposure data should be reviewed.
<P>
When assessing the potential exposures it is often efficient to assign workers to groups, based
upon jobs/tasks that share common determinants of exposure, i.e. same and/or similar job
functions and exposure conditions.  The assignment of workers to similar exposure groups
must be made using information gathered during the basic characterization.  Methods should
be described to verify the validity of worker groups.  In practice, worker groups may contain
one individual or many people with similar exposures.
<P>
When workers are initially assigned to exposure groups; they should not be considered a
"homogeneous" exposure groups (HEG).  Strictly speaking a HEG is a group in which every
worker experiences the same distribution of exposures.  Exposure assessment strategies can
employ monitoring and statistical methods to determine if worker groups are valid HEGs.
<P>
<LI>Qualitative Exposure Assessment and Prioritization - Information collected during the
basic haracterization of the workplace is reviewed to initially determine the acceptability of
worker exposures.  Priorities are established for obtaining additional information to clarify if
the exposure is acceptable or not; or for controlling unacceptable exposures.  Exposure
assessment programs should define criteria to determine when monitoring is needed (e.g.,
exposures may be approaching some fraction of the occupational exposure limit).  The
reasons for deciding not to perform exposure monitoring should also be documented.
<P>
<LI>Exposure Monitoring - Quantitative measurements are performed to characterize the
magnitude and variability of worker exposures that cannot be adequately assessed using
qualitative information.  Exposure monitoring is performed to evaluate workplace controls,
establish baseline data, ensure regulatory compliance, and inform management and workers.
Exposure monitoring programs should specify AIHA accredited laboratories, validated
sampling and analytical methods, and appropriate occupational exposure limits (OEL).  The
monitoring criteria should identify the minimum number of samples and length of sampling
period to characterize worker groups.  Monitoring programs must also determine the need for
specific sampling recommendations or random selection of workers and sample time periods. 
Workers are often stratified into exposure groups before individuals are randomly selected for
monitoring.
<P>
Typically, industrial hygienists utilize professional judgment to arrange workers in similar
exposure groups and to interpret the monitoring results.  Monitoring results are compared to
OELs with appropriate averaging times and clear statistical definitions of over-exposure based
upon toxicological determinants.  The results of exposure monitoring may apply to other
workers, depending upon the exposure determinants and overall uncertainty of the sampling
and analytical methodology.
<P>
<LI>Interpretation and Decision Making - Information from basic characterizations,
qualitative exposure assessments, and exposure monitoring programs are evaluated to
determine the acceptability of worker exposures.
<P>
<LI>Recommendations and Reporting - Exposure assessment strategies, performance
criteria for decision making, and the conclusions and recommendations are documented. 
Information should be disseminated to the affected worker and other parties with a need to
know.  Assessment records should be retained for future reference and readily accessible to
all affected workers, labor representatives, managers, regulators and other interested parties
with a need to know.
<P>
<LI>Re-evaluation - Worker exposures should be re-assessed periodically to ensure that
changes in workplace conditions do not create unacceptable worker exposures.  The
frequency of re-evaluation should be specified.  Foremost, the level of exposure may
determine the frequency of re-evaluation.  In addition, re-evaluation may be triggered by the
introduction of new hazardous materials, modification of workplace controls, changes in
process conditions or work practices, or new toxicology information or regulatory standards.
</OL>
<EM>AIHA supports development of criteria that specify who may design assessment
programs and interpret exposure information.  Professional industrial hygienists are uniquely
educated, skilled and experienced in this critical role.</EM>
<P>
For many decades, industrial hygienists have anticipated, identified, evaluated and controlled
workplace hazards.  Professional industrial hygienists are uniquely qualified by virtue of
education, skills and experience to:  1) manage exposure assessment programs, 2) perform
exposure assessments, 3) conduct exposure monitoring, and 4) determine the acceptability of
workplace exposures and adequacy of workplace controls.
<P>
The qualifications of a professional industrial hygienists include a technical baccalaureate
and/or graduate degree(s) in a relevant scientific or engineering discipline; and the skills and
experience to: 1) anticipate and recognize workplace hazards and their effect on people and
their well-being, 2) evaluate on the basis of experience and quantitative measurement
techniques the potential for adverse effects on peoples' health and well-being, and 3)
recommend methods to eliminate, or control these stressors when necessary.  In addition, the
AIHA strongly urges professional industrial hygienists to seek certification by the American
Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH) as recognition and confirmation of their qualifications.
<P>
The participation of other technically knowledgeable professionals such as chemists,
engineers, toxicologists physicians, etc. will facilitate exposure assessment programs and
improve the quality of assessments.  The guidance of professional industrial hygienists is
essential to ensure the accuracy and quality of exposure assessment programs.  The
interaction of industrial hygienists with other technical and health professionals will enhance
worker protection and the effective implementation of a GEAS.
<P>
<EM>AIHA supports utilization of AIHA accredited laboratories and validated
sampling/analytical methods.</EM>
<P>
The AIHA's Laboratory Accreditation Program (LAP) is specifically designed for laboratories
involved in analyzing samples for the purpose of evaluating workplace exposures. 
Participation in the AIHA LAP enables a laboratory to maintain the highest possible standards
of accuracy.  The AIHA administers the Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) program which
is a round-robin program that assists laboratories in improving their analytical performance by
testing the effectiveness of the methods used.  The Bulk Quality Assurance Program which is
a quarterly round robin testing program for bulk building materials that contain asbestos. 
The Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing program (ELPAT) provides
laboratories with quarterly samples containing lead in various matrices.
<P>
<EM>AIHA supports development of appropriate and clear statistical definitions of
occupational exposure limits based upon credible toxicological properties.</EM>
<P>
Occupational exposure limits (OELs) for hazardous agents are important criteria for exposure
assessments.  Organizations which recommend OELs (e.g., OSHA, ACGIH, NIOSH, AIHA,
companies, etc.) should provide statistical definitions based upon the agents' toxic properties. 
Clear statistical definitions of over-exposure will minimize error and confusion, and promote
consistency in exposure assessments.  Uncertainty regarding these values should be identified
in qualitative or quantitative terms.

<TITLE>AIHA Position on Risk Assessment</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2><CENTER>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
POSITION STATEMENT ON RISK ASSESSMENT</CENTER></H2>
<HR>                                
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) supports the use of human health risk
assessment techniques in regulatory decision making, the making of public  health policy, and 
in the allocation  of government resources to environmental issues.  Risk assessment should be
conducted with the best available scientific data.  In the absence of scientific data, AIHA
supports the use of health protective but reasonable default values which are selected using
well-defined principles.  
<P>
AIHA position with respect to the practice of human health risk assessment:
<P>
<B>1.</B>   AIHA believes that human health risk assessments should be conducted with the best available scientific data, and that uncertainties and known biases should be identified in the assessment.
<P>
<B>2.</B>   AIHA supports the  specification of health protective default inputs (assumptions) as the only feasible approach to conducting risk assessments in the absence of scientific data.  Principles for the selection of these defaults must be well-defined. 
<P>
<B>3.</B>   AIHA supports the use of an iterative approach to the assessment process in which relatively simple techniques are used initially to identify the potential magnitude of the health risk, followed by more sophisticated analyses as needed.  The conduct of increasingly sophisticated analysis should not preclude public health intervention where warranted.  
<P>
<B>4.</B>   AIHA supports the calculation and presentation of risk assessment results that include an
assessment of uncertainty with a narrative describing the rationale and assumptions used.  Quantitative uncertainty assessment in terms of probability distributions (i.e., central tendency, and upper and lower limits) or qualitative characterization of uncertainty should be presented, depending on the type and complexity of the risk assessment, and the data available.  Single point estimates with no characterization of uncertainty are unacceptable.  
<P>
<B>5.</B>   AIHA believes that the risk assessment process should be accessible, and that presentation
of results should be understandable, to all stakeholders, including those with alternative hypotheses and conclusions.
<P>
<B>6.</B>   AIHA endorses the concept that risk assessment should be comprehensive and accountable in its approach and include all of the potentially exposed populations (including sensitive persons) or ecosystems.
<P>
<B>7.</B>   AIHA supports the use of risk comparisons in risk analysis and communication only when the risks being compared have similar characteristics. 
<P>
AIHA encourages the following to support the development of the practice of human health
risk assessment:
<P>
<B>1.</B>   AIHA encourages the financial support of activities associated with the development and refinement of epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science to reduce the uncertainty and bias in health risk assessment, thereby increasing its utility for regulatory decision making, the making of public health policy, and in the allocation of governmental resources.
<P>
<B>2.</B>   AIHA supports the empowerment of expert advisory panels (including stakeholders, regulatory authorities, and representatives from labor, industry, academia, and professional/technical organizations) to assist in the development of  risk assessment guidelines and criteria.  These guidelines will be used to identify and highlight key areas requiring further research and regulation.
<P>

<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
The American Association of Occupational Health Nurses, American College of Occupational
and Environmental Medicine, American Industrial Hygiene Association, American Society of
Safety Engineers and National Society of Professional Engineers, the professional organizations
representing the majority of occupational health and safety professionals, have a particular
interest in the outcome of any legislation to reform the Occupational Safety and Health Act of
1970.<P>

Both HR 1834 and S 1423 contain provisions to allow exemption from routine health and safety
inspections by OSHA if the workplace has been reviewed and certified by a third party as having
a sound health and safety program.  We offer the following suggestions and revisions to these
bills:<P>

<B>1</B> Congress should specify that third-party workplace health and safety reviews be
conducted only by qualified individuals.  The legislation should identify the minimum
qualifications necessary for an individual to be recognized as qualified to conduct such
workplace reviews.<P>

<B>2</B> OSHA should not be in the business of "certifying" individuals to conduct workplace
reviews.  OSHA-approved national private sector organizations should credential third-party
workplace health and safety reviewers.  OSHA was not created to be a credentialing body and it
is unreasonable to establish a new taxpayer-financed bureaucracy when the private sector has
traditionally operated effective professional credentialing programs.  Oversight and approval of
private sector credentialing programs by OSHA should be sufficient to ensure that recognized
programs meet minimum standards in assessing individual competency.<P>

<B>3</B> States with OSHA operating plans should also recognize individuals qualified and
recognized by federal OSHA.  State plans should not be allowed to adopt qualifications that are
any more or less stringent than those established by Congress. <P>

<B>4</B> Any program and standards for conducting third-party workplace health and safety
reviews, including minimum standards for qualified reviewers, should be developed in
cooperation with professionals serving on the front line of health and safety.  Therefore, we
recommend the legislation specify that the program and regulations shall be developed in
consultation with an appointed advisory committee that includes all the relevant
stakeholders.<P>

Our organizations support Congress in researching programs that will better protect worker
health and safety.  We offer our assistance in any way possible.<P>

The above organizations have a particular interest in the outcome of any legislation that would
reform the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.  While the individual organizations have
views on many sections of the legislation, as a group our mutual concern pertains to Section 4 of
HR 1834, and Section 4 of S 1423, containing provisions to allow exemption from routine health
and safety inspections by OSHA if the workplace has been reviewed and certified by a third
party as having a sound health and safety program.<P>

Membership of our organizations represents the majority of occupational health and safety
professionals who would be involved in conducting any workplace review option.  As
professionals who now serve on the "front line" to promote and protect the health and safety of
our nation's workers, we offer the following suggestions and revisions to these bills:<P>

<B>1</B> Congress should specify that third-party workplace health and safety reviews be
conducted only by qualified individuals.  As such, we believe the legislation should identify the
minimum qualifications necessary for an individual to be recognized as qualified to conduct such
workplace reviews.  Legislative language should be more specific to state that <B> "uniform
minimum standards shall be developed for recognizing individuals qualified to conduct
workplace reviews for health, safety, or both, provided such reviews are within their area of
expertise.  When developing such standards, the Secretary shall consider the following
recognized and/or certified individuals as qualified, so long as the individuals meet the minimum
educational, training and experience criteria that are developed and approved by the Advisory
Board and the Secretary: </B><P>

<B>a)  an individual licensed by a State authority in a profession or occupation in which the
scope of practice, as defined by State law, includes health, safety, or both;<P>

b)  an individual certified in an occupational health and/or safety field by an organization whose
certification program has been accredited by a nationally recognized private sector accreditation
organization or by OSHA; or<P>

c)  an individual who is recognized and/or certified in an occupational health and/or safety field,
and whose recognition and/or certification has been recognized by federal or state statute or
regulation.</B><P>

Since effective reviews of some workplaces will require a team approach, the statute should
recognize that different individuals may provide expertise in particular areas of occupational
health and safety in the review process.<P>


<B>2</B> We believe the legislation should specify that OSHA not be in the business of
"certifying" individuals to conduct workplace reviews.  Instead, OSHA-approved national
private sector organizations should credential third-party workplace health and safety reviewers. 
OSHA was not created to be a credentialing body and it is unreasonable to establish a new
taxpayer-financed bureaucracy when the private sector has traditionally operated effective
professional credentialing programs.<P>

Utilization of national, private sector third-party programs would enable OSHA to work directly
with organizations and state governments, as opposed to OSHA approving or disapproving
individual applications itself.  Finally, private sector recognition allows OSHA to be more cost
effective, while providing employers with access to well educated, experienced and trained
professionals.<P>

Many private sector organizations offer training and certification programs and provide
individuals who have completed such training or complied with certification requirements a
credential that verifies completion.  Some of these organizations have established credentials that
individuals can readily obtain merely by paying a fee.  These credentials do not truly document
the necessary skills to conduct health and safety reviews. Accordingly, we support legislative
language that would allow <B>"OSHA to serve in an oversight role to any private sector
credentialing program or to delegate such responsibility to a national private sector accreditation
organization".</B>  Oversight and approval of private sector credentialing programs by OSHA
should be sufficient to ensure that recognized programs meet minimum standards in assessing
individual competency and that quality control is maintained.<P>

There is agreement that the organizations representing our professions are well suited to conduct
such programs.  It is our suggestion that the Secretary should approve national organizations of
occupational health and safety professionals, including those representing industrial hygienists,
occupational health nurses, occupational health physicians, safety professionals and/or other
nationally recognized occupational health and safety professions to credential individuals to
conduct workplace reviews, provided such credentialing meets the criteria prescribed by the
Secretary."<P>


<B>3</B> We believe the legislation should specify that states with OSHA operating plans
should also recognize individuals qualified and recognized by federal OSHA through a third
party mechanism.  State plans should not be allowed to adopt qualifications that are any more or
less stringent than those established by Congress.  Allowing state plans to be even more
restrictive than the Congressional intent will result in a plethora of qualifications criteria that
would make the program difficult to carry out and undoubtedly result in a reduction in the
number of qualified individuals able to conduct workplace reviews.<P>

To further alleviate the possibility of each state developing a unique program, and to maximize
potential utility of the third party review option, Congress should direct that  <B>"the Secretary
shall develop model guidelines to encourage states, in lieu of establishing separate qualification
requirements, to delegate credentialing responsibilities to private sector organizations approved
by federal OSHA so as to ensure a uniform program."</B><P>

<B>4</B> We believe that any program and standards for conducting third-party workplace
health and safety reviews, including minimum standards for qualified reviewers, should be
developed in cooperation with professionals serving on the front line of health and safety. 
Therefore, we recommend the legislation specify that  <B>"the program and regulations shall be
developed in consultation with an appointed advisory committee.  The advisory committee shall
be composed of representatives from each occupational health and safety discipline including,
but not limited to, industrial hygienists, occupational health nurses, occupational health
physicians, safety professionals and professional engineers, as well as representatives from labor
and management.  The perspective of both small and large businesses should be represented on
the committee.</B><P>

The Advisory Committee and OSHA should be charged with recommending program standards
stringent enough to protect the health and safety of employees of businesses that elect to
participate in the third-party workplace health and safety review program.<P>

In addition to developing the specifics of the overall workplace review program, the Advisory
Committee should be charged with recommending the criteria to be prescribed by the Secretary
for minimal educational, training and experience standards for those individuals deemed
qualified to serve as third-party reviewers.  Individuals meeting the minimum qualification
standards should have demonstrated knowledge and experience in recognizing and correcting
real-world health and safety concerns.  The minimum standards should also recognize that
thorough workplace reviews will sometimes require a team approach, with different individuals
providing expertise in particular areas of occupational health and safety.<P>


There are additional issues that deserve serious discussion but we believe these can be, and
should be, addressed within the advisory committee.  Our organizations support Congress in
researching programs that will better protect worker health and safety.  We offer our assistance in
any way possible.<P>

<H1>Laboratory Health and Safety Papers (81-86)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>81. Laboratory Chemical Co-Mingling for Cost-Effective Disposal: Reap 
the Benefits While Avoiding the Hazards.</H2> 
<B>K. Reinbach</B>, University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI<P>
Laboratory hazardous waste management is often very complex and expensive, 
because laboratories generate a bewildering array of hazardous chemicals for 
disposal.  One can pour liquids into a closed head drum for bulk disposal.  
There are potential risks involved in chemical commingling, however.  
Opening and pouring bottles of volatile liquids can result in personnel 
exposure to these chemicals.  Not considering the compatibility of the 
chemicals to be mixed can result in dangerous chemical reactions in the 
receiving drum.  A strange and poorly characterized mixture may be rejected 
by your disposal vendor, or might be acceptable only after paying costly 
chemical analysis of a sample.  To avoid these pitfalls, many institutions 
choose to hire a contractor to "Lab-Pack" each container of surplus 
chemicals that they generate.<P>
The long-standing solvent waste management program of a large research 
university in the Midwestern U.S. is presented, with particular emphasis on 
the features that allow us to reap the benefits of bulk disposal while 
avoiding the pitfalls of personnel exposure, incompatibility reactions, and 
excessive analysis expense.  Over the many years of experience commingling 
solvents, we have learned lessons and overcome problems inherent in mixing 
chemicals for bulk disposal.<P>
Features of our program that allow us to safely commingle our solvent 
wastestream into bulk drums for shipment include generator information and 
knowledge of wastestream, pre-bulking in five gallon carboys, and a vacuum 
transfer system for filling drums at our storage facility.<P>
The decision to commingle chemicals for disposal shipment should be 
carefully considered to anticipate and control the possible inherent hazards 
involved.  However, it can be done safely if done carefully, and one can 
attain considerable disposal cost savings.

<H2>82. Improving Laboratory Safety Through a Chemical Reuse Program.</H2> 
<B>J. Palmer</B>, A. Dunnick, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, 
CA<P>
Control and reduction of hazardous materials are desirable goals in most 
safety programs, but can be difficult to effect at large academic or 
commercial research institutions.  Diversity within the research population 
and a laboratory subculture that emphasizes thrift and independence can 
further exacerbate the problems in overall institutional management of 
hazardous materials. Chemicals tend to accumulate over time in such settings 
and can lead to dangerous conditions and situations where regulatory or fire 
code imposed limits are exceeded.  Consolidating excess or infrequently used 
chemicals from individual research laboratories into a facility designed to 
house, handle, and distribute  hazardous materials offers clear management 
benefits.  A chemical reuse facility was developed on a limited budget to 
explore potential benefits in safety management and hazardous waste 
reduction.  Over the period of 18 months, nearly 5000 chemicals were gleaned 
from research and teaching laboratory shelves stocks by way of voluntary 
donation to the reuse facility.  Appropriate data management tools were 
developed to make the inventory electronically accessible to potential users 
of the stock of materials.  Costs of creating and organizing the facility 
have been kept as low as possible (&lt;$10,000) and managing the facility 
has turned out to be relatively easy.  The local research community has 
shown a very positive response to the facility. The major benefits to the 
safety program have been reduction in hazardous waste disposal costs and 
reduced stockpiling of hazardous materials in individual research and 
teaching labs.  A somewhat unexpected benefit of the chemical reuse program 
has been a more positive and cooperative attitude by the research community 
toward health and safety issues.

<H2>83. Peroxidizable Chemical Safety: A Critical Review of the Literature.</H2>
<B>R. Kelly</B>, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA<P>
Many chemicals commonly used in research and industry form "adventitious" 
peroxides by the process of autoperoxidation.  Although ethers are the most 
notorious chemicals in this regard, at least a dozen other chemical moieties 
are subject to autoperoxidation.  Peroxides are unstable and may explode if 
present in adequate concentration.  Explosions and injuries have been 
attributed to accidents involving peroxidized chemicals.<P>
Chemical safety programs often include provisions for the storage, use, 
testing, and disposal of peroxidizable organic chemicals.  As OSHA has no 
specific requirements for peroxidizable chemicals, these programs are based 
on consensus guidelines and recommendations.  However, readily available 
guidelines are deficient in the following ways: None of these sources is 
comprehensive, making it necessary to acquire several references to identify 
all potentially hazardous peroxidizable chemicals; many references fail to 
list common peroxidizable chemicals such as 2-propanol and 2-butanol; almost 
all sources disagree with respect to fundamental elements such as permitted 
storage time; most references present peroxide detection and removal methods 
which are not effective against higher peroxide reaction products 
(cycloperoxides, polyperoxides); and, finally, virtually all references 
recommend a safe peroxide concentration limit which is based on historical 
limits of detection, not empirical testing.  The recommended peroxide limit 
appears to be at least an order of magnitude too conservative.<P>
The literature is discussed with special reference to the shortcomings 
identified above. Comprehensive lists of peroxidizable chemicals derived 
from many sources are presented.  The hazards of common secondary alcohols 
is reviewed.  The range of storage recommendations is presented and the 
limitations of common detection and deperoxidation methods are critically 
reviewed.  Recommendations for future research to establish a science-based 
limit for adventitious peroxides are offered.

<H2>84. VAV/Manifolded Exhaust System Issues and Observations.</H2> 
<B>M. Austin</B>, N. Carlson, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN<P>
Manifolded, Variable Air Volume (VAV) ventilation systems are being 
aggressively sold as the best solution to providing safe and efficient 
ventilation for laboratories and other similar industrial occupancies.  The 
question is whether the system can or will deliver on its promise.  We will 
briefly discuss the engineering theory upon which these systems are based 
and then compare four "real world" installations with initial expectations.<P>
Minimization of energy consumption while assuring safe air quality is the 
central rationale for installing manifolded VAV laboratory exhaust systems.  
A functioning system minimizes the total exhausted air flow while providing 
adequate contaminant control and a comfortable physical environment.  
Another theoretical benefit of a manifolded VAV system is its flexibility; 
it should accommodate additional exhaust devices or changed devices without 
requiring extensive mechanical remodeling or rebalancing.  Ideally, the 
product should be economical and reliable while providing flexibility to 
accommodate future needs.<P>
VAV systems include sophisticated controls to integrate information from 
many flow, pressure, temperature, and humidity measuring stations.  There 
are currently two basic types of VAV systems on the market.  In a VAV 
system, the supply air volume must adjust uniformly and simultaneously with 
exhaust volumes.  Volumetric flow is determined by comfort requirements of 
the space (temperature or humidity) or the volume demands of local exhaust 
devices in use. Additionally, minimum system set points are required to 
assure an adequate number of room air changes.<P>
We have found the path from theory to an installed product to be full of 
pitfalls and other obstacles.  Coordination among the users, designers, 
construction manager, equipment vendors, and installers is extremely 
difficult.  Hopefully, our experience can be used by others to achieve 
satisfactory results or avoid expensive failures.

<H2>85. Toxic Gas Hazard Assessment and Control Strategies in the Research 
Laboratory.</H2> 
<B>R. Hanselka</B>, Advanced Industrial Design, Inc., Danville,VA; R. 
Grayson, D. Vandenberg, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa 
Barbara, CA<P>
Toxic gases are commonly used in university laboratories.  They are highly 
portable, readily available and potentially lethal.  The requirements for 
handling, storage, and use of these materials is highly regulated.  The 
regulations though are complex and confusing, and attempting to assess the 
practical implications of the use of these materials can be daunting.  The 
industrial hygienist must deal with an array of considerations, including 
the toxicity of the pure material, its concentration, carrier gases, and 
potential rate of release.  Secondary hazards such as flammability, 
explosivity, and corrosivity must be considered.  Hazard assessment 
processes are numerous in the chemical process industry.  The use of gases 
in the semiconductor industry is quite standardized.  Universities are far 
less familiar with standard industry practice, and have far more variable 
processes and procedures.  Programs are few and difficult to enforce.  
Evaluation of hazards needs to be systematic and defensible.  The Material 
Hazard Index approach considers the primary relevant properties of the toxic 
gases in use.  The nature of the use in the laboratory is considered.  Code 
requirements are assessed in a context of practical laboratory applications. 
Hazards are reviewed from receipt and storage through delivery to the lab, 
transportation through buildings, the training of users, gas delivery 
systems, gas cabinets, selection of manifold systems, and other aspects.  
Lecture bottles pose unique hazards due to their size and portability.  A 
design resolution for this issue, a fume hood based mini-manifold system, is 
described.

<H2>86. Design and Implementation of a Laboratory Toxic Gas Handling System 
for an Academic Chemistry Building.</H2> 
<B>D. Vandenberg</B>, R, Grayson, University of California, Santa Barbara, 
CA<P>
Storage and use of toxic gases are strictly regulated by applicable fire 
code restrictions.  The University of California, Santa Barbara has designed 
and built a facility-wide, toxic gas handling, monitoring and alarm system 
into its new chemistry building.  Although toxic gas handling systems are 
common in specialized semi-conductor labs and clean rooms, this system may 
be unique in its application to an entire facility housing generic chemistry 
research and teaching laboratories.<P>
The systems accommodate usage of 20 different toxic gases in five 
independent lab spaces, with infrastructure for future expansion. Lab areas 
were outfitted for gas handling and monitoring at fume hoods, gas cabinets, 
and at large pieces of unventilated lab equipment such as lasers.  Fume 
hoods were equipped with gas manifolds to accommodate lecture bottle size 
cylinders.  Measures were taken to reduce the likelihood of false alarms 
during routine hood usage with other chemicals.  Due to the wide variety of 
gases involved, two separate, commercially available gas detection systems 
were employed: 1) a colorimetric system based on the interaction of air 
samples with chemically sensitive tapes; 2) a system based on an 
electrochemical sensor head in the laboratory.  Either detection system, or 
code-required emergency pull stations, can initiate local or building-wide 
alarms; automatic gas cylinder shut-down; and automatic call-outs to the 
campus hazardous materials team.  An integrated training programs was 
established for gas users and emergency response personnel.

<TITLE>AIHA White Paper on Risk Assessment</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2><CENTER>AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION<BR>
WHITE PAPER ON RISK ASSESSMENT</CENTER></H2>
<HR>                                
The AIHA supports the use of human health risk assessment techniques in regulatory
decision making, the making of public  health policy, and  in the allocation  of government
resources to environmental issues.  Risk assessment should be conducted with the best
available scientific data.  In the absence of scientific data, AIHA supports the use of health
protective but reasonable default values which are selected using well-defined principles.  
<P>
AIHA believes that when properly conducted, risk assessment is a valuable tool for identifying
the nature and magnitude  of health risks arising from a variety of sources  in  the workplace and the
environment.  Health risk assessment techniques can be effectively used to identify populations at
highest risk and describe the nature of these risks and how they arise (e.g.,  identify activities
associated with highest risks, indicate the dominant routes of exposure).  A clearer understanding of
the nature and magnitude of health risks can improve regulatory decision and policy making and
support the appropriate allocation of government funding applied to the protection of public health
and the environment. 
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  has estimated the annual cost of compliance
with its regulations at $150 billion (CIIT Activities, 1994).  Recent analyses of resource allocations
in the EPA ("Unfinished Business") have indicated a mismatch between these resources and the
sources of environmental and human health risk.  For example, tremendous sums of money have been
directed at hazardous waste site remediation, a relatively low source of risk, while minimal resources
have been applied to reducing the very real risk of radon exposure.  The studies blamed a variety of
factors, including mandated programs, public concerns about low-risk environmental issues, and
reduction of risk in some areas due to program efforts.  Increasing awareness of potential
misallocation of scarce environmental resources, along with concern about high levels of uncertainty
and conservative default values (i.e., assumptions used in the absence of scientific data) used in risk
assessment, and instances of public frustration with risk communication efforts, have led to the
introduction of proposed legislation in the United States Congress. 
<P>
AIHA strongly supports efforts to improve the quality of the risk assessment process by the
application of the best scientific principles and data.   However, the conduct of increasingly
sophisticated risk assessments should not be used to create an obstacle to public health intervention. 
When considered prudent, preliminary or temporary risk management options should be pursued. 
AIHA urges improved communication of that risk to the public through a more understandable and
open process.  AIHA believes that establishing risk assessment as the basis for rational decision
making can target scarce financial and human resources to the remediation of demonstrable
environmental and human health risks.  The AIHA White Paper on  Risk Assessment will further
delineate the AIHA position on the practice and the development of the science of risk assessment. 
<P>   
AIHA position with respect to the practice of human health risk assessment:
<P>
<B>1.</B>   AIHA believes that human health risk assessments should be conducted with the best
     available scientific data, and that uncertainties and known biases should be identified
     in the assessment.
<P>
     AIHA recognizes that one of the biggest impediments to the use and acceptance of health risk
     analyses is the availability of high quality scientific data to support many of the inputs to the
     assessment.  A key element to gaining acceptance of the use of risk assessment is the
     continued improvement in the science that is the foundation of health risk assessment and the
     routine disclosure of uncertainty and known bias in the assessment.  
<P>
     Technical areas requiring the disclosure of uncertainty  or bias are listed below.  
<P>
Epidemiologic Assessment
<UL>
<LI>Extrapolation of results from relatively high occupational exposures to lower environmental exposures.
<LI>Extrapolation of results from one route of exposure to exposures via other routes. 
</UL>
Toxicity Assessment
<UL>
<LI>Extrapolation of results of animal testing to humans, including the use of scaling factors or safety factors.  (When available, epidemiologic data based on human exposures is preferred to toxicological data based on animal exposures.)
<LI>Extrapolation of results of tests performed using high doses to exposures via low doses.
<LI>Extrapolation of results of testing performed for one route of exposure to exposures via other routes.
</UL>
Exposure Assessment
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Estimates of exposure parameters such as intake rates and exposure duration.
<LI>Use of contaminant fate and transport models to predict future exposures. 
</UL>
Risk Characterization
<UL>
<LI>Additivity/synergy of multiple contaminant exposure.
<LI>Selection of appropriate mathematical model to calculate potential risk.   
</UL>
With respect to toxicity assessments, it is AIHA's position that the most scientifically appropriate data is that which most closely matches the exposure scenario being evaluated (i.e., scientifically valid epidemiological studies of persons exposed to the same contaminants, via the same route of exposure, at a similar exposure level for the same length of time).    
<P>
<B>2.</B>   AIHA supports the  specification of health protective default inputs (assumptions) as
     the only feasible approach to conducting risk assessments in the absence of scientific
     data.  Principles for the selection of these defaults must be well-defined.  
<P>
     Default inputs (i.e., assumptions used in the absence of scientific data) for an assessment
     typically arise out of both scientific and policy considerations that should be clearly stated. 
     AIHA supports the recommendations contained in the National Research Council Report on
     Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment (Committee on Risk Assessment of Hazardous Air 
     Pollutants, 1994), which identifies criteria to be considered in formulating such principles,
     including:
<UL>
<LI> Protecting public health;
<LI>Ensuring scientific validity;
<LI>Minimizing serious errors in estimating risk;
<LI>Maximizing incentives for research; and
<LI>Creating an orderly and predictable process for fostering openness and trustworthiness.
</UL>
Most important is the use of scientific information in selection of default options.
<P>
<B>3.</B>   AIHA supports the use of an iterative approach to the assessment process in which
     relatively simple techniques are used initially to identify the potential magnitude of the
     health risk, followed by more sophisticated analyses as needed.  The conduct of
     increasingly sophisticated analysis should not preclude public health intervention where
     warranted.   
<P>
     The appropriate use of resources for characterizing health risks requires that an iterative
     approach to risk assessment be applied, beginning with techniques that are relatively simple,
     inexpensive, and either highly uncertain, or conservatively biased (i.e., tend to overstate actual
     risk).  The uncertainties and biases incorporated in such assessments need to be clearly
     described.  If such screening assessments support the conclusion of no significant risk, further
     evaluation is unwarranted.  If screening assessments suggest unacceptable risks, due either
     to uncertainty or bias, further resources can be invested in increasingly sophisticated and
     expensive techniques to provide a more rigorous scientific basis for decision making.
<P>
     The conduct of increasingly sophisticated risk assessments should not be used to create
     an obstacle to public health intervention.  When considered prudent, preliminary or
     temporary risk management options (e.g., providing workers with respiratory
     protection or supplying a community with an alternative source of drinking water)
     should be pursued.  
<P>
     The iterative approach to risk assessment involves the initial use of simple techniques,
     progressing to more complex analyses.  Examples of assessment techniques, starting with
     simpler methods and progressing to more complex, are listed below.
<P>
          Toxicity Assessment  (preferably based on epidemiologic data)              
<UL>
<LI>Non-biological, mathematical dose-response models (e.g., a linearized multistage model);
<LI>Physiologically based, pharmacokinetics (PB-PK) models; and
<LI>Tissue-response mechanistic models.
</UL>
Exposure Assessment
<UL>
<LI>Use of conservative point estimates of exposure parameters;
<LI>Specification of exposure parameters in terms of probability distributions; and
<LI>Exposure monitoring when feasible.
</UL> 
Presentation of uncertainty should be appropriate to the degree of sophistication of the risk
analysis.  
<P>
<B>4.</B>   AIHA supports the calculation and presentation of risk assessment results that include
     an assessment of uncertainty with a narrative describing the rationale and assumptions
     used.  Quantitative uncertainty assessment in terms of probability distributions (i.e.,
     central tendency, and upper and lower limits) or qualitative characterization of
     uncertainty should be presented, depending on the type and complexity of the risk
     assessment, and the data available.  Single point estimates with no characterization of
     uncertainty are unacceptable.  
<P>
     AIHA supports the use of probability distributions derived from measured data or statistical
     methods in the calculation and presentation of risk estimates as a basis for rational decision
     making.  When communicated to the public with clear statements of assumptions and
     procedures, a qualitative or quantitative assessment of uncertainties can make the risk
     assessment process more understandable and accessible.  Scientific uncertainty about the
     predictors of risk (i.e., toxicity assessment and exposure assessment) has two sources:  the
     natural variability of these predictors, and lack of knowledge about them.  By fully
     characterizing the risk and the underlying uncertainty associated with the estimates,
     knowledge that the assessment has integrity or that significant gaps in data information exist
     will be communicated to those making decisions and to stakeholders.
<P>
     The evaluation of uncertainty should be tailored to the type and complexity of the risk
     assessment, such that simple techniques are used initially and more advanced techniques are
     used for more sophisticated risk assessments.  There are many methods for evaluating
     uncertainty, including those listed below.
<UL>   
<LI>Qualitative description of the basis for selecting default values, exposure estimates, etc.     
<LI>Use of a sensitivity analysis to determine which predictor variables contribute the most to the uncertainty or variability of the predictions.
<LI>Analytical uncertainty propagation, that examines how uncertainty in individual parameters affects the overall uncertainty of the assessment.
<LI>Probabilistic uncertainty analysis in which the overall distribution of uncertainty is developed based on the individual distributions for the specific predicted values.
<LI>Classical statistical methods to estimate uncertainty where measured data exists.
<LI>Setting aside a concealed subset of data to be used to evaluate estimates developed based on the remaining data.
 </UL>    
Whichever method is selected, it must be communicated to the public with clear  statements
of assumptions and procedures. 
<P>
<B>5.</B>   AIHA believes that the risk assessment process should be accessible, and that presentation of results should be understandable, to all stakeholders, including those with alternative hypotheses and conclusions.
<P>
AIHA acknowledges that there is considerable debate in the scientific community regarding the practice of risk assessment, and believes that resulting scientific disputes should be stated clearly and openly in risk assessments.  The outcome of a risk assessment (i.e., the estimate of occurrence of additional illness or injury), can sometimes vary by orders of magnitude, depending on the underlying assumptions that are made in conducting the risk assessment. 
<P>
     Although these assumptions should be based strictly on scientific considerations, in reality
     they are influenced by value judgments.  The  participation of all stakeholders should be
     ensured by establishment of a permanent mechanism for submission and consideration of
     alternative hypotheses and conclusions.  Such  participation, along with clear explanations in
     risk communications of the assumptions, choice of models, uncertainties, and limitations of
     the analysis, will make the process more open and understandable, and ensure that the
     perspectives of all stakeholders are represented.  The selection of risk management
     alternatives, which have the potential to strongly impact the public, is subject to a variety of
     inputs, including social, cultural, economic, religious, spiritual, moral, and political concerns. 
     AIHA strongly supports efforts to obtain the input of all stakeholders in the selection of
     acceptable risk management alternatives.  
<P>
     AIHA agrees with the call of the National Academy of Science/National Research Council
     Report, in  Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment, for an open, structured, and
     documented risk assessment process, with identification of uncertainties, and a clear link
     between risk characterization and research.   
<P>
<B>6.</B>   AIHA endorses the concept that risk assessment should be comprehensive and
     accountable in its approach and include all of the potentially exposed populations
     (including sensitive persons) or ecosystems.
<P>
     An essential component of any risk assessment is accountability.  The assessment must be
     based on the  best available scientific data, reasonable and justifiable assumptions and models,
     and must be clearly written so that others can understand the assessment, including
     assumptions made, default values used, uncertainties, etc.  Risk assessments should be
     comprehensive, to encompass the substance (or substances) of concern, likely substitutes, and
     all potentially exposed persons (including sensitive populations) or ecosystems. 
     Comprehensiveness is critical in ensuring that the risk management decision made is based on
     an informed understanding of all aspects of the risk assessment.  Decisions based on risk
     assessments that do not encompass all aspects of the exposed populations or ecosystems may
     result in unacceptable risks to populations or ecosystems not addressed and potential
     disproportionate economic burdens for certain industrial or commercial segments.  
<P>
     Risk assessment should explicitly examine the impact of the hazard on the most sensitive
     workers, communities, and ecosystems.  The most vulnerable populations  should be used for
     the model. (Care should be taken to ensure that sensitive subpopulations are not "double-counted" with the concurrent use of overly conservative toxicity and exposure values.)    
<P>

<B>7.</B>   AIHA supports the use of risk comparisons in risk analysis and communication only
     when the risks being compared have similar characteristics. 
<P>
     Risk comparison is a tool frequently used in risk communication to equate unfamiliar risks
     with those that are more familiar (e.g., the risk of living near a chemical plant as compared
     to the risk of exposure to radon).  AIHA believes that such comparisons are appropriate only
     when the characteristics or dimensions of the risks are similar.  An involuntary,
     anthropogenic, catastrophic risk should not be compared with one that is voluntary, natural,
     and chronic in nature.  AIHA believes that to those who assume the risk, the context in which
     a risk occurs can be as important as the magnitude of the risk.  
<P>
AIHA encourages the following to support the development of the practice of
human health risk assessment:
<P>

<B>1.</B>   AIHA encourages the financial support of activities associated with the development
     and refinement of epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science to reduce the
     uncertainty and bias in health risk assessment, thereby increasing its utility for
     regulatory decision making, the making of public health policy, and in the allocation
     of governmental resources.
<P>
     The major obstacle in the conduct of risk assessment studies is the limited knowledge base
     in  epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science.   Ideally, risk assessment should be a
     straightforward evaluation of the health or environmental effects in relationship to exposure,
     integrated over time.  The reality is that uncertainty in toxicity values and exposure
     parameters frequently results in selection of conservative default values and assumptions, and
     leads to overestimation of risk.   Uncertainty and the judgments that are forced on the risk
     assessor as a result of this lack of essential knowledge can and will severely limit the
     usefulness, objectivity, and ultimately the credibility of the process.
<P>
     AIHA therefore supports the development of databases and models for epidemiology,
     toxicology, and exposure assessment that will allow for the application of a more quantitative
     approach to risk evaluation, particularly in the practice of industrial hygiene.  The data and
     models currently available in the published literature are generally only suitable for screening-level evaluations, in which  conservative estimates are useful in making statements such as
     "risk is not higher than this value."  However, these screening level evaluations are usually
     very uncertain and generally do not support more targeted decisions for risk reduction for
     specific subpopulations, work activities, etc.  To improve the targeting of risk reduction
     measures, it is crucial that professionals gathering and developing epidemiology, toxicology,
     and exposure assessment data collect and document all relevant data, and that this data be
     made available in the published literature.  Further, many of the currently available exposure
     models are based on theoretical approaches and have not been fully validated.  In some cases,
     the underlying assumptions and model limitations are not well-documented; therefore these
     models may be misused and modeled estimates may be misinterpreted.  Validation of current
     and future models is essential to ensure that the models are indeed providing reasonable,
     justifiable estimates of exposure that are useful in making risk reduction decisions.
<P>
     To further the utility of risk assessment to environmental issues having the potential to cause
     the greatest harm to the public, while allocating scare governmental resources efficiently,
     financial support of science in the following areas is critical to the further development of
     health risk assessment:
<UL>
<LI>Development of epidemiologic, toxicologic, and exposure databases.
<LI>Development of well-documented and validated exposure models.
</UL>
AIHA further urges that research initiatives include both public and private ventures.  A re-evaluation of the regulatory requirements for the risk assessment process provides an
     opportunity to encourage cooperation of the public and private sectors, with the potential for
     creating the best science.  Such collaboration may be synergistic, increasing the quantity and
     quality of research findings beyond that which could be achieved by each sector alone.  
<P>
<B>2.</B>   AIHA supports the empowerment of expert advisory panels (including stakeholders,
     regulatory authorities, and representatives from labor, industry, academia, and
     professional/technical organizations) to assist in the development of risk assessment
     guidelines and criteria.  These guidelines will be used to identify and highlight key areas
     requiring further research and regulation.  
<P>
     AIHA believes that empowerment of expert panels will allow the development of risk
     assessment guidelines and criteria that reflect current scientific thinking, and which can be
     revised in response to new findings in epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science. 
     Specific guidelines, criteria, and standards that are mandated by legislation or regulation
     become very difficult to revise (e.g., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's
     Permissible Exposure Limits, which have changed very little since 1971).  In contrast, the
     Threshold Limit Values, which were the original basis for the Permissible Exposure Limits,
     have been revised frequently and thus reflect recent scientific opinions.  The fluidity of the
     Threshold Limit Values is due to the nature of the process, which allows the TLV Committee
     of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists to propose revisions as
     deemed necessary.  The discipline of risk assessment is highly subject to change, as scientific
     and technological developments continue to advance the supporting disciplines of
     epidemiology, toxicology, exposure assessment, and risk characterization.  The empowerment
     of expert advisory panels would allow persons who are recognized experts in the methods and
     conduct of risk assessment and in the supporting disciplines to contribute to the development
     of state-of-the-art risk assessment guidelines and criteria that could be revised as needed. 
     Inclusion of stakeholders on the panels will contribute to the openness of the process, and
     ensure the consideration of the varying perspectives of all parties.  Advisory panels should
     meet periodically to review guidelines and criteria for consistency with current scientific
     thinking.  
     <P>
     AIHA recommends that an expert advisory panel be convened to ident ify and recommend  action on key areas in occupational and environmental risk assessment requiring further   research and regulation.  Stakeholders, regulatory authorities, labor, industry, academia, and professional/technical organizations should be represented on the panel, which should be convened at least once every five years.

<TITLE>Air Sampling Instrument Performance I (Particulate) Papers</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H1>Air Sampling Instrument Performance I (Particulate) Papers (13-18)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>13. Application of the Thoracic Sampling Definition to Fiber Measurement.</H2>

<B>P. Baron</B>, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Airborne fibers can cause several lung diseases; in principle, sampling 
methods should reflect this by collecting only fibers that can reach the 
target organ.  Definitions now exist for sampling aerosols that can reach 
the lungs via mouth breathing, namely the thoracic fraction as developed by 
ACGIH.  The thoracic definition is based on the aerodynamic diameter of 
compact particles.  NIOSH is currently developing a criteria document for 
refractory ceramic fibers.  As part of the consideration of the sampling 
method for these fibers, calculations were carried out to evaluate different 
approaches to fiber measurement.  The most common current technique for 
estimating fibers that can reach the lungs is to use an upper diameter limit 
of 3 &#181;m in the counting rules.  Calculations were carried out to 
estimate the aerodynamic diameter of fibers from a range of likely lognormal 
size distributions.  Using these size distributions, the use of a 3 &#181;m 
diameter upper limit in the counting rules was compared to results expected 
from a sampler operating according to the thoracic definition.  The other 
limits in the counting procedure, i.e., counting only fibers longer than 
5 &#181;m and thicker than 0.25 &#181;m, were included in the calculations.  
The calculations indicate that the 3 &#181;m counting rules agrees with the 
thoracic definition within about &#177;25 for a wide range of possible size 
distributions.  The advantages of using a thoracic sampler would be to 
reduce analyst decision making (all fibers collected would be counted) and 
to reduce the non-thoracic dust on the sample, making the sample easier to 
count.  Until the thoracic samplers are available for fibrous aerosols, 
incorporating the 3 &#181;m upper diameter limit in the fiber counting rules 
may serve as a surrogate for thoracic sampling.

<H2>14. Development of the New Federal Reference Method for Fine 
Particles.</H2>
 
<B>R. Wiener</B>, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle 
Park, NC<P>
A key element in considering a revised standard will be sampling for fine 
particles in addition to current PM10 requirements.  This will result in the 
need for a new federal reference method (FRM) for fine particles.  Goals for 
the FRM for fine particles include: 24-hour measuring period; automated 
sequential sampling, without daily maintenance; easy to use; capability of 
providing sample for later chemical analysis; ability to operate under wide 
range of ambient conditions (temperature and pressure); comparability to 
existing manual measurements and historical epidemiological data base; a 
sharp cut; appropriate quality assurance requirements for reference and 
equivalent methods; and sample collection at ambient temperatures.  This is 
to be accomplished by providing for three classifications of samplers.  
First, the Reference Method, a low volume, single-day, sampler based on 
filtration and gravimetric determination of mass and specified primarily by 
design.  Second, (Class 1 Equivalent) equivalent methods very similar to the 
reference method, including sequential (multi-day) samplers based on minor 
modifications of the reference method sampler.  Third, to permit 
technological flexibility, provisions will be made for an instrument (Class 
II Equivalent) significantly different from the reference sampler.<P>
Designation of a particle sampler as a Federal Reference Method (FRM) will 
be based on a demonstration that a vendor's instrument meets the design 
specifications, performance requirements, and quality control standards to 
be specified in the regulation.  Designation of a Class I Equivalent sampler 
will require the same tests as the FRM, with provisions to demonstrate that 
any alteration of component parts or inclusion of additional parts to those 
specified for the FRM does not alter the performance of the sampler. The 
Class II Equivalent samplers may use components and methods other than those 
specified in the FRM (e.g., continuous analyzers based on measurement 
principals different from the reference method, a different inlet, size 
separator, or filtration collection methodology).  The samplers would 
require full equivalency testing and meet quality assurance and control 
requirements.  Equivalency testing will include a combination of laboratory 
and field test to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to provide 
results similar to the Reference Method in accuracy and precision.

<H2>15. Strategy and Timetable for the Adoption of the CEN/ISO Sampling 
Conventions in the U.K.</H2>
<B>L. Kenny</B>, Health and Safety Laboratory, Sheffield United Kingdom; S. 
Bristow, T. Ogden, Health and Safety Executives, London, England<P>
The implementation of the CEN/ISO sampling conventions requires decisions on 
which sampling methods to recommend, estimation of the likely impact that 
changing sampling methods could have on apparent exposures, and adjustment 
where necessary of exposure limit values.  Changes will be necessary both 
to the UK's official guidance and regulation. This paper outlines the 
strategy that HSE intends to pursue, and the time scale needed for practical 
adoption of the CEN/ISO conventions in the UK.<P>
At present, the UK has no exposure limits for thoracic dust and we need only 
consider the conventions for respirable and inhalable dusts.  The current UK 
method for respirable dust, the Higgins-Dowell cyclone, agrees best with the 
CEN/ISO respirable convention when operated at a flow rate of 2.2 lpm.  The 
effect of changing from the current flow rate of 1.9 lpm will be to decrease 
apparent dust concentrations by about 20% on average.  Thus, in order to 
retain the same standards of control in the workplace, the exposure limits 
should also be decreased by 20%.  For the majority of substances, UK 
exposure limits have the status of guidance, and can be changed after public 
consultation with the agreement of the Health and Safety Commission.  Two 
substances_crystalline and barium sulphate_have respirable dust limits 
incorporated into regulation, changes to which require approval of 
Parliament.  The exposure limit for silica is under review at present.<P>
Evaluation of the current UK method for "total inhalable" dust, the 
seven-hole sampler, shows that in low external wind speeds it follows the 
inhalable convention adequately (although other samplers perform better).  
We consider therefore that UK exposure limits for "total inhalable" dust can 
be converted into "inhalable" limits without any numerical change.  This 
greatly simplifies the formal adoption of the CEN/ISO inhalable convention.<P>
Publication of new guidance on dust sampling will enable HSE to recommend a 
wider range of samplers, to include all instruments having satisfactory 
performance with respect to the new conventions.  Revised guidance will be 
issued in January 1997, and will coincide with the publication of the new 
respirable dust exposure limits, subject to all the necessary agreements and 
consultations.

<H2>16. Outcome of a Collaborative European Study of Personal Inhalable 
Aerosol Sampler Performance.</H2>  
<B>L. Kenny</B>, Health and Safety Laboratory, Sheffield, United Kingdom; R. 
Aitken, Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh, United Kingdom<P>
Following the worldwide agreement of sampling conventions for inhalable, 
thoracic, and respirable aerosol fractions, a working group of Committee 
European de Normalisation (CEN) developed a pre-standard for the performance 
of instruments used for workplace aerosol sampling.  In order to test the 
general applicability of this sampler performance standard, this study was 
set up to examine the experimental, statistical, and mathematical procedures 
it recommended.  This aim was achieved by working through the recommended 
test protocols with eight types of personal inhalable aerosol sampler used 
for workplace monitoring in Europe and elsewhere.<P>
The samplers were evaluated in terms of bias and precision with respect to 
the inhalable convention.  All the samplers were found to perform best in 
low external wind speeds, which of the range of conditions tested are 
thought to be closest to those normally found in indoor workplaces.  At low 
wind speeds, five of the eight sampler types tested gave adequate agreement 
with the inhalable convention, and the remaining three gave adequate 
agreement after the application of correction factors.  At moderate wind 
speeds, only two out of the eight samplers gave adequate agreement without 
correction.  At high external wind speeds, none of the tested samplers 
performed well.  In addition to bias, there were significant differences in 
the ease of use and handling of the different samplers, reflected in the 
precision of the results at all wind speeds.<P>
The results of the project have led to recommendations for revising the CEN 
pre-standard, in order to simplify the test protocols and lower their cost, 
in particular by reducing the number of compulsory tests and concentrating 
on low wind speed conditions.  However, some further work will be needed to 
develop suitable test facilities and methods. The sampler performance data 
obtained in this study were affected by large experimental errors, but will 
nevertheless contribute to decisions on how to implement the inhalable 
sampling convention in industrial hygiene practice.

<H2>17. Field Testing of New Multidirectional Sampling Inlet for Airborne 
Particulates: Simultaneous Measurement of Total Dust, Fungal Spores and 
Lead.</H2> 
<B>B. Hauck</B>, G. Mainelis, T. Reponen, A. Reponen, University of 
Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH<P>
A new personal sampling inlet with low wind sensitivity and good filter 
collection uniformity has recently been developed and evaluated by the 
investigators.  The inlet design includes a circular base fitted with a 
spherical screen with numerous evenly spaced pores, thus giving the sampler 
a multidirectional sampling capability.  In this study the new sampler 
prototype (178 &#181;m pore size, 9% porosity) has been evaluated in the 
field as an area sampler in houses where environmental cleanups have been 
conducted.  Teams of cleanup workers, made up of 4-5 members, used HEPA 
vacuum cleaners to purge the dwellings of surface contamination.  All floor 
areas, including under and behind all furniture, were vacuumed three times 
and all surfaces wiped with sanitizing solution also three times.  The 
cleaning teams, while working in poorly maintained inner city houses, were 
at risk for exposure to high levels of total dust, fungal spores, and lead. 
To assess the exposures, five homes were evaluated involving a wide range of 
cleanliness levels.  Samples of airborne total dust, fungal spores, and lead 
were collected on 0.8 &#181;m pore size, 25 and 37 mm diameter PVC filters 
during cleanup.  Two different sample inlets were utilized: the conventional 
37-mm diameter three-piece cassette and the new multidirectional 25-mm 
diameter sampling inlet.  Four co-located samplers of each type were 
tested.  The samples were collected at air flow rates of 2 or 10 lpm using 
both stationary and battery-operated pumps. The sample filters were analyzed 
for total dust using gravimetric analysis and then for fungal spores and 
lead. The fungal spore concentration was determined using Acridine Orange 
Staining and Epifluorescence Microscopy, and lead level was measured by 
Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The results of this ongoing study indicate 
that workers are not exposed to hazardous levels of total dust, fungal 
spores, and lead during these 4-5 hour cleanup operations.  Comparison of 
the new with the conventional aerosol sampling inlet demonstrates lower 
standard deviation of measured concentrations and better spatial 
distribution of particulates on the filter when using the new inlet.

<H2>18. Quantification Evaluation of Real Time Beryllium Air Monitoring 
Using Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy.</H2>
 
<B>N. Vahdat</B>, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL; M. Hoover, Inhalation 
Toxicology Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM; J. Johnson, G. Coutts,  
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA<P>
Beryllium particles in air can represent a significant inhalation health 
hazard.  The traditional  methods of monitoring beryllium particles in air 
involve passing a known  volume of air through a filter, chemically 
dissolving the collected material and determining the beryllium 
concentration of the solution using flame atomization atomic absorption 
spectrometry or inductively coupled plasma analysis. The process is time 
consuming requiring 6 to 8 hours. In this paper we discuss the use of 
laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for real-time beryllium air 
monitoring. A small transportable Beryllium Air Monitor System based on 
the LIBS technique was developed at the optics for focusing the output of 
the laser, and systems for air sampling, emission detection, and instrument 
control.  Beryllium particles in the air sample entering the ionization 
chamber of the instrument are vaporized and ionized.  Light emitted from 
the plasma is used to identify and quantify the airborne beryllium 
concentrations. The instrument was tested in a series of calibration 
experiments and data were collected for several beryllium particle size 
ranges and concentrations in the air. If a particle is completely vaporized 
by the spark, one would expect the signal received from the LIBS instrument 
to be proportional to the mass of the particle.  There is, however, evidence 
that large particles are not completely vaporized, preventing use of linear 
relationships between mass and signal.  Based on the experimental data, a 
theoretical model involving surface and volume of particles was developed 
which can be used to quantify the airborne beryllium concentrations.

<H1>Gas and Vapor Detection Papers (174-179)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>174. Effects of High Temperatures, Humidities, and Interference from 
Toluene and Xylenes on Benzene Detector Tube Accuracy.</H2>
<B>K. Murray</B>, Eagle Environmental Health, Houston, TX; M. Morandi, L. 
Whitehead, University of Texas Health Center at Tyler, Houston, TX; T. 
Stock, University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, TX<P>
Benzene is present in many work areas in the petrochemical industry 
including refineries, production sites, and in oil and gas tankers.  
Colorimetric detector tubes are often used to measure concentrations of 
benzene in these areas. Gulf Coast summer weather conditions range in 
temperature from 80&#176;F to over 100&#176;F with relative humidities 
ranging from 50% to almost 100%. These temperatures and humidity ranges also 
occur in certain confined spaces such as oil or chemical cargo facilities 
where workers perform cleaning and maintenance activities under extreme 
temperature and humidity.  The objective of this study was to determine 
whether the use of detector tubes for the measurement of benzene at high 
ambient temperatures and humidities and in the presence of interferences 
from toluene and xylene results in unacceptable measurements according to 
NIOSH criteria.<P>
A dynamic weather chamber was used to generate concentrations of benzene, 
toluene, and xylene at temperatures and humidities which simulate confined 
space and Gulf Coast temperature and humidity conditions.  Concentrations of 
1.0 and 5.0 ppm benzene and 50 ppm of xylenes and toluene were generated at 
50% and 90% relative humidity and 25&#176;C, 30&#176;C, and 35&#176;C.  Two 
brands of benzene-specific detector tubes were tested at each combination of 
temperature, relative humidity, and benzene concentration.  The 
concentrations indicated by the detector tubes were statistically compared 
to the known concentrations generated in the chamber.  Both brands of 
benzene-specific detector tubes exceeded the &#177;25% accuracy requirement 
set by NIOSH when exposed to 90% relative humidity.  Therefore, based on the 
results of this study, it is not recommended that benzene-specific detector 
tubes be used for the purposes of quantifying the concentration of benzene 
in confined spaces or for delineation of benzene regulated areas.

<H2>175. Evaluation of Open-Path FTIR Spectrometers for Monitoring Multiple 
Chemicals in Air.</H2>
<B>S. Farhat</B>, L. Todd, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
Chapel Hill, NC<P>
There has been mounting interest in the use of open-path Fourier Transform 
Infrared (OP-FTIR) spectrometers for occupational air monitoring.  Although 
this technology is gaining acceptance in the environmental field, there has 
not yet been a comprehensive assessment of instrument performance and the 
analytical limitations of this method have not been thoroughly delineated. 
Calibration of OP-FTIR systems present unique problems because the optical 
beam is exposed to the atmosphere.  An internal sample cell can be used for 
the calibration of the optical bench, but it does not provide verification 
of the entire system in the field.<P>
One solution to the problem of calibrating an open-path system is to place 
a sample cell in the path of the IR beam. A study was performed to evaluate 
performance of three bistatic OP-FTIR spectrometers (with MCT or In/Sb 
detectors) using a custom-designed flow through glass calibration cell, one 
meter in length and four inches in diameter, placed in the path of the IR 
beam. NIST traceable sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and cyclohexane were injected 
or flowed through the cell.  Instrument accuracy was verified by comparing 
cell concentrations with OP-FTIR measured concentrations.  One OP-FTIR 
spectrometer, equipped with an MCT detector, measured concentrations of SF6 
to within 5-7% of cell concentrations.  The second OP-FTIR, equipped with an 
MCT detector, underestimated concentrations of SF6 and cyclohexane by 
15-20%. These results were validated using a closed cell system.  The 
OP-FTIR spectrometer, equipped with an In/Sb detector, measured 
concentrations of cyclohexane to within 3% of cell concentrations.  The 
external calibration cell shows promise as a method to validate the 
operation of an OP-FTIR spectrometer in the field, and for quality assurance 
and quality control.

<H2>176. The Determination of Limits of Detection for 19 Organic Vapors by 
Surface Acoustic Wave Sensor Arrays Employing Novel and Conventional Surface 
Coatings.</H2>
<B>S. Patrash</B>, J. Grate, S. Kaganove, Battelle Pacific Northwest 
Laboratories, Richland, WA<P>
This work describes our efforts in developing new sensor interface materials 
that improve detection limits for toxic organic vapors.  Surface acoustic 
wave sensors exhibit changes in resonant frequency when an organic vapor 
migrates into a thin film interface on the sensor surface.<P>
Four channel surface acoustic wave sensor arrays were employed. Each channel 
used an individual 200 MHz resonator device.  A total of 20 different 
coatings materials were deposited on the sensor surfaces and exposed to 19 
individual organic vapors.  The coating set contained 14 polymeric and 6 new 
synthetic materials. Vapor test atmospheres were created by bubbling 
nitrogen through a bubbler maintained at 15&#176;C. Subsequent serial 
dilutions with nitrogen yielded four test levels that spanned a 20-fold 
concentration range between 0.25% to 25% of saturation. Each concentration 
exposure was performed in triplicate and the sensor temperature activity 
maintained at 25&#176;C.
In evaluating the sensitivities determined from regressions of response 
versus concentration, we found that our new synthetic materials had the 
highest sensitivities for 8 of the 19 test vapors.  In 5 cases, the new 
synthetic material yielded a sensitivity that was 10% or greater than the 
second best performing coating.  To examine the performance of the overall 
20 coating data set, the coating exhibiting best sensitivity for each vapor 
was identified and a limit of detection was calculated. For the 15 vapors 
for which PEL levels have been established, 12 had limits of detection below 
the PEL.

<H2>177. Evaluation of an Omer Beam Configuration for Tomagraphic 
Reconstructions of Gas Concentrations in Workplaces with a Remote Sensing 
FTIR.</H2>
<B>D. Park</B>, University of Michigan School of Public, Ann Arbor, MI; M. 
Yost, University of Washington, School of Public Heath, Seattle, WA<P>
The introduction of Computed Tomographic (CT) techniques coupled with 
optical remote sensing in the workplace opens the possibility of obtaining 
two-dimensional concentration maps of air pollutants in the entire breathing 
zone plane. The beam geometry plays a critical role in producing good 
reconstruction maps, and largely determines the feasibility of implementing 
this technique in the field.  Several beam configurations have been proposed 
and evaluated in the literature. However, most previous beam geometries have 
some limitations: a limited number of projection angles and rays when used 
with a single remote sensing FTIR; sensitivity to beam placement and missing 
ray paths due to obstructions; potentially high noise and peak -smearing and 
false peak artifacts when reconstructing complex concentration gradients.<P>
We have developed a new type of beam configuration based on a single 
scanning remote sensing FTIR system and steering optics.  We refer to this 
beam configuration as the "Overlapped Multiple Emitting Ray" (OMER) 
geometry.  We evaluated variations on the OMER geometry for various test 
maps generated from concentration gradient profiles obtained experimentally 
in a chamber study.  The OMER geometry produced good agreement between the 
test maps and the reconstructions.  The OMER geometry can be easily extended 
to accommodate complex concentration gradients, restricted beam locations, 
or high spatial resolution reconstructions.  In addition, the location of 
the remote sensing FTIR and steering optics remains very flexible with the 
OMER geometry.  Thus, it may be very convenient for practical applications 
in real workplaces.

<H2>178. Theoretical Interpretation of the Adsorption Capacity of Charcoal 
Sampling Tubes Exposed to Organic Mixtures.</H2>
<B>Y. Yoon</B>, J. Nelson, Datachem Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT;  J. 
Lara, IRSST, Montreal, Quebec, Canada<P>
The absorption capacity of charcoal sampling devices exposed to 
single-component systems has been addressed in various studies.  Only a 
limited number of investigators, however, have considered the effect of 
contaminant mixtures on the capacity of sorbent sampling tubes.  Since many 
work environments involve exposures to mixtures of chemicals, it is of 
interest to investigate and understand the adsorption of mixtures on solid 
sorbent sampling elements.  The authors have developed a model based on 
adsorption kinetics which addresses contaminant mixtures.  This model has 
been used to predict adsorption capacities and breakthrough times for 
respirator cartridges. In this study, the model was applied to investigate 
the adsorption properties of charcoal elements used to sample air 
contaminated with chemical mixtures.  The model was used to predict and 
assess the results of the simultaneous sampling of each of the chemical 
compounds of various contaminant mixtures.  The sampling system considered 
was a charcoal tube: front section--100 mg; of carbon and back section--50 
mg of carbon. Contaminant mixtures studied included: benzene/toluene; 
acetone/styrene; and toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene. Interestingly, the model 
predicts that different quantities of specific compounds of mixtures are 
collected on the two charcoal sections.  For example, for the 
toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene mixture, the ratio of the adsorbed weights of 
the various compounds is different in the two sections of carbon.  Toluene 
is relatively weakly adsorbed, penetrating the initial collection element 
before each of the other two compounds.  Toluene is displaced from the 
front section. Therefore, the back section of the sampling device is 
enriched with toluene in comparison to the other two contaminants.  The 
model accounts for this displacement phenomenon and allows one to calculate 
the adsorbed weight of each compound as a function of the sampling time.  
In addition, the model is capable of predicting the ratio of the number of 
displaced molecules to the corresponding number of displacing molecules.  
This study demonstrates that the adsorption capacity of charcoal for 
relatively weakly adsorbed compounds is decreased significantly by 
exposure to mixtures.

<H2>179. Exposure of Ground Crew to Aircraft Exhaust Constituents at the 
South Pole.</H2>
<B>H. Mahar</B>, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA; R. Boehne, 
Antarctic Support Association, Englewood, CO; D. Baker, New York Air 
National Guard, Scotia, NY<P>
Because of extreme environmental conditions at the National Science 
Foundation's research station at the geographic South Pole, cargo aircraft 
(LC-130s) resupplying the station are serviced with engines (turbo-prop) 
turning.  Therefore, ground crew handling cargo are exposed to engine 
exhaust constituents continuously during the off-load/re-load process, and 
have experienced health complaints  associated with those activities.<P>
Exposure assessments of those activities have been conducted, involving 
characterization of the engine exhaust plume behind the aircraft (with 
isopleths of sentinel exhaust constituent concentrations determined), 
partial chemical characterization of the exhaust (e.g., volatile organics, 
hydrocarbons, aldehydes, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide) and medical 
screening of the cargo handlers.  Extreme environmental conditions limited 
sampling/analytical schemes to the use of sorbent tubes (single and 
multi-media), with subsequent GC, GC/MS, and derivization analytical 
techniques.  Exhaust constituents included combustion products of the fuel 
(JP-8), partial combustion products and raw fuel --all in gas/vapor phase 
or as an aerosol (fume, mists, particulate materials). Direct reading 
instruments were utilized to define exhaust plumes in more temperate 
climates.<P>
Personal exposures are dependent on time and location in the exhaust plume 
and the environmental conditions during the off-load process (ambient 
temperatures affect performance and combustion efficiency of the engine as 
well as speciation of the exhaust constituents).  No clear single or group 
of chemical constituents appear to be associated strongly with the health 
complaints noted, and no established PEL/TLV seems to be exceeded.  Medical 
complaints appear to be non-specific, most frequently upper respiratory 
irritation, headache, nausea, the severity of which is associated with 
length of exposure and may be idiosyncratic.<P>
The findings are consistent with similar studies conducted by the military 
services concerned with similar work environments.  Collectively, these 
studies suggest JP-8 may be more irritating than other aviation fuels, with 
flight operations in cold temperatures exacerbating the symptoms.  This 
study characterizes the exhaust exposures at low environmental temperatures 
bordering the extreme end of the operating envelop of the aircraft and could 
be considered "worst case" conditions.

<H1>Management Issues Papers (123-133)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>123. Professional Liability Concerns for Industrial Hygienists.</H2>
<B>M. Klekner</B>, D. Carrier, M. Hanington, L. McCormick, Sedgwick, 
Falls Church, VA<P>
A review of liability and insurance programs allows consultants and 
business owners to make informed decisions on assessing and insuring risks. 
The litigious nature of society invites suit to even the most cautious 
scientist.  The unfortunate reality is that third-party allegations of 
negligence and breach of contract create liability potential regardless of 
fault.  The ultimate claim stems beyond financial terms impacting 
professional reputation, disrupting work and potentially endangering future 
availability of coverage.  There are several important areas to review when 
considering "Professional Liability:"<P>
<UL>
<LI>Coverage: Exclusions within typical contracts and policy terms and the basis 
surrounding penalties, fines and punitive damages, all present challenges to 
IHs.  The insuring agreement and definition sections are key to 
understanding policy coverage.
<LI>Pricing: What should be expected in a premium quote and its rating basis.
<LI>Limits: Choosing proper limits and deductibles to meet your needs.
<LI>Risk reduction: Techniques that minimize risk can be accomplished 
through a variety of methods including: standardized proposals, contracts, 
practices, methods of assessments, and reports.  The importance of 
establishing and maintaining professional credibility through ethics 
adherence, education, certifications, and association memberships.
<LI>Claims process: When, what, where and how to report a  potential claim.
<LI>Filling out a professional liability application: Significance of and 
methods for qualifying and quantifying all numerical responses.
<LI>Broker relations: Determining insurance company stability, the broker's 
role, and services expected.
</UL>
Education leads to informed choices when selecting coverages and enables IHs 
to make knowledgeable decision based on risk reduction and coverage needs. 
In conclusion, consultants liabilities can be dramatically minimized with a 
mixture of identifying liability, implementing appropriate risk controls, 
and insurance coverage.

<H2>124. Industrial Hygiene Career Development Program.</H2>
<B>P. Cowin</B>, U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Prevention, 
Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD<P>
It is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit and retain quality 
industrial hygienists in today's market.  The Army, in an effort to attract 
the best and brightest in the industrial hygiene field, has established a 
career development program for industrial hygienists.  This program provides 
broad-based technical and managerial training as well as opportunities for 
developmental assignments.  The program is based on the Army Civilian 
Training, Education, and Development System (ACTEDS) Plan for Industrial 
Hygienists.  The ACTEDS Plan begins with an intern program designed to take 
science majors into the world of industrial hygiene and continues with 
professional development courses to further expand the industrial hygienists' 
base of knowledge. This commitment to the continuous development of 
Department of the Army Civilians is critical in the retention of senior 
industrial hygienists.  Tom Brokaw, in the NBC News Series on "The New 
Work Ethic" indicated that workers are looking for jobs that provide 
training which keeps them marketable.<P>
Perhaps as important as the ability to keep good employees is the added 
benefit of a traceable, measurable means to document the skill level of 
these employees.  The ACTEDS Plan provides a Master Training Plan against 
which the industrial hygienists can be benchmarked.  With many states moving 
toward licensure, such a plan can keep an organization from being caught 
unprepared.  Future efforts of the program include the credentialing and/or 
privileging of Army industrial hygienists, much the same as medical 
professionals.

<H2>125. Development of a Corporate Mission and Vision Statement for 
Occupational Health and Safety.</H2>
<B>K. Dotson</B>, Phelps Dodge Corporation, Phoenix, AZ<P>
Many organizations strive to achieve excellence in employee health and 
safety protection. Organizations best achieve goals when there is clear 
definition, consensus and a communication of the vision and mission among 
stakeholder groups.  Many organizations have a health and safety policy 
statement issued from senior management, but few have compiled vision and 
mission statements to guide the contributions of industrial hygiene safety 
staff.<P>
Thus, the feasibility of developing a vision and mission statement for a 
corporate health and safety staff function was explored.  Methods included 
the analysis of routine activities conducted in support of industrial 
hygiene and safety programs.  Activities were grouped by scope, function 
and customer.  The development process included draft reviews by 
corporate-wide stakeholders. A customer service satisfaction survey was 
conducted as a semi-quantitative verification of definition accuracy.  
Results include the implementation of a consensus vision and mission 
statement distributed internationally in Spanish and English.<P>
Development of a vision and mission statement for occupational health and 
safety management enhances the ability of the organizational staff function 
to protect the health of workers. Correlation of an organization's 
occupational health and safety policy statement with routine industrial 
hygiene and safety activities provides crucial guidance to staff and 
increases the level of management support by demonstrating the increased 
compatibility of occupational health and safety programs with traditional 
business objectives.  Industrial hygienists, business managers, and the 
health of employees will benefit from further development and articulation 
of vision and mission statements that guide staff to accurately reflect the 
business value-added by occupational health and safety management programs.

<H2>126. Using Performance Measures as an Environment, Safety and Health 
(ES&H) Management Tool.</H2>
<B>J. Wong</B>, G. Campbell, J. Jackson, Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, Livermore, CA<P>
In an era of dwindling resources, increasing regulatory demands and 
management accountability, the use of performance measurements is an 
effective management tool for evaluating and assessing bottom lines 
performance.<P>
In 1992, the University of California (UC) renewed a five-year contract with 
the Department of Energy (DOE) to provide for significantly expanded and 
enhanced university management oversight at the Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory (LLNL), the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).  The enhanced UC management role will 
permit the DOE to structure its on-site oversight to achieve greater cost 
efficiency in its operations and to avoid duplication of efforts.<P>
The performance based management system included the use of clear and 
reasonable objective performance measurements agreed to in advance as 
standards against which the university's overall performance of 
administrative and/or managerial obligations will be assessed.  Because 
these performance measures are based on results, not processes, they have 
the net effect of reducing DOE management oversight and increasing the 
attention paid to the bottom line (i.e., performance).<P>
This paper will describe the development and the contents of the 
environment, safety and health (ES&H) performance measures, the effort and 
the challenges faced by the AS&H performance measure development committee, 
and the lessons learned from operating under these performance measures.<P>

<H2>127. Integrating Performance Measures with Industrial Hygiene Program 
Evaluations.</H2>
<B>P. Esposito</B>, T. Stich, Environmental Profiles, Inc., Columbia, MD<P>
Industrial hygiene programs are implemented with the purpose of assuring 
employee health and safety in the workplace.  Regulatory compliance and risk 
management are other goals of industrial hygiene programs.  Routine 
evaluation of these programs is essential to ensuring that the programs are 
producing the desired results.<P>
The purpose of this work was to develop Performance Measures (PM) that can 
be integrated into the program evaluation process.  The goal of a 
Performance Measurement Program (PMP) is to identify objective, measurable 
activities or program results that will be indicative of the performance or 
condition of a facility, group of facilities or site.  The PMP can be used 
to trend and analyze operational data in an effort to improve environmental, 
safety and health performance and to strengthen line management of program 
implementation.  Each PM must be developed so that the results can be easily 
collected, audited, and verified by independent assessments.  The measures 
must be specific in that management goals and objectives associated with the 
program evaluation performance areas, performance criteria, and critical 
objectives are addressed.<P>
Carefully selecting performance measures and constructing the PMP are 
essential to getting meaningful results from industrial hygiene program 
evaluations.  Suggested measures and programs are presented.  The results 
demonstrate a significant positive correlation between performance measures 
and program evaluations.  This correlation yields to meaningful program 
evaluation results that can be used to set goals and objectives, to 
formulate strategic plans, and to allocate resources.  Performing 
evaluations without meaningful measures provides little benefit. Based on 
the results of this work, a process that involves meaningful measures and 
results can be constructed using a performance based measurement process.

<H2>128. Behavioral Analysis: Bringing Good Science to Industrial Hygiene.</H2>
<B>D. Groover</B>, Behavioral Science Technology, Inc., Ojai, CA<P>
For years, the issues confronting industrial hygienists have been pushed by 
the wayside for the "more pressing" issues of safety and production.  All 
too often because of this, the methods used by industrial hygienists are not 
on parity with the new scientific methods of Total Quality Management (TQM) 
and Behavior-Based Safety.<P>
As in TQM and Behavior-Based Safety initiatives, no matter how well thought 
out the procedure, to reduce exposure requires managing critical behaviors. 
This means identifying, measuring, and improving exposure-related behaviors 
upstream -- before exposure happens.  It is a process based on measurement, 
upstream sampling of key variables, and problem solving.  An effective 
industrial hygiene (IH) management process identifies and corrects existing 
systems that produce at-risk behavior (behaviors increasing risk of 
exposure), and develops new systems that encourage safe behavior.  Leading 
companies are using this approach to achieve continuous improvement in their 
IH performance.<P>
Addressing at-risk behavior means understanding these six key elements:
<OL>
<LI> What behavior is (observable act);
<LI> What triggers a behavior (antecedent);
<LI> What results from a behavior (consequence);
<LI> How antecedents and consequences affect behavior;
<LI> How timing, consistency, and significance control a consequence's 
affect on behavior; and
<LI> How we can use this knowledge to prevent at-risk behavior while 
encouraging safe behavior.
</OL>

<H2>129. Managing Health and Safety in a Team Environment.</H2>
<B>J. Koch</B>, IT Analytical Services St. Louis Laboratory, Earth City, MO<P>
Corporate culture is using the team concept where a group of employees work 
on a particular project and perform all of the functions required of that 
project.  A variation of this is where several employees are cross trained 
to work in different areas so that when the work load increases in a 
particular area, they can move into that area until no longer needed and 
then move to where needed.<P>
This phenomenon challenges traditional health and safety management.  
Supervisors are finding that they may be responsible for one set of 
employees one day and a different set the next day and may also have to 
manage a team through processes with which they are not familiar.  This 
usually causes health and safety to be overlooked as employees and managers 
become focused on the tasks and methods to increase productivity.  
Accountability for health and safety may be placed on the team or 
supervisor, but conflicts arise when these teams cross into other 
supervisors' departments.  The health and safety professional may feel 
frustrated when he/she is unaware of who is responsible for training and 
enforcement of health and safety practices in these groups. Many times 
supervisors are unwilling to "claim" an employee, which results in this 
employee being unaware of the health and safety requirements in that area. 
Traditional health and safety training programs provide a good overview, but 
job specific requirements may get overlooked as employees are hurriedly 
trained in a particular area.<P>
This paper presents issues such as communication and team building concepts, 
which are essential for the industrial hygienist to know to help manage 
health and safety in a team environment.  This paper will also discuss 
concerns when teams are comprised of temporary labor.  A discussion of how 
one company has addressed this issue is also included.

<H2>130. Reinventing a 250-Person Health and Safety Organization.</H2>
<B>J. Jackson</B>, G. Campbell, J. Wong, Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, Livermore, CA<P>
Reinvention, reengineering, and reorganization are among the descriptors 
used when an organization desires or needs to change its practices, 
procedures, and paradigms resulting in increased efficiency, effectiveness, 
and/or employee empowerment.  The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
Hazards Control Department reinvented itself in mid-1993 and implemented a 
new mode of thinking and operating in November 1993.  We eliminated 24 (60%) 
management and supervising positions with up to four levels of management 
and formed a new organization with only one management level between 
employees and the Department Head.  The new leaders now have up to 40 people 
reporting to them in the reinvented flat organizational structure.<P>
Key to implementation of such large sub-organizational elements have been 
employee empowerment and the development of self-directed work teams (SDWT). 
Implementing effective SDWTs requires specific skills by the team members 
and training in these skills is essential. Employee development and growth 
is a natural outcome and provides rewards for team members as 
self-sufficiency, pride and productivity increase.  At the same time, 
defining SDWT boundaries enhances the process.  Unfortunately, the lack of 
boundaries results in teams being overly cautious and feeling abandoned.  
Our SDWT experienced such situations and others as team members and 
department leaders struggled to provide an opportunity for employee 
empowerment with balance of gradual increasing autonomy.<P>
Our original objectives have been met for the most part.  We are now 
beginning the search for our next reinvention.  We are experiencing the 
reality that continuous quality improvement is not just a set of buzzwords, 
but indeed, being change agents is a new way of life.<P>

<H2>131. Applying "Learning Organization" Concepts to Health and Safety 
Management.</H2>
<B>R. Stricoff</B>, Arthur D. Little, Inc., Cambridge, MA<P>
In managing health and safety, we have gone through a phase of focusing on 
physical conditions, and we are now in a phase of focusing on health and 
safety management processes.  However, even firms with sound health and 
safety management processes have continued to experience troublesome near 
misses and incidents.  To move beyond the management systems approach and 
apply key "learning organization" concepts to health and safety management, 
a new approach was developed.<P>
Analysis of health and safety performance was done by adapting the "systems 
thinking" approach documented in the general management literature. This 
approach involved examination of health and safety performance (successes 
and breakdowns) within the context of the overall organizational management 
systems (i.e., transcending safety and health management processes). It 
involves five steps: 1) review information on performance and the context 
in which it has occurred; 2) identify patterns; 3) define the systematic 
structure describing how seemingly unrelated factors may influence one 
another; 4) describe the underlying assumptions and motivations held by 
people that allow the current system to remain in place; and 5) define 
possible "interventions" that can improve performance.<P>
This approach was applied at a manufacturing plant, where there were 
occasional and unexpected accidents resulting from equipment malfunction.  A 
preventive maintenance program at the facility was in place, but did not 
seem to have any effect on these incidents.  A systematic analysis 
discovered that misalignment of the production management process and the 
maintenance management process resulted in key early warnings being 
disregarded, and accidents occurred.<P>
The power of systematic analysis was to move beyond the confines of the 
safety and health programs themselves, enabling us to identify safety 
implications of broader interactions within the plant.

<H2>132. Presentation of Air Sampling Data in Keeping with the Industrial 
Hygiene Code of Ethics.</H2>
<B>E. Senn</B>, New Jersey Department of Health, Trenton, NJ<P>
To meet the criteria of Canon 1 of the Industrial Hygiene Code of Ethics, 
air sampling data should be presented along with other findings of an 
industrial hygiene exposure assessment rather than in isolation.  Failure to 
do so may encourage the sampling results to be taken out of context and 
misinterpreted, especially when presented in tables which are easily 
separated from the report. Examples of easily misinterpreted tables are 
given.  Tables of air sampling data should allow for the presentation of 
relevant information such as dates, times, job titles of sampled employees, 
operations being performed, and chemicals, personal protective equipment, 
and ventilation in use. Samples should be clearly identified as personal, 
area, ceiling, full-shift, part-shift, etc.  A clear statement concerning 
the representatives of each sampling result should be made in the table.  A 
notation should be given in the table on the location in the full report of 
information and discussion on:
<UL>
<LI>Representatives of exposures, number similarly exposed;
<LI>Applicable exposure limits and interpretation of the air sampling data;
<LI>Whether or not the skin absorption and ingestion routes of exposure were 
assessed for the sampled employees and discussion of these assessments;
<LI>Sampling and analytical equipment and methods used, limit of 
quantification, instrument calibration, and laboratory proficiency;
<LI>Overall findings and recommendations concerning industrial hygiene 
controls at the sampled operations.
</UL>

<H1>Methodological Issues in Exposure Assessment and Implications for 
Occupational Epidemiology Papers (319-328, 465)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>319. Exposure Assessment for Epidemiology of EMF in the Uranium 
Enrichment Industry.</H2>
<B>T. Wenzl</B>, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Personal monitoring of workplace exposure to 60 Hz magnetic fields (MF) was 
carried out at a uranium enrichment facility for an updated mortality study. 
Very large amounts of electric power are used in the gaseous diffusion 
process, so it was anticipated that many workers would have elevated 
exposures.  The survey design used stratified random selection of workers in 
all jobs and areas, and sought to determine whether consistent differences 
could be found between job groups based on average magnetic field exposures. 
With 252 personal measurements, individual averages ranged from 0.20 to 86.2 
milligauss (mG). Though large electric motors were confirmed to be strong MF 
sources, production operators in those areas did not have elevated exposures, 
since their tasks did not require them to be close to the motors for extended 
periods. Exposure differences between a priori job groups were tested with 
ANOVA on log-transformed exposures. This analysis showed that between-group 
variability exceeded within-group variability, with significant overlap among 
exposures to non-electricians.  Geometric means (GMs) for these a priori 
groups ranged from 0.80 to 3.95 mG. Job groups having great variability were 
then subdivided, based on location or job title, to enable reasonably precise 
estimates to be made using arithmetic means (AM) for these subgroups, which 
ranged from 0.43 to 24.9 mG. Many electrical workers in maintenance jobs were 
found to have only slightly elevated exposures.  Workers in one old office 
building also had slight elevations in exposure (AM=2.7 mG). Only about 7 
percent of the worktime of this cohort appears to have been spent at average 
exposures above 3 mG, despite the daily consumption of more than 1500 
megawatts of electrical power at this plant.

<H2>320. Estimating Retrospective Exposures of Workers in a Beryllium 
Manufacturing Plant.</H2>
<B>W. Sanderson</B>, M. Petersen, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Beryllium is known to be toxic to the lungs, causing both acute chemical 
pneumonitis and chronic berylliosis.  Beryllium has also been associated with 
increased lung cancer. In attempts to reduce workers' risk for these 
diseases, airborne beryllium exposures have been monitored since the 1940s. 
This presentation describes the various methods that have been used to 
measure airborne beryllium concentrations and how historical measurements 
were used to create a matrix for categorizing workers by potential exposure 
level in a lung cancer control study.<P>
Airborne beryllium concentrations have been measured using all-glass 
impingers, high volume filter papers, and personal respirable and total dust 
samplers.  Comparing simultaneously collected samples, time-weighted average 
estimates based on high-volume filter samples were on average 1.5 times lower 
than estimates based on personal total dust samples but 2.0 times higher than 
personal respirable dust samples. In order to provide consistency in exposure 
estimates over time, measurements collected by the other monitoring methods 
were converted to approximate the most frequently used high-volume, 
time-weighted average measurements.  Over 7000 historical measurements were 
available to estimate the beryllium exposures of workers over time. Average 
exposures between jobs varied considerably and exposures for all jobs 
decreased dramatically between the 1940s and 1970s due to major plant 
production changes.  For example, the average exposure of the arc furnace 
operators in the 1940s was estimated to be 131 &#181;g/M&#179; but only 3.4 
&#181;g/M&#179; in the 1970s.  While the average exposure of the rollingmill 
operators was estimated to be 14.8 &#181;g/M&#179; in the 1940s and 0.09 
&#181;g/M&#179; in the 1970s. Because industrial hygiene measurements were 
not collected in every year for all jobs throughout the duration of the 
case-control study, exposure estimates had to extrapolated from the existing 
measurements over time and across jobs.<P>
Although some inaccuracy in the exposure estimates for the cases and controls 
is likely to occur due to the limitations of the exposure assessment data, 
the exposure matrix provides a reasonable, objective mechanism for 
categorizing workers by the relative exposures that they were likely to have 
encountered during their tenure.

<H2>321. Chronic Beryllium Disease and Beryllium Sensitization at Rocky 
Flats: A Case-Control Study.</H2>
<B>S. Viet</B>, M.H. Chew & Assoc., Inc., Golden, CO; J. Torma-Krajewski, 
DOE , Rocky Flats Field Office, Golden, CO<P>
A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the risk of chronic beryllium 
disease (CBD) and beryllium sensitization (SENS) associated with various 
levels of historical beryllium exposure at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons 
facility.  The purpose of the study was to determine whether the current 
occupational beryllium standard of 2 ug/m&#179; provides adequate worker 
protection during facility decommissioning and conversion efforts.<P>
As of October 1994, the Beryllium Health Surveillance Program at Rocky Flats 
had identified 50 CBD cases and 74 SENS cases by the blood lymphocyte 
proliferation test (BLPT) and follow-up diagnostic examinations. Each of 
these cases was matched to a control of the same age group, race, gender, and 
smoking status who tested negative by BLPT.  A job exposure matrix was 
developed from beryllium air sampling data available from 1960 to present and 
questionnaire data regarding job history.  Job titles were assigned factors 
from 1 to 10 based on exposure relative to a beryllium machinist.  Building 
areas were assigned factors from 0 to 10 based on exposure compared to the 
Building 444 Beryllium Machine Shop. Concurrence on these factors was 
obtained from past and present Rocky Flats industrial hygienists.  Using the 
matrix, long-term average exposure and cumulative exposure were estimated for 
each subject.<P>
Both long-term average and cumulative exposures were found to be 
significantly higher for CBD cases as compared to their controls by matched 
t-test (p=0.001). Also, the odds ratio rose statistically above 1.0 with 
increasing exposures suggesting a dose-response relationship for CBD. These 
trends were not observed for SENS cases as compared to their controls.

<H2>322. Experimental and Clinical Data about the Influence of Certain 
Industrial Harmful Substances on the Generative Function of the Male.</H2>
<B>E. Babayan</B>, R. Dartian, V. Gabuchian, L. Vartazarian, Institute of 
General Hygiene, Yerevan, Armenia<P>
In chronic experiments on white rats exposed to potassium copper, 
inolybdenum, bismuth, and lead, a development of gonadotropic effect was 
established.  The results of the experimental investigations were the cause 
to carry out a thorough clinical and laboratory examination of workers 
exposed to high concentrations of these substances in production. In total, 
165 workers were examined.  From them, 31 were exposed to the influence of 
ethyl and 47 to buthil zantates of potassium, 9 to lead oxide, 48 to 
molybdenum, 30 to copper. As a control in each production the adequate number 
of intact workers were examined.  The program of investigations included 
sociological questioning according to a specially worked out questionnaire, 
examination of the sperm as well as radioimmunological examination of blood 
to determine in it the hormones of hyprophis and testicles.  The results of 
the investigations revealed that many of the examined workers complained 
about the disturbance of the sexual function, impotence, and weakness. The 
questioning showed that the women had frequent spontaneous abortions (lead, 
xantates), birth of distrophical children (all substances), birth of mentally 
nondeveloped children and sterility (lead, xantates).  The spermatological 
investigations showed a decline of the volume of the ejaculate and the 
quantity of mobile spermatozoa.  In workers with job experience of more than 
10 years, the quantity of the degenerative form of the spermatozoa was 
higher, the level of fructose in the ejaculate was lower. In the workers of 
this category, cases of origozoospermy, azoospermy, and necrozoospermy were 
considerably more frequent in comparison with the workers with less job 
experience.  The radioimmunological investigations of the workers' blood 
having an industrial contact with chloroprene with lead xantates revealed 
serious disturbances of digestion of testeron and gonadotropic hormones of 
hyprophis.  On the basis of the data obtained, a conclusion is made that the 
disturbance of male's reproductive function under the influence of 
chloroprene, lead, and xantates carries a selective nature whereas that of 
copper and molybdienium is a manifestation of general toxic action.

<H2>323. PC Database for Industrial Hygiene Measurement Data: A General 
Application for Occupational Epidemiologic Studies.</H2>
<B>D. Utterback</B>, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH; K. Fraeman, J. Quarantillo, J. 
Rayner, Westat Inc., Rockville, MD<P>
Identification and collection of exposure data are crucial to the success of 
many occupational epidemiology studies.  To date, the process of coding this 
information into a database has required the development of custom 
programming for each of the studies.  A relational database package with a 
generalized and systematic format for industrial hygiene data has now been 
designed and developed to address needs across many retrospective studies. 
The system is programmed in SAS running on a Windows&#174; platform for 
personal computers.  A data entry portion of the system is also available as 
a MicroSoft ACCESS&#174; application.  More than 80 variables which may be 
available in industrial hygiene survey data may be stored in tables and 
labelled as Survey, Sample Collection, Sample Subject, and Analysis. Each of 
the data tables has an associated comment table for additional information 
which may be required for exposure assessment. Built-in range and logic 
checks prevent inappropriate data entry for many of the variables. The system 
supports standardized queries, reports, and graphical representation of data 
needed for retrospective exposure assessment.  Linkages to external job or 
task-based exposure assessments as well as demographic files are also 
features of the database.  This database should have broad application within 
occupational epidemiology studies where industrial hygiene measurement data 
may be used for retrospective exposure assessment.

<H2>324. Evaluation of Relationships Within and Between Worker Groups Exposed 
to Fibers.</H2>
<B>R. Goodman</B>, IT Corporation, Cincinnati, OH; C. Rice, J. Lockey, P. 
Succop, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH<P>
The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between 
exposures for the same worker with uniform job titles and uniform groupings 
of job titles (e.g., dust zones) at nine facilities that manufactured 
products from fibers.  Quarterly sampling was conducted at manufacturing 
facilities according to a sampling protocol prepared by the University of 
Cincinnati's Department of Environmental Health.  This protocol specified 
random selection of 10% of workers within each job title within designated 
dust zones during each sampling period. The uniform job titles were 
associated with dust zones.  The dust zones were determined a priori based on 
observations regarding worker activities. The samples were analyzed according 
to NIOSH method 7400 and B counting rules with the results converted to 
time-weighted averages for the sampling period.  A total of 954 samples were 
collected and analyzed according to the sampling protocol at these facilities 
since 1987.<P>
A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether any 
statistically significant differences existed within a uniform job title by 
worker for each facility.  Statistically significant differences tended to be 
associated with jobs having multiple work locations (e.g., supervisors 
exposure ranged from 0.02 to 0.19 f/cc) or variable activities (e.g., 
production of small parts to meet specific customer need exposures ranged 
from 0.03 to 0.45 f/cc). Exposures at jobs conducted at a single work station 
were generally not worker dependent (e.g., product takeoff exposure ranged 
from 0.03-0.07 g/cc). A two-way ANOVA was used to determine whether there 
were any statistically significant differences between grouping of uniform 
job titles within dust zones for each facility. Significant differences were 
identified between exposures of supervisors and those being supervised.  The 
evaluation provides information on the relationship both within and between 
worker's exposure to one type of fiber and may be useful in exposure 
assessments to other types of fibers.

<H2>325. An Investigation of Secondary Exposure Misclassification Effects of 
Lifelong Occupational History in Exposure Estimation.</H2>
<B>N. Esmen</B>, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK<P>
The effects of exposure misclassification on the results of occupational 
epidemiological studies has been widely investigated and reported. The 
primary assumption of these investigations is the non-differential nature of 
the exposure misclassification. Under this assumption, the effects of even a 
high rate of misclassification may be corrected. In most of these 
investigations, a systematic consideration of secondary misclassification 
errors such as differential rates of smoking among different occupations, job 
distinctions as a function of socioeconomic variables, the prevalence of 
local, regional, or ethnic dietary preferences, a possible correlation 
between ethnicity and job classification have not been reported. The 
theoretical constructs of the secondary misclassification effects suggests 
that under a number of generalized conditions and confounding variables, the 
misclassification errors cannot be assumed to be non-differential. These 
biases can be sufficiently severe to cause trend reversal and/or spurious 
false positive or negative outcomes.<P>
The theoretical constructs of the secondary misclassification effects may be 
investigated heuristically by using the results of a community based 
occupational exposure analysis for case-control study.  Using proxy reported 
distributions of lifetime employment profiles, the employment characteristics 
for over 700 decedents were modeled.  The results suggest that even the 
purely descriptive analysis of the occupational profiles provides an insight 
to the wide variety of potential difficulties and limitations due to 
secondary misclassification.  While few specific suggestions emerge from the 
theory and analysis, the inclusion of extensive recording of the work history 
of the subjects emerges as a reasonable basis for the investigation and 
reduction of secondary misclassification of exposures in occupational 
epidemiological studies.

<H2>326. A Coding System for Abstracting Symptoms Related to Indoor Air 
Quality Problems: Implications for the Investigation of Indoor Air Quality 
Problems.</H2>
<B>J. Guernsey</B>, G. Sherwood, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada<P>
Current methods of recording symptoms related to indoor air quality, 
including checklists and self-administered questionnaires, are highly 
sensitive but are potentially low in specificity. In order to capture a wider 
range of symptoms associated with indoor air quality problems, a hierarchial 
data abstraction coding system was developed specifically for obtaining 
symptom information from occupational health clinical records. The 
development of this system was based on a thorough review of indoor air 
quality literature and the abstraction of a randomly selected sample of the 
occupational health clinical records of 25 subjects involved in a complex 
indoor air quality problem. The principal advantage to this semi-quantitative 
approach to clinical data abstraction is a user-friendly database which is 
organized and standardized, allowing for ease of coding, computer storage and 
retrieval, and statistical analysis yet allows for the inclusion of 
additional data from the patients' charts as required.  This flexibility 
transfers to a broader understanding of the nature and etiology of indoor air 
problems.  Of the 356 visits made by the 25 individuals over the five-year 
study period, 13% reported dizziness, 12% reported significant memory loss, 
4% indicated lapses in concentration, and 1% indicated severe sense of 
intoxication_suggesting a larger role for neurotoxic agents in this indoor 
air quality investigation than would have been detected by conventional 
means.

<H2>327. Occupational Asthma in Medical Imaging.</H2>
<B>G. Byrns</B>, USPHS Indian Health Service, Rockville, MD; L. Shands, 
USPHS - NAIHS - OHSMB, Window Rock, AZ<P>
Poor ventilation, unsafe practices, and lack of recognition may contribute to 
occupational asthma in susceptible medical imaging personnel. Radiographic 
processing chemicals contain such substances as acetic acid, diethylene 
glycol, glutaraldehyde, hydro quinone, potassium hydroxide, sodium sulphite, 
phenidone (1-Phenyl-3-Pyrazolidone), aluminum sulphate, and ammonium 
thiosulfate. These chemicals may cause dermal and pulmonary irritation and at 
least two chemicals, glutaraldehyde and hydro quinone, cause chemical 
sensitization.<P>
An investigation of Indian Health Service medical monitoring imaging 
departments was initiated after two radiological technologists in different 
facilities were diagnosed with occupational asthma.  Affected individuals 
complained of respiratory problems, dizziness, and other ailments. Symptoms 
were deemed to be serious enough to warrant removal of these individuals from 
the department.<P>
The investigation consisted of a review of products and procedures, airborne 
sampling, and ventilation measurements. Findings indicated: insufficient 
darkroom ventilation, inappropriate automatic processor venting, unsafe 
equipment, and poor operator practices.  These conditions were likely 
contributors to the occupational asthma.  Recommendations for improvement 
included improvements in ventilation; purchase of auto-mixes; use of personal 
protective equipment during processor cleaning; re-assignment of affected 
individuals; and medical intervention.<P>
Occupational asthma is a little recognized hazard associated with medical 
imaging.  Effective intervention requires a proactive, cooperative effort of 
occupational safety and health specialists, physicians with experience in 
occupational health, ventilation engineers, and personnel specialists.

<H2>328. Five Years of Body Substance Exposures at a University Hospital.</H2>
<B>E. Aton</B>, V. Fraser, P. L'Ecuyer, Barnes Hospital, Saint Louis, MO<P>
Institutions must analyze employee exposures to infectious materials in order 
to design effective prevention strategies.  Barnes Hospital began tracking 
body substance exposures (BSEs) in September 1990. Over five years there were 
2181 BSEs including 1386 (63%) needlesticks; 331 (15%) splashes; 246 (11%) 
instrument injuries; and 109 (5%) patient bites or scratches.  Regular 
nursing personnel had 799 (37%); support personnel 411 (19%); emergency and 
operating room personnel 417 (19%); house staff physicians 283 (13%); and 
intensive care nursing personnel 155 (7%) BSEs. There was a 17% decrease in 
the average number of BSEs reported annually over five years, from 40/month 
to 33/month, p&lt;0.003. We compiled data from 09/92 through 08/95 to analyze 
reported BSEs, OSHA-defined exposure incidents, (EIs) and 200-log recordable 
events. Of 1255 BSEs, 595 (47%) were EIs and 136 (11%) were 200-log 
recordable events.<P> 
Data from 09/92 through 08/94 was analyzed to assess employee compliance with 
Hepatitis B Vaccine (HBV) and frequency of exposure source identification. 
Six-hundred-fifty-nine (77%) of the 860 exposed employees had completed HBV. 
Employees identified the source patient in 655 (76%) of BSEs compared to 407 
(89%) of EIs (p&lt;0.001).<P>
Multiple worker groups are at risk for BSEs but successful programs can 
decrease BSE rates. Comparison of BSEs with EIs and 200-log recordable 
exposures suggest that institutions not rely on 200-log data or EI data alone 
to analyze factors associated with and strategies for prevention of exposures 
to infectious materials.  Also, many healthcare workers at risk of BSE at 
this institution are protected by HBV, and occupational health personnel will 
generally have exposure source data to assess employee treatment.

<H2>465. Investigation of Acquired Dyschromatopsia in Workers Exposed to 
Tetrachloroethylene.</H2>
<B>A. Buch</B>, Anderson Columbia Environmental, Inc., Lake City, FL; C. 
Pfaffenberger, Metro Dade Department of Environmental, Miami, FL; T. Khalil, 
Coral Gables, FL<P>
There is a growing body of research that has investigated the connection 
between occupational exposure to solvents and a degenerative retinal 
condition known as acquired dyschromatopsia. It has been postulated that this 
condition may preclude more apparent neurotoxicological manifestations as the 
majority of these studies were performed with solvents of known 
neurotoxicological properties on subjects who otherwise appeared normal.<P>
A study was therefore performed to determine whether the same results might 
be found on subjects occupationally exposed to solvents of milder neurotoxic 
properties.  Tetrachloroethylene was therefore investigated as its exclusive 
commercial use in dry cleaning establishments resulted in a large exposed 
population and little, if any confounding effects from other solvents. 
Prospective candidates were solicited from the Metro Dade population of dry 
cleaning employees and were subjected to a comprehensive medical 
questionnaire to eliminate those whose exposures to ailments, medications, 
and other criteria would result in a similar condition.  Thirty-two subjects 
were selected as candidates and were matched with controls of the same age 
and gender. Controls were from Metro Dade population and were subjected to 
the same medical history questionnaire and were not previously employed in 
the dry cleaning industry or industries utilizing known to produce the same 
effect.<P>
All subjects were tested using a specialized graph to determine the type of 
dyschromatopsia and were then converted to a quantitative score using an 
equation written specifically for this type of test.  Qualitative results 
were then further broken down into level of deficit ranging from severe 
through moderate to no observed deficit.  Quantitative results were 
statistically analyzed with respect to age, gender, and eye side.<P>
Qualitative results showed that 70% of the exposed group suffered the deficit 
at levels from mild to severe versus only 5% of the control group whose 
results extended into the mild level. Statistical analysis demonstrated a 
strong significant difference between control versus exposed groups P (2,32) 
= 0.0002; alpha = 0.05. It is concluded that the solvent Tetrachloroethylene, 
used in dry cleaning industry, appears to possess an added neurotoxic effect 
of interfering with the color receptive properties of the retina. In 
addition, this study appears to demonstrate that this form of neurotoxicity 
monitoring can be used for employees exposed to mild neurotoxins.

<TITLE>Management Issues In Ergonomics Papers</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H1>Management Issues In Ergonomics Papers (199-206)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>199. Workers' Compensation Claims and Ergonomics: Examination of the 
Data in North Carolina.</H2>
<B>A. Snow</B>, M. Ayoub, A. Waldorf, North Carolina Ergonomics Resource 
Center, Raleigh, NC<P>
Prevention of ergonomic related workers' compensation claims and their 
associated costs can be a strong motivator for industry to implement sound 
ergonomic programs.  It has been estimated that ergonomic related workers' 
compensation claims account for more than 50% of all workers' compensation 
costs in the state of North Carolina.  The direct and indirect costs of 
workers' compensation claims for industry are significant; and unfortunately 
employees may also suffer with a lifetime of costs in disability.  We have 
taken a very close look at ergonomic related workers' compensation claims 
data in North Carolina to clearly identify risks and aggressively address, 
through outreach and education, areas with potential ergonomic deficiencies.<P>
The North Carolina Industrial Commission receives workers' compensation 
claims from across the state and maintains a database of these claims.  A 
subset of "ergonomic related" workers' compensation claims was extracted from 
this database and spans a period of five years.  The database has been 
analyzed for relationships with 1) claimant's county of employment; 2) 
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes; 3) Standard Occupational 
Classification (SOC) codes; 4) body part; and 5) some demographic parameters. 
Results of each analysis are reported as estimated incidence rates and 
relative risks, cost comparisons (medical, compensation, and settlements), 
comparisons of average lost work day rates, and "lifetimes" of claims.  For 
example, analysis by claimant's county of employment resulted in four 
ergonomic stressor exposure categories across the state, "very high," "high," 
"moderate," or "low." The risk of an ergonomic related claim in the "very 
high" exposure counties is 3.7 times the risk in low exposure counties.

<H2>200. North Carolina OSH Ergonomics Enforcement Strategy: Industry Impact 
and Response.</H2>
<B>M. Lewis</B>, North Carolina DOL, Raleigh, NC; A. Snow, A. Waldorf, North 
Carolina Ergonomics Resource Center, Raleigh, NC<P>
Recently, federal OSHA and industry have debated the need for general 
industry ergonomics standard and the potential impact of a standard.  The 
Occupational Safety and Division of the North Carolina Department of Labor 
(NC OSH) has conducted and continues to conduct ergonomic inspections in a 
variety of industries across the state.  Historically, inspections occurred 
as the result of an employee complaint or referral, and follow a very 
thorough risk assessment methodology.  The methodology requires data input 
from recordkeeping, employee pain surveys, and objective worksite analysis. 
Data analysis results must meet the requirements of a general duty violation 
to support a citation.<P>
NC OSH has surveyed employers who were recently inspected on the basis of 
alleged ergonomics hazards in their workplace.  Survey questions were in two 
primary categories: 1) assessment of the results and impact of the inspection 
and/or in-house activities catalyzed by the inspection on existing and/or 
developing ergonomics programs; and 2) response to and evaluation of the NC 
OSH inspection process.  Employers responded with quantitative results 
supporting the benefits of sound ergonomics programs in the workplace.  
Quantitative results include, but are not limited to, declines in the 
incidence rates of ergonomic related OSHA 200 log recordable and workers' 
compensation claims, and reductions in lost work days.  NC OSH's ergonomics 
enforcement strategy has encouraged employers to reduce ergonomic stressors 
in their workplaces, which can prevent pain for the workforce and eliminate 
associated costs, direct and indirect, for the employer.

<H2>201. Use of Participatory Ergonomics Teams to Address Musculoskeletal 
Hazards in the Red Meat Packing Industry.</H2>
<B>J. Moore</B>, University of Texas Health Center at Tyler, Tyler, TX; A. 
Garg, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI<P>
Participatory ergonomics teams from two departments of a pork slaughtering 
plant analyzed musculoskeletal hazards and proposed ergonomics solutions for 
several jobs in the plant.  The jobs were targeted based on association with 
a large number of injuries, one or more particularly severe injuries, high 
workers' compensation expenses, and/or high turnover plus absence of obvious 
solutions to abate hazards.  The teams used a structured problem-solving 
method that was generally derived from principles associated with quality 
improvement process.  Workers performing the targeted jobs were involved in 
the problem-solving process, even if they were not members of the team.  The 
effectiveness of each team was assessed and compared in terms of the number 
of problem jobs addressed and feedback from team members. One team addressed 
all nine of its targeted jobs; the other team addressed 8 of 12 targeted 
jobs.  Feedback from team members regarding their teams' methods and 
performance were generally favorable.  The major obstacle to effective team 
functioning in this project was the scheduling of meetings.  There were also 
some obstacles related to team leadership.  Overall, this project 
demonstrated that the use of participatory ergonomics teams that rely on 
structured problem-solving methods are able to work effectively to address 
musculoskeletal hazards, especially related to upper extremities, in the red 
meat packing industry.

<H2>202. Attitudes That Impede Ergonomics Programs.</H2>
<B>R. Thomas</B>, Auburn University, Auburn University, AL<P>
Occupational safety and health (OS&H) professionals are challenged with 
implementing and maintaining ergonomics programs.  One of the "lessons 
learned" in recent years is that common negative attitudes regarding 
ergonomics exists in most organizations. Frequently encountered negative 
attitudes include: 1) ergonomics is "just common sense!"; 2) we shouldn't be 
"saddled" with ergonomics; 3) everybody is human...just like me!; 4) 
ergonomics doesn't pay! OS&H professionals should anticipate these attitudes 
and be prepared to counter them as a part of their overall program efforts. 
Ergonomics, as a science, has sufficiently developed that it provides strong 
counter arguments to each of these negative attitudes.

<H2>203. Ergonomics Ideas: Disseminating Successful Job Designs to the Mining 
Industry.</H2>
<B>S. Gallagher</B>, K. Cornelius, L. Steiner, U.S. Bureau of Mines, 
Pittsburgh, PA<P>
Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the number of ergonomics 
committees being established in the mining industry.  Some of these 
committees have been active for quite some time and have demonstrated 
significant reductions in lost-time injuries, particularly those to the low 
back.  Unfortunately, the industry remains largely unaware of the successful 
job redesign efforts performed by these committees, despite the willingness 
of companies to share many of these ideas.  As a result, the U.S. Bureau of 
Mines has undertaken to document and distribute many of the ergonomics ideas 
developed by the industry in order to achieve a widespread dissemination of 
the information.<P>
A one-page format has been adopted by the Bureau of Mines to describe the 
recommended job changes.  The top half describes (using illustrations and 
text) the original methods or procedures used to perform a certain job or 
task, and enumerates the risk factors associated with the original work 
practices.  Similarly, the bottom half describes the methods used to reduce 
the ergonomic risk factors.  Information regarding the reduction of risk 
factors and other benefits (injury reduction, cost or manpower savings, 
increased production or efficiency) are all included at the bottom of the 
page.<P>
A number of ergonomics ideas have already been completed, and have been 
posted on the Bureau of Mines World Wide Web Site (http://ergomine.usbm.gov). 
As more ideas are documented, they will continue to be posted on the Web Site 
listed above, and will be collected and published in a bound volume, which 
will be disseminated throughout the industry.  The sharing of these ergonomic 
job redesigns is an important means of supporting both new and existing 
ergonomic efforts in the mining industry. 

<H2>204. Department of Defense Ergonomics Working Group Activities.</H2>
<B>M. Lopez</B>, U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency, Aberdeen Proving 
Ground, MD<P>
The Department of Defense (DOD) has formed the largest ergonomic working 
group in corporate America.  The working group was formed to consolidate and 
focus the expertise in DOD, rather than individual services duplicating 
efforts on policies and initiatives.  This is a high-powered group, 
representing the ergonomic experts from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine 
Corps, Defense Logistics Agency, Army Research Laboratories, Coast Guard, 
OSHA, and NIOSH.  The group functions as the technical adviser to the DOD 
Safety and Occupational Health Committee regarding work-related 
musculoskeletal disorders.  The group is responsible for policy and program 
execution issues related to ergonomics and is committed to inter-service 
coordination and cooperation.  The members have focused on several issues, 
starting with the description of the ergonomics-related problems in the 
Department of Defense.  The group is working to identify the number of 
workers and service members affected by specific diagnoses and the costs 
associated with these conditions.  The group has outlined a DOD wide 
ergonomics training course, establishing standards and a consistent quality 
training which reflects the state-of-the-art in the field of ergonomics.  The 
group has drafted a DOD wide instruction on ergonomics programs as a guiding 
document to ensure program consistency and appropriate content. Members are 
examining the application of risk assessment codes to hazards in order to 
improve the field survey process.  The group has established a formal 
partnership with the Department of Energy to share an occupational ergonomic 
analysis software program and other ergonomics-related products.  In 
conclusion, this working group demonstrates the benefits of inter-service 
cooperation and sharing, producing significantly more than the individual 
services alone.

<H2>205. Assessment of an In-House Ergonomics Training Program.</H2>
<B>J. Pentikis</B>, M. Lopez, U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency, 
Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD<P>
Numerous courses have been developed to instruct professionals in the 
principles of ergonomics; however, follow-up surveys relating to the 
usefulness of training are not conducted.  The U.S. Army has developed a 
40-hour ergonomics training class to produce "ergonomic technicians" as 
defined by OSHA.  To evaluate training class effectiveness, the U.S. Army has 
begun to assess training materials used, the confidence of trainees in 
performing an ergonomics survey, and the amount of ergonomics services 
(training and worksite evaluations) performed by trainees. Questionnaires 
were mailed to all participants one year after completing an ergonomics 
training course in 1994.  Survey results indicated that training materials 
developed in-house were 36 percent more likely to be used than vendor 
resources because of the specifity of the materials to the trainee.  
Additional data analysis indicates that each course participant conducted an 
average of two surveys with 93 percent performing at least on survey.  
Training, however, was only performed by 71 percent of the participants.  
Participants indicated other training obligations prevented them from 
providing more ergonomics services.  Finally, confidence in performing 
ergonomic services was gauged on a 1-5 rating scale, with 5 being the score 
for highest confidence.  The average score was 3.8.  The reason cited most 
often for high confidence was the participation in an ergonomics survey as 
part of the training course.<P>
In conclusion, a successful in-house ergonomics training course should 
provide training materials tailored to the needs of the course participants 
and promote confidence in their ability to perform an ergonomics survey 
through hands-on experience.  To fully realize the impact of ergonomic 
training, industrial hygiene, medical, or safety programs need sufficient 
staffing to allow trainees to perform as many ergonomics services as 
necessary without sacrificing other elements of the program.

<H2>206. Analysis of Accident Records to Assess the Needs and Focus for an 
Ergonomics Program at a Multifaceted Public University.</H2>
<B>E. Kraft</B>, R. Thomas, Auburn University, Auburn University, AL<P>
Although many corporations have implemented ergonomic programs, there is no 
evidence in the literature of an ergonomics program for a public university. 
Public universities are not required by law to comply with OSHA regulations. 
A public university is not only an academic facility, but a public, business, 
and residential facility.  Thus, the needs of a university are different from 
the needs of a corporate ergonomics program, as a corporation is a business 
facility that must follow OSHA regulations.<P>
To determine the need for a university ergonomics program, 2186 accident 
reports from a public university accumulated during 1984 to 1994 were 
analyzed for trends.  The public university maintains records on all 
accidents regardless of whether they are recordable under OSHA requirements.<P>
Sprains/strains was the second largest leading type of employee injury 
constituting 18.04% of the 1680 injuries.  The average number of employee 
sprains/strains per year during 1990-1994 was significantly higher (alpha = 
0.05) than the average number of employee sprains/strains per year during 
1984-1989.  The distribution of employee sprains/strains by body parts was 
lower extremities (34.98%), backs (39.27%), and upper extremities (17.82%). 
Heavy objects and overexertion accounted for 30.19% and 18.87% of the upper 
extremity sprains/strains respectively, and 56.30% and 14.29% of the back 
sprains/strains. Student sprains/strains accounted for 5.51% of the 472 
student injuries.  Lower extremity sprains/strains accounted for 85.10% of 
the student sprains/strains and slip/fall was the cause of 77.78% of the 
student sprains/strains.<P>
Based on the accident records, it can be concluded that a university 
ergonomics program should focus on reducing employee sprains/strains caused 
by lifting heavy objects and overexerting the back and upper extremities.

<H2>19. The Relationship Between Low and Medium Keyboard Use Office Jobs and 
Upper Extremity Cumulative Trauma Disorders in a Cross-Sectional Study.</H2>
<B>S. Ulin</B>, T. Armstrong, W. Latko, A. Franzblau, University of 
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI<P>
Ergonomic risk factors such as repetition, forceful exertions, awkward 
positions and localized contact stress have been associated with the 
development of upper limb cumulative trauma disorders in office workers.  
Job exposure was assessed for four job categories: claims processor, 
customer service, associate underwriter, and underwriter.  Worker 
interviews, workplace inspection, time lapse video, real-time video and 
analyst ratings were used to assess ergonomic factors associated with each 
job category.  The ergonomic assessment revealed that claims processors 
spent the largest percentage of the day (41%) performing keyboard work, 
customer service representatives spent 24% and the underwriters spent only 
15% of the day using a keyboard.  Using a 10-point scale, ergonomists rated 
the repetition of the claims processor as 6, the highest repetition job in 
this study, where as the repetition of the underwriters was rated as 2,
the lowest job in this study. A survey of 164 workers (142 female, 22 male), 
116 of whom were in the four studied job categories, was also conducted and 
the survey included a self-administered questionnaire, physical examination 
of the upper extremities, electrodiagnostic assessment at both wrists, and 
anthropometric measurements.  The questionnaire collected information on 
demographics, medical history, upper extremity symptoms, tobacco usage and 
psychosocial factors.  Based on the final clinical assessment after the 
medical survey, 27% of the total study population had no symptoms or 
specific disease diagnoses, 13% had carpal tunnel syndrome, 16% were 
diagnosed with tendinitis, and 54% reported nonspecific discomfort in the 
upper extremities. Multi-variate analyses were performed to examine the 
relationship between medical history, anthropometric, demographic, 
psychosocial and ergonomic variables and medical diagnoses or reported 
symptoms.  The significant variables in the final model for carpal tunnel 
syndrome were history of surgery, gender, age, and wrist depth (Chi-square 
of model = 14.56, df=4, p=0.006). The difference between these jobs are not 
explained by the different levels of repetition.  The level of the ergonomic 
risk factors present in this population was in the low and medium range and 
the variance of the ergonomic assessment variables between the four job 
categories was very small. This does not mean that we would not see 
increased prevalence of symptoms or disease with high levels of repetition 
in office jobs.  Further studies to investigate the association between 
ergonomic, psychosocial, demographic, and medical factors in the development 
of upper limb disorders among office workers are needed.

<H2>20. Case Study of an Epidemic of Upper Extremity Disorders in a 
Corporate Office.</H2> 
<B>J. Moore</B>, University of Texas Health Center at Tyler, Tyler, TX; A. 
Garg, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI<P>
A corporate headquarters noted increased reporting of musculoskeletal 
disorders among its workers in late 1991. In mid-1992, the company hired a 
local consultant to address the problem. This person visited individual 
workstations and adjusted them in accordance with ANSI/HFS 100. The number 
of reported complaints increased during 1992 and 1993. In the spring of 
1993, the investigators met with organizational players, interviewed 13 
workers, and evaluated the morbidity data.  Morbidity was categorized 
according to body part and evaluated for relationships with gender, 
employment status, education level, age, duration of employment on current 
job, and duration of employment with the company were evaluated 
(c2, p&lt;0.05). Contributing factors believed to be related to the observed 
morbidity were grouped into five categories.  Category I, organizational 
factors affecting workers, included overtime, unaccustomed work, 
unreasonably rigid interpretation of ergonomics "criteria," and lack of 
worker involvement in problem identification.  Category II, psychosocial 
factors affecting workers, included overtime, perceived emotional stress, 
and lack of knowledge of musculoskeletal disorders.  Job dissatisfaction was 
not an issue.  Category III, organizational factors affecting the "system," 
included differing departmental agendas, inappropriate emphasis on 
workstation design and analysis, reliance on quick fixes, no appreciation of 
office work as a production process with limited capacity, and lack of 
appreciation that workers had problems in the past.  Category IV, medical 
management issues, included diagnostic misclassification and generic 
treatment protocols. Physical factors, such as furniture, equipment, VDT 
appliances, and their comfort and proper adjustment, were neither observed 
to be problems by the investigators nor considered problems by the workers.  
Lessons from this case study are (1) the etiology of musculoskeletal 
disorders in the office ergonomics is complex, e.g., multiple factors 
contribute to the problem; (2) those attempting to define and evaluate the 
problem must talk to workers; (3) compliance with the ANSI/HFS 100 standard 
did not solve this company's problem; (4) office work is a production 
process with finite capacity.

<H2>21. Development and Use of a Perceived-Risk Tool to Rank the Need for 
Office Ergonomics Evaluations.</H2> 
<B>R. Ogle</B>, E. Guy,  National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN<P>
The Metals and Ceramic Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory has 
approximately 300 employees.  In 1995, division management expressed a 
strong interest in reducing ergonomic risks to these people.  To help 
improve employee awareness and to ensure professional attention was placed 
on the highest risks first, the division industrial hygienist developed an 
ergonomics risk-ranking tool.  The tool was designed to be completed by 
office workers and researchers who had limited training in ergonomics.  
Workers were asked to assign numerical values to commonly accepted ergonomic 
risk factors.  Even though completion of the ranking tool by employees was 
made voluntary, over 50 percent of the division participated.  The sum of 
the risk values was used to prioritize the industrial hygienist's 
workplace/station evaluations.  Also, by reading the rating form, the user 
was given a brief overview of the primary ergonomics risk factors.  During 
the professional ergonomic assessment, the ranking tool was evaluated to 
determine its effectiveness at targeting higher risk people and in helping 
to improve ergonomic awareness. It was determined that with few exceptions, 
the ranking tool correctly targeted at-risk workers.  It also proved to be 
valuable in ensuring attention was given to potential ergonomic problems 
before injuries occurred. An unanticipated extra benefit was found; workers 
used the tool to communicate a variety of concerns.

<H2>22. Workplace Factors, Anthropometry and Musculoskeletal Discomfort 
among VDT Users.</H2>
<B>P. Tittiranonda</B>, S. Burastero, E. Wei, Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, Livermore, CA<P>
The increase in work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSD) which now 
accounts for over 62% of occupational illnesses (BLS '92). Workplace factors 
such as work postures and workstations have been linked to the development 
of WRMSD (Sauter '92). In addition, a difference in anthropometric 
dimensions among injured and non-injured female VDT operators has been 
reported (Green '89). This study examined the relationship between 
anthropometry workstation characteristics and work posture among VDT users 
with and without WRMSD.  A total of 78 heavy VDT users at the Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory completed a questionnaire on musculoskeletal 
discomfort in the upper extremities, onset of discomfort, severity, duration 
and frequency, demographic factors, and hours spent on the VDT.  Subjects 
filled out the questionnaire the same day their workstations, work postures, 
and anthropometry were measured.  Measurement data was collected by two 
trained observers on (1) work postures of the neck, shoulders, elbows, 
forearms, and wrists; (2) workstation dimensions and their relative 
distances to the user.  Of the 78 subjects, 47 (57%) were females and 35 
(43%) were males.  The reported average keyboard use was 5.1 hours 
(SD&#177;1.8) and average mouse use was 3.7 hours (SD&#177;2.2). Fifty-six 
(71%) reported having pain or discomfort somewhere in the upper limbs and 
torso and 49 (62%) reported having wrist or hand pain.  Pearson correlation 
analyses performed on anthropometry and work postures showed statistically 
significant correlations between shoulder breadth and right ulnar deviation 
(r=0.354, p&lt;0.01) and between abdominal depth and right shoulder flexion 
(r=0.273, p&lt;0.005). For the right side, significant correlations between 
different joint postures were observed between shoulder abduction and ulnar 
deviation (r=0.354, p&lt;0.005), shoulder flexion and wrist extension 
(r=0.237, p&lt;0.03), and shoulder flexion and elbow flexion (r=0.317, 
p&lt;0.05).  For both sides, significant correlations were observed between 
shoulder abduction and ulnar deviation (r=0.354, p&lt;0.05).  For both 
sides, significant correlation were observed between elbow flexion and wrist 
extension (Right: r=0.333, p&lt;0.01, Left: r=0.300, p&lt;0.005), and 
shoulder rotation and ulnar deviation (Right: r=0.209, p&lt;0.01, Left: 
r=0.237, p&lt;0.005). Logistical regression models indicated that right 
shoulder abduction and ulnar deviation were significantly associated to 
right hand discomfort (x2=8.36, p&lt;0.003 and x2=2.93, p=0.05, 
respectively). Left wrist extension and elbow flexion and left hand 
discomfort were significantly associated.  This study confirms the 
relationship between awkward postures (e.g., ulnar deviation and wrist 
extension) and hand discomfort. It further shows that certain anthropometric 
dimensions and workstation characteristics are related to work postures and 
can indirectly affect musculoskeletal symptoms.  Anthropometry such as 
shoulder breadth were significantly correlated with ulnar deviation, a 
significant predictor of right hand discomfort in this study.  Although 
significant effects of workstation characteristics were not detected, other 
studies have shown that an ergonomic variable such as relative keyboard 
height was a significant predictor of upper torso pain (Faucett '94) and arm 
discomfort (Sauter '91).  These results can help health and safety 
professionals incorporate anthropometric issues into their approach to 
ergonomic workstation evaluations.

<H2>23. Comparison of Three Methods for Assessing Workload During Computer 
Use: A Pilot Study Among Transcriptionists.</H2> 
<B>M. Homan</B>, T. Armstrong, C. Woolley, University of Michigan, Ann 
Arbor, MI<P>
Epidemiological studies suggest an exposure-response relationship between 
computer use and upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders.  Further 
understanding of this relationship requires methods for assessing the 
physical workload that are valid, reliable, and practical for large scale 
studies.  The specific aim of this work is to evaluate three methods for 
assessing the physical workload during computer use including worker self 
report, time lapse video analysis and electronic activity monitoring.  Once 
developed and evaluated, the long-term goal is to utilize these methods to 
evaluate exposure within an epidemiological study.<P>
The pilot study was conducted among five workers performing word processing 
functions across five days.  Self reported exposures were gathered through a 
questionnaire in which workers estimated the time spent performing specific 
tasks (i.e., typing, using mouse, writing). Time lapse analysis was used to 
determine the distribution of work tasks and hand activities by programming 
video cameras to record for one second each one minute interval.  
Additionally, five activity monitors were attached to the keyboards and 
computers of workers and programmed to record keystrokes and typing time 
within each successive 30-minute interval.<P>
Worker self-reports of daily typing time were consistently higher than that 
obtained from time lapse analysis or activity monitoring.  The average daily 
typing time from worker self reports was 5.86 (&#177;1.42 hours) compared 
to 2.60 (&#177;0.60 hours) and 2.62 (&#177;0.59 hours) obtained by time 
lapse analysis and activity monitoring, respectively. Approximately 50 
percent of the variance (R&#178;=0.50) was explained by the linear 
regression model comparing typing time data from time lapse analysis and 
activity monitoring. None of the variance was explained by the model 
(R&#178;=0.00) comparing data from worker self-reports and activity 
monitoring.  Time lapse showed that, on average, workers were involved in 
hand activities for 4.23 (&#177;1.0 hours) per day (i.e., typing, writing, 
using mouse, handling documents).<P>
The methods used in this study provided useful exposure information with 
minimal intrusion to the workers.  Additional information available from 
these methods include: number of keystrokes, keying rate, rest time, mouse 
use, etc. Development of activity monitors is underway to record mouse use 
and static holding of the hands above the keyboard.  Such methods are likely 
to be practical for gathering exposure information on a wide scale basis.  
Results from this pilot study suggest that workers may overestimate the 
actual time spent typing.  Relying on worker self-reported computer use 
within epidemiological studies, therefore, may bias the estimate of the 
exposure-response association.  To strengthen the results of this pilot 
study, it is recommended that these methods be used on larger worker 
populations with more heterogeneous exposure profiles (i.e., high and low 
typing activity).

<H2>24. Effects of Low, Medium, and High Keyboard Stiffness on Typing Force, 
EMG, and Subjective Preference Among Transcriptionists.</H2>
<B>M. Gerard</B>, Center for Ergonomics, Ann Arbor, MI; T. Armstrong, W. 
Latko, B. Martin, the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI<P>
The goal of this work was to determine the effects of keyboard stiffness on 
typing force, EMG, and subjective preference.  Each subject's own keyboard 
(with a positive key click and key activation force of 0.71 N) and three 
keyboards with no key click that were identical in design but had different 
key activation forces (0.28 N, 0.56 N, and 0.83 N) were used. Twenty-four 
female transcriptionists participated in the experiment.  The subjects' work 
involves transcribing interviews from audiotape.  Subjects typed on each 
keyboard for 15 minutes.  Each keyboard was mounted on a force platform and 
the keyboard reaction force and surface EMG of the finger flexors and finger 
extensors for the left hand were analyzed.  Subjects then used the keyboard 
at their workstation for approximately seven work days.  After this time 
subjects were again monitored as they typed for 15 minutes.  This procedure 
was repeated for all four keyboards.<P>
Ninetieth percentile APD finger flexor EMG was 17% MVC on the 0.71 N 
keyboard, 19.6% MVC on the 0.28 N keyboard, 21% on the 0.56 N keyboard, and 
23.8% on the 0.83 N keyboard. At the 50th percentile level finger flexor EMG 
was 5.4% MVC on the 0.71 N keyboard, 6% MVC on the 0.28 N keyboard, 6.3% on 
the 0.56 N keyboard, and 7.2% on the 0.83 N keyboard. Finger extensor EMG 
was significantly higher for the 0.83 N keyboard than the other keyboards 
at the 10th (2.9% MVC vs. 2.4-2.6% MVC), 50th (8.7% MVC vs. 7.5-7.7% MVC), 
and 90th (18.3% MVC vs. 15.6-16.4 % MVC) percentile levels of the APD 
distribution.<P>
Subjective discomfort was significantly higher for the 0.83 N keyboard than 
the other keyboards at the fingers (51% higher), wrist (77% higher), lower 
arm (87% higher), upper arm (27% higher) and overall (61% higher).  There 
were no significant differences in subjective discomfort for the shoulder 
and back/neck.  Seventeen subjects preferred their original keyboard most, 
four subjects preferred the 0.28 N keyboard, and three subjects preferred 
the 0.56 N keyboard most.<P>
The above results suggest that a positive key click may have a larger 
influence on finger flexor EMG and are preferred by transcriptionists. It 
also appears that lighter touch keyboards produce less finger flexor and 
finger extensor EMG and subjective discomfort.

<H1>Exposure Assessment Strategies Papers (111-122)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>111. Prediction of Personal Exposures to Toluene From Area 
Concentrations and Work Patterns Around a Rotogravure Press.</H2>
<B>M. Suero</B>, L. Conroy, J. Franke, R. Wadden, University of Illinois, 
Chicago, IL<P>
A two-day test was carried out at a rotogravure press room during press 
operation.  The purpose of the test was to collect data which would enable 
us to characterize rotogravure printing emission rates and worker exposures. 
One-hour air samples were simultaneously collected on charcoal tubes at 15 
locations within the press room for 12 production hours.  In addition, 
samples of inks, extenders, and other solvents were collected.  Samples were 
analyzed by flame ionization gas chromatography (GC-FID) for 20 speciated 
VOCs.  Ventilation data were collected at doors and ducts using a 
combination of pitot tube and hotwire anemometer measurements. Personal 
exposure samples were obtained with passive VOC dosimeters which were 
analyzed for benzene, toluene, and total VOC by GC-FID.<P>
The major chemical species found in the air samples was toluene, which 
represented more than 90% of the ambient VOCs in the samples.  Toluene, also 
at concentrations greater than 90%, was the major component of the inks, 
press solvent, and extenders.<P>
Three of nine workers in the press room exceeded the toluene TLV of 50 ppm. 
The data suggest that personal exposure is a function of both area 
concentration and time spent in work activities which put workers in close 
proximity to the press.  An equation was developed which described the link 
between area concentrations (A, ppm) and time spent within one meter of the 
presses (T, minutes) with personal exposure (E, ppm).  The form is E = 0.99A 
+ 0.17T, with an r&#178; = 0.98.<P>
Measured room air and exit concentrations were in reasonable agreement with 
the solvent use inventory.  The mass balance developed using measured air 
concentrations and ventilation rates gave a usage rate of 217 kg 
toluene/hour.  The estimated emission inventory for the same time period is 
186 - 323 kg toluene/hour.  The capture efficiency of the press dryers for 
toluene was determined to be greater than 90% from the test data.

<H2>112. Development and Implementation of an Exposure Assessment Program in 
a Research Environment.</H2>
<B>R. Hadley</B>, L. McLouth, T. Roberts, Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, Livermore, CA<P>
Exposure assessment is performed to anticipate, recognize, evaluate, and 
control potential workplace hazards so that all employees are assured a safe 
and healthful work environment.  The challenges are to recognize both real 
and potential exposures, to evaluate each as acceptable or unacceptable, and 
to recommend controls for all unacceptable exposures.  Recognition of 
exposures involves considering the tasks, agents, and workers.  Workers may 
be exposed to hazardous agents (chemical, physical, and biological) during 
the performance of tasks directly involving these agents, by incidental 
contact, or by the effects of nearby tasks performed by others.  A credible 
exposure assessment strategy considers all sources of exposure and 
prioritizes them based on risk: those perceived by employees; the real risk 
or hazard of the operation; and the risk of non-compliance with regulatory 
requirements.  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is a large 
multidisciplinary research laboratory with a large variety of hazards, 
constantly changing operations and a mobile group of workers.  Evaluation of 
these complex situations requires a sound, logical workplace exposure 
assessment and monitoring strategy to focus industrial hygiene, occupational 
medicine, and other occupational health resources on those work situations 
with the greatest potential for adverse health effects or risk.  LLNL has 
developed and implemented an exposure assessment program that goes beyond 
compliance and provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to the 
characterization of chemical, biological, and physical (noise, nonionizing 
radiation, and temperature extremes) stressors.  Assessments are conducted 
by industrial hygiene professionals with input from supervisors, employees, 
occupational health clinicians, and other resources that are familiar with 
the operation. Assessment information is documented in Oracle database and 
integrated with other health and safety data collection systems.

<H2>113. Statistics for Typically Small IH Data Sets.</H2>
<B>M. Thompson</B>, Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, NM<P>
A major problem with contemporary IH surveys is that data interpretation is 
highly subjective. Specifically, no tests are performed to assess the 
probability of underlying exposure patterns exceeding the applicable 
exposure limit for either average or highly exposed workers.  The methods 
described in the AIHA Occupational Exposure Assessment text are not useful 
in most surveys, because they require large numbers of personal samples 
(&gt;30) to function properly.<P>
Using distribution-free statistics (Z tests) and apparent-distribution 
statistics (t tests) it is possible to derive probability predictions for 
more typical IH survey sample sizes (3 to 24 personal samples).  
Additionally, it is assumed that the investigating IH will have an imperfect 
knowledge of the innumerable factors involved in variation of worker 
exposure.  Hence, some emphasis is given on methods to probe for association 
in small data sets.  This is important, because variation in worker 
exposures usually dwarfs the much smaller sampling and analytical errors 
that get so much attention.  Also, data probing will allow quantification of 
the relative effectiveness of various control measures.<P>
There is, however, an important problem with the design of IH studies.  The 
AIHA OEA text favors stratified random sampling, but this method is intended 
for epidemiological cohorts that are far larger than populations in IH 
surveys.  In IH surveys, this method will be an obstacle to determining the 
risks of highly exposed workers.  For example, if we have 15 personal 
samples, more than two stratifications is going to severely compromise the 
accuracy of our variance estimate (our calculated standard deviation is then 
a poor predictor of the underlying standard deviation).  Consequently, the 
power of any statistics we use will face a severe penalty.  To solve this, 
we have developed a protocol that does what the OEA committee desires to 
accomplish: information for the dose construction of any worker, but without 
the diluting of statistical power resulting from use of the AIHA protocol.

<H2>114. Redefining Our Approach to Exposure Assessment: Instantaneous 
Readout Equipment, Data Loggers and the Future.</H2>
<B>M. Fitzgerald</B>, Scientech, Rockville, MD<P>
The advent of instantaneous readout equipment for monitoring airborne 
concentrations of contaminants, and the more recent introduction of data 
loggers affords an opportunity to redefine our approach to exposure 
assessment.  The eight-hour time weighted average exposure assessment 
approach may miss the important short duration peak exposure--the dose 
significant periods.  The short turn around time of instantaneous read out 
equipment allows for a more biologically appropriate time weighted average 
period such as a breath.  Yet the amount of data from instantaneous read out 
devices connected directly to data loggers may be overwhelming.<P>
Mathematical considerations have been explored and a standardized approach 
to using data logged from instantaneous readout devices will be presented.  
The standardized approach will augment the 8-hour time weighted average with 
an "exposure profile."  The exposure profile includes, in addition to the 
8-hour time weighted average, an actual sample time weighted average, 
average 15 minute short-term exposure levels, maximum 15-minute short-term 
exposure levels, and several novel measures--the "breath max" or the highest 
reading by the device, T3 and T5 timed exposures which is time spent 3 or 5 
times above some predetermined exposure level (i.e., an action level, 
permissible exposure level or threshold limit value).  The goal of this 
presentation is to offer a standardized approach to data analysis and 
description of which can serve as the basis of this new approach to exposure 
assessment.

<H2>116. Simple Procedures for Calculating Confidence Intervals Around the 
Sample Mean and Exceedance Fraction Derived from Lognormally Distributed 
Data.</H2>
<B>P. Hewett</B>, NIOSH (DRDS), Morgantown, WV<P>
The determination that a work environment is acceptable or unacceptable is 
often based on the calculation of the mean exposure and/or exceedance 
fraction (i.e., the fraction of measurements expected to exceed an 
occupational exposure limit) for an employee or exposure group. Procedures 
for statistically comparing either the sample mean or exceedance fraction to 
some target (i.e., acceptable) value are either based on non-validated 
approximations to exact procedures or are difficult and uninviting.<P>
Simple procedures are introduced for calculating accurate estimates of the 
95% lower confidence limit (LCL) and 95% upper confidence limit (UCL) for a) 
the sample arithmetic mean; and b) the sample exceedance fraction for 
lognormally distributed exposure data.  The procedure for the arithmetic 
mean is adapted from Land's procedure for calculating "exact" confidence 
intervals around the mean of lognormally distributed data.  The procedure 
for the exceedance fraction is based on the Odeh and Owen tables of 
confidence limits on a proportion in one tail of the normal distribution. 
Both procedures are graphically based and require no hard-to-find 
references.  The resulting 90% confidence interval (5% is in each tail) 
indicates the degree of uncertainty in point estimates of the mean and 
exceedance fraction.  (This uncertainty is a function of both the inherent 
environmental variability in exposures and the sample size.)  The resulting 
confidence limits can also be used for hypothesis test by simply comparing 
the upper or lower confidence limit to target values, such as long-term mean 
OEL or an acceptable exceedance fraction. Consequently, these procedures can 
be used in lieu of a) the mean test procedures of the AIHA (AIHA 1991 
monograph on exposure assessment) and Rappaport and Selvin (AIHAJ 48:374-379, 
1987); and b) the exceedance fraction tests described by Tuggle (AIHAJ 
43:338-346, 1982).

<H2>117. Development of a Specific Profile for Assessing Exposures to 
Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons in an Aluminum Refinery.</H2>
<B>J. Farant</B>, M. Gariepy, McGill University, Montreal, Canada<P>
At present, exposures to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in aluminum 
refineries can be assessed by measuring a concentration of either benzene 
soluble materials (BSM), benzo (a) pyrene (BaP), 14 individual PAHs or a 
combination of these. These parameters afford little or no information as to 
the contribution over time of the main source of PAH exposures in this 
industry, namely, the coal tar pitch used to prepare the electrodes for the 
electrolytic process.  We have developed an index based on the ratio of the 
concentration of each of 20 of the most common PAHs found in an aluminum 
refinery to that of the known carcinogen BAP.  The 20 ratios, taken together, 
yielded a profile of PAH exposure for the various tasks performed in the 
industry.  The results presented are based on two-week duration 
investigations conducted during winter and summer months over a period of 
four years in a Soderberg aluminum refinery.  It was found that the ratio of 
individual particulate phase PAH concentration to that of BaP measured in 
the same sample varied less than 18% for all samples collected during any 
given investigation.  Vapor phase volatile PAH ratios showed greater 
variation, a fact attributable, in large part, to the monitoring procedure 
used.   It was also found that the ratios and the profile they afforded were 
directly related to the coal tar pitch used to prepare electrodes.  Thus, 
the ratios, or profiles obtained from these, found at all worksites, did not 
vary significantly from month to month or year to year as long as the coal 
tar pitch did not change.  The ratios obtained allowed a retrospective 
construction of profile for past years based solely on the concentrations of 
BaP measured.  An estimate of the overall toxic potential of PAH exposures 
can also be obtained based on the principle of BaP equivalency.  The results 
also confirmed that BaP is an excellent indicator of PAH exposure in 
aluminum refineries.

<H2>118. Exposure Assessment Strategies: The Practical Development of NEAS 
for Maintenance Activities.</H2>
<B>D. Zalk</B>, R. Kelly, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, 
CA<P>
New OSHA lead and asbestos standards for the construction industry add new 
urgency to the development of negative exposure assessments (NEAs).  The 
lead standard lists many maintenance activities that assume exposures above 
the PEL.  At considerable cost, this requires implementation of a range of 
controls until a NEA is complete.  The lead standard does not specify a "de 
minims" lead substrate concentration and industrial hygiene judgment is not 
acceptable to establish the NEA.<P>
Maintenance activities at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory involve 
"minuscule" (&lt;30 minutes) disturbances of leaded paint and 
asbestos-containing materials which are likely to result in significant 
exposures.  Traditional exposure assessment paradigms are difficult to apply 
to maintenance activities.  Work practices vary among employees, supervisors, 
and shops.  We limit the scope of an NEA to a given shop and a defined set 
of work procedures.  Employees within a shop are covered by a NEA, but 
similar work performed by other shops require an independent NEA.<P>
We established NEAs for minuscule work using a two-step procedure.  Step one 
involved controlled simulations of actual tasks to identify those likely to 
merit an NEA and to determine exposure reduction procedures.  Simulations 
used actual asbestos and lead substrates assembled in a dedicated trailer.  
Field monitoring of maintenance operations not resulting in significant 
exposure during the simulations was then performed.  NEAs have been 
developed for activities such as drilling 12 or fewer holes less than 
half-inch in diameter into asbestos-coated and lead-painted wallboard and 
removing bolts from asbestos-coated wallboard.  Procedures for the 
simulation of maintenance work, exposure reduction, monitoring and data 
analysis are presented.<P>
Work performed under the auspices of U.S. Department of Energy by the 
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory under contract W-7405-Eng-48.

<H2>119. Emission Factors for Toluene Parts Washing.</H2>
<B>C. Keil</B>, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH<P>
Emission factors are a useful way to describe pollutant release into indoor 
air spaces.  They may be used for worker exposure modelling, evaluating the 
effectiveness of engineering controls, developing exposure assessment 
strategies, and prioritizing control efforts.  Emission factors were 
developed for toluene emissions from a part washing operation which was part 
of a spray painting process.  Toluene is used to wash parts prior to 
entering a paint booth.  Toluene is kept in an open container and is applied 
to the parts by hand using a cloth rag.<P>
Ventilation in the room was characterized and measured using smoke tubes and 
anemometers. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) at the paint booth and other 
processes in the room provided the only mechanical ventilation.  Make-up air 
infiltrated into the room via open doors and window. Smoke tubes test 
indicated that the room could be described as an air space approaching 
well-mixed conditions.<P>
Sampling took place over two days.  Hourly air samples for toluene were 
collected at locations near the part washing station, in the paint booth 
exhaust, and at remote locations in the room. Ventilation rates were checked 
twice each day.  Process information was recorded continuously.<P>
Toluene concentrations near the wash station ranged from 1.75 to 61.2 
mg/m&#179;. The average concentrations at the sites at a distance from the 
washing ranged from 0.66 to 12.2 mg/m&#179;.<P>
The concentrations and ventilation information were used in a mixed space 
mass balance model to determine mass emission rates for each one hour sample 
period.  The paint booth captured 46 to 276 g toluene/min.  Uncaptured 
toluene emission rates into the room ranged from 23 to 322 g/min.  These 
emission rates agreed well with bulk inventory data maintained by the plant.<P>
Emission rates were compared with the total surface area of parts cleaned 
during the corresponding period.  This resulted in an emission factor of 9.5 
mg uncontrolled toluene emission into the work space per square inch of part 
washed.  The analysis also revealed that transfer of toluene from bulk 
container into the working container results in the uncontrolled emission of 
118 mg toluene into the workplace.  When both of these variables are 
considered, the model predicting toluene emissions has an r&#178; of 0.71.

<H2>120. Factors Affecting Microbial Levels in the Air and Bulk Machining 
Fluids.</H2>
<B>A. Virji</B>, D. Kriebel, S. Woskie, S. Sama, University of Massachusetts 
at Lowell, Lowell, MA<P>
Exposure assessment was conducted for an epidemiologic study aimed at 
investigating short-term respiratory effects of workers' exposure to 
machining fluids (MF) in a transmission manufacturing plant.  As part of the 
exposure assessment, a two stage culturable microbial impactor was used to 
collect viable microbes in the air.  At the time of air sampling, a sample 
of the bulk soluble MF was also collected as well as quantitative and 
qualitative data on the work environment, process and machine 
characteristics, and worker activities.  These factors were used to develop 
separate statistical models to estimate microbial levels in the air 
(log-CFU/m3) and the bulk MF (log-CFU/ml). Data on the Ph of the fluid, 
percent oil and tramp oil in the fluid, brand of the fluid, size of the tank 
holding the fluid, part metal, type of operation, machine enclosure, time 
since MF sump refill, season, indoor air temperature and humidity, number of 
machines with 10 feet, and distance of the impactor from the machine were 
used as predictors of microbial levels in multiple linear regression models. 
A step-wise procedure was used to determine the order of importance of 
predictors in the two models.<P>
For predicting microbial levels in the bulk MF, factors of statistical 
significance were Ph of the fluid, percent of tramp oil in the fluid and 
season.  For predicting microbial levels in the air, the statistically 
significant factors were distance of impactor from the machine, number of 
machines within 10 feet, machine enclosure and microbial levels in the bulk 
MF.<P>
This study shows that exposure measurements and qualitative and quantitative 
data on the work environment can be used in statistical models to study the 
determinants of workers' exposures to airborne contaminants.  These models 
can assist in prioritizing interventions for the control of hazards in the 
work environment.

<H2>121. Use of Employee Exposure Monitoring Data to Estimate Ambient Air 
Emissions.</H2>
<B>J. Brown</B>, Galson Corp., Latham, NY; M. Malachowski, Galson Corp., 
Hawthorne, NY<P>
With the promulgation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments of 1990, 
manufacturing facilities are required to estimate ambient air emissions by 
use of emissions sampling, mass balance, engineering estimates, or using 
published emission factors to estimate emissions.  If emission data or 
material balance information are not available, companies may use industrial 
hygiene data, both personal and general area monitoring, to determine what 
pollutants are being emitted from an emission point.<P>
Employee exposure monitoring data were collected and compiled in order to 
estimate the air emissions of a manufacturing operations.  Exposure data 
were used to calculate duct loading. Subsequent mass balance calculations 
were performed in order to determine if the facility's total emissions of 
particulates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were above the levels 
which would have required the facility to prepare a Title V operating permit 
under the CAA.  Employee exposure information was compared to results on 
subsequent stack emissions monitoring in order to access its usefulness in 
such applications.<P>
Use of employee exposure data proved to be a cost-effectiveness method of 
estimating ambient emissions and determining the applicability of the CAA 
operating permit program.
 
<H2>122. ISO and Beyond:  Implications of Global Standards for Established 
Industrial Hygiene Programs.</H2>
<B>A. Leibowitz</B>, ITT Defense and Electronics, McLean, VA<P>
A number of extraterritorial programs with IH implications have been 
developed.  ISO, EMAS, NAFTA and other such programs each approach health 
and safety from slightly different, at times conflicting, perspectives.  
Program managers are faced with the difficult task of selecting which path 
they will follow and how to accommodate other requirements once an initial 
choice is made. This selection process is often driven by forces other than 
concerns for employee or public health. Rather customer requirements or 
market control efforts will drive these decisions.  Given such impetus it is 
not unusual to experience difficulty in accommodating the increased 
paperwork and auditing burdens these standards introduce.<P>
Well-managed existing programs often face difficulty in adapting established 
practices to new formats.  some of the more successful approaches to 
managing this effort follow a standard path:<BR>
1) Initial baseline comparison of existing programs to new requirements;<BR>
2) Development of action plans to address each area of incompatibility;<BR>
3) Internal audit of completed actions; and<BR>
4) External validation of results.<P>
This is a living process which must be maintained over time.  A method to 
measure status must be incorporated into the overall management plan.

<H2>282. Human Nasal Passage Deposition: The Effect of Particle Size, 
Flowrate, and Anatomical Factors.</H2>
<B>J. Kesavanathan</B>, D. Swift, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD<P>
The nasal passage filters particles which enter the respiratory system. 
Previous human studies have shown a large inter-subject variation in nasal 
deposition for a given particle size and flowrate. Our previous study showed 
that particle size, nostril shape, and nasal passage cross-sectional area 
affect deposition at a constant flow rate of 30 1 min-&#185;. This study was 
conducted to determine the effect of nostril shape and nasal passage 
cross-sectional area at three constant flowrates on deposition efficiency in 
human subjects.  An empirical equation for deposition efficiency was derived 
from these experimental data.<P>
Ten healthy, nonsmoking adult subjects were included in this study. The 
nasal deposition efficiency, DEN, of 1-10 &#181;m diameter particles at 15, 
25, and 35 l min-&#185; constant flow rates was measured.  The nasal passage 
cross-sectional areas were measured by acoustic rhinometry, and the nostril 
dimensions (nostril length and width) were measured. A mixed non-linear SAS 
procedure was used to develop the best-fit empirical equation.  The results 
show that particle diameter, d<I>p</I>, flowrate Q, nostril length/width 
ratio, E, and minimum nasal cross-sectional area, A<I>m</I>, affect particle 
deposition (p&lt;0.06). The efficiency equation is:<P>
DE<I>n</I> = 1 - exp(-0.1 * d<I>p</I><I>1.78</I> * Q<I>1.12</I> * 
A<I>m-1.33</I> * E<I>1.26</I>)


<H2>283. Regional Deposition of Unattached Radon Progeny (Polonium-218) in 
Tracheobronchial Region.</H2>
<B>W. Li</B>, J. Xiong, B. Cohen, NYU Medical Center, Tuxedo, NY<P>
Indoor radon is one of the leading causes of lung cancer.  The unattached 
fraction of radon daughters that reached the tracheobronchial region of 
human airway deposits efficiently in tracheobronchial region because of its 
high diffusion coefficient. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
deposition of unattached Po-218 in tracheobronchial region and compare with 
the existing theories.<P>
To measure the regional deposition of Po-218, a method that used iodine 
vapor as a surrogate of Po-218 has been developed.  The experiments were 
conducted in a tracheobronchial replicate cast whose inner surface was 
coated with NaOH impregnated charcoal powder.  This coating can trap iodine 
molecules by converting iodine into iodide and idodate so that the iodine 
gas molecules, behaving like particles, stick to a surface upon contact. It 
has been shown experimentally that the efficiency of this coating is close 
to 100%. The deposition of iodine in the cast is determined by measuring the 
iodine concentration before and after the cast.<P>
The experiment has been conducted in the flow rate range of 5-50 LPM. It is 
found that the deposition of iodine can be described by diffusion in laminar 
flow.  This result is different from that observed in previous experiment 
with submicrometer size particles (40-200 nm) which showed that the 
deposition is between the estimate for diffusion in laminar flow and the 
estimate for the diffusion in plugflow.  Further study has shown that this 
discrepancy is caused by the difference in flow pattern through larynz 
(sinusoidal for the particle study vs. constant flow for the iodine study) 
and the effect of charge on particles.<P>
The result of this study will be useful in modeling not only the radon lung 
dosimetry but also the deposition of all vapor and nanometer size particles 
whose lung deposition is dominated by diffusion.

<H2>284. Universal Size-Distribution Aerosol Generator.</H2>
<B>C. Chen</B>, College of Public Health, Taipei,Taiwan; F. Cheng, W. Li, 
Institute of Environmental Engineering, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC; P. Baron, 
NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
A variety of aerosol generators have been developed to produce aerosol 
particles with different size distribution. Most of these aerosol generators 
can only be modified to produce aerosol particles of different count median 
diameter with about the same geometric standard deviation. No generator is 
specifically developed to produce particles having the same count median 
diameter but with different geometric standard deviation, which may be 
critical to some aerosol characteristics, such as optical and filter loading 
properties. Two computer-controlled peristaltic pumps were used to carry 
sodium chloride solution and water into a 60 kHz ultrasonic aerosol 
atomizing nozzle.  The total solution feed rate is fixed at 0.4 ml/min. By 
varying the rotation speed of these two pumps, NaCl solution of different 
concentrations, after being ultrasonically atomized, produced particles with 
different size distribution.  The aerosol charges were neutralized by an air 
ionizer. An Aerodynamic Particle Sizer and an Aerosizer were used to measure 
the aerosol concentration and size distribution.  The aerosol charge was 
monitored by an aerosol electrometer.  The mass concentration increased 
linearly with increasing solution feed rate, if the drying process was 
complete.  The count median diameter was found to decrease with increasing 
power input to the atomizer, that also resulted in higher number 
concentration, but the mass concentration remained the same. The GSD 
decreased with increasing solution concentration, reflecting the effect of 
surface tension.  By adjusting the solution mixing volume (inside the 
atomizer) and the length of run-time of each concentration phase, the system 
was able to generate aerosol particles with GSD range from 1.2 to 1.8 or 
higher while CMD remained the same.

<H2>285. The Effect of Carbon Fiber Stiffness and Grinding Orientation on 
Composite Dust Particles Size Distributions.</H2>
<B>B. Johnson</B>, 3M, Woodbury, MN; L.. Brosseau, J. Vincent, University of 
Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN<P>
Carbon fiber epoxy composite materials are used on military and commercial 
aircraft, automobiles and for sports equipment.  Parts are made by layering 
sheets of prepreg (fiber impregnated with uncured epoxy matrix resin), 
curing with heat and pressure and shaping by grinding and machining.  This 
shaping process generates airborne dust that includes both carbon fibers and 
cured epoxy particles.  Recent revelations about the fibrogenci and 
carcinogenic potential of asbestos, ceramic, and glass wool fiber aerosols 
have raised concern about any fine durable fibrous aerosol.  This study 
investigates the effect of carbon fiber stiffness and orientation of a 
grinding process on the aerodynamic particle size distribution of composite 
dust.<P>
A laboratory study was conducted on four different unidirectionally oriented 
carbon fiber epoxy composite flat panels.  Each panel contained one fiber 
which ranged in stiffness from 300 to 800 thousand pounds per square inch 
(ksi). Each panel was ground parallel and perpendicular to axis of the 
fibers using a disk sander (60 grit). The dust generated was sampled using a 
personal inhalable dust spectrometer (PIDS), as described by Gibson et al. 
(Am. Occup. Hy., 1987), in the breathing zone of the grinder operator. The 
particle size distribution was obtained  using a new inversion algorithm 
described by Ramachandran et. al. (J. Aerosol Sci., 1995). Samples were also 
examined microscopically using NIOSH method No. 7400.<P>
We found, for composite made from fibers with stiffness greater than 600 
ksi, that grinding perpendicular to the axis of the fibers resulted in a 
bimodal particle size distribution with one mass median aerodynamic diameter 
(MMAD) of 12 to 18 um, and another of 0.2 to 0.5 um.  Grinding parallel to 
the fiber axis on all carbon fiber types or perpendicular to fibers with 
stiffness less than 400 ksi caused a monomodal particles size distribution 
with MMAD from 15 to 30 um. All of the fibers examined microscopically were 
found to have the same diameter as the original composite fibers. No 
respirable fiber were identified by NIOSH method 7400.

<H2>286. Inhalability of Ultralarge Aerosols in Calm Air.</H2>
<B>D. Hsu</B>, D. Swift, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD<P>
Early recommendations for health related sampling of aerosols were based on 
the concept of "total" dust. This concept was based on the assumption that 
all airborne particulate matter could produce health effects. However, the 
different toxic effects and means of handling deposited particles led to the 
recent sampling conventions of inhalable, inspirable, and respirable 
fractions which were accessible, respectively, to the entire respiratory 
tract, the thoracic region, and the pulmonary/alveolar zones. While the 
latter two conventions have a strong experimental and theoretical basis, the 
inhalability concept is not well supported, especially for the case of no 
convective flow.  This study was performed to determined the inhalabilty of 
ultralarge particles (&gt;20 &#181;m diameter) when breathed through the 
nose or mouth of an adult and child mannikin at breathing conditions which 
stimulate rest and moderate exercise.<P>
A shower stall was used as the exposure chamber.  It was divided into an 
upper and lower zone by five layers of plastic grille.  The upper mixing 
section housed the aerosol generation system. Mixing in this zone was damped 
by the grilles and the aerosol particles fell under gravitational forces 
through the exposure zone. Six mean particle sizes were used in this study, 
15, 60, 90, 125, 175, and 190 &#181;m aerodynamic diameter, each having a 
GSD of less than or equal to 1.20.  Minute volume of 8.5 and 20 liters were 
used for the adulate at rest and moderate exercise, respectively. The minute 
volume of child at corresponding breathing conditions was 6.5 and 15 liters, 
respectively.  The chamber particle concentration was calculated from the 
mass of particles which settled onto a 37 mm filter paper in the vicinity of 
the nose. Cotton balls were inserted into the mannikin's nostrils to collect 
the inhaled aerosol mass. Inhalability was defined in the customary fashion, 
the ratio of the inhaled mass to the mass outside the nose. It was found 
that there was a cutoff particle diameter, above which the inhalability was 
essentially zero. The minute volume did not have a significant effect on the 
inhalability curve over the range of volumes studied. Inhalability for the 
child mannikin was essentially equal to that for the adult mannikin.  It is 
concluded that inhalability at rest does not conform to the ACGIH 
inhalability curve which remains constant at 50% above 30 &#181;m diameter. 
An empirical equation of inhalability as a function of particle aerodynamic 
diameter was obtained for these mannikin studies.

<H2>287. Workplace Comparison of Personal Cascade Impactors for Inhalable 
Aerosol Exposures.</H2>
<B>N. Yamada</B>, L.  Brosseau, G. Ramchandran, J. Vincent, University of 
Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN<P>
Particle size selective sampling criteria for workplace aerosol exposure 
assessment have been adopted by ACGIH and other standard setting bodies in 
the international industrial hygiene community.  Within this framework, 
measurement of the mass concentration and particle size distribution of 
inhalable aerosol are important industrial hygiene goals, and a personal 
inhalable dust spectrometer (PIDS) has been proposed for this purpose 
(Gibson et al., Ann Occup. Hyg., 1987). Currently, the so-called "Marple" 
personal cascade impactor is widely used for workplace particle size 
determination, but it is not yet known the extent to which it provides 
information about inhalable aerosol as defined in the new criteria.<P>
With this in mind, this study compared the PIDS and Marple under actual 
field conditions in a dusty industrial workplace.  Both instruments were 
mounted side by side on life-sized mannikins placed in a manner simulating 
actual worker exposure.  The collected aerosol for each instrument was 
assessed gravimetrically.  From repeat runs, it was found that the Marple 
sampler, in versions with and without the face-plate, consistently sampled 
less than the inhalable fraction as measured using the PIDS.  However, after 
making recommended empirical corrections to the masses collected at the 
various stages of the Marple sampler to account for wall and entry losses, 
the overall mass bias was of the order of 10% only. Tests were conducted of 
a modified Marple sampler incorporating a new inhalable entry, and agreement 
in overall mass sampled was improved.  From particle size analysis for both 
instruments using a new inversion algorithm (Ramachandran et. al, J Aerosol 
Sci., 1995) direct calibration of the new entry system for the modified 
Marple sampler was obtained based on the field data.<P>
This work provides a basis for continued use of the PIDS and Marple samplers 
in workplace studies under the rationale contained within the new particle 
size-selecting sampling criteria.

<H2>288. Evaluation of Inhalable, Thoracic and Respirable Dust 
Concentrations from Impactor Sampling.</H2>
<B>G. Perrault</B>, Institut De Recherche En Sante et En Securite, Montreal, 
Quebec, Canada,; Y. Cloutier, D. Drolet, IRSST, Montreal, Quebec, Canada<P>
Theoretically, results of sampling with an impactor can be used to calculate 
the three fractions of airborne particulate matter defined by ACGIH, namely 
the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions.  However, few researchers 
have compared the results of these calculations to actual measurements of 
each fraction in the field.<P>
From the ACGIH definitions and the collection of efficiency of a Sierra 
impactor slightly modified to improve the data significance for inhalable 
dust calculations, calculations have been done of these three fractions in 
ferrous and non-ferrous foundries, a wood furniture manufacturer, sawmills, 
paper mills, and various other industries. The results of these calculations 
are validated for respirable dust as determined with a Dorr-Oliver cyclone 
in ferrous and non-ferrous foundries, and for inhalable dust as evaluated 
with an IOM (Institute of Occupational Medicine) sampler, designed to meet 
the criteria of inhalability.<P>
It is concluded that the calculations from the impactor data give a good 
approximation of both inhalable and respirable dust concentrations. Thoracic 
dust concentrations cannot be validated due to the lack of a proper sampling 
method.

<H2>289. Assessment of the Impact of Particle Size-Selective Sampling 
Criteria and Instrumentation for Inhalable Aerosol on Observed Workplace 
Exposure Levels.</H2>
<B>M. Werner</B>, Environmental/Occupational Health, Minneapolis, MN; J. 
Vincent, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN<P>
International agreement has now emerged on a quantitative definition for 
that portion of aerosol which may enter the body through the nose and/or 
mouth -- namely, the <I>inhalable</I> aerosol fraction. This work has set 
the stage for the development of workplace aerosol standards in which the 
current "total" aerosol approach will be replaced by one based on this 
concept of "inhalability." We have undertaken a number of studies to 
investigate the relationship between "total" and inhalable aerosol exposures 
of nickel and lead industry workers and to assess the impact of such new 
standards on industry.<P>
In these studies, sampling was carried out in a side-by-side fashion, with 
each worker wearing one "total" aerosol sampler (the 37 mm cassette, 
closed-face) and one inhalable aerosol sampler (the IOM personal aerosol 
sampler).  Results from over 250 sample pairs show that the level of 
exposure based on inhalable aerosol consistently exceeds that for "total" 
aerosol, with the observed bias ranging from 1.2 to 3.2. This bias tends to 
be greater for workplaces in which the aerosol is particularly coarse.  
Further examination of these data reveals that a switch to inhalable 
sampling will lead to an increase in the proportion of exposure measurements 
which are in excess of current occupational exposure limits.  For example, 
the distribution of "total" nickel exposures in one nickel smelter shows 
about 50% of observed exposure values exceeded the proposed new nickel 
threshold limit value (TLV) of 0.05 mg/m&#179;, while the distribution of 
observed inhalable nickel exposures shows that 80% of exposures are above 
this level.  Special consideration should be given to substances for which 
both a switch to inhalable sampling methods and a reduction in an 
occupational exposure limit are proposed.

<H2>134. Interim Hazard Surveillance Data from the NIOSH Farm Family Health 
and Hazard Surveillance (FFHHS) Program in New York.</H2>
<B>D. Pedersen</B>, CDC, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH; E. Hallman, Cornell 
University, Ithaca, NY; J. May, New York Center for Agricultural Medicine, 
Cooperstown, NY; A. Stark, New York Department of Health, Albany, NY<P>
In recognition of a lack of a baseline hazard surveillance data for 
agriculture, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH) established cooperative agreements with several state-based agencies 
to: (1) conduct health history, medical access, and hazard awareness 
interviews within a sample of the farm population, and; (2) conduct on-site 
hazard investigation investigators in the family farm environment.<P>
In New York, approximately 380 standardized interviews and approximately 300 
on-site field investigations, have been completed.  These two types of farm 
surveys encompass livestock, cash grain, dairy, and fruits and vegetable 
operations in the state of New York, and serve to tentatively identify areas 
of potentially significant occupational concern.<P>
Standardized questionnaire interviews with the adult farm population in New 
York included questions about the utilization of on-site industrial hygiene 
and safety consultations, process changes and chemical substitution for 
reasons of health and safety, and on-farm use of personal protective 
equipment.  These preliminary data suggest that only a minority of farmers 
(18% of respondents) have used on-site professional consultative services or 
have made major operational or equipment changes (25%). However, most 
farmers (77%) are convinced of the need for use of personal protective 
equipment on the farm.<P>
Hazard data from on-site surveillance activities show that approximately 95% 
of dairy farm operations have trailed equipment with missing or defective 
power take-off (PTO) shields or defective hydraulic systems, and about 45% 
of the farm tractors examined had missing or defective PTO master shields. 
These data also suggest that dairy farm animal handling facilities present a 
considerable safety hazard, including a lack of safety passages in holding 
or pasture areas (98-100%), slippery walking surfaces in various 
confinement facilities (22-29%), and inadequate or improperly installed 
lighting in different confinement areas (6-20%).

<H2>137. Poultry Workers' Risk of Exposure to Organic Arsenic in Chicken 
Houses.</H2>
<B>S. Lenhart</B>, NIOSH/DSHEFS, Cincinnati, OH<P>
An environmental sampling study was conducted at a chicken farm to evaluate 
poultry workers' risk for inhalation exposure to organic arsenic.  The study 
resulted from a concern that the addition of 3-Nitron R (active ingredient: 
roxarsone [3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid]) to poultry feed exposed 
poultry growers and catchers to organic arsenic compounds.  Nearly 50 years 
ago, adding roxarsone to feed was reported to significantly stimulate 
poultry growth. Today, the amount of roxarsone added to poultry feed is the 
same as recommended in 1984, 45 grams (gm) per ton, or about 0.0005% of the 
feed.  The only exposure limit for organic arsenic compounds is the OSHA PEL 
of 500 micrograms (&#181;g) per cubic meter, measured as arsenic.<P>
Area air sampling was conducted in four chicken houses during chicken 
catching operations. Seventeen area air samples, four litter samples, four 
rafter dust samples, two compost samples, three feed samples, and a 
roxarsone sample were analyzed for arsenic by NIOSH method 7300. Arsenic was 
not detected in any area air sample; the analytical limit of detection was 
1 &#181;g.  Each litter sample and one rafter dust sample contained 20 
&#181;g/gm of arsenic.  Arsenic was not detected in three rafter dust 
samples.  Compost samples contained 26 &#181;g/gm and 51 &#181;g/gm of 
arsenic. Starter feed contained 25 &#181;g/gm, middle feed contained 30 
&#181;g/gm, and no arsenic was detected in final feed.  The roxarsone 
sample contained approximately 67,000 &#181;g/gm of arsenic.<P>
The findings of this study suggest that there is essentially no health risk 
associated with inhalation exposures to organic arsenic from the addition of 
small amounts of roxarsone to poultry feed.

<H2>138. A Pilot Test of Field Surveillance in Ginseng Growers.</H2>
<B>D. Stueland</B>, B. Ault, P. Gunderson, National Farm Medicine Center, 
Marshfield, WI<P>
Twenty-two (13 males) ginseng growers participated in laboratory evaluation, 
including cholinesterase and liver function (AST and LDH) testing in 1994 
and 1995.  Plasma and red cell cholinesterase levels and chemistries were 
obtained before the planting season began. Cholinesterase tests were 
repeated in the middle of the growing season.  Participants listed the 
pesticides used so that each grower could be classified as to whether or not 
he/she used organophosphate, molluscicides, herbicides, fungicides, or 
pyrethroids.<P>
Twenty (90.9%) of the participants were owner/operators and 12 (60%) applied 
their own chemicals. The area treated was small (mean of 8.07 acres) but 
treated frequently (mean of 16.08 applications/growing season). Participants 
"often" used gloves (n=12, 60%), masks (n=8, 40%), and other personal 
protective equipment (n=7, 36.8%).<P>
The initial mean plasma cholinesterase was 16.15 in 1994 and 16.25 in 1995 
with a follow up plasma cholinesterase of 16.01 in 1994 and 15.10 in 1995. 
The initial mean red cell cholinesterase was 37.95 in 1994 and 42.32 in 1995 
with follow-up values of 39.55 in 1994 and 38.80 in 1995. The correlation of 
plasma cholinesterase between years was 0.84 at time 1 and 0.90 in time 2. 
The correlation of the red cell cholinesterase was 0.49 at time 1 and 0.68 
at time 2.  The t-test percent change, classified by whether the participant 
used organophosphate, was 2.16 for plasma cholinesterase (p=0.0445) and 2.09 
(p=0.0513) for red cell cholinesterase.  The t-test for percentage change in 
plasma and red cell cholinesterase was not related to use of molluscicides, 
herbicides, fungicides, or pyrethroids.  AST and LDH were higher in users of 
organophosphate and fungicides than non-users.<P>
In this sample of self-employed growers who intensively applied chemicals to 
small areas, the cholinesterase levels between years were stable.  As 
expected, the plasma and red cell cholinesterase levels tended to drop 
during the summer and was significantly determined by whether the 
participant used organophosphate.  Participants who used organophosphate or 
fungicides tended to have higher liver function studies than non-users.  
Although liver function studies may be influenced by the use of agents other 
than organophosphate, organophosphates were the only pesticides that 
affected the change in cholinesterase.

<H2>139. Evaluation of Farmers' Ability to Use a Self-Diagnostic Gas 
Sampling System Based on Diffusion Tubes.</H2>
<B>P. Waldron</B>, W. Popendorf, S. Reynolds, K. Donham, University of Iowa, 
Iowa City, IA<P>
Diffusion tubes are a proven, semi-quantitative survey instrument, that have 
the potential to meet most of today's enclosed livestock industry gas 
sampling needs.  However, it is believed that this gas sampling method is 
not utilized by the majority of farmers due primarily to the format of the 
packaging, the design of the instructions, and the way in which these tubes 
are marketed.  It was hypothesized that diffusion tubes could be presented 
in such a way as to overcome these perceived problems and be accepted and 
used accurately by farmers.  To evaluate this potential diffusion tubes were 
packaged as part of a Gas-Card-Sampling system which included preloaded 
tubes for NH3 and CO2, instructions and color-coded tables for calculating 
gas concentrations. The Gas Card was distributed to 75 enclosed livestock 
operations across Iowa during the winter of 1995.  Gas Card users were asked 
to rate their use of the Gas Card system by answering eight questions 
related to ease of use, relevance and utility of information on a scale of 
1 to 4, with 1 being "poor" and 4 being "excellent."  Data was available on 
49 complete sets of respondent questions.  The mean satisfaction score was 
26.4 out of a possible 32 with a standard deviation of 3.7.  The lowest 
score was 18, and the highest score was 32.  The coefficient alpha for the 
8 items is 0.83 which indicates a good agreement among the items. Data on 
calculated gas concentrations were returned by 61 of the participants.  
After recalculation of this data, it was determined that diffusion tube data 
was correctly calculated 64.4% to 75.4% of the time by the users.  In 
addition the ability to use the diffusion tubes as presented in the Gas Card 
system and to determine a correct gas concentration level was not 
significantly associated with either prior experience with gas testing or 
prior knowledge of diffusion tubes.  It is concluded that the Gas Card 
sampling system, if available, would be accepted and used correctly by 
operators of enclosed livestock facilities.

<H2>140. Silo Gas Exposure in New York State Following the Dry Growing 
Season of 1995.</H2>
<B>N. Pavelchak</B>, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY; S. 
Roerig, Eastern New York Occupational Health Program, Latham, NY; L. Church, 
M. London, New York Center for Agricultural Medicine, Cooperstown, NY<P>
Exposure to silo gas is a recognized agricultural hazard.  Silo gas produced 
from corn fermentation may consist of oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. 
The presence of potentially lethal concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 
within vertical silos has been well-documented. The risk of silo gas 
exposure from other silage storage methodologies including horizontal 
"ag-bags" and concrete bunkers has been less well characterized.  A dry 
growing season is known to be a factor for elevating nitrate levels in corn 
plants and soil and can result in increased NO2 production.  Farms in the 
northeastern U.S. faced drought conditions during the 1995 growing season. 
The New York State (NYS) Department of Health (DOH), the NYS Occupational 
Health Nurses in Agricultural Communities (OHNAC), and the New York Center 
for Agricultural Medicine and Health (NYCAMH) investigated three exposure 
incidents involving six farm workers during September/October 1995. Five of 
these workers were hospitalized for multiple days, with two workers 
receiving treatment in intensive care units.  The sixth worker was treated 
in a hospital emergency department and left against medical advice.  
Although NO2 has low odor threshold, it may initially produce only mild 
irritation of the respiratory passages.  Pulmonary edema and other 
complications generally do not manifest for hours or days following 
sufficient exposure.  We additionally monitored NO2 air samples for 
"Ag-Bags" at several NYS farms.  For four days, NO2 concentrations at one 
site remained in excess of the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health's (NIOSH) immediately dangerous to life and health value (IDLH) 
of 25 parts per million (PPM).  As a result of the clinical and industrial 
hygiene data, and the growing season's abnormal weather conditions, DOH and 
NYCAMH issued statewide health hazard alerts and performed educational 
outreach services.

<H2>141. An Ergonomic Evaluation of Blueberry Rakers.</H2>
<B>C. Estill</B>, S. Tanaka,  NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Annually thousands of seasonal workers rake wild blueberries in various 
parts of Maine, mostly in the month of August.  A field survey consisting of 
a symptom questionnaire, limited physical examinations, and ergonomic 
assessment of raking, was conducted at a blueberry grower/processor in 
Maine.<P> 
A convenience sample of 134 rakers was recruited on site over a three-day 
period in late August. Their median age was 30 (range: 13 to 69); 73% of 
participants were males and 27% females; 10% of the participants were 
children (age 12 to 18).  Participants reported moderate to severe pain, 
which was felt, after the start of raking, in the back (14%), in the 
hand/wrist (12%), and in the elbow (8%).  On physical examinations, 10% had 
some hand/wrist pain accompanied by a positive Phalen's or Tinel's test 
(suggesting Carpal Tunnel Syndrome), or a positive Finkelstein's test 
(suggesting de Quervain's disease).<P>
Ergonomic analysis of raking revealed that rakers worked mostly in stooped 
posture and frequently carried loaded buckets (up to 13 kg each). The metal 
rakes varied in size (35 to 60 cm wide) and weight (1.2 to 2.1 kg). The 
typical raking motion involved constant firm grip on the handle and 
repetitive ulnar and radial deviations of the wrist.  The force of raking 
was estimated to be 87 Newtons (S.D. &#177; 17.5), and the motion was 
repeated 32 times/min (S.D. &#177; 13).  These repetitive and forceful 
motions could cause friction on the tenosynovium and explain a high 
prevalence of tendinitis.  Many seasonal workers depend on income from this 
work, which nonetheless needs to be performed without adverse health 
effects.  Ergonomic recommendations such as keeping the wrist in a neutral 
position (to avoid deviations) and an initial period of slow raking (work 
hardening) might reduce the incidence of tendinitis.

<H2>142. Airborne Concentrations of Propanil Within Residences of Families 
Living Adjacent to Aerially Sprayed Rice Fields.</H2>
<B>J. Gandy</B>, T. Lavy, J. Mattice, S. Richards, University of Arkansas 
for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR<P>
Propanil is widely used as post-emergent herbicide in rice.  Since it is 
typically applied aerially, drift of propanil is common into and around 
residences of those living adjacent to rice fields. Propanil has been shown 
to be immunotoxic in rodent models.  The objective of this study was to 
measure the levels of propanil to which families living adjacent to aerially 
sprayed rice fields are exposed.<P>
Air levels were sampled by passively collecting propanil particulates and 
actively collecting propanil vapor in and around the homes of volunteer 
families living in close proximity to rice fields sprayed with the herbicide 
propanil.  Homes ranged from 238 ft to 368 ft from treated rice fields.  
Sampling was conducted in the home, adjacent to the home (within 15 ft), 
100 ft from the home and at the edge of the field.  Levels were determined 
via gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy.<P>
Propanil levels adjacent to the homes ranged from non-detectable to 1106.4 
&#181;g per 400 cm&#178; collection surface (2.0 &#181;g detection limit). 
No detectable levels were measured within any of the homes.  Wind direction 
and velocity were the primary determinants of propanil drift.  At sites 
where the prevailing wind was blowing away from the home, no propanil was 
detected except at the edge of the field.  Distance from the edge of the 
rice field also influenced the amount of drift with higher levels measured 
at 100 ft from the house than adjacent to the house.<P>
The results indicate that individuals living adjacent to rice fields 
aerially sprayed with propanil are potentially exposed to various amounts of 
propanil, and wind speed and direction are the most important factors that 
influence the level of aerially applied pesticide.  The levels of human 
exposure to aerially applied propanil due to drift are considerably lower 
than the levels administered to rodents that elicit immunitoxic responses.

<H2>466. Dust Levels and Particle Size Distribution During Agricultural 
Operations in California.</H2>
<B>M.J. Nieuwenhuijsen</B>, H. Kruize, M.B. Schenker, Agricultural Health 
and Safety Center, University of California, Davis, CA.<P>
Introduction: California has approximately 76,000 farms with 1.5 million 
people directly employed on them. In 1993, California farmers produced 250 
different commodities and sold almost $20 billion in farm products. In 
California, farm size, quantity and variety of commodities, agricultural 
practices, soil types and climate are substantially different from those in 
other parts of the United States. Long dry periods of hot weather make 
California ideal for agriculture (in combination with irrigation) but also 
for dust generation.<P>
Aim: The aim of this study was to measure dust levels and particle size 
distribution during agricultural operations in California.<P>
Material and methods: Dust levels were measured on experimental fields 
around Davis with a personal 4-stage Sierra Marple 294 cascade impactor on 
2 liters-minute (50% cut off diameters: 21.3, 14.8, 9.8, 3.5 &#181;m) during 
various agricultural operations.<P>
Results: High dust levels were measured, with many measurements over the TLV 
for nuisance dust (10 mg/m&#179;), in particular for ground preparation dust 
belonged to the extra thoracic fraction (top 2 stages of cascade impactor) 
but considerable levels were measured for the thoracic and alveolar 
fractions.<P>
Conclusions: High dust levels occur during agricultural operations in 
California with a large proportion of the particles belonging to the extra 
thoracic fraction.

<BODY>

<H2>213. Evaluation of a Modified Diffusion Sampler for Measuring 24-Hour 
VOC Concentrations and Personal Exposures in Community Environments.</H2>
<B>T. Stock</B>, M. Morandi, M. Afshar, University of Texas Health Center at 
Houston, Houston, TX<P>
Although diffusion samplers are widely used for exposure monitoring in 
industrial workplaces, they have seen only limited use as samplers of air 
pollutants in community environments, a commercially available diffusion 
badge was modified and field tested.  The modification of the badge consisted 
of two steps: 1) alteration of the dimensions of the diffusion path in order 
to increase sampling rate and thus lower the detection limit for 24-hour 
sampling; 2) replacement of the badge windscreen to allow easier handling of 
the sampler.<P>
The modified samplers were field evaluated by direct side-by-side comparison 
monitoring with the unmodified badges in various indoor and outdoor 
environments.  Both partially modified (replacement of windscreen only) and 
completely modified (replacement of windscreen and alteration of diffusion 
path) samplers were field tested.  After sampling, all charcoal wafers from 
badges were extracted with 1.0 mL of 2:1 (v/v) acetone/CS2, and analyzed by 
gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for 10 target VOCs.  Two major 
conclusions may be derived from these results.  First, the teflon membrane 
used to replace the original windscreen had no statistically significant 
effect on the sampling rates of any of the target compounds, as judged by 
masses of each compound collected on the badges.  Second, the average 
increase in sampling rate for all tested compounds from the diffusion path 
alteration was not significantly different from that expected from theory 
(i.e., a doubling).

<H2>214. Field Validation of a Passive Sampler for Ethylene Glycol 
Monomethyl Ether Exposure.</H2>
<B>T. Shih</B>, R. Cheng, T. Smith, L. Wu, Chang Gung College of Medicine & 
Technology, Tao-yuan, Taiwan, ROC<P>
Samplers for collecting non-polar or slightly-polar chemicals are readily 
available for industrial hygiene practice.  However, only a few samplers have 
been developed for the measurement of highly polar chemicals.  This study was 
to evaluate the performance of a passive sampler in assessing ethylene 
glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) mixed with acetone in high humidity working 
environments.<P>
In this study we used NIOSH recommended method with activated charcoal tubes 
and charcoal-based passive badges.  To evaluate the validity of both the 
passive and active sampling methods, 68 pairs of 8-hour active/passive 
side-by-side samples were collected by a combination of 41 personal samples 
of workers and 27 stationary samples of different work sites.  Statistically 
consistent results were found (R^2&gt;0.98, slope = 0.99, p=0.0001 from 
linear regression model) between these two sampling methods over a wide-range 
of exposure levels (0.17 - 522.40 ppm, GM = 7.05 ppm, GSD = 6.04).  To assess 
the precision of both sampling methods, a separate design of 
parallel-sample-collection using 48 pairs of active/active samples and 42 
pairs of passive/passive samples was performed.  The intraclass correlation 
coefficients of these pair active and passive samples indicated the 
precision of both methods were excellent (r=0.99). To examine the performance 
of multiple sampling and the influence of relative humidity, six passive, six 
active, and six active-dry tube samples were collected at each of three 
different exposure areas.  The results were very consistent  and small 
variation was found (CV&lt;5%) within each group. Humidity was not a 
significant factor in the exposure monitoring with the low sampling rate 
(36.3 mL/min) in this study.<P>
We concluded that using the passive sampler to assess EGME exposure resulted 
in a comparable finding as from the active sampler collection with respect to 
accuracy, precision, and effects by the environmental interferences.  Data of 
this study also indicated that the variation of environmental monitoring in 
field was more complicated and more variable than that in laboratory.  We, 
therefore, recommended the &#177;25% validation criteria for recommendation 
methods may need to be re-examined if we want it in the field validation.

<H2>215. Novel Integrated Passive Personal Sampler for Organic Vapors.</H2>
<B>L. Simon</B>, J. Farant, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada<P>
Passive monitors applied to sample airborne organic vapors are mostly based 
on the principles of sorbent diffusion. Globally, the lack precision in 
short-term exposure sampling and they offer poor versatility to collect 
long-term integrated samples.  To overcome these problems, we have designed 
and tested a novel passive sampler which collects whole air samples in 
evacuated vessels using a linear flow rate given by a new type of inlet 
controller. This new type of controller is the key part of the samplers. From 
an appropriate  design which is initially based on mathematical simulations 
performed with  a phenomenolgical model developed for that purpose, and 
further confirmed by an experimentation, the flow control offers any 
volumetric flow rate and hence, any sampling time.  From these facts, we have 
designed samplers which can collect repeated 15 minutes samples, and a whole 
working work week integrated sample.  Using the appropriate flow controller, 
we have achieved a constant flow rate of 0.021 ml/min which allowed the 
collection of 50 ml of ambient air inside a 100 ml evacuated vessel over an 
intermittent 40 hour sampling interval (5 periods of &#177;8 hours ).  
Furthermore, with a different geometry of our controller, we have obtained a 
linear flow rate of 1.66 ml/min which results in a short-term exposure 
sampler that can be applied for 2 separate periods of 15 minutes using the 
same sampler volume.  In each case, the regression coefficient between the 
sampled volume and the sampling time was over 97%. Laboratory testing was 
performed to evaluate the integrity of the sample using this novel passive 
sampler.  A gas standard matrix of 40 VOCs at 100 ppb(v) was transferred to 
the sampler over 5 periods of 8 hours and 5 days.  The GC/MS analysis of 
aliquots taken with a gas tight syringe revealed a good agreement between the 
standard matrix and the long-term passive sample.  In conclusion, we have 
developed a novel integrated passive sampler for organic vapors that is 
simple to operate and can be used to collect true long-term as well as 
short-term samples.

<H2>216. Universal Exposure Chamber for Validating Diffusive Monitors.</H2>
<B>J. Shafer</B>, N. Keder, C. Manning, M. Parker, Assay Technology, Palo 
Alto, CA<P>
Although diffusive sampling methods are understood to have practical 
advantages over traditional sampling methods, adoption of such methods has 
been slowed by validation difficulties.  Proper validation of diffusive 
samplers requires presenting a uniform chemical exposure to a statistically 
significant number of diffusive and reference samplers, and the difficulties 
of building adequate exposure chambers have limited validation studies to 
investigators with substantial budgets and engineering talent.<P>
Regulators have begun to promulgate standard protocols for diffusive sampler 
validation, and NIOSH recently published a universal chamber specification 
based on performance requirements. The speciation has been addressed by a 
design featuring:
<OL>
<LI> Quantitative flash vaporization of contaminant emerging from a 
volumetric pump to generate a vapor spike. 
<LI> Variable air velocities developed soles by continuous flow of 
freshly-generated contaminant atmosphere.
<LI> Generation of sufficient analyte atmosphere to prevent significant 
depletion of environment by samplers. 
<LI> Ability to investigate a wide variety of analytes.
<LI> PTFE-coated stainless steel surfaces to minimize sorption by chamber.
<LI> Sufficient chamber capacity for 48 diffusive samplers and 8 reference 
samplers.
<LI> Temperature, humidity, and pressure control of chamber allowing study of 
the effects of these variables.
</OL><P>
Initial evaluation suggests this type of chamber will provide an opportunity 
for complete but economical validation.  A simplified version of the chamber 
may enable occupational hygienists in the field to perform valid and 
economical side-by-side studies comparing diffusive samplers with traditional 
methods.

<H2>217. A Solid Sorbent Technique for Personal Monitoring for Ethylene.</H2>
<B>W. Vincent</B>, Exxon Biomedical Sciences, Inc., East Millstone, NJ<P>
Ethylene is a colorless, highly flammable gas used in the production of 
polyethylene, ethylene oxide, ethylene-propylene polymers, and vinyl acetate. 
Historically, monitoring for this olefin has required collection in gasbags 
using mechanical air sampling pumps.  Personal monitoring using gasbags is 
often cumbersome and obtrusive for employees.  Typical solid sorbents such as 
charcoal tubes or other polymeric adsorbents lack the necessary capacity and 
affinity for retaining ethylene with adequate efficiency.<P>
Laboratory studies were conducted to identify a solid sorbent sampling system 
which could effectively be used for collected workplace samples.  Carbosieve 
SIII was the solid sorbent selected because of its ability to retain small 
organic molecules such as C2 hydrocarbons. Sampling volume was found to be a 
concern and a one-liter maximum air volume was established to prevent 
breakthrough. Since a low sampling rate system would be required to allow 
long-term sampling, a passive thermal monitoring method using stainless steel 
thermal desorption tubes packed with the Carbosieve S-III was evaluated. 
Thermal desorption also allowed quantitative desorption of the collected 
ethylene.<P>
A sampling rate of 0.27 cc/min was determined for the passive tubes. Reverse 
diffusion effects indicated that a maximum sample time of four hours to 
minimize loss of analyte due to reverse diffusion. Storage stability tests 
indicated no loss of analyte after 7 days of freezer storage. The overall 
accuracy of the method was tested at 8 and 80 ppm of ethylene in air. Overall 
accuracy at these two concentrations was 21.1% within &#177;25% criteria was 
established by NIOSH.

<H2>218. Comparison of the NIOSH and European Diffusive Sampler Evaluation 
Protocols.</H2>
<B>M. Harper</B>, L. Guild, SKC, Inc., Eighty Four, PA<P>
The performance characteristics of any equipment to be used in occupational 
hygiene exposure monitoring must be well-known and appropriate to the 
particular exposure situation.  Diffusive samplers are low-cost, light-weight 
alternatives to traditional sampling methods for gases and vapors, but their 
operation may be affected by a large number of factors, including sample 
time, analyte concentration and fluctuations in concentration, reverse 
diffusion, the presence of interfering compounds, relative humidity, 
temperature, wind speed and orientation, desorption efficiency, and storage 
stability.  Interactions between these factors may also be important.  A 
rigorous protocol for determining sampler performance has been developed by 
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which 
addresses the precision and accuracy of a sampler when these factors are 
varied within the ranges normally encountered in the field.  Another protocol 
is under development in Europe by the Comite' European de Normalisation 
(CEN).  It is important that these protocols be reconciled as part of an 
ongoing effort toward global harmonization of standards. Both protocols are 
used to test the potential effects of the same factors on sampler 
performance, over an essentially similar range of conditions.  The minor 
differences between some of the experiments are easily resolved.  The 
essential feature of both protocols is that their object is to confirm the 
overall precision and accuracy of the sampler.  It is likely that a sampler 
which performs to a given accuracy and precision level when tested according 
to one protocol will show a similar level of performance when tested to the 
other.

<H2>267. Biological Monitoring of Thermal Decomposition Products of a 
4,4-Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate (MDI) and Toluenediisocyanate (TDI) 
Polyurethane (PUR).</H2>
<B>G. Skarping</B>, M. Dalene, P. Lind, University Hospital, Lund, Lund, 
Sweden<P>
Isocyanates are used in the production of polyurethane (PUR).  Exposure to 
isocyanates has been associated with respiratory health problems among 
workers.  To relate health problems to the exposure, data from air 
measurements or biological markers were essential.  A study was performed at 
a factory where workers were heating MDI and TDI polyurethane and thermal 
degradation compounds as different isocyanates, amino-isocyanates, and amines 
were released.<P>
No MDI was seen in air when samples were taken and analyzed by conventional 
wet sampling methods.  However, a response was seen when monitoring the 
exposure with a continuous monitoring device, indicating high concentrations 
of isocyanates in air, occurring at short peaks. Further, the response was 
related to the work, but the detailed nature of the isocyanate compounds in 
the air is not known at present.<P>
From 16 female workers urine and blood samples were collected during about 
five work days. To study the biological half-lives, biological samples, from 
3 of the 16 workers, were also taken before and after the Christmas holiday. 
4,4'-Methylenedianiline (MDA) and 2,4- and 2,6-toluenediamine, were after 
strong acid hydrolysis determined as penta-fluoro-propionic anhydride (PFPA) 
derivatives by GC-MS using selected ion monitoring in the negative chemical 
ionization mode.  Ammonia was used as the reagent gas. The detection limit 
was less than 0,05 ug/L for both TDA and MDA in human urine or plasma.<P>
During the work the plasma levels for each worker were stable and varied 
between workers in the range of 1-40 ug/L for MDA, 0,1-5 ug/L for 2,4-TDA and 
0,1-3 ug/L for 2,6-TDA. During the Christmas holiday the plasma levels of MDA 
were determined and half-lives of 14, 16, and 20 days were calculated.<P>
Biological monitoring of MDI and TDI, by the determination of MDA and TDA in 
hydrolysed plasma or urine makes it possible to estimate the short-time 
exposure (urine) and long-term exposure (plasma).

<H2>268. Biological Monitoring of Exposure to Parathion and Methyl Parathion 
by High Performance Liquid Chromatography.</H2>
<B>M. Chang</B>, Y. Chen, H. Yang, Chang Gung College of Medicine & 
Technology, Tao-yuan, Taiwan, ROC<P>
Parathion (EtP) and methyl parathion (MeP) are organophosphate (OP) 
insecticides that readily penetrate the skin and inhibit plasma 
cholinesterase (ChE) in mammals. The TLV-TWA values are 0.1 and 0.2 
mg/m&#179; for EtP and MeP, respectively.  The BIE for EtP ar 1) total 
p-nitrophenol (4NP) in urine, 0.5 mg/g creatinine (Crn) and 2) ChE in red 
cells, 70% of an individual's base line. No BEI is yet recommended for MeP. 
A rate model was used to evaluate the effects of both OPs on the inhibition 
of ChE and elimination of urinary (U-) 4NP. An HPLC method was modified and 
standardized to analyze U-4NP. We have found a linearity of r&gt;0.995 for a 
standard curve ranging from 0.06 to 0.96 &#181;g/mL with the % of error of 
less than or equal to &#177;10% and a recovery of 89&#177;2%. The %CV at all 
levels was less than or equal to 10%. The main observation of this study was 
that a linear correlation was observed between the OP does and with 1) % 
inhibition of ChE, or 2) U-4NP for both OPs. Based on the first relationship, 
a 30% inhibition i.e., 70% of an individual rat's baseline would come from a 
dose of EtP 1.5 mg/kg and a MeP 6.0 mg/kg. Based on the second relationship, 
an EtP of 1.5 mg/kg would yield an U-4NP of 6.7 mg/g Crn and a MeP of 6.0 
mg/kg an U-4NP of 24.1 mg/g Crn. Assuming the relationships found in rats 
also hold true for humans, we would recommend an U-4NP of 2.0 mg/g Crn as the 
BEI for MeP.  (Supported by CMRP 461, Chang Gung Med.Coll. and NSC

<H2>269. Urine Arsenic Monitoring in Occupationally Exposed Individuals: 
Validation of a Method to Specifically Analyze Non-Dietary Arsenic.</H2>
<B>A. LeBlanc</B>, Centre De Toxicologie du Quebec, St. Foy, Quebec, Canada<P>
Traditionally, occupational exposure to arsenic has been monitored through 
the measurement of total urinary arsenic.  While these analytical techniques 
are accurate and reproducible, the relevance of the results is questionable.<P>
Arsenic can exist as several species, some toxic others not.  Seafood in 
particular may contain very high levels of nontoxic arsenic compounds such as 
arsenobetaine and arsenocholine. Following consumption of seafood, these 
species are rapidly and quantitatively excreted in the urine. This may 
severely bias the results of biological monitoring if total urinary arsenic 
is measured.<P>
We have validated a simple analytical procedure that measures only the total 
non-dietary component of urinary arsenic (As&#179;+, As<I>5+</I>, MAA, and 
DMAA).<P>
Reference material was used to validate the method.  Accuracy, recovery, and 
reproducibility data are shown for each of the species of interest.  The 
absence of response from arsenobetaine and arsenocholine is confirmed through 
the analysis of urine samples from seafood consumers.<P>
This cost-effective method proves to be well-suited for the monitoring of 
exposed workers.

<H2>270. Synthesis of 2-Thiothiazolidine-4-Carboxylic Acid and Its 
Chromatography in RT and Human Urine.</H2>
<B>C. Cox</B>, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Montgomery, AL<P>
2-Thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA) is a urinary metabolite produced 
in humans and rats exposed to carbon disulfide (CS2) which is used primarily 
in the viscose rayon industry.  Urinary TTCA is the marker of CS2 dose for 
the ACGIH biological Exposure Index.<P>
TTCA, which is not available commercially, was synthesized by reacting CS2 
with L-cystine. The product was validated as pure by direct probe MS (high 
and low voltage), using isotopic composition of the direct probe MS molecular 
ion, UV spectrometry, HPLC and UV detection with MS direct probe analysis of 
the suspected TTCA peak, and elemental analysis.<P>
ICP analysis for C, Cl and S in aqueous solution showed that the molar C/S 
ration was 2.0 with undetectable Cl. Direct probe MS detects only free acid 
for a free acid/HCl salt mixture.  ICP analysis will detect both since 
differential volatilization is not involved.  The ICP purity was &gt;99%; and 
the yield was 0.8%; sufficient to produce standards and measure validating 
spectra. Also, two reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic 
columns in series were necessary to resolve TTCA from background peaks on 
detection at 272 nm in human and rat urines.  The isolation procedure for 
TTCA from urine had a mean recovery of 94&#177;8.1% with a CV of 8.6%. The 
purity of TTCA must be validated by both elemental analysis and 
chromatographic and spectroscopic methods.

<H2>271. Synthesis of Trans-3'-Hydroxycotinine, a Major Urinary Metabolite of 
Nicotine.</H2>
<B>S. Yim</B>, S. Que Hee, UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA<P>
Many biological markers are not commercially available.  The ability to 
synthesize such markers is therefore very important in the initial stages of 
establishing a biological monitoring method.  For the present study 
trans-3'-hydroxycotinine was to be synthesized because it was not 
commercially available and because it is more abundant than cotinine in the 
urines of smokers.<P>
Cotinine, precursor of trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, was synthesized from 
nicotine by dibromination followed by reduction with zinc in the presence of 
acid.  The melting point of cotinine was 162&#177;2&#176;C, and was pure 
compared with commercially available cotinine by thin layer chromatography 
using ultraviolet detection.<P>
Synthesized dibenzyl peroxydicarbonate with metling point 100&#177;2&#176;C 
was added as a [[benzyloxy]carbonyl] oxy grouped to cotinine with sodium 
bis(trimethuylilyl)amide to make (3,3-bis[[benzuyuloxy)carbonyl] 
oxy]-5-(3-pyridyl)-N-methylpyrrolidinone and 3-[[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-
oxy]-5-(3-pyridyl)-N-methylpyrrolidinone). The ultraviolet absorbing 
fractions at 230 nm and 260 nm were collected upon silica gel column 
chromatography using methylene chloride/methanol (90:10) for elution.<P>
Hydrolysis of these intermediates with potassium hydroxide give 
tans-3'-hydroxycotinine which was purified by chromatography on a silica gel 
column using methylene chloride/methanol (95:5). The pure compound was 
recrystallized with acetone/ether (1:1).<P>
The purity was then verified by ultraviolet, infrared, nuclear resonance 
spectroscopies and by chromatography.

<H2>272. Validation of a Biomarker for Exposure: Hemoglobin Adducts from 
1,3-Butadiene.</H2>
<B>T. Smith</B>, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard University, 
Boston, MA; T. Shih, Chang Gung College of Medicine & Technology, Tao-yuan, 
Taiwan, ROC; H. Chang, National Cheng University, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC<P>
A Monte-Carlo simulation of petrochemical exposures to 1,3-butadiene (BD) was 
conducted to develop a sampling strategy for a validation study of BD 
hemoglobin adducts.  Exposure sampling data were available from an extensive 
field study in Taiwan conducted by national Cheng Kung University and the 
Taiwanese Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.  The data from 10 
plants showed a wide range of exposure.  Exposures in different work areas 
ranged from GM less than detectable (&lt;0.1 ppm) up to 3.1 ppm with many in 
the range of ppm, and the GSDs ranged from 2.22 to 6.69 with most between 2 
and 3.  These data were used in a lognormal random number generator to 
produce sets of five days per week random TWA exposures, which were used to 
represent the sequence of exposures expected for 120 days of a typical worker 
with a GM of 1.0 ppm and a GSD of either 2.0 and 3.0.  The hemoglobin adduct 
formation by epoxy butene (the active metabolite of BD) was assumed to follow 
the same kinetics as adducts formed by ethylene oxide.  At low concentrations 
there is a linear relationship between adducts formed and the duration times 
TWA concentration for a day of exposure. Adducts were modeled by a linear 
turnover process in which 1/120 of the red blood cells are removed each day 
and none live longer than 120 days.  So each day's exposure produces adducts 
in cells of all ages and each age set accumulates adducts until removed at 
120 days.  This model was used to test several sampling strategies and 
observe how adduct levels would vary over time as a function of the variation 
in exposure.  Simulated adduct levels varied across 1000 subjects by a CV of 
9,5% for an exposure of GSD of 2.0 and by 19.0% for a GDS of 3.0. Pairwise  
comparisons showed that 15, 20, and 25 samples estimates accounted for 45%, 
54%, and 63%, respectively, of the variability of the true adduct levels, 
which was independent of the GSD of exposures. Estimates with lower numbers 
of days monitored were poorly correlated with the true adduct levels. We 
concluded that highly intensive sampling is needed to provide sufficiently 
precise exposure estimates to validate accumulative biomarkers of exposure.

<H2>273. A Field Method for Near-Real Time Analysis of Perchloroethylene in 
End-Exhaled Breath.</H2>
<B>N.D. Sweet</B>, G.E. Burroughs, L.M. Ewers, G. Talaska, University of 
Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Perchloroethylene (PERC) is a known animal carcinogen and is considered by 
the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to be a probable human 
carcinogen (Group 2A). Other researchers have shown that specific events in 
the routine of a dry-cleaning worker contribute significantly to the total 
daily exposure. A field method for near real-time analysis of PERC in 
end-exhaled breath and in workplace air was developed.  A portable gas 
chromatograph with photoionization detector was used in these analyses.  
Laboratory development of the method included evaluation of the sensitivity, 
specificity, accuracy, precision, and speed of analysis for PERC. Replicate 
aliquots of PERC at concentrations from 0.001 to 1000 ppm were analyzed and 
successfully detected. Interference of acetone, benzene, formaldehyde, 
toluene, trichloroethylene, and other common interferences were evaluated.  
PERC concentrations were detectable at the threshold limit value (TLV), and 
the biological exposure index (BEI) established by the American Conference 
of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH).  This method can be used in 
the field to measure PERC concentrations in end-exhaled breath and in the air 
on a near real-time basis.

<H2>274. Salivary Excretion of the Herbicide, Atrazine, After Oral 
Administration in Rats.</H2>
<B>C. Lu</B>, R. Fenske, University of Washington, Seattle, WA<P>
Because of the inability of current biological monitoring techniques to 
provide accurate estimates of pesticide dose in exposed worker populations, 
a study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of pesticide 
biomonitoring by saliva sampling. Because of its chemical and physical 
properties, atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-(isopropylamino)-s-triazine), 
a member of the triazine herbicides, was selected to investigate the salivary 
excretion mechanism following oral administration (gavage dosage) in rats 
using whole saliva. Concentrations of atrazine in whole saliva and arterial 
plasma samples were determined by Enzyme Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). 
Atrazine reached its highest level in both arterial plasma and whole saliva 
about 35 minutes after dose administration.  The atrazine concentration in 
whole saliva and arterial plasma samples always had lower atrazine levels 
than arterial plasma samples (r=0.988). The average whole saliva/arterial 
plasma atrazine concentration ratios (S/P) did not vary to a large extent 
(0.69&#177;0.1), and the S/P ratios were relatively constant over time and in 
different salivary flow rates.  This study demonstrates that atrazine is able 
to cross cell membrane of salivary glands in rats and shows relatively 
constant concentration ratios between whole saliva and arterial plasma 
samples.  Because the salivary pH values, atrazine is well suited to be 
monitored in rat's saliva. This study concludes the appearance of chemicals 
in rat's saliva can be predicted by the selection criteria, and it suggests 
that other pesticides with similar chemical and physical properties as 
atrazine can be monitored in saliva.  Moreover, it is possible to estimate 
atrazine plasma level from saliva data based on Martin's equation, if all the 
parameters in the equation, such as salivary pH values and protein binding in 
saliva and plasma samples have been determined.

<H2>258. Personal Protective Equipment: Factors Contributing to Workers' 
Discomfort in a Metal Refining Plant.</H2>
<B>F. Akbar-Khanzadeh</B>, Medical College of Ohio at Toledo, Toledo, OH<P>
When engineering or administrative hazard control techniques are neither 
feasible nor able to entirely protect workers, the proper use of personal 
protective equipment (PPE) becomes the final alternative to safeguard the 
worker. If workers find the required PPE unacceptable due to discomfort or 
other factors, the may not wear or may tamper with the equipment, which 
impairs this last resort hazard control method.  In this study, 366 workers 
in a metal refining plant were interviewed through a questionnaire to 
investigate the degree of discomfort of eight types of PPE and 17 factors 
contributing to workers' discomfort. Up to 97.8% of these employees used one 
or a combination of PPE. The percentages of employees who reported their hard 
hats and cooling vests as comfortable was 17 and 19%, respectively. 
Twenty-five percent of workers felt their respirators and safety harnesses 
were comfortable.  Safety glasses ranked at 50%, gloves ranked at 53%, and 
safety shoes ranked at 54% for comfort factor.  The percentage of employees 
who tolerated their PPE (somewhat uncomfortable) ranged from 27% to 52%. Of 
those factors contributing to workers' discomfort of wearing PPE, "not 
needed," "interferes with work," "undesirable type/model," "irritating 
skin," "hard to wear," "being too heavy," "creating new hazard," and "putting 
pressure on the body" were cited most frequently.<P>
The results indicate that while workers are provided with adequate education 
in the proper use and limitations of PPE, the comfort and desirability of PPE 
have to be further enhanced in order to make PPE more appealing and thus a 
more effective worker safeguard.  To examine the success of a PPE program, it 
is recommended that an approach similar to this study be used by health and 
safety professionals as an evaluation component of the program.

<H2>260. Heat Stress Characteristics of Seven Particle-Barrier Coveralls.</H2>
<B>T. Bernard</B>, M. Alexander, E. Greenberg, USF College of Public Health, 
Tampa, FL<P>
The primary purpose of protective clothing is to establish a barrier between 
the skin and chemical/biological hazards in  the environment. One class of 
protective clothing is composed of those fabrics that provide a barrier to 
particulates, such as pesticides and radiological contaminants.  In this 
class are coveralls that are designed to be limited-use and reusable. The 
usual selection of coverall depends on the actual manifestation of the 
hazard, life-cycle costs etc. When the environmental conditions are hot, heat 
stress may be a further consideration.  The thermal characteristics of a 
clothing ensemble are described by the amount of insulation (lcl) and the 
resistance to evaporative cooling (Re).  Values of lcl and Re were determined 
from wear tests under controlled laboratory conditions for seven types of 
coverall configurations. The seven configurations were: 1) spun bonded 
polyethylene (PE), 2) melt blown polypropylene (PP), 3) treated, nonwoven 
cotton (TC), 4) nonwoven cotton with microporous film (CF), 5) nylon shell 
over light-weight cotton scrub, 6) 8-oz. cotton coverall (CC), and 7) 8-oz. 
cotton coverall over cotton scrub (CS). The method found critical conditions 
at which thermal equilibrium could be just maintained. At this point, 
(Psk-Pa)/Re=M+(TA-Tsk)lcl, and the only unknowns are Re and lcl. By finding 
two different critical environments, each unknown could be determined. There 
were no significant differences for clothing insulation among the seven 
configurations.  Re was least for the TC, followed in increasing order by PP, 
CF, and PE, which were not different, and the highest resistances were found 
for CC and CS. The resistance to evaporative cooling plays a much larger role 
in affecting heat stress than insulation, and there were important 
differences among the configurations.  These values can be used in heat 
balance analyses for evaluating and planning heat stress exposures.

<H2>261. Permeation of a Chlorpyrifos Formulation Through Butyl Gloves.</H2>
<B>A. Khan</B>, S. Que Hee, UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA<P>
Chlorpyrifos is an important pesticide with a TLV (skin) of 0.2 mg/m&#179;. 
For organophosphate pesticide applicators and mixers approximately 60-80% of 
the total absorbed dose is through the dermal route. The mechanisms governing 
chemical absorption through skin are poorly understood. Personal protective 
equipment (PPE) made of butyl material is widely in use because of its 
resistance to solvents. In this study breakthrough time and steady state 
permeation rate for chlorpyrifos in a commercial emulsifiable concentrate 
formulation were determined for butyl gloves at 30&#177;0.5&#176;C. The glove 
material was tested by a modified American Society for Testing and Materials 
(ASTM) method F379-85. The collection medium consisted of isopropyl alcohol. 
The latter does not back-permeate through butyl gloves and does not cause 
degradation over the duration of the four-hour study.  The average thickness 
of the glove test material was measured to be 0.033&#177;0.002 in. Samples of 
100 &#181;l each were collected at 10-min intervals over a period of four 
hours. The samples were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry 
(GC/MS) in selective ion mode (SIM) using m/z 97 for the active ingredient. 
The limit of quantification for chlorpyrifos was determined to be 4.5 ng. The 
inert compounds (ethyl toluenes, trimethyl benzenes, and propyl benzene) 
permeated sooner than the active ingredient chlorpyrifos. The breakthrough 
time for chlorpyrifos was determined to be 50&#177;5 minutes. The estimated 
permeation rate wa 0.21&#177;0.02 &#181;g/cm&#178;/min. Based on these 
findings butyl gloves should be changed every 50 minutes.

<H2>262. Permeation of Xylenes Through Protective Materials.</H2>
<B>S. Tsai</B>, S. Que Hee, UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA<P>
Permeation testing, usually by the standard ASTM protocol, is the most common 
means to assess the effectiveness of materials as barriers to chemicals. The 
aims of this study were to determine the kinetic characteristics such as 
breakthrough times, steady-state permeation rates, and lag times of neat 
p-xylene, m-xylene, o-xylene, ethylbenzene, and also xylene mixtures through 
nitrile gloves.  The nitrile glove was selected as protective material in 
this study not only because of its excellent resistance to degradation, but 
it is the glove material most frequently used in industry. The specimen was 
taken from lined Ansell Edmont&#174; Solvex&#174; Nitrile Gloves. The 
measured thickness was 0.62&#177;0.03 mm. Circular glove material was 
preconditioned in a desiccator of 21.06&#177;0.34&#176;C and relative 
humidity 65.2&#177;0.8% before permeation testing using the ASTM-type PTC-600 
permeation cell.  The ASTM F739-85 permeation test method with liquid 
(hexane) and gas collection was used.  Collection side samples were analyzed 
by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry by the selected ion monitoring mode 
at m/z 91 and 105 using positive ion electron impact.  For liquid collection, 
the breakthrough time of o-xylene was 26.7&#177;5.8 min, p-xylene was 
16.7&#177;5.8 min , m-xylene was 13.3&#177;5.8 min, and ethylbenzene was 
26.7&#177;5.8 min. The respective steady-state permeation rates were 
0.232&#177;0.075, 0.692&#177;0.165, 0.384&#177;0.026, and 0.272&#177;0.023 
mg/cm&#178;/min, respectively.  The respective lag times were 53&#177;12, 
33&#177;13, 28.9&#177;3.7, 37.2&#177;3.3 min, respectively. For xylene 
mixtures, (equal volumes of neat o-, p-, m-xylene, and ethylbenzene), the 
average breakthrough time was 22.5 &#177;4.5 min. The steady-state permeation 
rates of o-xylene, p-xylene, m-xylene, ad ethylbenzene were 0.098&#177;0.013, 
0.109&#177;0.21, 0.111&#177;0.015, 0.121&#177;0.011 mg/cm&#178;/min, 
respectively. The respective lag times in the xylene mixture were 22&#177;16, 
27&#177;12, 28&#177;11, 34&#177;9 min, respectively. For gas collection, the 
breakthrough time of m-xylene was 56.67&#177;5.77  min. The steady-state 
permeation rate was 0.069&#177;0.035 mg/cm&#178;/min.  All the permeations 
were type A permeation and there was only one steady-state permeation period. 
The sensitivity for liquid collection was better than gas collection. 
Compared with the literature, the breakthrough time for xylene mixtures 
through nitrile gloves in this study was shorter for both collection methods. 

<H2>263. Critical Analysis of the ASTM F739-91 Method for Testing the 
Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation by Liquids.</H2>
<B>D. Anna</B>, R. Sulewski, E. Zellers, University of Michigan School of 
Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI<P>
Permeation testing is one of the most common means of evaluating the 
effectiveness of chemical protective clothing. ASTM F739-91 is the standard 
method used for conducting such tests under conditions of continuous contact 
between the chemical and the clothing material.  The method describes the 
permeation test cell, sample specifications, and flow rates for both open and 
closed loop testing systems.  For an open loop test, the method recommends a 
collection of medium flow rate of 50 to 150 cc/min, and defines the 
normalized breakthrough time (BT) as the time at which the permeation rate 
reaches 0.1 &#181;g/cm&#178;/min. For non-ambient temperatures, it is stated 
that the test should be performed in a constant temperature bath.  In this 
presentation, permeation test data obtained with glove samples composed of 
butyl, natural, neoprene, and nitrile rubber are used to illustrate some 
difficulties encountered when using the ASTM method.<P>
Permeation tests were performed in duplicate using an automated open-loop 
collection system with a GC-FID analysis.  Test were conducted on each of the 
four glove materials with 44 solvents at 25&#176;C , and with 20 additional 
solvent/glove combinations at 30.35 and 45&#176;C. The normalized 
breakthrough time (BT) and the steady state permeation rate (SSPR) were 
determined for each combination. Studies to determine the required collection 
medium (N2) flow rate and the relation between flow rate and pressure and 
temperature in the cell were conducted.  Data from the SSPR determinations 
showed that flow rates &gt;150 cc/min were needed to remove all of the 
permeated contaminant from the inside surface of the glove material.  With 
high boiling/low vapor pressure solvents, flow rates &gt;8000 cc/min were 
necessary for many combinations.  In some cases flow rates &gt;25000 cc/min 
were needed. Without increasing the flow rate, the measured SSPR values were 
negatively biased by as much as a factor of 15.  Pressure changes in the cell 
were determined to be negligible (&lt;2% different than ambient) for flow 
rates &lt;8000 cc/min. The tests were conducted in a constant temperature 
water bath.  Cells were submerged up to the stopcock valves on the outlet 
port of the standard 2 inch diameter ASTM test cell. Temperatures were 
measured in various parts of the test cell at water bath temperature of 25, 
30, 35, 40 and 45&#176;C at N2 flow rates up to 4000 cc/min.  Temperature 
gradients were measured between the challenge and collection sides of the 
cell, as well as between the bottom and the top of the collection sides of 
the cell. The gradient increased with water bath temperature and with the 
flow rate.  The average equilibrium temperature on the collection side of the 
cell (internal) was up to 3.2&#176;C lower than at the bottom of the cell. A 
modified cell design which permits deeper submersion of the cell was used to 
reduce the temperature gradients to below 0.5&#176;C for temperatures less 
than or equal to 45&#176;C and for flow rates of 4000 cc/min.  Since these 
issues impact the measured BT and SSPR values, the data interpretation, 
comparison, and extrapolation will also be affected.

<H2>264. Conducting a Personal Protective Clothing and Equipment Assessment: 
Three Different Approaches.</H2>
<B>P. Kaufmann</B>, L. Booher, W. Diana, T. Webster, Exxon Chemical Americas, 
Linden, NJ<P>
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is used to control employee exposure to 
physical and chemical hazards at the petrochemical operating sites. Periodic 
assessments of PPE programs play a key role in ensuring the effective use of 
PPE. A PPE assessment typically includes hazards identification, PPE 
assessment and recommendation, as well as the development of a worker 
communication and documentation package.  Envelopment and implementation of 
an effective PPE program can be approached in several different ways.  The 
specific approach selected depends on the status of the site's current PPE 
program, the level of worker participation desired, and in part, on the 
resourcing available.<P>
We have used three different approaching for conducting PPE assessments. The 
first allows a "traditional" approach where the industrial hygienist conducts 
a hazard evaluation and makes PPE recommendations with input from unit 
supervisory personnel. The second approach links the PPE assessment to a 
detailed, task-based exposure assessment.  In the third approach, workers are 
more directly involved in the PPE assessment using a team structure based on 
the site's behavioral safety process.<P>
Each assessment was found to provide the information needed to define hazards 
and recommend the appropriate PPE while meeting the requirements of the U.S. 
OSHA PPE standard (29 CFR 1910.132-138), Linking the PPE assessment to an 
in-depth exposure assessment can provide for a more comprehensive PPE 
assessment than the "traditional" approach with a minimal amount of 
incremental resourcing.  The behavioral safety team approach requires more 
resourcing than the other two approaches, but it has the potential to result 
in more employee ownership of the PPE program.

<H2>265. Evaluation Criteria and Exposure Assessment for Personal Protective 
Equipment for Emergency Responders Upon Exposure to Chemical Nerve Agent.</H2>
<B>R. Fairfax</B>, U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Washington, D.C.<P>
In the determination of appropriate levels of personal protective equipment 
there was initial disagreement between the community responders and the Army 
as to what the proper protection should consist of.  The community 
responders, NIOSH and CDC, and the Army all looked to OSHA for this 
evaluation, determination, and recommendation.<P>
As part of the weapons treaties with the Soviet Union, the United States is 
required to destroy the arsenal of chemical nerve agents stored in military 
facilities throughout the United States. The nerve agent destruction process 
calls for the construction of incinerators at each storage facility where the 
nerve agent is to be burned.  The problem lies with the potential of an 
accidental agent release that is carried off the military base (off site) and 
toward surrounding communities.  Once the agent release is off site, it 
becomes the responsibility of community responders to carry out evacuation 
procedures of adjacent communities.  Military respirators available to 
responders are not NIOSH certified. The personal protective clothing used by 
the military is also available, however it is not well accepted by community 
responders and may present additional problems such as heat stress.  The 
problems evaluated in this process included: 1) the determination of 
acceptable respirators and levels of respiratory protection when SCBA would 
be impractical and no other NIOSH approved respirators are available; 2) an 
acceptable level of protective clothing when limited test data on nerve agent 
penetration into protective clothing was available.<P>
The paper presents the evaluation and decision logic used by OSHA to arrive 
at acceptable levels of protection that could be used by community responders 
in the event of a nerve agent release.

<H2>266. Hazmat Emergency Response Training at the Liquefied Gaseous Fuels 
Spill Test Facility (LFGSTF) Using Controlled-Large Scale Chemical Spills.</H2>
<B>C. Giesler</B>, EG&G Energy Measurements, Las Vegas, NV<P>
Training of hazmat emergency response personnel is required by OSHA 1910.120 
for personnel, who as part of their employment, are expected to control and 
mitigate leaks or spills of hazardous substances.  Until recently, hazmat 
personnel have only been able to test the effectiveness of their training 
when involved in real emergencies with hazardous materials.  Hazmat training 
using controlled large scale chemical spills allows emergency response 
personnel to test their control and mitigation techniques in a controlled 
environment, prior to responding to a real emergency. At the LGFSTF, 
personnel were involved in three days of classroom instruction which was then 
followed by two days of field exercises. The classroom portion of the 
training was similar to classroom instructions that participants had received 
during previous emergency response training.  For this training, it was the 
field exercises that made it so unique.  The primary purpose of the field 
exercises was to allow each hazmat team the opportunity to dress out in their 
chemical protective clothing and to participate in the control and mitigation 
of hazardous substances during large scale spills.  All field exercises were 
videotaped and observed by qualified personnel. Videotapes and instructor 
comments were used as an instructional aid to critique each hazmat team at 
the conclusion of each test series.  Results of this type of training have 
shown that by allowing hazmat personnel the opportunity to participate in 
this type of exercise, participants are better able to judge the 
effectiveness of their existing programs, their equipment, and to identify 
not only their deficiencies and weaknesses, but also allow each hazmat team 
the chance to share their experiences and ideas.

<H2>302. Cadmium Surveillance in a State Health Department.</H2>
<B>E. Senn</B>, D. Schill, D. Singh, M. Stanbury, New Jersey State Department 
of Health, Trenton, NJ<P>
Cadmium exposure can produce health effects ranging from pulmonary edema to 
chronic kidney disease and possibly lung cancer. New Jersey is one of six 
states requiring clinical laboratory reporting of elevated cadmium levels. 
Levels greater than or equal to 5 &#181;g/L in blood and 3 &#181;g/gram 
creatinine (10 &#181;g/L before 1994) in urine are reportable in New Jersey. 
Two hundred fifteen reports of elevated blood levels (mean = 5.11 &#181;g/L) 
and 152 reports of elevated urine levels (mean=6.8 &#181;g/L) have been 
received on 294 individuals since 1985.  Since 1992, with funding from NIOSH 
under its SENSOR program, the NJDOH has conducted follow-up with reported 
individuals and employers using the model for surveillance of occupational 
lead toxicity already implemented in 18 states.  The NJDOH has also conducted 
outreach and technical assistance with New Jersey employers identified as 
possibly using cadmium but for which no elevated reports have been received 
to inform them of the recently promulgated OSHA cadmium standard.  Several 
hundred employers were mailed educational material on the OSHA cadmium 
standard and an NJDOH survey inquiring how cadmium is used in the workplace. 
The 53 largest users were then interviewed by telephone concerning their 
industrial hygiene practices.  Exposures were found to be under the OSHA PEL 
except in six workplaces. Twenty-nine employers were not performing cadmium 
biological monitoring of workers, nor were they required to, either because 
of exemptions in the OSHA standard or the stay on the standard for dry color 
formulators.  Sixteen employers discontinued using cadmium during follow-up. 
NJDOH disease and hazard surveillance both suggest that cadmium is not a 
major occupational hazard in New Jersey.

<H2>303. Exposures and Health Effects: A Medical Evaluation of Workers at a 
Sodium Azide Production Plant.</H2>
<B>D. Trout</B>, E. Esswein, T. Hales, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Sodium azide is the principal gas-generating agent used to inflate automobile 
supplemental restraint systems (airbags), which are being increasingly used 
in the United States and worldwide. Sodium azide, and a reactant product 
hydrazoic acid, affect the cardiovascular system by causing peripheral 
vasodilation, potentially leading to hypotension, headache, and other 
symptoms.  In 1994, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH) evaluated occupational exposure to sodium azide and hydrazoic acid 
among employees of the only continuous sodium azide production plant in the 
U.S. Personal breathing zone (PBZ) air sampling during this evaluation found 
exposures to sodium azide and hydrazoic acid above the NIOSH recommended 
exposure limits (REL). The corresponding medical evaluation included a 
symptoms questionnaire, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and blood 
analysis for azide. Headache (10 of 11 [91%]) and episodes of "low" blood 
pressure (9 of 11 [82%]) were reported by participants as occurring in the 
production areas within the six months prior to the NIOSH evaluation. Four of 
11 (36%) employees reported mild headaches during the NIOSH survey. One of 10 
employees whose blood pressure was monitored met our criteria for an episode 
of hypotension during the workshift (a drop in systolic [at least 20 mm Hg] 
and diastolic [at least 10 mm Hg] blood pressure). This episode was recorded 
while the employee was performing a packing operation during which a PBZ air 
sample revealed a concentration of sodium azide five times the NIOSH REL. 
None of the blood samples had detectable azide, but the limit of detection of 
the analytic method to detect azide in blood was found to be 2800 ppb, which 
was an order of magnitude greater than expected blood levels.  As a result of 
this evaluation, recommendations were made to identify areas of exposure and 
to prevent potential health effects.

<H2>304. Potential Mercury Toxicity Among Workers in a Battery Recycling 
Plant.</H2>
<B>D. Kang</B>, J. Hurrell, C. Reh, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Although alkaline batteries are known to contain a small amount of mercury, 
there is inadequate information on mercury toxicity among workers in battery 
recycling plants. We investigated a plant where a variety of batteries (e.g., 
alkaline household battery, railroad battery, etc.) were recycled.  A 
cross-sectional survey was conducted to determine potential mercury toxicity 
among 58 workers.  The investigation consisted of environmental monitoring, 
measurement of urinary mercury levels, and administration of symptom 
questionnaires (e.g., CNS, respiratory, gum, and teeth, and GI symptoms).<P>
The mean (&#177;SE) urinary mercury level of all 58 employees evaluated was 
39 (&#177;5.4) UG/G creatinine.  Forty percent (23/58) of individual values 
were above the biological exposure indices (BEI) recommended by ACGIH (35 
&#181;g/g creatinine) and 31% (18/58) were above the recommended limit by WHO 
(50 &#181;g/g creatinine). The mean urinary mercury level of 10 employees who 
worked in an area where alkaline household batteries were recycled was 49 
&#181;g/g creatinine; 50% (5/10) of individual values of these workers were 
above the BEI of ACGIH. There was a statistically significant correlation 
between ambient mercury levels assessed by personal breathing zone monitoring 
and urinary mercury levels (Pearson's r=0.32, p=0.04, n=42). There were 
statistically significant relationships between urinary mercury levels and 
CNS and respiratory symptoms, feeling tired, weak, depressed, and shortness 
of breath (tested by Fisher's exact test with a significance level of 0.05). 
These results are consistent with the presence of mercury toxicity among 
workers in a battery recycling plant.

<H2>305. Body Burden of Dioxins and Furans in Sawmill Workers Exposed to 
Chlorophenol Fungicides.</H2>
<B>C. Campbell</B>, J. Bert, K. Teschke, University of British Columbia, 
Vancouver, B.C., Canada; P. Quintana, San Diego State University, San 
Diego, CA<P.
Chlorophenols were used to prevent sapstain fungal growth on lumber in 
sawmills located in Canada, United States, Scandinavia, and elsewhere, from 
the 1940s to the late 1980s. Elevated levels of chlorophenols have been 
measured in the urine of sawmill workers, particularly those with dermal 
exposure.  Since polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and furans (PCDFs) 
are contaminants created in the manufacture of chlorophenols, it is expected 
that sawmill workers were exposed.  PCDD/Fs have half-lives on the order of 
years and accumulate in adipose tissue. Biological monitoring is not easily 
carried out due to its invasive nature and cost, consequently little 
information exists on PCDD/F levels in sawmill workers.<P>
In a cohort of Canadian sawmill workers assembled for a cancer incidence and 
mortality study, we estimated the adipose tissue concentrations of PCDD/F 
compounds, using a single-compartment pharmacokinetic model.  Estimates of 
dermal and inhalation exposure to chlorphenols throughout the working lives 
of the sawmill workers were combined with PCDD/F contamination levels, 
half-lives, and absorption efficiencies to estimate tissue concentrations. 
Each variable in the model was assigned a distribution based on 
literature-reported data, as well as information about the sawmill cohort. 
The predicted distributions of PCDD/F concentrations were then estimated 
using 5000-run Monte Carlo analyses.  Predicted median adipose tissue 
concentrations of all dioxins and tetra- and penta-chlorinated furans among 
the sawmill workers were similar to background levels in unexposed residents 
of the same region, though about 10 to 30% of sawmill workers were estimated 
to have elevated levels of these congeners. Median levels of hexa-, hepta-, 
and octa-chlorinated furans were predicted to be 2 to 15 times background 
levels.  Sensitivity analyses indicate that the variability of the model 
predictions was most influenced by estimates of PCDD/F skin absorption 
efficiency, duration of employment at the sawmill, and levels of PCDD/F in 
the chlorophenols.

<H2>306. Exposure Assessment of Workers at Hazardous Waste Sites Based on 
Concurrent Air Monitoring and Breath Sampling.</H2>
<B>C. Komis</B>, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA; P. Donnelly, Drexel 
University, Philadelphia, PA; L. Levin, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA<P>
The analysis of exhaled breath has assumed greater recognition and use as a 
biomonitoring index of exposure particularly since its incorporation into the 
Biological Exposure Indices (BEIs). Breath sampling is a non-invasive, easy 
to perform method, readily adaptable to on-site monitoring.  Nonetheless, 
breath sampling has not been applied appreciably in evaluating the multiple, 
and often unidentified, volatile chemical exposures experienced during 
hazardous waste site remediation.  In this study, breath analysis was used to 
evaluate worker exposure to volatile chemicals at hazardous waste sites. 
Pre- and post-shift alveolar breath samples were collected in Tedlar gas 
sampling bags using the Apnea Technique. Full-shift breathing zone samples 
were collected on charcoal tubes with low-flow pumps and with passive 
dosimeters.  Sample analysis was performed by a standard gas chromatographic 
procedure with a flame ionization detector; mass spectrometry provided 
confirmatory identification of the specific contaminants.<P>
Standard statistical methods including regression analysis were employed to 
test the association and correlation of the breath sampling results with the 
airborne environmental exposure levels. The data suggest an association 
between the ambient exposure levels and elevated total hydrocarbon levels in 
the post-shift alveolar breath samples of hazardous waste workers, relative 
to their pre-shift breath levels.  Thus, comparative on-site breath sampling 
performed before and after the exposure period and the environmental exposure 
levels show greater promise of assessing more meaningfully the work exposures 
of hazardous waste workers and, indeed, of all workers exposed to volatile 
chemicals, than environmental air monitoring alone.

<H2>307. Use of 1-Hydroxypyrene Glucuronide in Human Urine as a Biomarker of 
Exposure to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons.</H2>
<B>D. Kang</B>, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH; P. Strickland, Johns Hopkins School 
of Public Health, Baltimore, MD<P>
Humans are exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from various 
occupational, environmental, medicinal, and dietary sources.  The measurement 
of specific PAH metabolites in human urine can be used to assess recent 
exposure to PAHs. We have measured a major pyrene metabolite, 1-hydroxypyrene 
glucuronide (1-OHP-gluc), in human urine in three groups of subjects with 
exposure to PAHs from occupation, diet, or smoking. The analytical method 
utilized solid phase extraction, immunoaffinity chromatography, and 
synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy. Urinary concentration of 1-OHP-gluc 
was measured 1) in a controlled feeding study of 10 subjects before, during, 
and after ingestion of charbroiled beef; 2) in a group of 44 steel plant 
workers and 40 on-site controls stratified by job category and smoking 
status; 3) in 47 cigarette smokers stratified by type of tobacco smoked 
(black or blond) and 50 controls.<P>
In all three studies, urinary 1-OHP-gluc was strongly associated with 
measured or estimated PAH exposure. The feeding study indicated that elevated 
urinary 1-OHP-gluc reflected recent (within 48-72 hours) exposure to PAH. The 
steel plant study indicated that workers in the high PAH exposure job 
categories (blast furnace or coke oven) had a mean urinary 1-OHP-gluc level 
of 10-fold higher than office workers.  The smoking study showed significant 
differences in mean urinary 1-OHP-gluc concentration between smokers and 
nonsmokers; and a dose-response relationship between number of cigarettes 
smoked and urinary 1-OHP-gluc. These validation studies support the use of 
urinary 1-OHP-gluc as a biomarker of recent exposure to PAHs.

<H2>308. Dermal Uptake of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Engine Room 
Personnel on Ships.</H2>
<B>R. Nordlinder</B>, R. Nilsson, Institute of Internal Medicine, 
G&#246;teborg, Sweden<P>
Engine room personnel have an increased risk of lung cancer and bladder 
cancer. Smoking habit is one explanation but occupational factors have also 
been suggested as etiological factors. Asbestos and polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAH) are possible factors in the engine room environment.  
Asbestos has been banned since the 1970s in Swedish ships. PAHs are still a 
component in heavy marine diesel oils and in lubricant oils and the 
machinists could be exposed to PAH by inhalation or dermal uptake during work 
in engine rooms.  The PAHs are metabolized to different metabolites and 
1-hydroxypyren is a metabolite to the common PAH pyrene. We have analyzed the 
excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene in urine in engine room personnel in different 
types of ships and compared them with unexposed personnel on the same ships.<P>
Twenty machinists and 14 unexposed men on five ships were included in the 
study.  Exposure to oil and oil products and smoking habits 24 hours before 
sampling was registered with a questionnaire.<P>
The 1-hydroxypyrene levels in urine were detected with a HPLC-method.<P> 
There was no difference in excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene between unexposed 
(0.12 &#181;mol/mol creatinine, 95% CI 0.06-0.18, N=14) and exposed with no 
dermal contact with oil (0.13 &#181;mol/mol creatinine, 95% CIH 0.01-0.16, 
N=4). Machinists who had dermal contact with oil and oil products had, 
however, a significant higher excretion (0.25 umol/mol creatinine, 95%CI 
0.15-0.35, N=16, p=0.03). A higher excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene was also seen 
in smokers but the effect was smaller than that of the oil exposure.<P>
This investigation shows that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be 
absorbed through unprotected skin. Dermal uptake seems to dominate compared 
to uptake through the respiratory system. Precautions to reduce skin uptake 
as use of protection gloves and overalls during work in the engine room 
should be encouraged.

<H2>309. Dermal Exposures and Uptake of Methanol: Model and Experimental 
Results.</H2>
<B>S. Batterman</B>, A. Franzblau, University of Michigan, Dept. of EIH, Ann 
Arbor, MI<P>
Concentrations of solvent metabolites in breath, urine, and blood are 
frequently used to estimate inhalation and percutaneous exposures.  The 
interpretation of such biological exposure indicators, however, greatly 
depends on the pattern of exposure and the timing of the sampling. To aid 
this interpretation, a model of dermal absorption, partitioning, and 
degradation of methanol is developed and validated.  The model includes 
stratum corneum, epidermis, blood, lung, body water, and urine compartments. 
Uptake into the skin is diffusion-limited. First order of metabolism of 
methanol is assumed.  The model is evaluated using studies in which human 
subjects immerse a hand in methanol for periods ranging up to 16 minutes. 
Methanol is measured in breath, blood, and urine before and after exposure.<P>
The model reproduces features needed to interpret biological exposure indices 
for dermal exposures.  Model and experimental results illustrate that during 
the period of dermal exposure, when the solvent is being taken up by the skin 
and subcutaneous tissue and diffused into the blood, arterial blood 
concentrations are approximately double venus blood concentrations. Peak 
concentrations of methanol in breath (<I>=</I>10 ppm for a 16-minute dermal 
exposure in one hand) show the result of a "first-pass" effect.  At the 
cessation of exposure, breath and arterial blood concentrations rapidly 
decline to an equilibrium between the major compartments of blood and body 
water.  As the reservoir of methanol in the exposed epidermis is depleted, 
venus blood concentrations peak (<I>=</I>14 mg/L for a 16-minute dermal 
exposure) <I>=</I>45 minutes following the cessation of exposure.

<H2>310. A Single Skin Contact with Toluene Diiscoyante (Tdi) Causes a 
One-Year Persistence of Airway Sensitization, Demonstrable in Vivo and in 
Vitro.</H2>
<B>U. Bickis</B>, Phoenix OHC, Inc., Kingston, Ontario, Canada; K. Nakatsu, 
Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada<P>
Worker sensitization to isocyanates has long been recognized, but the 
etiological mechanisms have remained enigmatic: individual response to 
challenge at the TLV concentration does not appear to be directly and/or 
consistently related to the degree of chronic airborne exposure, genetic 
allergic predisposition, level of TDI-specific antibodies and/or nonspecific 
bronchial hyperreactivity.  A clear understanding of causality can lead to 
more effective preventive measures.  Animal studies have been dismissed by 
some authorities because of the reported difficulty in eliciting isocyanate 
sensitization; this reservation appears to apply except where sensitizing 
exposure has been through skin contact.<P>
The thesis of this research was that worker skin contact with isocyanate is a 
critical event in many cases of airway hypersensitization. Using a guinea pig 
model (n+44), the study involved, sequentially:<P>
<OL>
<LI>topical application of 12 mg TDI (5%, in acetone) to intact skin; control 
animals received acteton;
<LI>serial determination (by ELISA) of levels of blood IgG directed against 
TDI-serum albumin conjugate;
<LI>plethysmographic determination of animals' airway response to TDI 
challenge; weeks 47-51;
<LI>pharmacological (tissue bath) characterization of tracheal response; 
weeks 63-71.</OL><P>
Within two weeks of the TDI application, all animals developed a high level 
of IgG against TDI. Even 63-71 weeks later, the mean IgG effect in sensitized 
animals was six times that of control animals; no immune response was 
observed after TDI inhalation challenge.  The TDI inhalation sensitivity of 
sensitized animals was seven time greater than that of control animals; in 
vitro, the mean tracheal contractions were 0.84 and -0.06 g, respectively. 
All reported differences were significant (p&lt;0.05). This work has led to 
the (renewed) recommendation of a "skin" notation for isocyanates. Workplace 
controls should reflect this.

<H2>251. The Use of Ergosterol to Measure Exposure to Fungal Propagules in 
Indoor Air.</H2>
<B>J. Miller</B>, J. Young, Plant Research Centre, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada<P>
The growth of fungi in buildings leads to health and comfort complaints 
depending on the fungi involved, duration of exposure and individual 
sensitivity. Fungal exposures in indoor air are usually estimated by the 
collection of air samples by impaction on agar surfaces.  Such samples 
provide information on "culturable" propagules but greatly underestimate the 
total spore numbers present. there are several reasons for this including 
decline in spore viability, choice of agar medium, and damage to the spores 
during sampling. Several comparative studies have reported positive 
correlations between viable and total fungal spores estimated by direct 
microscopy of microporous filter samples, but this varies according to the 
spore concentrations, which are subject to extreme temporal variation. 
Although reliable qualitative information is obtained, no useful quantitative 
information is acquired from such measurements.  The alternative approach is 
to measure an indicator biochemical present in the fungal propagules. One 
such chemical is &#223;-1,3-glucan, however, no studies have been reported on 
the variability of the concentration of this chemical in fungal spores. 
Another possibility is the fungal sterol ergosterol, which has been widely 
used in fungal ecology studies to estimate fungal biomass.<P>
Ergosterol was determined in spores of 11 species of <I>Aspergillus</I>, 
<I>Penicillium</I> and <I>Cladosporium</I> selected from the most common 
molds in 400 homes in Ontario. The ergosterol content of spores was highly 
correlated to their volume (r=0.785, p&lt;0.007). Spore ergosterol content 
was ca. 1 &#181;g/mg, which is the range reported for mycelia and varied by 
ca. 25% for the species tested. Ergosterol was determined in bedroom air 
samples taken during the winter in homes in southern Ontario.  The median 
ergosterol value corresponded to a total concentration of fungal spores of 
ca. 100 per m&#179;, in the range for other studies where total and viable 
propagules were determined by other methods. The sampling of air for 
ergosterol is a robust method for assessing fungal biomass in air.<P>
This method has been extended to settled dust which contributes to the fungal 
burden of air.

<H2>252. Ergosterol and Its Decomposition Products in Animal Feed Aerosols.</H2>
<B>M. Strength</B>, AT&T, Atlanta, GA; P. Gao, H. Dillon, University of 
Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL<P>
Ergosterol has been proposed as an index of fungal biomass in a variety of 
bulk biogenic materials and in house dust. The purpose of this study was to 
examine the relationship between fungal propagule count and ergosterol and 
photolytic decomposition products of ergosterol in dust suspended during the 
preparation of animal feed. Relatively large volumes of air (5-20 m&#179;) 
were sampled through Teflon-coated glass fiber filters. The collected 
aerosols were analyzed by C18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection at a wavelength of 282 
nm, by C8 reversed phase HPLC with tandem mass spectrometric detection 
(MS/MS) with an electroscopy interface, and by microscopy using bright field 
illumination with computer-assisted image analysis to determine a count of 
fungal propagules.<P>
A regression of the mass of ergosterol found by HPLC/UV against fungal spore 
count yielded as statistically significant (p&lt;0.025) correlation 
coefficient of 0.92 (n=5). Analysis by HPLC/MS/MS indicated the presence of 
not only ergosterol but two photolytic degradation products, Vitamin D2 and 
either tachysterol or lumisterol. The total amounts of these compounds and 
ergosterol correlated with the amounts of ergosterol observed by HPLC/UV 
(r= 0.84, p&lt;0.05, n=5) but were estimated to be an order of magnitude 
higher.<P>
It was concluded that either ergosterol alone or the sum of ergosterol and 
accompanying decomposition products provided an index of fungal propagule 
count in a specific aerosol generated by the mixing of animal feed.  The 
co-occurrence of these degradation products with ergosterol may provide 
additional useful information about the "aging" of fungal contaminants in 
biogenic dusts.

<H2>253. Toxins Produced by Fungi Found in Water-Damaged Buildings.</H2>
<B>W. Sorenson</B>, NIOSH, Morgantown, WV; B. Jarvis, J. Jiang, Y. Zhou, 
University of Maryland, College Park, MD<P>
Mycotoxins are small molecule secondary metabolites produced by a wide range 
of fungi which pose a risk to the health of humans and animals.  Numerous 
toxigenic fungi are well known to contaminate food and feed and thus pose a 
hazard through ingestion of farm produce. What is less well appreciated is 
that water-damaged buildings can also harbor toxigenic fungi which threaten 
the health of the building occupants.  Since the vast majority of mycotoxins 
are not volatile, the principal source of exposure in these buildings is due 
to inhalation of aerosolized spores and fungal-contaminated building 
materials. Our present state of knowledge suggests that only a relatively 
small number of fungal species (e.g., various <I>Penicillium, Aspergillus, 
Fusarium</I>, and especially <I>Stachybotrys atra</I>) pose a general health 
hazard.  Most reported cases deal with work-related disease, e.g., increased 
risk of liver cancer in granary workers exposed to aflatoxin-contaminated 
dust, although there is increasing concern with fungi in damp homes.<P>
In the winter of 1994, a cluster of 14 cases of pulmonary hemosiderosis was 
reported in the eastern part of Cleveland, Ohio. These unusual cases appeared 
only in infants ranging in age between one and eight months and were 
characterized by massive bleeding in the lungs.  No infective agents or 
environmental toxins were shown to be associated with this syndrome. However, 
all the target homes had continuing water problems which were most severe in 
the preceding summer when Cleveland experienced serious flooding in the area. 
The toxigenic fungus, <I>Stachybotrys atra</I> was found in all but one of 
the homes, and the levels of fungal activity were considerably higher than 
those found in control homes.  <I>S. atra</I> isolates collected from these 
homes have been shown to produce a number of highly toxic compounds.

<H2>254. Monitoring of Bacterial Load Using Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass 
Spectrometry for Muramic Acid Analysis and Culture Techniques.</H2>
<B>A. Fox</B>, K. Fox, M. Krahmer, University of South Carolina, 
Columbia, SC<P>
Plating techniques are traditionally used for assessing viable bacteria 
numbers in air. Alternatively, muramic acid, as a marker for peptidoglycan 
(PG) allows assessment of total bacterial load (including both culturable, 
non-culturable, dead and degraded cells). PG is present in both gram positive 
and gram negative bacterial PG and mimics the biological activity of 
endotoxin in many systems.  Samples for plating were collected in a barn 
using a single stage Andersen sampler. Colonies were characterized 
morphologically and by gram stain.  The mean bacterial load was 2.4 x 10&#179; 
colony forming units/m&#179; of air. The majority of colonies were 
gram-positive bacilli and filamentous rods.  Airborne dust was also collected 
on Teflon filters for MA analysis. The entire filter and associated dust was 
hydrolyzed to release MA which was converted to alditol acetate derivative 
and analyzed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS-MS). Most 
of our experience has been with triple quadropole instrumentation. Although, 
encouraging results have been obtained with a more modestly priced ion trap 
MS-MS instrument.  The concentration of MA in air was 1.6 &#177; 0.2 
ng/m&#179;. This value translates to a total bacteria load of 6.5 x 
10&#179; (if the non-culturable population was indeed primarily 
gram-positive) or 1.7 x 10<I>5</I> bacteria/m&#179; (if the non-culturable 
population was primarily gram-negative). Emission of muramic acid values (as 
a measure of bacterial peptidoglycan), using tandem mass spectrometry, adds 
to the limited group of indirect tests available for assessing airborne 
biocontamination.

<H2>255. Quantification of Lipopolysaccharide and Fungal Biomass in Organic 
Dust by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</H2>
<B>L. Larsson</B>, University of Lund, Lund, Sweden; H. Burge, D. Milton, 
Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA<P>
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria and certain fungi 
exhibit toxic effects upon inhalation.  Determination by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of 3-hydroxy fatty acids (3-OH FAs), 
which are LPS-specific constituents, and ergosterol, which is a 
fungus-specific membrane lipid, have been suggested as alternatives to the 
use of Limulus-based bioassay methods for measuring potency of endotoxin 
(the toxic component of which is LPS) and beta 1,3 glucan (present in many 
fungi). A GC-MS method for determining both 3-OH FAs and ergosterol from the 
same dust is described in the following.<P>
Samples of organic dust are heated in methanolic KOH and extracted with 
hexan:water.  The organic phase is evaporated, purified, and subjected to 
trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivization of ergosterol. The aqueous phase is 
acidified, evaporated, heated in methanolic HCl, extracted, purified, and 
subjected to TMS derivization of the 3-OH FAs. GC-MS analysis has revealed 
that &gt;95% of each of the 3-OH FAs present in the dust samples is found in 
the aqueous layer.  The relative amounts of individual 3-OH FAs in the 
samples provides information about the gram-negative bacteria present.  By 
using tandem MS (GC-MSMS), a method that has recently become practical due to 
developments in instrumentation, an even higher detection specificity is 
achieved than with conventional GC-MS.<P>
The amounts of 3-OHFAs in dust samples can be correlated with endotoxin 
activity and the amounts of ergosterol correlated with culturable fungi. The 
described method may be used for correlating inhalable LPS and fungal biomass 
exposure with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function changes.

<H2>256. Detecting Non-Culturable Air Biocontamination: Direct Quantitative 
Sampling of Indoor Air Biomass by Lipid Biomarker Analysis.</H2>
<B>S. MacNaughton</B>, Microbial Insights, Inc., Knoxville, TN<P>
To a large extent, standard methods for characterizing the microbial 
community of indoor air rely on culture based techniques such as Andersen, 
impactor, or impinger sampling. The success of these classical techniques 
depend on the ability of an organism to grow on "non-selective" media. 
However, as has been repeatedly documented, such viable counts consistently 
underestimate bacterial numbers from environmental samples by between 
90-99.9%.<P>
One approach to ameliorating the problems associated with culturing 
techniques is to determine biomass via the analysis of specific biochemical 
cell components.  Lipids are major components of all cell membranes, are 
labile and have profiles that vary considerably dependant on microorganism 
species.  To test the hypothesis that lipid analysis will enable 
quantification of bioaerosols, it was first necessary to compare lipid 
analysis of known volumes of culturable test organisms with conventional 
sampling method.  Replicate samples of <I>Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis</I> 
and <I>Mycobacterium fortuitum</I> and two mixtures of these organisms were 
deposited onto filtration media using a test stand constructed as a 
modification of the ASTM 1215 standard. Filter deposited bacterial numbers 
were determined by two methods: 1) by viable counts on media following 
collection in an all glass liquid impinger; and 2) by phospholipid analysis. 
Lipids were extracted from organisms on the filtration media in chloroform: 
methanol: buffer solvent from which the lipids were recovered in the organic 
phase.  Phospholipids were separated out from the extracts by fractionation 
on silicic acid columns, methylated, profiles analyzed and specific peaks 
identified by gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Lipid biomarker 
analysis of the bacterial phospholipids showed that numbers of bacteria 
quantified from the filters compared favorably with the liquid impinger 
counts.  Replicate samples clustered together following principal components 
analysis of the profiles.  We concluded that lipid analysis was comparable 
with standard sampling procedures where culturable organisms were studied. By 
enabling rapid quantitative analysis of bioaerosols, lipid analysis will 
allow characterization of culturable and non-culturable indoor air microbial 
communities in areas where air quality is in question.  Further studies using 
lipid analysis of non-culturable indoor air pollutants such as endotoxin are 
currently in progress.

<H2>257. PCR for Enhanced Bioaerosol Detection.</H2>
<B>L. Stetzenbach</B>, A. Alvarez, M. Buttner, UNLV/HRC, Las Vegas, NV<P>
Monitoring of bioaerosols has traditionally been focused on culture-based 
methods.  However, bacterial cells may be nonculturable due to the stress of 
aerosolization and aerobiological sampling. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
used to amplify specific genetic sequences, has been shown to detect airborne 
microorganisms with greater sensitivity and specificity than culture. Recent 
laboratory and field experiments were designed to optimize PCR protocols for 
use in bioaerosol monitoring.  The amplification of plasmid target sequence 
resulted in a detection limit of a single bacterial cell using freeze-thaw 
and solid-phase cell lysis methods, within 5 and 9 hours, respectively. With 
a genomic target, the sensitivity of the solid-phase method was 10-fold lower 
than with the freeze-thaw method.  AGI-30 samplers were used to collect 
environmental bioaerosols before and after inoculation with a target organism 
to obtain data on sampling stress and interferences due to the presence of 
non-target DNA. Inhibition to PCR amplification was observed when 10&#179; to 
10<I>4</I> CFU/m&#179; of environmental organisms were present but successful 
amplification was obtained with a 10-fold dilution of collection buffer. 
Sampling stress resulted in an order of magnitude decrease in culturability 
of cells but no difference in sensitivity of the PCR assay was observed. In a 
field validation experiment, the presence of airborne <I>E. coli</I> and/or 
<I>Shigella</I> sp. were detected in outdoor samples using genomic primers. 
This research verifies that PCR represents a rapid, sensitive alternative to 
culture-based detection of airborne microorganisms.

<H2>244. Positive Incentives for Implementation of Work-Site Programs.</H2>
<B>J. Platner</B>, Cornell University, Albany, NY<P>
Positive incentives for compliance are rapidly expanding in their popularity 
in national and state legislative and regulatory initiatives.  Supplementing 
traditions in negative incentives associated with OSHA citations and criminal 
actions, there is a whole range of proposed positive incentives which have 
great potential for broadening the impact to include smaller employers who 
have largely been unaffected by OSHA enforcement initiatives. A range of 
initiatives and voluntary programs will be outlined, based on current 
discussions in New York state and nationally.  These include initiatives in 
several states to implement "self-evaluative privilege" laws to shield 
internal audit results from fact finding and public disclosure, and other 
measures to reduce current liability-based disincentives for programs to 
anticipate hazards and develop plans for evaluation and control.  Several 
insurance-based initiatives to create program-based risk pools which 
encourage employers to implement effective programs, will also be considered. 
Possible positive initiatives will also be discussed from the perspective of 
appropriate oversight which must balance internal audit, government 
enforcement actions, and third-party audits. Both financial auditing systems 
and ISO 9000 quality management standards provide comparable models of 
oversight. With proper oversight and controls, such positive incentives could 
provide a critical supplement to current negative incentives in influencing 
activities in more than 6 million U.S. workplaces. This also offers a 
valuable opportunity for expanding initiatives to prevent injury and disease 
in a period of declining enforcement funds and increasing resistance to more 
stringent specification standards. 

<H2>245. A Collaborative Approach with a Regulatory Agency in Developing 
Control Recommendations for Mercury in Wastewater.</H2>
<B>B. Weeks</B>, Environmental Health & Engineering, Inc., Newton, MA<P>
The EPA and many state and local agencies, including the Massachusetts Water 
Resources Authority (MWRA), have scrutinized the impacts of mercury 
discharged into the environment. Key substances used in research and 
diagnostic work, particularly reagents, contain trace amounts of mercury that 
are not required to be listed in content descriptions.  These trace amounts 
of mercury tend to collect in the organic material present in piping systems 
and as a consequence can slough off into the wastewater stream at any time.  
Many hospitals and laboratories in the MWRA service territory have 
encountered significant difficulties in meeting the agency's mercury limit, 
receiving enforcement actions ranging from a notice of violation to discharge 
fines.  To address this issue, the MWRA established a Mercury Products Work 
Group in the fall of 1994 to develop strategies to reduce mercury flowing 
into the sewer system.  As part of this effort, 28 Boston area hospitals and 
medical institutions pooled their resources to identify and resolve the 
problem in their wastewater stream, a unique effort to bring together a 
regulatory agency and medical facilities.<P>
The Hospital Mercury WorkGroup approached the problem from three directions: 
to identify the sources of contamination and develop control recommendations; 
to develop guidelines for removing residual mercury from hospital wastewater, 
and to identify and evaluate potential mercury pre-treatment systems. Product 
manufacturers and distributors have assisted in this effort by supplying 
mercury-free alternatives.<P>
Source reduction through identification and education continues to offer the 
best means to reduce the amount of mercury being discharged into wastewater 
systems.  A database of products used by hospitals developed by this group 
identifies products containing mercury.  Continued testing of products 
contained in that database is making it easier for hospitals to practice 
effective source control and avoid further pollution into the wastewater.

<H2>246. Working Within the Nation's Capital to Combat Environmental Hazards.</H2>
<B>S. Heath</B>, L. Lewis, Alice Hamilton Occupational Health Center, 
Landover, MD; T. Barnett, DHCD, Washington, D.C.; M. Mbanaso, Howard 
University, Washington, D.C.<P>
In Washington, D.C., the unemployment rate among low-income, minority 
community residence ranks among the highest in the nation.  In addition, 
residents of disadvantaged communities are often unaware of hazards from 
peeling lead paint and friable asbestos present in much of the older housing 
where they live.  The Alice Hamilton Occupational Health Center (AHOHC) leads 
three programs to combat unemployment and the lack of knowledge of 
environmental hazards in our nation's capital.  The District of Columbia 
Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) and AHOHC have 
cooperated through the Environmental Support Training Support Program (ESTS). 
The purpose of this program was to train low income residents of 
disadvantaged communities for successful careers in environmental 
restoration. The AHOHC staff trained participants in asbestos removal, lead 
paint abatement, first aid, and CPR.  AHOHC works with two other nonprofit 
organizations, ACORN and the Council for Latino Agencies, to form the D.C. 
Coalition to End Lead Poisoning. The coalition works to educate community 
members about the dangers of lead poisoning through presentations at local 
high schools, blood screenings, and health fairs.  In addition, the coalition 
provides technical assistance in both English and Spanish to D.C. residents 
to combat lead poisoning.<P>
In addition, AHOHC and Howard University are cooperating to provide life 
skills and literacy classes as well as lead and asbestos abatement training 
to minority youth, aged 18-25 years.  This project teams graduates with 
experience environmental contractors for employment. AHOHC has learned the 
importance of using interactive teaching methods in the language of community 
residents to provide awareness and training to combat environmental hazards 
in the nation's capital.

<H2>247. Human Operator Capabilities and Behavior in Safety Activities.</H2>
<B>A. Coblentz</B>, P. Cabon, B. Caceres, F. Mourey, Laboratoire 
D'Anthropologie, Appliquee, Paris, France<P>
The probability of choosing an individual who will fit into his job reaches 
15% when the selection is based on "feelings" (interviews), 35% when 
personality tests or capabilities tests are only used, and 76% when the 
assessment center is used in conjunction with traditional methods.<P>
On the basis of these results, a research has been conducted in order to 
improve the selection procedure of highway patrollers.  Almost all French 
highways are continuously monitored, 24 hours a day, by these personnel. The 
highway is usually divided into portions of 50 km, each of them representing 
a district. In each district, five patrollers work in three shifts (morning, 
afternoon, and night shift).  They drive a van and watch the highway, 
including rest areas and gas stations.  They are in charge of detecting 
accidents, alerting rescue teams and the district.  They must also mark out 
accident locations to assure safety of other motorists. In order to determine 
both the capabilities and behavior required in this job, a task analysis is 
based on documents and on-the-field observations have been achieved.  From 
this preliminary analysis, it has been developed and then tested a selection 
procedure based on four evaluation dimensions: complete medical check up, 
psychomotor capabilities, risk awareness, and behavioral assessment.<P>
It has been shown that this method provides some useful and complementary 
evaluations of the main aspects necessary to insure the safety on the 
highway.  This method has been standardized with patrollers currently 
working.  The next step concerns the transposition of the behavioral 
assessment in formation supervision in order to correct the negative points 
emphasized in their behavior.

<H2>248. The Role of Science and Social Concerns in Occupational Health 
Policy.</H2>
<B>N. Esmen</B>, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK<P>
Although the sound basis provided by the scientific rigor for the formulation 
of occupational health policy is essential, it is important to realize the 
limitations of value neutral inputs to the policy making process.  The 
sciences provide the predictive elements. but, as in any action with societal 
implications, occupational health policy has other dimensions.  To illustrate 
the importance of intangible considerations in occupational health policy, a 
set of policy decisions were constructed and were quantitatively analyzed 
using game theory and multiple criteria optimizations.<P>
The policy models were constructed using an assumed quantitative set of 
preferences and power levels for the involved groups.  Assumed outcome and 
risk probabilities and the cost/benefit estimates of potential policy 
decisions were also used to define the model parameters that can be 
quantified.  If the involved groups are politically or economically able to 
participate in the decision making process, then their social concerns are 
reflected as group preferences may be quantified. If all the constituents are 
powerful enough to participate, then the results are not expected to be 
controversial.  However, in many industrial situations the health risk taking 
group is sufficiently small so that it can participate only through a distant 
proxy.  Thus they may not have the power to enforce their social concerns. In 
other cases, the normative concerns would only be reflected as an external 
constraint that would not quantitatively influence the results of any 
analysis.<P>
The quantitative analysis of the weak participant models show that in 
surprisingly many situations, the policy results would be economically 
optimal when socially unacceptable or undesirable. These results suggest that 
the advocacy of normatively neutral mechanisms as the sole of the most 
important determinant of "good" policy is disingenuous, because such an 
advocacy inherently denies the possibility of social irresponsibility in 
policy making.

<H2>249. Should Bringing Good Science to the Capital Be a Political Process?</H2>
<B>C. Crutchfield</B>, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ<P>
A charge to protect the health of workers lies at the heart of industrial 
hygiene profession.  Our professional growth is strongly influenced by our 
ability to evaluate and apply the best available science and technology to 
assessments of worker exposures and contaminant control strategies. The broad 
scope of the industrial hygiene profession necessitates substantial reliance 
on the technical expertise of regulatory agencies and technical committees to 
help assess technological innovations.  Although actual definitions of best 
available science and technology are obviously open to interpretation, it 
seems reasonable to assume that such interpretations are generally based on 
available scientific evidence.  The personal experience of bringing a faster 
and more scientifically defensible method of respirator fit testing to the 
capital for regulatory consideration and acceptance produced some revealing 
insights regarding the relative merits of hard science and cold politics in 
such deliberation.<P>
The scientific evidence provided to OSHA in support of accepting controlled 
negative pressure (CNP) technology for respirator fit testing was 
substantial, especially when compared to the available scientific evidence 
that supports OSHA's current and proposed generate aerosol fit test standard. 
The chronological record of the 814 days OSHA spent evaluating CNP technology 
details a fascinating case study of new technology challenging an entrenched 
standard that is based primarily on assumptions that were never validated. 
The spectrum of responses and reactions contained in that record raises some 
thought-provoking questions about how our profession deals with technological 
change. This paper examines that issue by presenting an overview of the major 
issues and decisions that emerged during deliberations about CNP acceptance 
both inside and outside OSHA.

<H2>250. Industrial Hygiene Initiatives in Eastern Europe.</H2>
<B>A. Nawakowski</B>, Nawakowski & Associates, Windsor, CT<P>
The AIHA International Affairs Committee has been very active in 
collaborating with occupational health professionals in several Eastern 
European countries. Many of the contacts were made through the World Health 
Organization Collaborative Center, Institute of Occupational Medicine and 
Environmental Health at Sosnowiec, Poland, which deals with health and safety 
problems in the coal mines and heavy industry in Silesia. This presentation 
will discuss a successful and ongoing pilot program in Poland where AIHA 
members are taking part in assisting: 1) to start a graduate program in 
industrial hygiene based on ABET accredited requirements; 2) training 
technicians at a large chemical manufacturer how to evaluate work exposure to 
hazards (this will potentially serve as a teaching laboratory for the 
graduate program); 3) assisting in pursuing IH laboratory accreditation or 
equivalent QA/QC. These achievements serve as a model for broader initiatives 
to expand the profession of industrial hygiene globally by building local 
resources and encouraging broader interactions among occupational health 
professionals.

<H1>Confined Spaces: Computers, Rescues, and Air Monitoring Papers (75-80)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>75. Development of a Comprehensive, Computer-Based, Confined Space 
Management System.</H2>
<B>P. Crawford</B>, Pacific Environmental Services, Inc., Herndon, VA; A. 
Dooley, 78th AMDS/SPGB, Robins Air Force Base, GA; V. D'Amato, Pacific 
Environmental Services, Inc., Herndon, VA<P>
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Confined Space 
Standard, 29 CFR 1910.146, requires the establishment of a comprehensive 
confined space entry program.  The standard specifies performance criteria 
for safe entry into confined spaces, documentation, and training 
requirements.  In order to aid compliance with the standard and ensure the 
health and safety of entrants, a computer-based confined space management 
system has been designed.  It provides interactive access to critical 
information about the confined space and includes a detailed confined space 
assessment protocol.  Completion of the assessment protocol by a qualified 
confined space program manager results in designation of the space as a 
"non-permit required" or "permit required" confined space.  The assessment 
record also specifies public safety, engineering control, personal 
protective equipment, and respiratory protection requirements.  Specific 
entry procedures are appended to each assessment record.  The system 
generates entry permits, tracks open permits, and provides exception reports 
for permit discrepancies.  A personnel qualifications module verifies that 
entrants, attendants, and supervisors indicated on the permit have received 
proper training for the roles indicated.  An emergency search function has 
been developed which allows emergency responders to gain immediate access to 
critical information regarding the confined space.  The database includes 
diary functions that are used to record entry problems, data discrepancies, 
and log entry events.  A report function assists in development of annual 
reports for OSHA compliance and includes an ad hoc report writer.  The 
system is designed to be compatible with local or wide area networks or can 
be used as a stand-alone work station.  The confined space management system 
has been used successfully to manager over 4500 individual confined spaces 
including 2500 "permit required" confined spaces at a large industrial 
complex. The system significantly aids compliance with OSHA requirements and 
promotes the safety and health of confined space entrants.

<H2>76. Rescue Compliance Issues: Revisions to 29 CFR 1910.146 
Permit-Required Confined Spaces.</H2> 
<B>M. Roop</B>, Roco Rescue, Baton Rouge, LA<P>
OSHA proposes to strengthen and clarify rescue provisions to its 
Permit-Required Confined Space Standard (1910.146).  At issue are the 
competency levels of rescue teams regarding: 1) timeliness of response; 2) 
rescue training; and 3) rescue equipment. Rescue response can be divided 
into six increments of time including: a) reaction time; b) notification; c) 
response; d) assessment; e) preparation; f) rescue.  The adequacy of 
training can be determined by written and performance-based evaluations of 
the rescue team as outlined in ANSI (American National Standards Institute) 
Z117.1-1989 Section 15.5.<P>
Criteria for the evaluator of rescue services are based on OSHA and ANSI 
definitions of a "qualified person."  Criteria for rescuers and rescue 
instructors are being determined by the National Fire Protection Association 
(NFPA) Technical Rescue Committee-Confined Space Rescue Task Force.  Rescue 
equipment should meet or exceed NFPA Standard 1983, latest edition.  The 
type and amount of rescue equipment can be determined through performance 
evaluations.  Rescue teams must also be aware of rescue requirements in 
other OSHA regulations.<P>
Getting into compliance with OSHA's 1910.146 Permit-Required Confined Space 
Standard involves the inventorying and typing of all confined spaces.  
Typing of confined spaces must be based on OSHA's criteria, which include: 
a) size opening; b) configuration; c) accessibility.  The various types of 
confined spaces must be specified in order to establish required training 
and practice drills.  Classifying confined spaces, based on the personal 
protective equipment required for entry, will determine response 
requirements for rescue services ("Rescue Stand-By" or Rescue Available").

<H2>77. Real World Air Sampling in Confined Spaces.</H2>
<B>C. Clarke</B>, Rhone-Poulenc, Winder, GA<P>
Prior to entry into any confined space, its atmosphere must be tested so 
that appropriate steps can be taken to safeguard entrants entering that 
space.  Testing is conducted for oxygen, combustible gas, and then toxic 
contaminant level.  While there is not much discussion on how to determine 
oxygen or combustible gas level, toxic gas levels can be difficult to 
determine in a timely or cost-effective manner.  If a space cannot be 
isolated, continuous monitoring is required by the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration.  This is also good general practice.  Again, for 
oxygen and combustible gas monitoring, this is easily accomplished, while 
for toxic contaminants this can be difficult if not impossible.  For 
example, if welding is done in a confined space, there is no recognized, 
practical method to determine the dynamic welding fume level in the space at 
any one time, let alone on a continuous basis.  Even sampling for many gases 
and vapors can be difficult.  Colorimetric tubes do not exist for many 
materials, cannot be used to measure some materials at relevant levels, and 
certainly cannot be used to measure a material on a continuous basis.  While 
photoionization detectors can be used for some applications, they are not 
specific for particular vapors in mixed vapor environments and may require 
worst case assumptions.  Other instruments such as portable gas 
chromatographs may also have applications in some environments, but are 
expensive, require good maintenance by trained technicians, and are often 
not rugged enough for real world confined space workplaces.  The level of 
sophistication of contract firms specializing in confined space work is also 
very varied.  As a result, the use of air-supplied respirators for confined 
space entries is often dictated by good practice and for safeguarding 
employee health.

<H2>78. Solvent Exposure and Controls During Metal Refinishing.</H2>
<B>N. Clark</B>, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY; M. Goldberg, 
W. Jones, Hunter College of CUNY, New York, NY<P>
Metal maintenance workers use volatile solvents with recognized health and 
physical hazards during the refinishing of decorative metal finishes in 
commercial buildings.  Traditional surface preparation for metal finishes on 
elevators, doors, wall paneling, and other architectural components involves 
the removal of lacquer finishes with strippers containing acetone, methanol, 
toluene, methyl ethyl ketone and various acetates.  After surfaces are 
prepared, solvent-based lacquers are sprayed onto the metal.  Exposure to 
solvent vapors and flammable atmospheres were assessed in various metal 
refinishing operations.  In several of the enclosed work spaces, short-term 
exposure limits for acetone and methanol were exceeded, and flammable vapor 
concentrations were measured in excess of ten percent of the lower explosive 
limit (LEL). Solvent concentrations and LEL measurements were within 
accepted standards when refinishing operations were conducted in 
well-ventilated areas.<P>
Investigators worked with industry representatives to design alternative 
work procedures to reduce solvent exposures and fire hazards.  Water-based 
strippers and lacquers formulated to reduce solvent content and flammability 
were evaluated during refinishing operations in enclosed spaces.  Results 
showed that fire hazards and exposures to organic solvent vapors were 
minimized with the new materials.  Use of these alternative products was 
recommended for metal refinishing operations in general and specifically for 
use in elevators and other enclosed spaces.  When solvent-based materials 
are used, engineering and work practices controls including ventilation and 
vapor reduction techniques were recommended.

<H2>79. Multi-Gas Instrument Performance in Extremely Low Temperatures.</H2>
<B>N. Barone</B>, Exxon Biomedical Sciences, Inc, East Millstone, NJ; A. 
Nowosiwsky, Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, Anchorage, AK<P>
It is often necessary to use direct reading gas testing instruments to 
measure hydrocarbon vapors, hydrogen sulfide, and oxygen deficient 
atmospheres in environments where temperatures are below the instrument 
manufacturer's prescribed limits.  This study was directed at defining the 
reliability of five gas testing instruments in extremely low temperature 
environments.<P>
The instruments evaluated are used under two conditions in extremely cold 
environments: 1) the instruments are calibrated at room temperature, 
maintained in a warm environment, and then briefly brought into the cold 
environment for measurements; or 2) the technician will keep the instrument 
inside of their coat to protect the instrument, and remove it occasionally 
to measure gas concentration.  Both conditions were simulated in this 
study.<P>
Three passive sampling instrument models equipped with methane, oxygen, and 
hydrogen sulfide sensors, and two active sampling models with methane and 
oxygen sensors were evaluated. Instrument performance was evaluated under 
two challenge conditions: 1) exposure to cold test gas atmospheres while the 
instruments were maintained at room temperature; and 2) exposure to both a 
cold environment and cold gas atmospheres over a one-hour test period. Tests 
were conducted at four temperatures (23,5,-20, and -30&#176; F) with three 
challenge gases (11 % methane, 10 ppm hydrogen sulfide, and 19.1% oxygen).<P>
Instruments maintained at room temperature accurately measured cold gas 
concentrations and alarmed appropriately.  When placed in cold test 
environments, the passive sampling models displayed accurate gas 
concentrations and alarm function.  One passive sampling model with alkaline 
batteries failed after about 20 minutes when below 32&#176; F.  The active 
sampling models responded accurately to methane but exhibited significant 
upward drift for oxygen when at or below 32&#176; F.<P>
It is concluded that the instruments tested can be used in low temperatures 
if the user understands the limitations of the instrument, and applies the 
appropriate test protocol.

<H1>Construction Papers (105-110)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>105. Construction Contractor Respiratory Program Evaluation.</H2> 
<B>N. Davis</B>, Carpenters Health & Safety Fund, Washington, D.C.; V. 
McDougall, Carpenters Health & Safety Fund, Washington, D.C.<P>
This paper summarizes the findings of a questionnaire survey of union 
carpenters and other construction trades during 1995 and 1996.  The 
questionnaire evaluates the type of respirator use and associated exposures, 
training and fit testing programs, cleaning and storage procedures, and 
medical monitoring programs.<P>
Questionnaires were administered during training programs for either 
hazardous waste, lead, or asbestos which were sponsored by the Carpenter 
Health and Safety Fund.  The aim is to gain insight into typical employer 
practices with respect to respirator use in construction, and the 
effectiveness of existing respirator training programs.<P>
This will be the first public reporting of these results.  It is expected 
that 900-1000 questionnaire responses will be available for analysis.  The 
quality of ongoing respiratory protection programs in the construction 
industry has not been well investigated.  A questionnaire evaluation is 
cost-effective tool to obtain preliminary data on this important issue for 
the health and safety community.

<H2>106. Hazardous Waste Sites, Significant Other Health and Safety Hazards 
Besides Chemicals.</H2> 
<B>N. Davis</B>, Carpenters Health & Safety Fund, Washington, D.C.<P>
The principal thesis of the presentation is that hazardous waste 
construction projects are essentially a subset of civil engineering 
projects.  Research findings, mostly unpublished, will be reviewed of 
projects sponsored by the Carpenters Health and Safety Fund.<P>
Recent research of heat stress associated with wearing protective suits will 
be reviewed.  A preliminary study of a NIOSH cross-sectional study of 
carpenter's hearing loss and a carpenter task-based noise study will also be 
presented.  A summary of ergonomic findings from field studies and review of 
workers' compensation data on carpenters and other trades will also be 
presented.<P>
A brief review of the common construction safety concerns and their relative 
severity will so be presented.<P>
The special characteristics of hazardous waste projects, including the 
preparation of written health and safety plans, the formal involvement of 
the industrial hygiene profession, and the high degree of regulation will be 
evaluated.  These unique characteristics of hazardous waste construction can 
be used to minimize the potential risk of construction workers.

<H2>107. Sandblasting:  Can We Actually Prevent Silicosis?</H2>
<B>N. Goyer</B>, IRSST, Montreal, Quebec, Canada<P>
Several new cases of silicosis are diagnosed every year in sandblasting 
workers.  This situation is particularly alarming due to the rapidity and 
the seriousness of the injury, the short duration of the exposure, and 
particularly from the standpoint of industrial hygiene, the apparent 
availability of the means of prevention which should provide proper 
protection of workers.<P>
A study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of means of prevention 
at three levels of intervention, namely the elimination or modification of 
emission sources, the control of these sources, and exposure control.  Dust 
concentrations were measured upstream and downstream from the means of 
prevention for sandblasters and other workers.  Carbon monoxide and pressure 
were also measured inside the supplied air hood used by the sandblasters.<P>
The field measurements and observations lead us to worrisome observations: 
silica concentrations inside supplied air hood are often above threshold 
limit values; the other workers are often the ones most exposed; substitute 
products for silica are not commonly used; the work is often carried out 
indoors in the open air exposing other workers; the sand-blasting rooms are 
not ventilated; respiratory protection is used only during the sandblasting 
operation and not during related work; the respiratory protection is 
inefficient in most cases due to improper use, nonexistent maintenance or 
improper operation (negative pressure measured in the supplied air hood); 
the work methods and habits do not promote worker protection and the workers 
are poorly informed about the hazardous situation in which they work.<P>
For all these reasons, we must ask ourselves whether we can actually prevent 
silicosis, and where must our efforts be put in order to achieve it?

<H2>108. Dermal Exposure to Wood Preservative Fluids.</H2>
<B>M. Roff</B>, Health and Safety Laboratory, Sheffield, United Kingdom<P>
Outdoor wood preservative fluids contain fungicides and pesticides.  
Traditionally spirit based, they are painted onto dry wood using a wide 
coarse brush.  New low-odor products are now available which are oil-in-water 
emulsions (referred to here as water-based). Approval for sale is based on a 
risk assessment that includes calculations of expected operator dermal 
exposure.  Few data are available to validate the risk assessment, although 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency has calculated that up to 
6 ml of fluid may be retained on the hand following total immersion in the 
fluid and subsequent draining.<P>
Twelve subjects painted a lattice fence twice each, using colorless spirit 
and water-based woodworm fluid to which a fluorescent dye was added.  Three 
trellis panels were painted on both sides for 5 min each in a half-hour test 
and repeated twice for the one-hour test.  This cancelled out the effect of 
wind direction but not of wind speed.  Subjects were filmed during the tests 
to record behavior, and afterwards under ultraviolet light to reveal the 
extent of contamination of the dye. Video photographs were taken using the 
health and safety laboratory's fluorescence monitor for analysis of dermal 
exposure.  Handwashing residues were collected and analyzed for permethrin. 
Urine samples were collected to monitor bodily uptake.<P>
Analysis of variance of the log-data showed that:<BR>
1) the subjects used the same quantities of water and spirit-based 
formulations; 2) they painted only 1.6 times more fluid in one hour than 
half-hour; 3) dermal contamination was 4.5 times higher for spirit-based 
fluid; 4) dermal contamination in one hour was not significantly great than 
in half hour (factor 1.4); 5) wind speed had no significant effect on the 
dermal contamination; 6) light clothing (jeans, shirt and permeable 
gardening gloves) gave a protection factor of ten over minimal clothing 
(shorts and t-shirt); 7) the subjects themselves were the greatest source of 
variation_a factor of 35 was found between the cleanest and the dirtiest 
subjects after allowing for clothing and formulation; 8) maximum dermal 
exposure was 5 ml of spirit containing 8 mg of permethrin in half hour; 9) 
there was little or no bodily uptake.

<H2>109. Asbestos Operation and Maintenance Experiments at Sandia National 
Laboratories.</H2> 
<B>D. Lessley</B>, Smith Environmental Technologies, Albuquerque, NM; G. 
Lipka, B. Britain,  Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM<P>
In order to quantify potential exposures to asbestos during maintenance 
tasks, experiments have been conducted at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) 
in Albuquerque, N.M.  These experiments were designed to simulate operations 
and maintenance (O&M) tasks.  The experiments were designed to test whether 
methods and work practices could be developed for O&M tasks involving 
asbestos-containing materials without creating an asbestos exposure.  These 
tests were conducted by an asbestos abatement contractor in a vacant 
building.  The target exposure limit was the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) clearance level of 70 structures per square millimeter (s/mm&#178;) 
using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).  In addition to TEM samples 
taken during the tests, personal samples were collected and analyzed using 
Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM).<P>
The tasks selected were removal of floor tile, core drilling floor tile, 
drilling into sheetrock containing positive spackling, and cutting sheetrock 
containing positive spackling.  Three trials of each method were planned.  
If early trials were clearly unsuccessful, the follow-up trials were not 
conducted.  In one case, only two trials were conducted due to time 
constraints.  While the OSHA samples remained below the Permissible Exposure 
Limit (PEL) and the Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL), the TEM results were 
often above the target of 70 s/mm&#178;.<P>
The experimental results support work practices for core drilling, laying 
floor track, and setting "tap and screw" anchors.  Work practices for 
removal of floor tile using infrared, heat guns and foam were determined to 
be unsuccessful or impractical.  Removal of wall track and drilling into 
ACM drywall to set anchors were also unsuccessful under the criteria used 
for evaluation. Results of cutting ACM drywall seem to be inconclusive due 
in part to having only two trials and in part due to the potential for poor 
results without close supervision.

<H2>110. Managing Insulation Wools (MMMF) in the Workplace.</H2>
<B>B. Denault</B>, B. Kojola, B. Spring, S. Trudel, FTQ Model Code 
Committee, North Vancouver, B.C., Canada<P>
An international union seminar was held in Canada attended by construction 
industry worker representatives from six countries.  The representatives met 
to discuss their concerns about man made mineral fibers (MMMF) in the 
construction workplace.<P>
Their concerns were augmented by the increasing use of MMMF worldwide, 
construction workers' illnesses, inconsistencies of interpretation of 
emerging scientific data and a general lack of specific legislation, 
regulations or practical guidelines for working with these products.<P>
The F.T.Q. organized an international advisory committee to develop a Model 
Code of Practice for the Safe Use of Insulation Woods.<P>
The Model Code of Practice is developed and includes recommended work 
practices specifically designed for occupational exposure to glass wool, 
rock wool, slag wool and refractory ceramic fibers.

<BODY>

<H2>58. The Effectiveness of Lifting Belts in Controlling Trunk Muscle 
Electromyographic Activity During Sudden Unexpected Loading.</H2> 
<B>S. Lavender</B>, Rush-Presbyterian-St.Lukes' Medical Center, Chicago, IL; 
G. Anderson, D. Corcos, J. Thomas, University of Illinois at Chicago, 
Chicago, IL<P>
Epidemiological studies have indicated the back injuries are often preceded 
by some type of unanticipated event that places large mechanical loads on 
the spine.  This even may be a loss of footing that requires a rapid 
movement of the torso to maintain body stability (skips or stumbles), or a 
shifting load during a material handling task.  In either case, the rapid 
corrective action creates large muscles forces within the torso.  Lifting 
belts have previously been shown to limit the torso's lateral bending and 
twisting motions.  It was hypothesized that the lifting belt, in stiffening 
the torso, would reduce the compensatory muscle forces developed during an 
unanticipated loading event.  Twenty subjects, 10 male and 10 female, 
participated in a study which they experienced sagittally symmetric and 
asymmetric suddenly applied bending movements, with and without a blindfold 
(expectancy condition), and with a lifting belt that was either tensioned or 
extremely loose.  Each of the eight combinations of the experimental 
conditions was repeated three times for a total of 24 suddenly applied 
loads.  Electromyographic (EMG) data were obtained bilaterally from the 
Erector Spinac, Longissimus Thoracis, External Oblique, and the Rectus 
Abdominous.  Subjects stood in an apparatus that restrained the pelvis and 
allowed the loads to be applied directly to the torso via a chest harness.  
The bending movements were applied by allowing a weight, connected by a 
cable running through pulleys, to fall one meter before tensioning the cable 
and loading the torso.  The magnitude of the static moment was set to 5 
percent of each subject's maximum trunk extension moment.  Statistical 
analyses of the peak muscle responses indicated that the bilateral Erector 
Spinae response was relatively unaffected by the lifting belt during the 
sagittally symmetric applied moments. However, the lifting belt did reduce 
the Erector Spinae EMG activity during the blindfolded asymmetric loading 
conditions to a level approximately equivalent to that observed during the 
non-blindfolded asymmetric loading conditions.  Further, the EMG activities 
in both Longissimus Thoracis muscles, and the right Rectus Abdominous and 
External Oblique muscles were reduced by an average of 8 percent when the 
lifting belt was tensioned.  In conclusion, the results suggest that 
individuals working in environments where slipping is likely, or where 
materials frequently shift when handled, may derive some benefit from the 
lifting belt, although, additional research is needed for individuals in 
unconstrained postures.

<H2>59. The Lumbar Tissue Injury Prediction Model:  A Framework for 
Investigating Spinal Injury Risk.</H2>
<B>M. Nussbaum</B>, D. Chaffin, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI<P>
The high rates of low back pain and their associated compensation costs, 
motivate the desire for an understanding and prediction of factors related 
to injury risk.  In attempting to relate aspects of a physical exertion to 
the risk of low back injury, two approaches are available.  In the first, 
gross observable measures of exertions and worker motions when performing 
jobs are empirically reacted to medical or pain incidence rates, severity, 
etc.  Alternatively, one can proceed from the "inside-out," using 
experimental results concerning tissue stress and population tolerance.  The 
challenge then is threefold: 1) determine crucial tissues and quantify their 
stress levels; 2) apply appropriate normalizations to quantified stress 
levels; 3) model the physical system so as to obtain these "internal" 
measures from "external" observations of job requirements.<P>
The present study is concerned with the development of a framework and 
methodology for addressing these three needs.  Key components of the risk 
model include both traditional (e.g., spinal compression) and more novel 
(muscle dynamic contraction) indices of injury.  The experimental literature 
provides some but not all suitable tolerances or normalization factors. 
Contemporary biomechanical models provide a means for obtaining estimates of 
the key elements within the risk model.  The injury risk model is composite 
of ongoing research and theories regarding the complex and multi-factored 
mechanisms of injury onset.  By incorporating several different tissues and 
injury models, the approach should lead to improved methods of assessing 
risk level and interpreting often confusing epidemiological results.  It is 
compared to some existing injury outcome studies.  Further, the absence of 
certain key quantitative values in the injury model help motivate and guide 
future experimental efforts.

<H2>60. Modeling of Physical Load in Dynamic Work Environments.</H2> 
<B>A. Burdorf</B>, M. Van Riel, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, the 
Netherlands<P>
Physical load on the body is considered to be a causative importance to 
various musculoskeletal disorders.  In highly dynamic work environments 
characterization of physical load presents many challenges. This study was 
carried out to investigate whether a combination of different measurement 
techniques addressing different dimensions of physical load could improve 
the assessment of physical load on several body regions.<P>
In a tank terminal company 160 workers were assigned to three occupational 
title groups: office work (n=61); operators (n=84); and miscellaneous (n=16). 
For each worker, the overall postural load was determined by the 
OWAS-observation method by taking observations every 20 s during two periods 
of 30 min on a workday.  Apart from posture of the back, arms and legs also 
the task executed was recorded.  On the same day workers kept a diary, 
filling out every two hours the amount of time spent performing specific 
tasks.  Health interviews were conducted to ascertain the 12-month 
prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints with onset in the current job.<P>
The health survey demonstrated significant differences between operators and 
office workers for complaints on shoulder (20% vs. 5%), elbow (19% vs. 2%), 
and wrist (14% vs. 3%).  Age adjusted logistic regression analysis showed 
odds ratios for these complaints of 2.26, 3.65, and 2.26, respectively. The 
observations illustrated that operators had a higher load on their shoulders 
(4% worktime with raised arms) and applied more often substantial  force (6% 
worktime with force over 100 N).  The workplace survey also showed a large 
variation in physical load between and within workers.  The physical load 
over the workday was also modelled by allocating the group's average 
physical load per task to the proportional distribution of task durations 
for each worker as derived from their diaries.  The model estimates smoothed 
variability in physical load at individual level.  When using the modeled 
exposure estimates in logistic regression analyses several significant 
associations were found that were not detected when applying the observation 
results directly.  For example, percentage of worktime with force over 100 N 
showed odds ratios for shoulder pain of 1.09 and 1.04, for elbow pain of 
1.31 and 0.99, and for wrist pain of 1.48 and 1.03, respectively for modeled 
estimates and direct observations.<P>
In conclusion, the assessment of physical load improved by combining 
information at individual level on tasks executed  and at group level 
physical load per task.  This strategy may be useful in large 
epidemiological surveys on the effects of physical load in dynamic work 
environments.

<H2>61. Do Wrist Splints Reduce Exposure to Risk Factors Associated with 
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?</H2> 
<B>G. Perez</B>, OSHA, Somerville, MA; B. Buchholz, University of 
Massachusetts at Lowell, Lowell, MA<P>
Awkward postures of the upper extremities, prehensile force, and repetitive 
hand motions have been identified as risk factors for carpal tunnel syndrome 
(CTS).  Wrist splints have recently gained popularity as a control for these 
risk factors because the wrist is thought to be held in a fixed position and 
allowed a period of rest.  The goal of this study was to determine the 
effectiveness of the use of a rigid wrist splint as abatement for CTS risk 
factors in the work environment.  Peak grip strength was tested under two 
conditions: with a bare wrist and with a splinted wrist.  In addition, 
surface electromyography (EMG), wrist posture and shoulder abduction, were 
evaluated for 20 subjects (10 female) during a metronome-paced, repetitive 
pick and place task under the same two conditions.<P>
To begin with, grip strength (PGS), measured with a Jamar dynamometer, 
decreased an average of 28.9% (+/-10.5) for females and 8.0% (+/-24.1) for 
males, with the use of the splint.  Thus, women in this study experienced a 
3.5-fold greater percent decrease in PGS as compared with men.  In fact, 
five males improved their grip strength with the use of the splint.  
Regression analysis showed that gender differences, with respect to percent 
change in PGS, was partially due to differences in hand anthropometry.  The 
longer the hand, the less detrimental the splint was to grip strength 
(p&lt;0.01). This may be due to decreases in functional hand length that 
result from the metal bar of the splint.  Secondly, the splint significantly 
limited wrist motion, but did not eliminate non-neutral wrist postures 
during the pick and place task.  Shoulder abduction was significantly 
increased as a result of using the splint.  Thirdly, EMG (rms) was used to 
evaluate relative muscle activity during the pick and place task where 
percent change in EMG was determined by [(splinted EMG-Bare 
EMG)/Bare EMG]*100.  Extrinsic flexor (EF) and anterior deltoid (AD) muscle 
activity increased significantly by 37.4% (+/-21.8) and 12.5% (+/-18.5), 
respectively, with the use of the splint (p&gt;0.01).<P>
In conclusion, subjects with shorter hands had the greatest decreases in 
grip strength.  The attenuation of grip strength increases a person's force 
requirements.  The wrist splint did not eliminate motion of the wrist and 
resulted in increased shoulder abduction.  Muscle activity was also 
significantly increased while working with a splinted wrist, which may be 
indicative of increased exertion.  These results suggests that the rigid 
wrist splint does not effectively abate risk factors for CTS  during a pick 
and place task.

<H2>62. A Cross-Sectional Study of the Relationship Between Carpal Tunnel 
Syndrome (CTS) and Hand Repetition Among Industrial Workers.</H2> 
<B>A. Franzblau</B>, W. Latko, S. Ulin, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 
MI; T. Armstrong, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, 
MI<P>
Upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders represents a large, and growing, 
problem among industrial workers.  A goal of the present investigation is to 
model relationships between indices of job exposure (e.g., quantitative 
rating of repetitiveness) and indices of medical outcomes with the goal of 
developing quantitative, exposure-response relationships.  Jobs were 
selected on the basis of the frequency of repetitive hand movements ("Low," 
"Medium," and "High," defined in Latko, et al, "An Observational Method for 
Assessing Exposure to Physical Stressors in Epidemiological Studies: 
Description and Reliability Analysis" to be presented at this conference), 
and all workers with at least 6 months tenure in such jobs were invited to 
participate.  Each company selected to be studied had to have at least 20 
eligible workers in each category, so that repetition was stratified within 
each plant studied.  Details of procedures used to quantitatively evaluate 
ergonomic aspects of jobs are described in the report of Latko et al.  The 
medical examination protocol included a self-administered questionnaire, 
limited physical examination of the upper extremities, limited 
electrodiagnostic assessment at both wrists, and various anthropometric 
measurements.  Subjects were instructed to report a symptom if it had been 
present on at least 3 separate episodes, or one episode had lasted more than 
one week, in the 12 months preceding the survey.  The criterion for focal 
median nerve impairment at the wrist was a difference of at least 0.5 
milliseconds between median and ulnar sensory peak latencies in the same 
wrist.  CTS was defined as focal median nerve impairment and self-report of 
symptoms consistent with CTS in the ipsilateral wrist, hand, or fingers 
(i.e., numbness, tingling, burning, or pain).   A total of 440 subjects (53% 
male) were studied.  Because of nerve damage known to occur among diabetics, 
subjects with diabetes were excluded from analysis (n=13).  An additional 
13 subjects were excluded because they were found to be in jobs that were 
not eligible for the study. There remained 37 of 413 subjects (9.0%) who met 
the case definition of CTS in the dominant extremity. These were distributed 
among the repetition categories as follows: "Low"--n=5 of 129; "Medium"--n=6 
of 110; "High"--n=26 of 174 (overall x&#178; = 13.38, 2df, p=0.001; x&#178; 
for linear trend = 11.84, 1df, p&gt;0.001). Based on a multivariate logistic 
model adjusted for age, gender, and body mass index, the odds ratio for risk 
of CTS of subjects with repetition ratings equal to the mean in the "High" 
repetition category compared to subjects with repetition ratings equal to 
the mean in the "Low" category was 4.5 (95% Cl: 1.7-11.7). These results 
suggest that highly repetitive hand tasks, as defined in this study, are a 
significant risk factor for CTS among industrial workers.

<H2>63. Preventing Decreases of Alertness and Sleep Deprivations Related to 
Hours of Work.</H2> 
<B>A. Coblentz</B>, S. Bougrine, R. Mollard, Laboratoire D'Anthropologie 
Appliquee, Paris, France<P>
Shift systems involving morning and/or night work result in the disruption 
of shift workers' circadian rhythms in large number of and 
psychophysiological variables.  The degree to which these rhythms are 
adjusted depends on the biological clock inertia, the speed and the 
direction of the rotating shift and on the individual differences.<P>
Shift work adaption is possible with the appropriate use of bright light.  
Indeed, since the establishment of the bright light efficiency on human 
biological clock, subsequent laboratory and field studies suggest that three 
hours of bright light during three cycles induce an improvement of mental 
nocturnal performance and diurnal sleep quality and quantity.  In addition, 
social and physical (sunlight, noise, etc.) environment during the day off 
does not prevent the positive effect of bright light on night work 
adjustment.  The use of bright light in field situation with operators 
working in a fixed shift on laying barge suggest that the bright light is 
the optimal solution to increase safety, sleep efficiency and well-being.  
Moreover, results suggest that the phase of urinary melatonin production 
could be used to predict the tolerance to shift work.  Indeed, subjects, who 
have an early peak of urinary melatonin production, show no adjustment to 
night work which is characterized by a reduction of amplitude of urinary 
melatonin cycle, high night work sleepiness, sleep and performance 
disturbances.<P>
There is no one solution to shift work problems.  The choice between the 
different shift systems depend on the relative importance attached to 
health, social, and safety problems.  But, bright light use in permanent 
nightwork systems can be recommended especially in the "public risk" 
situations as transportations and in the "high hazard" workplace as nuclear 
power plants.

<H2>180. OSHA's Draft Standard for Prevention of Musculoskeletal Injuries: 
The Construction Revision.</H2>
<B>S. Schneider</B>, Center to Protect Workers' Rights, Washington, D.C.<P>
In March 1995, OSHA released a draft standard for the prevention of 
musculoskeletal injuries. Yet despite the enormous effort which went into 
drafting the proposal, little attention had been given to how this proposal 
would work in industries like construction, where workers are constantly 
changing jobs and work sites.  The OSHA Advisory Committee on Construction 
Safety and Health convened a workgroup to study the proposal and advise OSHA 
on how to adapt the draft to the construction industry.  This draft was 
presented to the Advisory Committee in August 1995.  In short, the revised 
draft focused on identification and reduction of risk factors by task rather 
than by job.  Other major changes include: Deletion of an incidence trigger, 
changes made to the checklist, deletion of quick fix provisions, addition of 
control measures for manufacturers. This presentation will summarize the 
major changes made by the workgroup, discuss the rationale for these 
changes, and recommend further items that need revision.

<H2>181. Occupational Exposures of Construction Workers: An Analysis of the 
DOL/ETA Database on Job Demands Part 1-Ergonomic Variables.</H2>
<B>S. Schneider</B>, M. Griffith,  Center to Protect Workers' Rights, 
Washington, D.C.<P>
Very little research has been done quantifying occupational exposures of 
construction workers. Little monitoring of chemical exposures or noise has 
been done and quantification of ergonomic exposures has just begun in the 
past few years.  There exists, however, other sources of information where 
some of these variables have been quantified for other purposes and the data 
may have a use for the purposes of industrial hygienists and ergonomists.  
The U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration 
(DOL/ETA) has for many years been collecting quantitative data based on 
field observations of the job demands of over 13,000 different occupations. 
The purpose of this database is primarily to help job applicants and injured 
workers be placed in the most appropriate jobs, in particular, those that 
they are physically capable of performing.  Ten of the 33 variables which 
DOL/ETA coded for are ones which seem to relate to ergonomics.  For example, 
strength required by the job was assessed on a 5-point scale from sedentary 
to very heavy.  Construction jobs were identified by reference to 
classification by DOL/ETA and a contractor association manual.  Data was 
sorted to compare construction job requirements with non-construction jobs. 
These data show construction jobs to be significantly more ergonomically 
challenging than non-construction jobs.  Limitations of the data set will 
also be discussed.

<H2>182. Reducing Ergonomic Hazards During Highway Tunnel Finishing 
Construction Operations.</H2>
<B>V. Paquet, B. Bucholz, University of Massachusetts at Lowell, Lowell, MA<P>
The ergonomic hazards and interventions designed to reduce hazards of 
highway construction have been discussed very little in the literature. The 
objectives of this study were to summarize the ergonomic hazards of several 
highway tunnel finishing operations and describe interventions that were 
used to reduce the hazards.  The study took place during the finishing stage 
of a 2.5 mile highway tunnel construction project.  Several researchers 
visited the site weekly over a three-month period.  The finishing stage was 
divided into operations, trades involved in each operation, and job tasks 
performed by each trade during each operation.  Descriptions of finishing 
operations were obtained from contractor documentation.  Information about 
trades and job tasks were obtained primarily by worker interviews and direct 
observation.  Ergonomic hazards were identified and/or quantified with a 
variety of approaches including a work-sampling observational technique, 
systematic analysis of job tasks, use of a hazard identification checklists 
and worker interviews.  During the evaluation, interventions to reduce 
ergonomic hazards were developed by the contractor or workers, sometimes 
with suggestions provided by the researchers.  The most common ergonomic 
hazards were heavy manual material handling (MMH) activities, frequent 
non-neutral trunk postures, and static loading of the shoulders during 
over-head work.  Interventions for the wall tiling operation included: the 
use of pulleys and dollies to aid MMH activities, buckets raised to waist 
height to reduce non-neutral trunk postures and push forces during MMH 
activities, basic MMH training, and wood support beams used to reduce static 
loading of the shoulders during overhead work.  Data obtained from worker 
interviews and direct observation suggest that some of the ergonomic hazards 
had been reduced.  In the future, more formal pre- and post-intervention 
evaluation of ergonomic hazards are planned to more accurately assess their 
effect on reducing ergonomic hazards.

<H2>183. Ergonomic Hazards During Concrete Reinforcement Work at a Large 
Highway Construction Site.</H2>
<B>B. Buchholz</B>, V. Paquet, H. Wellman, University of Massachusetts at 
Lowell, Lowell, MA<P>
Concrete reinforcement (rebar) workers or rodmen are often required to 
perform their job while in awkward trunk postures and many of their 
activities involve heavy manual material handling. Subsequently, they have 
high rates of low back problems. Despite the increased risk that these 
workers have to low back injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders, the 
ergonomic hazards they experience have been less clearly established.  The 
objective of this study then was to characterize the ergonomic risk factors 
in concrete reinforcement work on a large heavy highway construction 
project.  PATH (Posture, Activities, Tools, Handling), a work sampling-based 
method, was used to quantify the percentage of time workers spend in various 
postures (trunk, arms, legs, head/neck), perform activities (e.g., manual 
material handling and hand postures/activities), use tools and handle loads. 
Workers were sampled randomly at fixed 45-second intervals.  Posture codes 
are based on the Ovako Working Posture Analyzing System (OWAS) and the 
analysis is customized for each construction trade and  operation.  A total 
of 1973 observations were made of 19 concrete reinforcement workers 
performing 5 major job tasks: 1) horizontal rebar work; 2) vertical rebar 
work; 3) ventilation rebar work; 4) preparation work; and 5) supervising. 
Non-neutral trunk postures were observed frequently (&gt;30%) for all job 
tasks except supervising, and were most frequent during ventilation rebar 
work (57.6%). Arm postures at or above the shoulders were most frequent 
(9.7%) during vertical rebar work and kneeling postures were most common 
(4.2%) during horizontal rebar work.  Loads greater than 22.7 kg (50 lb) 
were most often handled during horizontal rebar work (4.2%). MMH activities 
were the most common activities for all job tasks (&gt;20%), except 
supervising. Tying rebar was the second most frequent activity during 
ventilation rebar work (20.9%) and vertical rebar work (13.4%). Walking was 
the second most frequent activity during preparation work (19.4%) and 
horizontal rebar work (11.6%). This study demonstrates a task-based method 
for systematically evaluating the ergonomic hazards during concrete 
reinforcement work.  The results can be used to target specific job tasks 
or activities which require ergonomic intervention.

<H2>184. A Comparison of Hand-Arm Vibration Measurements for Selected 
Jackhammers and Vibration Isolation Materials.</H2>
<B>D. Heacock</B>, Liberty Mutual Group, Pleasanton, CA; G. Hampel, E. 
Stevenson, Liberty Mutual Research Center for Safety, Hopkinton, MA<P>
Hand-arm vibration using hand-held vibratory tools has been known to give 
rise to hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) and has been associated as a risk 
factor for other cumulative trauma diseases. A review of worker compensation 
claims over  a five-year period for one national contractor revealed a 
significant number of claims and dollar losses related to jackhammer use.  A 
field study was conducted during actual use of seven different jackhammers, 
two of which were designed as low vibration tools.  In addition, four 
vibration isolation materials and three gloves were evaluated to compare 
hand-arm vibration levels.  The study was undertaken to: 1) determine if 
vibration levels exceeded the currently recommended TLV values for hand-arm 
vibration; 2) compare relative vibration levels of different tools; 3) 
determine the effect of vibration isolation materials.  Measurements were 
made using a Br&#252;el & Kjaer Type 2513 Integrating Vibration Meter with 
B&K Type 4392 Hand-Arm Transducer and three B&K Type 4374 miniature 
accelerometers.  Measurements were made in three mutually orthogonal 
directions forming the basic enteric coordinate system at the interface 
between the hand and jackhammer handle, in accordance with the procedures 
and instrumentation specified by ISO 5349-1986 and ANSI S3.34-1986. 
Measurements indicated the vibration levels exceeded the current maximum 
ACGIH TLV of 12m/s&#178; for less than one hour for all jackhammers 
evaluated.  Vibration levels for all jackhammers were similar and vibration 
isolation materials had little effect on reducing vibration levels.

<H2>185. Carpenters' Assessment of Hammers and Screwdrivers.</H2>
<B>P. Coleman, Carpenters Health & Safety Fund, Washington, D.C.<P>
Ergonomically designed hand tools, kitchen implements, gloves, even 
dashboards are now being marketed.  How well these items suit their users 
and how much input user have had into the design is unclear.  The Carpenters 
Health & Safety Fund developed an interactive education exhibit to serve 
three major purposes:<P>
1) to gather information from carpenters concerning the comfort and 
efficiency of hammers and screwdrivers; 2) to raise awareness among 
carpenters about the tool features which may reduce their risk of cumulative 
trauma disorders; and 3) to promote acceptance of the need for change within 
the construction industry and to encourage tool manufacturers to recognize 
the importance of listening to the people who use the tools.<P>
The exhibit consisted of a selection of hammers, screwdrivers, wood, screws, 
nails and ballots. Carpenters tested each screwdriver/hammer and voted for 
the tool of their choice.  Each voter explained the reasoning behind his/her 
choice. Level of interest and participation was greater than the Fund had 
anticipated.  Carpenters have a wealth of knowledge to bring to the process 
of tool design and development of alternative work methods.  The exhibit 
demonstrated the circularity of learning, teaching, and application of 
knowledge, and the importance of listening to tool users, not just tool 
engineers.  Most important, from the Health & Safety Fund's point of view, 
is that the interactive exhibit fostered a sense of the necessity for and 
possibility of change to reduce musculoskeletal disorders among carpenters.

<H2>166. Evaluation of the OSHA Proposed Ergonomics Checklist to Identify 
High Risk Jobs in an Ergonomics Program.</H2>
<B>B. Joseph</B>, A. Griffith, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, MI<P>
Successful ergonomics programs are an integral part of a total health and 
safety operating system in an industrial facility.  A successful ergonomics 
program must have the following components: management commitment, employee 
involvement, and hazard analysis.  Successful hazard analysis includes 
methods to identify high risk jobs, evaluate stresses on those jobs and 
develop and implement solutions.<P>
Identification of high risk jobs  is often an overlooked part of the 
process.  It steers the program and drives commitment and resources.  There 
are many tools currently available that claim to identify high risk jobs, 
including the OSHA Ergonomics Musculoskeletal disorders Risk Factors 
Checklist (released early in 1995). In order for these tools to be effective 
in surveillance, they must be quick, easy to use, and accurate.  The purpose 
of this study is to determine the ability of a well-established in-plant 
ergonomics committee to evaluate jobs and predict risk using several methods 
of evaluation including the OSHA checklist.<P>
Sixty jobs were randomly selected from each area of an automotive assembly 
plant.  The jobs were documented via videotape and basic information was 
recorded (e.g., load weight, distance moved and cycle time). Injury data and 
employee symptoms were collected during the videotaping.  The plant 
ergonomics committee (blinded to the medical and surveillance data) was 
divided into groups and trained on one surveillance method.  They were then 
shown the videotape of the job and the basic job information and asked to 
rate the risk on the job using their assigned method.  This procedure was 
repeated until all 60 jobs were completed.<P>
After all jobs were analyzed, comparisons were made between methods to 
determine the agreement in predicting risk. In addition, sensitivity, 
specificity, and predictive values were calculated to determine which method 
was the best at identifying risk.<P>
Preliminary analysis of the data indicate that there is poor agreement 
between methods and no one method stood out in predicting risk with a high 
level of accuracy.  The study will be expanded to include additional 
manufacturing jobs to see if these trends continue.

<H2>167. An Observational Method for Assessing Exposure to Physical 
Stressors in Epidemiological Studies:  Description and Reliability Analysis.</H2>
<B>W. Latko</B>, T. Armstrong, J. Foulke, A. Franzblau, University of 
Michigan, Dept of EIH, Ann Arbor, MI<P>
Several physical stressors (e.g., repetition, force, posture, stresses, and 
contact stresses) have been linked to increased risk of work-related 
musculoskeletal disorders.  The quantitative exposure-response relationship 
between these stressors and disorders is not clear, partly because of the 
difficulty in assessing exposure in quantitative terms.  The goal of this 
work was to evaluate a recently-developed observational method which 
facilitates rating the magnitude of exposure on a series of 10-point scales. 
The method is currently being used in a cross-sectional epidemiological 
study.<P>
The method consists of a series of decision rules and benchmark examples 
which correspond to the various physical stressors and body segments.  The 
stressors evaluated include repetitive exertions, force, contact, stresses, 
postures, movement speed, recovery time, vibration, and low temperatures.  
One or more researchers videotape and document jobs of interest, then later 
present the information and videotape to a team of experienced analysts who 
independently rate the exposure, based on the rules and examples.  The group 
then discusses the ratings and comes to a consensus agreement (a difference 
of no more than 1 point on the 10-point scale). Forty-six jobs have 
currently been rated by the researchers for inclusion in the epidemiological 
study.<P>
The same group of 46 jobs was rated by an outside group for purposes of 
intergroup reliability analysis. The outside group then re-rated a subset of 
these jobs (n=12) 8 weeks after the first rating.  The repetition ratings 
exhibited a strong agreement between the two groups (r&#178;=0.88). In 
general, the individual raters gave similar ratings in their independent 
analyses (before the consensus discussion), with a mean range of 1.4 
(&#177;1.4) points within the group.  Ratings between the two rating 
sessions also exhibited strong correlation; (r&#178;=0.90 for all stressors 
pooled).  The newly-trained group was able to learn and apply the method in 
a reasonable amount of time.  The training session consisted of 6 hours; 
rating time averaged less than 30 minutes to perform both the individual 
ratings and consensus discussion.  In addition to being used for 
epidemiological purposes, this method can potentially be used by industrial 
hygienists and other safety professionals to evaluate exposure to ergonomic 
stresses in the workplace; similar to the way in which chemical exposures 
are currently evaluated.

<H2>168. Ergonomic Job Analysis Using Participative Teams: A Comparison of 
Three Approaches.</H2>
<B>W. Keyserling</B>, S. Hankins, Center for Ergonomics, Ann Arbor, MI<P>
Plant-based, participative teams have been established in many organizations 
to facilitate the implementation of ergonomic programs intended to reduce 
the incidence and severity of work-related overexertion injuries and 
disorders such as low back pain, tendinitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. 
These teams frequently perform job analysis activities to: 1) identify work 
activities and exposures that place workers at risk; and 2) to develop and 
implement interventions to control these exposures.<P>
Three approaches to job analysis were compared in a series of plant-based 
studies.  The first approach used a "closed-form" checklist in which trained 
members of a plant-based team were required to answer an extensive list of 
questions.  Each question was designed to identify the presence and in some 
cases the magnitude of a specific ergonomic risk factor. The second approach 
used an "open-ended" technique in which user documented work methods and 
then relied on their knowledge of ergonomics (typically obtained in a "short 
course" of one week or less) to identify and evaluate ergonomic risk 
factors.  The third approach was based on a hybrid procedure in which users 
first documented work methods.  They were then required to identify the 
presence and magnitude of exposure to ergonomic risk factors at key body 
locations by comparing observed stresses to pre-established benchmarks.<P>
Results generated by the plant-based committees were compared to results 
generated by an expert ergonomist.  When using the open-ended method, plant 
personnel tended to overlook certain potentially hazardous exposures that 
were identified by the expert.  The structural features built into the 
closed-form and hybrid methods of job analysis resulted in more thorough 
coverage and identification of ergonomic risk factors.

<H2>169. Initial Assessment Method for Work Demands of Short Cycle Tasks.</H2>
<B>T. Bernard</B>, A. Callahan, P. McRright, University of Public Health, 
Tampa, FL<P>
Selecting existing jobs for closer examination of the physical demands 
placed on workers is a common problem.  To consider the potential impact of 
physical demands on the workers, we designed a simple data collection and 
analysis framework to document the results and prioritize change efforts.  
The framework hinged on three aspects of the work.  The first aspect was the 
requisite strength and biomechanical stress.  The limits were based on 
biomechanical models and data as well as strength (maximum force 
development) data that were reported in the literature. The second aspect 
was fatigue of small muscle groups.  While strength was important here, so 
were work time (endurance) and recovery allowances.  The relations reported 
by Rohmert were used to determine endurance time and work/recovery cycles.  
The third aspect was the cumulative trauma issue. In addition, the NIOSH 
Lifting Guidelines were incorporated into the analysis.  To examine the 
demands, we divided the body into four joints: lower back, shoulder, elbow, 
hand/wrist; and divided the work space into zones: horizontal, vertical, and 
lateral.  Limiting forces or loads for the hands/wrists were specified based 
on the posture of the hands and type of grip, and for the back, shoulder, 
and elbow based on the posture likely to occur on the grid.  A data sheet 
was designed to gather the data from the visual inspection of the job.  The 
data were then entered onto a spreadsheet for analysis and summary of 
results.  The analysis of a job yielded Concern Levels for each joint and 
aspect.  The Concern Level reflected the portion of a mixed population of 
workers who should be capable of the work, and they were expressed as a 
number from 1 to 5.  Concern Level 1 meant that up to 95% of the population 
were capable; 2 meant 75% capable; 3 meant 25%; 4 meant 5%; and 5 meant 
fewer than 5% were capable.  The Concern Levels provided a mechanism to 
prioritize changes.  Concern Levels 4 and 5 suggested immediate changes; 3 
suggested further study may be necessary; and 1 and 2 suggested lower 
demands.

<H2>170. Factors Affecting Rate of Closing Connectors.</H2>
<B>T. Bernard</B>, G. Deal, University of Public Health, Tampa, FL<P>
The repetitive closing of electrical and mechanical connectors by workers on 
automotive assembly lines have many of the risk factors associated with 
cumulative trauma disorders of the upper extremities.  To provide engineers 
with information for the design of jobs and connectors, a study was 
undertaken to understand how posture, grip, and mechanical characteristics 
of the connectors inter-relate. The first step was to characterize the 
actual work postures and grip as well as connector force profiles.  The 
results of this effort pointed to six  grips, four wrist positions and four 
elbow postures that accounted for most of the work positions. Virtually all 
force profiles were represented by a ramp-up of force with distance.  
Experiments were designed to simulate the various postures separately, 
important combinations of postures, and four combinations of forces and 
distances.  Subjects were recruited from the community and they were evenly 
divided between sex and over three age groups.  They worked for four 5-day, 
40-hour weeks.  Within one 4-hour segment, they were assigned one posture 
and connector profile, and asked to repeat the connection activity at the 
highest rate that they found acceptable and did not induce discomfort or 
sensations of pain, stiffness, or numbness.  There were nine data points for 
each experimental cell, and the resulting frequencies followed a lognormal 
distribution. No differences were found for replicates and there were no 
differences between repeated cells in the morning versus afternoon. The mean 
acceptable rate (MAR) for the 15 kg force was one-half that for the 8 kg 
force, independent of distance moved.  When the wrist is extended or under 
ulnar deviation, the MAR is 70% of the MAR for a neutral posture.  When the 
elbow is extended, if the hand is in a prone posture, the MAR is 70% of the 
MAR when the palm faces inward.

<H2>172. The Effects of Ergonomic Interventions for Standing Fatigue Among 
Semi-Conductor Manufacturing Workers.</H2>
<B>A. Amendola</B>, J. Congleton, C. Kerk, M. O'Brien, Texas A&M University, 
College Station, TX<P>
In many industries, workers are required to perform their responsibilities 
while standing during most of the shift.  As a result of the pain and 
discomfort associated with standing fatigue, workers may be susceptible to 
work-related injuries and illnesses.  To prevent or control this problem, 
ergonomic interventions such as anti-fatigue mats and comfort shoes may be 
used.  This research was conducted to investigate the effects of 
anti-fatigue mats and comfort shoes on various physiological and 
psychosocial indicators of standing fatigue in the semi-conductor 
manufacturing industry.  Specific physiological variables measured include: 
skin temperature of the foot, blood pooling (swelling) of the foot, blood 
pooling of the leg, shrinkage of the spinal column, curvatureof the spinal 
column, flexibility of the hamstring muscles, and heart rate.  Psycho-social 
measures include: subjective ratings of pain, job satisfaction, and overall 
perceptions of the workplace. Recommendations were made concerning the 
usefulness of anti-fatigue mats and comfort shoes as part of an ergonomic 
plan to improve the health and safety of workers exposed to the possibility 
of standing fatigue.

<H2>173. Ergonomic Assessment at a Shoe Manufacturing Facility.</H2>
<B>N. Burton</B>, L. MacDonald, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs) have been found in previous 
studies to occur in workers whose jobs require repetitive movements, 
forceful exertions, and awkward body postures.  Men's footwear is listed 
among the Bureau of Labor Statistics' industries with the highest rates of 
repeated trauma disorders. In response to a confidential employee request 
for assistance, NIOSH investigators conducted an ergonomic assessment at a 
facility which produces men's  welt (sewn) and cement (glued) shoes.  The 
assessment centered around the department where the heels were added and 
shaped, the soles were edged and matched, and the bottoms finished.<P>
A questionnaire was administered concerning personal demographics, work 
history, and musculoskeletal symptoms.  All workers in the department were 
videotaped.  Forty-eight individuals were videotaped for at least three work 
cycles and postural data was abstracted from the videotapes for each work 
cycle element.  Sixty-three workers out of 65 (97%) completed the 
questionnaire.  Forty-nine (78%) of the employees were male and 14 (22%) 
were female.  The average length of employment was 9.7 and 9.5 years for 
males and females, respectively.  Forty (62%) of the respondents classified 
the physical effort necessary to perform their job as hard or very hard.  
Fifty-five (85%) reported some body discomfort for the year prior to the 
site visit (82% upper extremity [UE] and 52% back).  The physician diagnosed 
musculoskeletal disorders (and number of cases) among these employees for 
the preceding year were: tendinitis (3); carpal tunnel syndrome (2); 
thoracic outlet syndrome (1); and back strain (1). The majority of jobs had 
risk factors for WRMDs, including short cycle times, piece work rates, 
awkward trunk and UE postures, and hand-arm vibration.  Forceful pinch grips 
were frequently used to grasp and manipulate the shoes.  Recommendations 
were provided to the company to help reduce risk factors for CTDs using 
engineering controls and process changes.

<H2>311. Effects of Collection Fluid Evaporation and Particle 
Re-aerosolization on the Collection Efficiency of Liquid Impingers.</H2>
<B>X. Lin</B>, J. Donnelly, C. Huang, V. Ulevicius, University of Cincinnati, 
Cincinnati, OH<P>
All-glass impingers (AGI-30 and AGI-4) are widely used for collecting 
airborne microorganisms in various working environments. However, the 
collection efficiencies of impingers are not well characterized. The purpose 
of this study was to investigate the effects of collection fluid evaporation 
and particle re-aerosolization. The physical collection efficiencies of the 
AGI-30 and AGI-4 were determined experimentally with an Aerosizer -- a 
dynamic aerosol size spectrometer -- by measuring the particle concentrations 
upstream and downstream of each impinger.  Monodisperse PSL test particles of 
aerodynamic sizes ranging from 0.3 &#181;m to 2.0 &#181;m were used for 
testing both impingers. It was observed that the subsonic impinger jet 
generated greater violence in the aqueous collection fluid, resulting in 
significant volume loss due to evaporation and re-aerosolization of collected 
particles with liquid fragmentation.  The study has shown that about 35% of 
the collection liquid was lost due to evaporation during 30 min of sampling 
at the recommended conditions (sampling flowrate = 12.5 Lpm, volume of 
collecting fluid=20 mL) for both impingers when deionized water was used. It 
was found that the impinger volume reduction resulted in the decrease of the 
collection efficiency at certain liquid volumes. This effect is primarily 
caused by particle bounce impingers at low levels of collection fluid and 
depends on the particle size and physical properties of the collection fluid. 
Re-aerosolization of microorganisms collected by the impingers was found to 
be another factor affecting the impinger's collection efficiency. Significant 
particle aerosolization was found while a phosphate buffer solution was used 
as the collection fluid.  Most droplets, escaped from the phosphate buffer, 
were in the range of 0.8 &#181;m to 2.0 &#181;m, and therefore, could carry 
previously collected microorganisms. The losses of collection efficiency due 
to re-aerosolization for both AGI-30 and AGI-4 were found to increase with 
the sampling time. It is concluded that for efficient collection of typical 
bacteria-sized microorganisms the selected volume of the collection fluid 
should be sufficiently high to have the impinger nozzle surrounded by the 
bubbling liquid during the entire sampling period.  When long sampling times 
are required (e.g., in occupational environments with low bioaerosol 
concentration levels), the loss of collection efficiency due to 
re-aerosolization should be taken into account.

<H2>312. Characteristics of Exposure to Fungal Spores in Indoor Air.</H2>
<B>T. Reponen</B>, S. Grinshpun, A. Reponen, V. Ulevicius, University of 
Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Exposure to airborne fungal spores in mold-problem buildings may cause 
respiratory symptoms. The health effects of fungal spores depend on their 
concentration, composition (genera or species), and aerodynamic particle 
size. All these three elements of exposure were studied in six day care 
centers and 12 dwellings in Finland.  Each mold problem building had a 
matched reference one.  The aerosol collection was performed with a six-stage 
Andersen impactor on malt-extract agar. It was found that the total 
concentrations of fungal spores as well as the individual concentrations of 
<I>Cladosporium</I> and <I>Aspergillus</I> were higher in moldy buildings 
than in reference ones.  Four other fungal genera (<I>Acremonium</I>, 
<I>Botryosporium</I>, <I>Oedocephalum</I>, and <I>Stachybotrys</I>) were 
detected only in moldy buildings. The aerodynamic size of most of the fungal 
spores was 2-3 &#181;m. The fungal spores in moldy buildings were somewhat 
larger in size than those in reference ones.  The findings of the field study 
motivated a laboratory study on aerodynamic size and hygroscopicity of fungal 
spores performed at the University of Cincinnati in the U.S. In the 
experimental setup, fungal spores of six different species were first 
released from an agar surface by air flow. The spore aerosol was humidified 
to 30, 60, 90 and ~100% relative humidity (RH). The particle size 
distribution was measured with an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer. The results 
were used to calculate the respiratory deposition of fungal spores by the new 
model of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The 
results show that the sizes of fungal spores do not change significantly when 
the RH increases from 30% to 90%. A more distinct increase was found at RH 
~100%. The highest increase was found with spores of <I>Cladosporuym 
cladosporioides</I>: its aerodynamic size increased from 1.8 to 2.3 &#181;m 
when the RH increased from 30% to ~100%. According to the respiratory 
deposition calculation this growth in size will result in a 1% increase of 
respiratory deposition of spores. It is concluded from the field study that 
exposure to fungal spores in moldy buildings differs, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively, from that in non-problem buildings. The laboratory study and 
calculations using the ICRP-model for six tested species show a small 
increase in respiratory deposition of spores due to hygroscopic growth in the 
human respiratory system.

<H2>313. The Masking Effect on Bioaerosol Colony Counting: A Computer 
Simulation Study.</H2>
<B>C. Chen</B>, J. Chang, T. Yu, College of Public Health, Taipei, Taiwan, 
ROC, C. Chang, Institute of Occupational Safety & Health, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC<P>
The prevalence of bioaerosol particles is considered to impose potential 
health hazards on people in a variety of environments, and has gained 
significant attention in past decades.  The studies on the error due to 
overcrowding of the colonies have concluded that the bias did not become 
significant until about 300 colonies/plate were present, but no study has 
taken the non-conformity of colony size into account.  In present study, the 
points on a Cartesian coordinate system were used to simulate the surface 
area of the standard 100-mm diameter colony culture plates.  The resolution 
of 1000 X 1000 was found accurate enough to represent the actual size of the 
colony. The capability of distinguishing overlapping colonies, defined as 
resolution index, the covering fraction, the colony surface density, and the 
colony size and distribution were the primary parameters in this study.<P>
The counting efficiency was found to consistently decrease with increasing 
surface density and decreasing resolution index.  The recommended upper limit 
of colony counts on the plates depended not only on the number concentration 
but also the size distribution of the colonies. To have a minimum counting 
efficiency of 90%, the colony count should not exceed 630, 110, and 50 
count/plate, for the colony size of 2, 5 and 8 mm, respectively, assuming 
that the colony size was uniform and resolution index was 0.5. For an unclear 
reason, if the surface density was fixed, the GSD of 1.1, not GSD of 1, had 
the lowest covering fraction; therefore, it had the highest counting 
efficiency. However, as the GSD kept increasing, the larger GSDs resulted in 
higher covering fraction, thus, lower counting efficiency. This phenomenon 
was independent of resolution index.

<H2>314. Environmental Mycobacteria Detected in Air and Bulk Samples.</H2>
<B>B. Shelton</B>, P. Christensen, D. Jaeger, Pathogen Control Associates, 
Inc., Norcross, GA<P>
Two cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) were diagnosed in industrial 
machine workers. An investigation of the facility was conducted and 
environmental samples were collected. High levels of rapidly growing 
environmental mycobacteria were detected in the air. These levels were 
&gt;9000 colony forming units (CFR) per cubic meter of air. The source of 
this mycobacteria in air was traced to machine coolant fluid.  Levels between 
3X10<I>5</I> and 3X10<I>7</I> CFU per milliliter were detected in coolant 
samples.  The <I>Mycobacterium</I> isolated from air and bulk samples was 
identified as <I>Mycobacterium chelonae</I>. The finding of this bacterium in 
the environmental samples allowed the manufacturing plant to identify an area 
of concern in the facility and to proceed with decontamination efforts on the 
equipment in which the coolant fluids were used.<P>
It is important to note that these coolant fluids were being routinely 
treated with biocide before the reports of HP occurred in the factory. 
Although a direct cause-effect relationship cannot be made, there is strong 
evidence linking the <I>M. chelonae</I> with the cases of HP. High levels of 
<I>M. chelonae</I> were detected in the air and coolant samples taken in the 
factory where the cases of HP were reported. This data, in combination with 
the fact that <I>Mycobacterium</I> cells have a highly antigenic cell 
surface, indicates a strong likelihood for the association between <I>M. 
chelonae</I> and the cases of HP in the factory. This case demonstrates the 
importance of microbial monitoring by industry that uses coolant fluids in 
their systems.

<H2>315. Monitoring Viable Fungal and Bacterial Bioaerosol Concentrations to 
Identify Acceptable Levels for Common Indoor Environments.</H2>
<B>L. Robertson</B>, Mycotech Biological, Inc., Jewett, TX<P>
The objective of this research was to evaluate viable aerosol concentrations 
to aid in the development of standardized values for indoor fungi and 
bacteria. A total of 934 bioaerosol samplers were evaluated over a nine month 
period in 18 states.  The sample sites selected included commercial and 
residential structures equipped with heating, ventilating and air 
conditioning units.  Samples were collected with an Andersen N-6 single stage 
microbial sampler and the bottom of an Andersen 10-850 two stage microbial 
sampler.  Collection was made utilizing sterile petri plates containing 30 
milliliters of 2% malt extract agar.  Sample collections were incubated at 
25&#176;C with 12-hour light-dark cycles.  Isolates were examined on day 7 
utilizing standard light microscopic technique.  Mature sporulating fungal 
colonies were identified to genus and enumerated as colony forming unites 
(CFUs) per cubic meter (m&#179;). Yeast and bacteria were reported as yeast 
and bacteria CFUs/m&#179;, respectively. Non-adjusted fungal and bacterial 
bioaerosols ranged from 0 CFUs/m&#179; to 6077 CFUs/m&#179; with an average 
of 157 CFUs/m&#179;. Eighty-seven percent of the sample set indicated indoor 
concentrations below 300 CFU/m&#179;. Seven percent of the samples ranged 
between 300-500 CFU/m&#179; and six percent were over 500 CFUs/m&#179;. The 
data obtained from this study suggests that concentrations below 300 
CFUs/m&#179; are typical for indoor fungal and bacterial bioaerosols and 
should be considered acceptable for normal, non-immunologically compromised 
environments.  The author suggests that indoor values that exceed 300 
CFUs/m&#179; require additional investigation with respect to prominent 
outdoor bioaerosol(s), adequate filtration, and/or potential indigenous 
contamination source(s).

<H2>316. Detection of Infectious Agent Containing Aerosols in the Hospital 
Environment.</H2>
<B>M. Sawyer</B>, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA; N. 
Aintablian, Morgan Clinic, Decatur, GA; C. Chamberlain, Naval Medical Center, 
San Diego, CA; E. Keyser, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA<P>
Several infectious diseases are felt to be transmitted by small particle 
aerosols. Among these are varicella-zoster virus (VZV), measles virus, and 
<I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I>. Other respiratory agents are generally 
felt to be transmitted by direct contact or by large droplet particles. To a 
large extent the mode of transmission of these infections has been determined 
by epidemiologic studies. We have utilized a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
based method to demonstrate nucleic acid from infectious agents in air 
samples taken from hospital rooms of patients with documented infections. In 
the case of agents with clear aerosol risk, patients were isolated in rooms 
with a high air exchange rate and with negative pressure with respect to the 
adjacent hallway. Other patients were housed in conventional hospital rooms. 
Air samples of 60-6000 liters were collected through protected, 9.0 cm&#178; 
0.45 &#181;m cellulose filters using portable air sampling pumps for 15 
minutes to 48 hours. Samples were collected at varying distances from the 
bedside and over several days of hospitalization.  Material trapped on the 
filters was eluted, concentrated, and subjected to amplification using PCR. 
VZV DNA was readily detected in hospital room air samples in 64 (82%) of 78 
air samples from the rooms of 25 infected patients. In contrast DNA from 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I>, another agent with presumed high aerosol risk, was 
detected in only 10 of 53 (19%) air samples.  Nucleic acid from respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) and <I>Bordetella pertussis</I>, two respiratory agents 
thought to be spread only by large droplet particles have also been detected 
using this method. RSV RNA was found in 17 (63%) of 27 patient rooms and 
<I>B. pertussi</I> DNA in 7 (58%) of 12 patient rooms. This PCR based method 
allows for the detection of aerosolized infectious agents in the environment. 
With this technique objective evidence for the extent of bioaerosolization of 
infectious agents can be developed and used to evaluate environmental and 
engineering controls designed to limit the spread of bioaerosols in the 
hospital as well as other environments.

<H2>317. Characterization of Bioaerosols in Work Areas at Two Refuse-Derived 
Fuel (Rdf) Facilities.</H2>
<B>G. Garlets</B>, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN S. Reynolds, S. 
Mahar, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA; D. Vesley, University of Minnesota, 
Minneapolis, MN<P>
An investigation was conducted to examine the amounts and types of 
bioaerosols generated during the handling and processing of municipal solid 
waste (MSW) at two refuse-driven fuel (RDF) facilities, based on 
considerations that exposure to such aerosols may be associated with adverse 
health effects.  The measurements involved short-term (on the order of 1 
minute) area sampling onto agar nutrient media using a six-stage Andersen 
cascade impactor. In this instrument, the aerosols were classified according 
to their aerodynamic particle size, and the culturable biological fraction 
was assessed in terms of visual examination of colony-forming units. Data 
were obtained for five locations at different stages in the processing line 
(i.e., tipping floor, magnetic separator, main process floor, loading and 
compacting, and in the lunch room).<P>
Airborne concentrations of overall viable bioaerosol in the workplaces 
studies were appreciably above background levels (e.g., in the lunch room). 
These ranged from about 103 to as high as 5x10<I>4</I> CFU/m&#179;, compared 
with background levels of about 5x10&#178; CFU/m&#179;. The highest levels 
appeared to be associated with that part of the process where the greatest 
amount of energy was being applied to separate the various components of the 
solid waste (i.e., the main magnetic separation). Levels were somewhat higher 
in summer than in winter. In general, about 30% of the culturable organisms 
were fungi, about 50% were gram-negative bacteria, and the remaining 20% were 
gram-positive bacteria.  The largest proportions of fungal and gram-positive 
material were collected in the larger particle size ranges (i.e., on the 
first two or three stages of the Andersen), while the largest proportions of 
the gram-negative material were contained within finer particle size ranges. 
Such results are important  in health-related exposure assessment for such 
bioaerosols, leading ultimately to improved occupational standards and 
preventive measures.

<H2>318. Can Tobacco Smoke Particles Carry Bacteria and Fungi?</H2>
<B>J. Pastuszka</B>, R. Gorny, D. Lis, Institute of Occupational Medicine, 
Sosnowiec, Poland<P>
It is known that aerosols carrying bacteria or fungi are potential problems 
outdoors and indoors. Since Poland is a country of high tobacco consumption 
we investigated whether the microorganisms, which are a part of normal indoor 
environment, may be attached to the tobacco smoke particles. In order to 
study this problem the size distributions of indoor particulate as well as 
bacterial and fungal aerosol were measured. The particle mass size 
distributions were obtained with a 10-stage cascade Andersen impactor. This 
instrument covers a wide range of particle sizes (from less than 0.08 
&#181;m to more than 21 &#181;m). The bioaerosol particles (bacteria and 
fungi) were fractionated in a 6-stage cascade Andersen impactor for viable 
aerosols.<P>
At home with smoking residents the main peak of particle concentration was 
observed always in the range from 0.33 to 0.54 &#181;m with the mass 
concentration <I>D</I>M (<I>D</I>log D<I>ae</I>)<I>-1</I> reaching more 
than 200 &#181;gm-&#179;.  The tobacco smoke has given no substantial 
contribution to the concentration level of particles larger than 0.5 &#181;m. 
We determined only the mass concentration but it can be concluded that the 
peak of dust number size distribution should be moved into the smaller 
particles. On the other hand, the most interesting feature of the size 
distribution of bacterial and fungal aerosol in the indoor environment 
without tobacco smoke, was the predominance of the larger size ranges and 
very low concentration of viable particles with aerodynamic diameter less 
than 1.1 &#181;m.  Hence, it can be seen that the potential particulate 
carriers are smaller than microorganisms which means that the typical indoor 
bacteria and fungi cannot be transported by the tobacco smoke particles. 
However, these particles may play an important role in carrying airborne 
endotoxin.

<H2>207. Field Validation of Passive Monitors for the Determination of 
Employee Exposures to Methylene Chloride in Pharmaceutical Production 
Facilities.</H2>
<B>K. Charron</B>, M. Puskar, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL; S. Levine, 
University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI<P>
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed the 
lowering of the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for methylene chloride 
(MeCl2) from 500 ppm to 25 ppm and the implementation of short-term exposure 
limit (STEL) of 125 ppm.  The acceptance of this proposal will result in an 
increased demand for determining a worker's exposure to MeCl2.  The current 
method for determining MeCl2 exposure is charcoal tube active method.  A 
passive monitor method would be more cost-effective than the current method 
due to the reduction in sample collection and sample analysis complexity.<P>
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends 
monitoring methods have an accuracy of &lt;&#177;25% of the "true" result for 
PEL sampling and &lt;&#177;35% of the "true" result for STEL sampling.  A 
field evaluation was performed to estimate the accuracy of three 
manufacturer's passive monitors for PEL and STEL sampling: Assay Technologies 
Model 541 and 546, 3M Model 3520 and SKC Model 575-001. Area samples were 
exposed in a pharmaceutical production facility at five MeCl2 air 
concentrations for both PEL and STEL periods.  A specially designed exposure 
chamber was used to concurrently expose 6 of each type of passive monitor 
while concurrently collecting 6 active samples from locations surrounding the 
dosimeter array.  The 6 active samples were used to estimate the "actual 
concentration" during the exposure period.  The bias, and accuracy were 
determined for each monitor type at concentrations bracketing the OSHA 
proposed exposure limits.<P>
The actual concentration for the PEL sampling periods ranged form 0.9 ppm to 
63 ppm for the STEL sampling periods ranged from 14 ppm to 357 ppm.  All the 
passive monitors evaluated for PEL and STEL sampling met the NIOSH accuracy 
recommendations.  The Assay Technologies Monitor, Model 541 had a pooled 
accuracy of &#177;28% for STEL exposures.  The Assay Technologies Monitor, 
Model 54 had a pooled accuracy of &#177;20% for PEL exposures.  The 3M 
monitor had a pooled accuracy of &#177;29% for STEL exposures and a pooled 
accuracy of 16% for PEL exposures.  The SKC monitor had a pooled accuracy of 
&#177;30% for STEL exposures and a pooled accuracy of 19% for PEL exposures.

<H2>208. A Novel Passive Sampler for Low Molecular Weight Olefins.</H2>
<B>W. Vincent</B>, L. Bishop, Exxon Biomedical Sciences, Inc., East 
Millstone, NJ<P>
Low molecular weight olefins such as 1,3-butadiene, propylene, isobutylene, 
and isoamylene are commonly used in the syntheses of polymers and organic 
solvents.  Air monitoring for these compounds is frequently done using 
charcoal tubes and air sampling pumps.  Passive badges are preferred by many 
hygienists as a simple technique for obtaining air monitoring data.  A 
preliminary evaluation of commercially available passive monitors  indicated 
that the devices did not meet our laboratory's performance criteria under 
high humidity (&gt;85% RH &#64; 85&#176;C) conditions. Since many 
petrochemical facilities are located in the Gulf Coast of the United States 
where high humidity and temperatures are the norm, an alternative passive 
device was sought.<P>
Laboratory studies identified Columbia JXC charcoal as the sorbent which 
could effectively collect these light olefins even under high temperature and 
humidity conditions.  No passive monitor was commercially available using 
this sorbent.  A passive monitor from SKC, Inc. that used interchangeable 
sorbent cartridges was identified as a compromise that would allow the 
modification of the passive monitor sorbent without requiring extensive 
development effort to design a new passive device.<P>
Sampling rates ranged from 7.8 to 12.2 cc/min for the four olefins.  Reverse 
diffusion was tested but no losses were observed.  Storage stability losses 
of 10-24% were noted for several of the olefins after 7 days.  The passive 
monitor was evaluated versus challenge atmospheres of propylene, isobutylene, 
1,3-butadiene and isoamylene at concentrations from 1 to 100 ppm of each 
component.  The overall accuracy of the monitoring method was determined to 
be within the &#177;25% accuracy recommended by NIOSH for air monitoring 
techniques.

<H2>209. Field Comparisons of the 3520 OVM and Canister Sampling Using 
24-hour Exposure Periods.</H2>
<B>M. Morandi</B>, University of Texas Health Center at Houston, Houston, 
TX, C. Chung, Y. Kim, T. Stock, University of Texas School of Public Health, 
Houston, TX<P>
Passive dosimeters such as 3M 3500/3520 OVMs have been used to a limited 
extent for monitoring airborne volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 
non-industrial indoor and community settings.  These applications have not 
included comparisons with other accepted sampling approaches for the low ppb 
concentrations typically found in such environments.  This study presents a 
field comparison of the performance of the 3520 OVM with canister sampling 
for the measurement of 1,3 butadiene, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, 
chloroform, methylene chloride, styrene, and toluene using 24-hour sampling.<P>
Six 3520 OVMs including two field blanks were placed at each of two air 
quality monitoring stations in Houston, Texas, where routine sampling with 
stainless steel canisters is performed for VOCs. Two parallel canister 
measurements were available at one of the stations.  Midnight to midnight 
sampling was performed during 14 days.  The OVMs were extracted by 
sonication with 1 ml of 2:1 v/v acetone/low benzene CS2 and analyzed by 
GC/MS. The results of the comparison indicated that the background 
variability of methylene chloride, chloroform, benzene, toluene, styrene, and 
tetrachloride in the OVMs impacts the detection limits desirable for low ppm 
concentration monitoring.  There was significant variability between the OVMs 
and the canister measurements was no worse than variability between the 
canister samples for benzene, butadiene, and carbon tetrachloride.  There was 
good agreement between the two methods for benzene and toluene 
(concentrations typically less than or equal to 15 ppb). The results of the 
comparison indicate that OVM sampling is a promising approach for monitoring 
exposures at low ppb concentrations for selected VOCs.

<H2>210. A Comparison of Two Diffusive Samplers for the Collection of 
Styrene, A-Methylstyrene, and O-Chlorostyrene Vapors.</H2>
<B>M. Harper</B>, D. Fiorito, SKC, Inc., Eighty Four, PA<P>
Traditional methods of workplace air sampling involve the collection of 
vapors on a solid sorbent sampling tube, followed by laboratory desorption 
and analysis.  In this study, a diffusive sampler was validated for styrene 
according to a modified version of a protocol developed by the National 
Institute for occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Two versions of the 
sampler were validated simultaneously, each having a different sorbent 
substrate.  Both samplers passed the requirements of  the validation 
procedure, including tests for desorption efficiency, uptake rate and 
capacity, reverse diffusion, storage stability, temperature effects, and a 
factorial study of concentration, sampling time, humidity, interferences, 
wind velocity, and sampler orientation, and their interactions.  Both 
samplers were also tested for critical sampling parameters (desorption 
efficiency, uptake rate, and storage stability) according to the guidelines 
of the BiLevel theory of sampler validation for the homologues 
a-methulstyren and o-chlorostyrene. The sampler containing Anasorb 747 showed 
desorption efficiency for all three compounds that varied with loading, while 
that containing Anasorb 727 showed consistently high recoveries. The sampler 
containing Anasorb 747 might still be preferred in many instances, however, 
because it can be used to collect a wide range of other vapors, in addition 
to the three listed.  The uptake rates of the samplers for styrene, 
a-methylstyrene, and o-chlorostyrene are 13.7, 12.6, and 9.8 mL/minute, 
respectively.  The extent of the validation work performed on these samplers 
should enable acceptance by regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Europe.

<H2>211. Boundary-Layer Resistant Passive Sampling with a Dual Sampler 
Array.</H2>
<B>R. Rando</B>, P. Pintauro, H. Poovey, C. Williams, Tulane Medical Center, 
New Orleans, LA<P>
Passive sampling devices are widely used for personal monitoring of exposure 
to airborne pollutants, but are limited in use for area monitoring in 
confined spaces or other environments where there is low air movement.  Low 
air velocity over the sampling face results in the formation of a "boundary 
layer" which adds to the resistance to mass transfer of the sampler and 
decreases the effective sampling rate.  Most passive samplers have been 
engineered with large internal resistance to mass transfer to make them less 
sensitive to boundary layer effects.  With this approach the mass transfer 
rate is reduced, which decreases the sensitivity of the sampler; and the 
response time of the sampler is increased.  A dual sampler array may an 
alternative to samplers with high internal mass transfer resistance.  A set 
of paired samplers which have the same sampling face diameter and are 
experiencing the same air velocity, will have the same boundary layer 
thickness.  In this case, it is possible to mathematically eliminate the 
boundary layer thickness from the mass transfer equation (Fick's First Law). 
This concept was evaluated in the laboratory using samplers for chlorine 
which were made from 22-mm aerosol monitor cassettes and contained sulfamic 
acid absorbing solution.  Samplers with diffusion path lengths of 3.13 mm and 
8.79 mm were set up in an array inside a wind tunnel containing a test 
atmosphere of 1 ppm chlorine.  The dual sampler array was tested from about 
4 ft/min to 300 ft/min at orientations of 0, 90, and 180 degrees, with 
exposures of one hour.  Evaluated individually, the samplers experienced 
decreasing mass transfer rates as wind velocity decreases, with the bias in 
predicting the exposure concentration reaching as much as -61% at 4 ft/min 
for the 3.13 mm path length sampler.  In contrast, the dual sampler array was 
statistically independent of wind velocity in predicting exposure 
concentration and exhibited an average bias of only 9%.  The test results 
suggest that the dual sampler array is a viable alternative to high mass 
transfer resistance samplers for use in environments of low wind speed.

<H2>1. Re-Aerosolization of Microorganisms from the Filter Media of Health 
Care Respirators.</H2>

<B>Y. Qian</B>, J. Donnelly, V. Ulevicius, K. Willeke, University of Cincinnati, 
Cincinnati, OH <P>
Health care respirators are used to protect health care workers and patients 
against airborne microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While 
the respirator wearer inhales, microorganisms present in the air environment 
may deposit on the respirator's filter material.  These captured 
microorganisms may become a secondary contamination source under adverse 
conditions such as coughing or sneezing.  The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the re-aerosolization of captured microorganisms from the filter 
media of health care respirators. Different filter media of health care 
respirators were cut into 40 mm disks in diameter and were tested as typical 
filtration velocities of 0.6 m/s and higher in the direction opposite to the 
loading flowrate.  Also, a high velocity jet was used to re-aerolosize these 
microorganisms and inert spherical test particles from the filter media to 
see whether under extremely adverse condition a sizable fraction of the 
deposited organisms may be re-aerosolized.  The measurement for particles 
loading and re-aerosolization were conducted with Aerosizer, a real-time 
particle size spectrometer.  The results indicate that at air velocities 
below 1 m/s only a very small percentage of the microorganisms 
re-aerosolized from the filter media (less than 0.01%).  The jet flow 
results in higher re-aerosolization, up to 0.5%.  Re-aerosolization 
increases with increasing particle size.  Based on the results obtained so 
far, it can be concluded that re-aerosolization of microorganisms appears to 
be a minor problem under normal breathing conditions.  The further testing 
of a diversity of filter materials may modify this initial conclusion.

<H2>2. Respiratory Protection Selection and Acceptance by Health Care 
Workers for Protection Against Airborne Tuberculosis Droplet Nuclei in a 
Major Health Care Center.</H2> 
<B>J. Schaefer</B>,  E. Bernacki, R. Gilpin, The Johns Hopkins Institutions, 
Baltimore, MD<P>
When the Centers for Disease Control issued its Draft Tuberculosis Guideline 
in 1994, it stated that respiratory protection was required for workers who 
must enter isolation areas.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
enforcement document further stated that at that time only high efficiency 
particulate air (HEPA) respirators met this requirement.  Based upon these 
documents, the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution conducted evaluation of 
several of the available half face respirators to determine their potential 
for use in the Institution.  A pilot program was then initiated to determine 
the acceptance of the selected respirators, any problems with training 
programs, problems the staff may experience with respirators, and patients' 
acceptance of the respirators.  Based on the outcome of the pilot, a final 
selection and cost analysis was conducted.  Evaluation included staff and 
patient acceptance, compliance cost, training, and American with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) issues.  The final selections were presented to the 
Medical Institution's administration for acceptance and use throughout the 
Institution.  A continuous project to monitor compliance and to address 
concerns of health care workers, patients, and visitors was established.

<H2>3. Total Latex Management: Identifying, Assessing, and Controlling 
Exposures to Latex Allergens in the Health Care Environment.</H2>
<B>N. Moss</B>, K. Coghlan, J. McCarthy, B. Weeks, Environmental Health & 
Engineering, Inc., Newton, MA<P>
Latex allergy has become a major occupational health concern in the health 
care industry. Reports in the international literature indicate that between 
8% and 17% of health care workers are at risk for latex reactions.  
Traditional exposure minimization programs have focused on replacing high 
allergen, powdered gloves with low allergen, powderless gloves to reduce 
dermal and inhalation exposures.  A study was conducted in a large teaching 
hospital (>700 beds) to identify other secondary and tertiary exposures to 
latex allergen within the hospital environment.  Environmental dust samples 
were collected for analysis using a radioimmunoassay technique to determine 
latex allergen content.  Air samples were collected on Teflon filters for 
RAST analysis to assess the impact of a variety of activities (i.e., 
operations and maintenance, renovation) on airborne levels of latex 
allergen.<P>
Significant reservoirs of latex allergen were identified in environmental 
dust samples collected within the hospital.  Levels ranged from 1000 ng/g 
to 1,000,000 ng/g of latex allergen in the dust.  These levels are 
comparable to moderately high latex allergen containing glove products.  
When these areas were disturbed during renovation activities, airborne 
levels of ND to 50 ng/m3 were measured.  These levels have been associated 
with reactions in sensitive individuals.<P>
These environmental levels of latex allergen have accumulated due to use of 
high latex allergen content gloves and other products over a long period of 
time.  When disturbed. this dust may exceed levels associated with reactions 
in highly latex sensitive individuals.  The data collected in this study 
suggest that other important secondary and tertiary exposures to latex 
allergen may exist in health care institutions that have used high latex 
products in the past.  Appropriate identification, assessment, and control 
of these allergen reservoirs is required to fully control environmental 
latex exposures to health care personnel.

<H2>4. Nitrous Oxide Exposure Controls for Cervix Cryo Therapy.</H2> 
<B>C. Warholic</B>, J. Blakley, R. Cravener, C. Thomas, Duke University 
Medical Center, Durham, NC<P>
Nitrous oxide has been linked with spontaneous abortion, congenital 
abnormalities, and liver, kidney, and nervous system disorders among health 
care workers who have been chronically exposed at high levels.  Within the 
hospital setting, this gas is most commonly utilized of its anesthetic 
properties.  However, it has recently been gaining popularity as a cryogenic 
agent.  Most industrial hygiene efforts have focused on nitrous oxide 
exposures during its use as an anesthetic.  Consequently, very little 
monitoring data is available for such cryogenic procedures.  Given 
increasing concern about the hazards associated with nitrous oxide, a study 
was initiated to investigate employee exposure levels during one such 
procedure commonly known as cervix cryo therapy.  During this procedure, a 
"cryo device" is used to freeze mild dysplasia (pre-malignant tissue) on the 
surface of the cervix.  The necrosed tissue eventually sloughs off thus 
reducing the likelihood of the development of cervical cancer.  Hospital 
employees participating in this procedure were interviewed and exposure 
monitoring was conducted.  Landauer Nitrox LT dosimetry devices were used to 
determine employee exposure levels.  Initial results revealed that exposures 
were consistently higher than the ACGIH 8-hr TWA of 50 ppm.  During this 
11-minute procedure, levels as high as 10,431 ppm were observed.  
Engineering control methods were developed with the objective of scavenging 
the gas while completely isolating it from the breathable environment.  
Through subsequent exposure monitoring, it was determined that the control 
measures utilized were effective in reducing exposure levels to below the 
ACGIH TLV, and in some instances to below detection limits.<P>
It has been concluded that nitrous oxide must be scavenged during this 
procedure to prevent overexposures from occurring.  Several types of 
engineering controls can be utilized to bring exposure levels to below 
detectable limits.  Control measures can be utilized without decreasing the 
effectiveness of this procedure.

<H2>5. Nitrous Oxide Exposure to Operating Room Personnel Using Different 
Mask Induction Techniques During Pediatric Ear Surgery.</H2>
<B>E. Stewart</B>, Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, CA<P>
Epidemiological, clinical and/or experimental evidence over the past 25 
years indicated that nitrous oxide can injure the hematopoietic system, 
fetus, brain, lung, liver, and kidneys of occupationally exposed 
individuals.  Perceptual, cognitive, and eye-hand coordination effects have 
been seen in volunteers exposed to levels as low as 50 ppm.  Little 
published real-time data exists that correlates anesthesia providers' work 
practices with occupational exposure to operating room staff.<P>
This study looks at those anesthesia induction techniques most likely to 
produce fugitive emissions from anesthesia machines equipped with waste gas 
scavenging. Changes in work practices can have significant effects on the 
exposure to operating room staff.  The work practices and resulting 
exposures of 27 anesthesiologists and 11 nurse anesthetists were examined 
over the course of 145 pediatric ear surgeries (all bilateral myringotomies) 
in 18 hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.<P>
Real-time data was gathered with a datalogger from an infrared analyzer 
whose probe was placed to represent the anesthesia provider's exposure.  
Exposure results were verified with passive diffusion dosimeters hung from 
the infrared probe top.  Time weighted average exposures were calculated 
based on the period of administration for each bilateral myringotomy, 
starting from patient entry into the operating room and ending when the 
patient left the room for recovery.  Anesthesia induction techniques and 
work practices were noted as they affected short-term exposures.<P>
This study correlates mask induction techniques with short-term time 
weighted average nitrous oxide exposures and shows that careful work 
practices during mask inductions can reduce occupational exposures to all 
operating room personnel to below recommended exposure limits.

<H2>6. Occupational Health Concerns in the Denture Industry.</H2> 
<B>R. Korczynski</B>, Manitoba Labour, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada<P>
Concerns were raised by several denturists regarding potential exposure to 
methyl methacrylate, dust and noise in the processing of dentures. Both the 
National and Provincial Denturist Associations encouraged testing to be 
conducted.  The ACGIH TLV-TWA for particulates not otherwise classified 
(PNOC) is 10 mg/m3 inhalable particulate and 3 mg/m3 respirable 
particulate.  Analyses were according to NIOSH Methods 0500 and 0600. In 
Manitoba, a hearing conservation program is required where the equivalent 
sound pressure level (Leq) exceeds 80 dBA-weighted sounds pressure level 
(dBA) on an averaged 8-hr day.  Quest model M-8B dosimeter was used.  Methyl 
methacrylate was analyzed according to NIOSH Method 2537.  Results were: 
respirable dust exposure was below the lower detection limit (LDL) of 0.3 
mg/filter (N=5) and inhalable dust exposures ranged from 0.91 to 1.29 mg/m3 
(N=5, SD&#177;0.14).  Ambient dust concentrations ranged from 71-79 dBA 
(AM=75).  Personal exposures to methyl methacrylate ranged from 7.14 to 
7.35 mg/m3 (N=5, SD&#177;.07) and ambient concentrations ranged from 12.18 
to 20.51 mg/m3 (N=10, SD&#177;2.17)(ACGIH TLV-TWA=410 mg/m3).  Based on this 
study, personal exposures were found to be acceptable.  Some denturists 
were progressive and implemented control measures.  A local exhaust 
ventilation system was installed to capture dust emissions from the 
trimming and polishing lathes and a canopy hood over the hydraulic presses 
to reduce solvent exposure.  Hearing protection was encouraged to be worn.

<H2>236. OSHA 1910.95 Noncompliance Trends:  1988-1995.</H2>
<B>D. Gasaway</B>, Cabot Safety Corp, San Antonio, TX<P>
Federal and state OSHA citation for 1910.95 noncompliance reveals intriguing 
trends regarding missing and/or weak elements comprising occupational hearing 
conservation programs (OHCPs). Knowledge of deficient OHCP elements which 
have been cited for noncompliance furnish safety and health providers with 
valuable insight which can help them more effectively structure and evaluate 
their existing program elements and ongoing efforts.  Printouts of state and 
federal 1910.95 noncompliance citation were obtained by the author from 
OSHA's Integrated Management Information System (Washington, D.C.) and 
periodically updated on an annual basis.  Results and findings, spanning an 
eight-year period, identify a wide range of noncompliance features associated 
with deficiencies.  Summary elements include: specific 1910.95 paragraph 
elements cited for noncompliance, citation activities observed between state 
and federal OSHA conducted inspections, SIC codes associated with citations, 
union representation at sites, numbers of affected employees included under 
citations issued (other, serious, repeat, or willful), range of monetary 
penalties linked with initial and follow-up noncompliance according to 
1910.95 paragraph elements, type of resolution (contested) of deficiencies 
observed between OSHA inspecting office and each cited facility, and other 
pertinent findings. Overall summaries and annual trends categorize missing or 
weak elements and identify specific deficient areas of noncompliance. 
Findings provide safety-health managers with valuable insight regarding areas 
which have been found deficient during OSHA investigations.  Findings can be 
used to better structure a company's OHCP audits, content of education and 
training of affected employees, areas of documentation and record keeping 
required to ensure visibility of compliance tasks and/or events, and related 
program compliance actions. 

<H2>237. The Appropriate Microphone Position for Measuring a Miner's Noise 
Exposure.</H2>
<B>M. Valoski</B>, Mine Safety & Health Administration, Pittsburgh, PA<P> 
Noise dosimeters and sound level meters (SLMs) are commonly used to measure 
the noise exposure of workers.  Previous laboratory research has shown that 
these instruments can accurately measure noise.  However, often little regard 
has been given to microphone positioning when measuring occupational noise 
exposure. The previous studies on microphone positioning only involved 
laboratory tests.<P>
This study determined the relationships between the sound level at the 
various measurement locations employed when using a noise dosimeter or SLM, 
and the references position under field conditions.  Based on damage risk 
studies, the reference position was the center of the head with the worker 
absent. The SLM position was one foot from the most exposed ear and the noise 
dosimeter position was on top of the most exposed shoulder.<P>
Tests were conducted on 11 noise sources commonly found in either surface or 
underground mines.  These sources were judiciously chosen so that all 
measurements could be conducted under realistic mining conditions.<P>
This study has determined that there is no practical difference between the 
occupational sound levels measured with SLMs and noise dosimeters as long as 
instrumentation with Type 2 accuracy is used.  Type 2 instrumentation is 
generally specific as having an accuracy of &#177;2 dBA.<P>
In addition, this field study corroborated the laboratory studies which 
showed that the noise dosimeter microphone should be located at the top of 
the shoulder, midway between the neck and end of the shoulder with the 
microphone pointing in  a vertical upward direction.

<H2>238. An Evaluation of Noise Exposures Among Theme Park Entertainers.</H2>
<B>K. Tum Suden</B>, R. Bumar, Walt Disney World Co., Lake Buena Vista, FL<P>
While noise exposures and hearing loss are known problems among many 
industries such as metalworking  and refining, the problem is not as widely 
acknowledged in the entertainment industry despite the efforts of many 
renowned performers' statements and experiences. Many entertainment locations 
may not even be aware of the existence of the OSHA Noise Exposure Standard 
which established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 90 dBA and an action 
level (AL) of 85 dBA.<P>
Assessments of potential noise exposures for entertainers, including 
musicians/conducters, stage technicians, and parade float drivers, were 
conducted at a theme park located in Florida. The assessments included full 
shift dosimetry.  Exposures for musicians/conducters ranged from 78 to 09 dBa 
for 23 samples with an average of 88 dBA. Stage technicians' exposures ranged 
from 70 to 86 dBA for 31 samples with an average of 81 dBA. Exposures for 
parade float drivers ranged from 69 to 87 dBA for 17 samples with an average 
of 77 dBA.  Results such as these are highly variable due to such factors as 
theme park hours, number of shows per day, show length, and weather impacts. 
The results presented verify the requirements for hearing conservation in 
this industry.

<H2>239. Hearing Protector Attenuation Measurement by Bone Conduction 
Loudness Balance Compared to Threshold Difference Method.</H2>
<B>T. Rimmer</B>, University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR<P>
A new method designed for the measurement of hearing protective device (HPD) 
noise attenuation under actual use conditions was compared to the standard 
method, real ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) as specified by ANSI 
Standard S12.6-1894.  The procedure, bone conduction loudness balance (BCLB), 
utilized pulsed sounds delivered alternately by a bone conduction vibrator on 
the forehead of the HPD wearer and by a loudspeaker outside the HPD. The bone 
conduction sound was maintained at a constant level and frequency and the air 
conduction sounds (1/3 octave bands of noise from 125 to 8000 Hz) were varied 
in level by the HPD wearer to achieve a subjective impression of equal 
loudness between the bone conducted and air conducted sound pulses.  The 
difference in level between the air conduction sounds required to balance 
with the HPD on or off was defined as the attenuation.<P>
The BCLB procedure was evaluated for three different background noise levels 
using eight subjects wearing expandable foam earplugs.  For the lowest 
background noise condition (21 dBA), the mean attenuation measured by BCLB 
agreed with REAT within 0.6 dBA, except at 2000 Hz where the mean difference 
was 3 dB, and 97% of all individual attenuation comparisons at individual 
frequencies agreed with &#177;10 dB.  BCLB results were not significantly 
affected by background noise at levels and spectral distribution typical 
either of industrial audiometric testing environments (35 dBA) or (for 
frequencies below 2000 Hz) of a fairly noisy office (53 dBA). Also, BCLB was 
shown to be at least equal to REAT regarding administration time, 
repeatability, and subjective acceptability.

<H2>240. Active Noise Cancellation Hearing Protectors: Open-Back and 
Closed-Back Device Performance.</H2>
<B>J. Casali</B>, G. Robinson, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA<P>
Active noise cancellation (ANC), as found in hearing protection devices 
(HPDs) and communications headsets, utilizes electronic circuitry to provide 
a phase-inverted sound wave, or "anti-noise," at the ear to physically cancel 
the energy in an  offending noise.  The intent is to: 1) improve the 
signal/noise ratio at the ear; and 2) reduce the noise exposure threat to 
hearing through increase attenuation. ANC-based HPDs have proliferated in the 
past five years, and considerable variance in design and attenuation 
performance exists among devices. Two prominent dichotomies in ANC HPD design 
include: 1) digital vs. analog circuitry (some devices incorporate both); and 
2) open-back (active attenuation only) vs. closed-back (earmuff-based, 
active-plus-passive attenuation) devices. Attenuation experiments have been 
conducted on several example devices.<P>
In a reverberant chamber, microphone-in-real-ear (MIRE) and real-ear 
attenuation threshold shift tests (REAT) were applied as appropriate to 
quantify the spectral attenuation performance of three ANC HPDs: 1) digital, 
narrow-based open-back HPD designed for use against siren noise; and 2) an 
analog open-back HPD; and 3) an analog closed-back earmuff. Attenuation 
performance of device 1 varied by siren type, ranging from 8 to 22 dB at the 
800 Hz peak frequency, and up to 15 dB at 4000 Hz. Low-frequency performance 
of device 2 ranged from 4.6 to 11.6 dB in the frequency range from 125 to 
500 Hz.  Device 3 showed gains in performance (over passive) of as much as 
18.3 dB (at 125 Hz) with the ANR circuitry active.  In addition, excellent 
agreement between the passive MIRE and REAT data was noted in the test bands 
centered at 500 Hz and above, the maximum difference being 1.8 dB at 1000 Hz. 
A slight reduction in performance in the frequency range from 2000 to 4000 
Hz was measured when devices 2 and 3 were tested in their active mode.<P>
For selected noise exposure applications where substantial low-frequency 
content or highly predictable narrow-band content is present, ANC devices 
provide an attractive alternative or augmentation to conventional passive 
HPDs.

<H2>241. Labeling and Rating Hearing Protector Performance: What Makes 
Sense?</H2>
<B>E. Berger</B>, Cabot Safety Corporation, Indianapolis, IN; L. Royster, 
North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC<P>
For over a decade, the issue of how to label and rate hearing protector 
performance, and how to provide meaningful information to both hearing 
conservation professionals and the general public has been a topic of much 
debate. The issue is particularly acute as it relates to the Environmental 
Protection Agency's (EPA) hearing Protector Labeling Regulation which 
specifies a primary label exhibiting a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) as well 
as a secondary label with accompanying information.  Two ongoing efforts in 
the professional community are directed at examining this issue and 
developing solutions: 1) Accredited Standards Working Group S12/WG11 Field 
Effectiveness and Physical Characteristics of Hearing Protectors conducted an 
interlaboratory comparison study and has been developing a laboratory-based 
test method and a resulting draft standard intended to yield useful estimates 
of the field performance of hearing protectors; 2) The National Hearing 
Conservation Association (NHCA) established a multi-organizational Task Force 
on Hearing Protection Effectiveness in the summer of 1993, to address 
labeling-related issues and make recommendations to EPA.  The AIHA 
participated in this effort via a representative from its Noise Committee.  
The WG11 study demonstrated that a lab protocol using subject naive with 
respect to use of hearing protection, but audiometrically experienced, 
directed to fit hearing protectors based on written instructions without 
experimenter assistance of interference, provided data with good real-world 
predictive capabilities.  A draft standard is being prepared based on those 
findings. The task force adopted the WG11 recommendations for testing and 
incorporated them into a new Noise Reduction Rating/Subject Fit [NRR (Subject 
Fit)] for the primary label, and also specified an expanded and more 
explanatory secondary label providing practical explanations and guidance to 
hearing protector specifiers and users.  The AIHA Noise Committee voted at 
their May 1995 meeting to endorse the task force's findings and send them on 
to the AIHA Board for general approval.

<H2>242. Revision of Baseline Audiograms: Comparison of Various Methods and 
Recommendations.</H2>
<B>J. Royster</B>, Environmental Noise Consultants, Inc., Raleigh, NC<P>
Employees in hearing conservation programs receive annual audiograms which 
are compared to their baseline tests to detect OSHA Standard Threshold Shifts 
(STSs) and other hearing changes. The audiologist or physician reviewing the 
employee's record may revise the baseline for persistent STS or for 
improvement; however, revision practices vary among reviewers.  The National 
Hearing Conservation Association's ad hoc committee on baseline revision is 
working toward a consensus for good practice to promote consistency in 
revisions.  The purpose of the research presented in this paper was to 
quantify the effects of different revision rules on the number of STSs 
identified and the extent of follow-up action which employees would receive 
as a result.  Audiometric data over at least six years from ten different 
companies were analyzed using alternative revision rules.  Revision for 
improvements of 5 dB (rather than 10 dB) in the average of thresholds at 2, 
3, and 4 kHz increase employee protection without raising STS rates 
significantly.  Treating the two ears independently in the revision process 
allowed identification of STSs in each ear separately and simplified the 
decision process.  This practice triggered more follow-up actions for 
employees than the practice of revising baseline for both ears together, 
which often failed to identify STS in the second ear to show it.  Rules which 
allow revision after fluctuating STSs (shifts not present in two consecutive 
tests) led to earlier revision than rules which require persistence of two 
consecutive tests.  Revision of non-consecutive STSs caused a greater risk of 
revision for recurrent threshold shifts.

<H2>243. The Successful Use of Active Noise Control on the Rotary Positive 
Displacement Blower.</H2>
<B>R. Posey</B>, Walker Manufacturing Company, Linthicum, MD<P>
This paper describes the successful use of active noise cancellation (ANC) 
systems on several different manufacturer's rotary positive displacement (PD) 
blowers.  The PD-blowers in this study were Roots-Whispair 1024, URAI-47, 
MD-Pneumatics 9020-17T2, Duraflow 7012 V-B, 4512, and Aerzen 287-314 units. 
Work was conducted with several Fortune 500 companies within the United 
States. All had a desire to reduce harmful noise in operating areas or to 
reduce unwanted boundary noise.<P>
The ANC System consists of a passive silencer, active silencer, and 
associated electronics.  The passive silencer is a low flow restriction 
design which effectively eliminates high frequency noise but lacks low 
frequency attenuation.  The active silencer consists of tuned speaker 
enclosure, controller, amplifier, sensor, and microphone.  The microphone 
senses low frequency PD-blower tones emitted from either the exhaust 
(vacuum), or intake (pressure).  In response to these tones, the control 
generates a signal, when amplified and applied to the active silencer, 
produces an acoustic signal equal in amplitude but opposite in phase to the 
original noise source which is commonly called "anti-noise." The generation 
of anti-noise in close proximity to the original source causes reduction in 
that noise.  The combination low frequency attenuation of the active silencer 
and high frequency attenuation of the passive silencer results in better 
overall reduction in noise than offered by conventional reactive passive 
silencers.  The implementation of active noise on the study PD-blowers 
resulted in noise level reductions up to 24 dBA or 92% reduction in sound 
pressure levels (SPL) than obtained by conventional passive silencers with 
specific tonal reductions to 31 dBA. <P>
It is concluded that active noise control provides an alternative pathway to 
conventional noise reduction methods.

<H2>87. Assessing the Prevalence of Sick Building Syndrome in Offices with 
Different Ventilation Systems.</H2> 
<B>M. Mikatavage</B>, Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, D.C.; H. 
Dillon, K. Oestenstad, V. Rose, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 
Birmingham, AL<P>
Workers from 39 offices without the "sick" label were surveyed to estimate 
the background prevalence of sick building syndrome (SBS) and identify 
factors that affect the estimate, including the type of office ventilation 
system.  Two questionnaires were randomly administered before routine 
physical examinations; one described the SBS study, the other did not.  SBS 
was defined as a symptom (headache, fatigue, upper- or lower respiratory 
irritation) in the prior 24-hour or 7-day recall period that was more severe 
at work and not related to suspected confounders-allergy, cold, flu.  
Prevalence and prevalence ratios were then estimated along with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI).  Symptoms were reported by 45% of 1088 workers 
surveyed, but most reported them as more severe outside work or related them 
to confounders.  SBS prevalence was 5.0% and it did not differ by 
ventilation system, workday, or age. SBS prevalence was 3.2 times higher 
(95% CIH: 1.2, 4.1) for the 7-day relative to the 24-hour recall period, and 
2.5 times higher (95% CI: 1.4, 5.0) for females.<P>
The type of office ventilation system did not affect the prevalence estimate 
of SBS, but the following factors did cause variation in the estimate: the 
employees knowledge of the study, the study's recall period, and gender.  
These findings suggest that one type of ventilation system is not 
necessarily more hazardous than another, and a standardized method of 
assessment seems necessary for SBS.

<H2>88. Measurement of Dilution Ventilation Efficiency Using CO2 As a 
Tracer Gas.</H2> 
<B>M. Auger</B>, J. Farant, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada<P>
Ventilation efficiency describes the ability of a ventilation system to 
distribute air and to dilute pollutants.  This is an important parameter for 
office buildings since it is estimated that roughly 80% of complaints for 
air quality are related to ventilation and pollutants. Recent literature 
reviews have shown, however, that available ventilation efficiency methods 
are not suited for actual field conditions.  The research presented 
describes a method developed to measure dilution efficiency in real 
conditions of occupancy.  The method consists in injecting pulse of CO2 that 
lasts four minutes towards a monitor registering the concentrations at 
16-second intervals.  The pulse is repeated every 20 minutes.  The method 
was tested in a control chamber (64 m&#179;) where temperature, humidity, 
air velocity and air flow rates were measured.  Tests were performed with 
flow rates varying from 20 L/s to 80 L/s and for air distributions through 
1, 2 and 3 air diffusers. Cases were selected to simulate actual room 
conditions found in office buildings.<P>
A linear relationship between maximum concentrations measured and airflow 
rates was observed with a coefficient of determination (r&#178;) higher than 
0.95.  For these concentrations, dilution efficiencies were found to vary 
between 10 and 20%.  No relationship between air velocities in the room and 
dilution efficiencies was found.  The effect of placement of the diffusers 
on efficiency is also discusses.  Overall results compared well with other, 
more involved dilution efficiency methods.  It can be concluded that the 
method is performing well under the test conditions and that it could be 
applied in office buildings.  Further testing should provide information 
necessary to perform the actual field testing.  The method can be adapted to 
evaluate other types of environments besides office buildings.

<H2>89. Assessment of Emission of Formaldehyde from Wood Products in Homes.</H2>
<B>B. Samimi</B>, M. Dias, San Deigo State University, San Diego, CA<P>
Indoor use of many wood products such as pressed wood, particleboard and 
plywood in which formaldehyde-containing resin has been used as adhesive, 
can result in buildup of potentially harmful levels of formaldehyde indoors. 
CAL EPA (1992) has determined that exposure to formaldehyde concentrations 
within the range of 0.1-3.0 ppm is expected to cause hypersensitivity 
amongst the 20-30% of population exposed and indoor concentrations as low as 
0.03 to 0.07 ppm is likely to trigger adverse symptoms among the sensitized 
population.<P>
The objectives of this study were: 1) to assess the emission rate of 
formaldehyde from the two commonly used wood products, i.e., particle board 
and plywood, under combination of conditions, i.e., ambient (22&#177;3&#176; 
C) versus high (40&#176; C) temperature, moderate versus poor (0.5 air 
exchange/hr) ventilation at four typical wood surface to space (Was/Sp) 
ratios applicable to California homes and; 2) to predict the accumulation 
level of formaldehyde in a typical California home under the above 
conditions.  All tests were conducted within a laboratory chamber and 
controlled ventilation conditions.<P>  
Wood products were purchased from two major lumber supply stores. The 
samples were cut and stored in a conditioning chamber with continuous 
ventilation for a period of seven days.  Six independent samples were taken 
from each wood product and tested under each of the above test conditions.  
Four independent air samples were collected during each test condition.  
This strategy provided 24 sampling data for each product/test condition.  
Air samples were collected by Midget Impingers containing sodium bisulfide 
and were analyzed according to NIOSH-adopted chronotropic acid method.  Mean 
equilibrium TWAC of formaldehyde reached 0.266 ppm for plywood at ambient 
temperature, one air exchange per hour (AE/HR) and 0.29 ft&#178;/ft&#179; 
Was/Sp ratio.  The equilibrium TWAC for particleboard reached 0.525 ppm for 
the same temperature and ventilation conditions but at lower Was/Sp ratio of 
0.13 ft&#178;/ft&#179;.  At high end conditions, i.e., temperature of 
40&#176; C and 0.5 AE/HR, the mean equilibrium concentration of formaldehyde 
reached 0.0363 ppm and 1.463 ppm for plywood at 0.43 ft&#178;/ft&#179; 
Was/SP ratio and particleboard at 0.2 ft&#178;/ft&#179; Was/Sp ratio, 
respectively.  The average rate of formaldehyde emission from the two 
products tested under ambient temperatures were 21.3 &#181;g/ft&#178;-HR and 
95 &#181;g/ft&#178;-HR for plywood and particleboard, respectively.  High 
temperature did not seem to have a significant effect of the rate of 
formaldehyde emission form the selected products.

<H2>90. Evaluation of Emissions from Laser Printers Using Environmental 
Chamber Testing.</H2> 
<B>W. Muller</B>, Air Quality Sciences, Inc., Marietta, GA<P>
Chemical and particle emissions from laser printers were evaluated using 
controlled environmental chambers.  Each printer was placed into an 
environmental chamber, complete with its associated paper (new or recycled) 
and cables.  The computer controlling the unit was located outside the 
chamber.  The test system was allowed to equilibrate at one air change/hour 
with the unit powered but not printing.  Background measurements were made 
of the emissions from the powered unit prior to any printing process.  The 
unit was then operated over a 45-minute period, while printing a designated 
test page.  Emissions were monitored over this 45-minute period and a 
subsequent 4-hour period, to collect all emissions during the time of 
operation.  Particle and ozone emissions were continuously monitored; single 
integrated samples of volatile organic compounds (VOCs, analyzed  using 
triple-bed sorbent tubes) and selected aldehydes and ketones (analyzed using 
DNPH-derivatized sample cartridges) were also collected.  Emission rates for 
continuously collected analytes were determined using the theoretical best 
fit to the data.  This theoretical fit is constructed from a mass balance 
around the chamber/printer system, assuming constant emissions of these 
analytes over the printing period and perfect mixing within rates for VOCs 
and selected aldehydes and ketones.  The average emission rate of total VOC 
for 6 different printers printing virgin paper (no recycled content) was 
determined to be 17 mg/hr (23 mg/page printed).  Compounds which were 
commonly identified in these emissions included aromatics (including 
toluene, styrene, and xylenes), saturated aliphatics, and alcohols.  The 
average emission rates for ozone and particles were determined to be 1.1 
mg/hr (1.8 mg/page printed) and 1.9 mg/hr (2.6 mg/page printed), 
respectively.  Higher average VOC levels were determined for printers 
operating using recycled paper or during color printing.

<H2>91. Addition of the Sensory Irritation Potencies of Chemicals Found in 
Indoor Air Mixtures and Estimation of Acceptable Limits.</H2>
<B>Y. Alarie</B>, M. Schaper, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA; G. 
Nielsen, Danish National Institute of Occupational Health, Kobenhavn, 
Denmark; M. Abraham, University College London, London, UK<P>
Products or processes can emit nonreactive volatile organic chemicals (NRVOC) 
in indoor air.  A common complaint due to NRVOC is eye, nose, and throat 
irritation, i.e., sensory irritation (SI). The SI potency (i.e., RD50) of 
many NRVOC has been obtained in mice and the results can be directly 
extrapolated to humans.  Typically, 50 to 300 NRVOC are identified in indoor 
air.  For many, RD50 values are not available.  We have developed a multiple 
linear regression equation to estimate the RD50 NRVOC. The equation uses 
sensory irritant receptor.  The equation is:<P>
RD50 (ppm)= 6.72-(0.79 x p2H)-(1.11 x Sa2H)-(0.85 x log L (Oil).  p2H is the 
chemical dipolarity/polarizability, Sa2H is the chemical overall or 
effective hydrogenbond acidity and L (Oil) is the chemical Ostwald partition 
coefficient on olive oil.  With 56 NRVOC, r&#178; was 0.91. Thus excellent 
estimates of log RD50 can be obtained.<P>
Values for the above variables may not be readily available.  Therefore, we 
obtained an equation to estimate RD50 of NRVOC from molecular weight (MW): 
log RD50 (ppm)=5.40-(0.021 x MW) yielding an r&#178; of 0.61 and applicable 
for MW from 32 to 170.<P>
To obtain the potency of a mixture, potency being defined as a threshold 
value to prevent SI, we used the concentration (C) of each chemical, their 
potency and a safety factor: [C]/(RD50/safety factor of 1333). If the sum of 
these ratios for a mixture larger than 1, complaints of SI are likely. This 
approach is taken by the ACGIH to determine whether or not a mixture is 
above or below TLV, provided that the same toxicological effect is produced 
by each chemical.  A mixture of 22 chemicals effective for SI in humans at a 
total concentration of 25 mg/m&#179; was also estimated to be too high to 
prevent SI from the above equation.

<H2>92. Cat Scanning the Air to Map Concentrations in Space: Experimental 
Studies.</H2> 
<B>A. Samanta</B>, L. Todd, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
Chapel Hill, NC<P>
Current techniques for evaluating exposure and characterizing sources in 
indoor air use area and personal sampling.  Both techniques provide results 
which are spatially limited, and, when integrated sampling is used, are 
temporarily limited.  A new technique is being developed that may provide 
spatially and temporally resolved estimates of contaminant concentrations in 
indoor air. This technique combines the non-invasive, real-time measuring 
capability of an Open Path-Fourier Transform Infrared (OP-FTIR) Spectrometer 
with the mapping capability of Computed Tomography (CT) to provide 
two-dimensional concentration maps for an entire room.<P>
This research reports on the experimental validation of this technique using 
a prototype OP-FTIR-CT system.  Experiments were conducted in an exposure 
chamber that was equipped with sampling and injection ports and a virtual 
scanning OP-FTIR/CT system.  Single and multiple vertically rising plumes of 
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) were generated at different locations of the 
chamber; plumes were mapped using the OP-FTIR/CT system and three different 
fan beam ray configurations.  Point sample maps were compared with 
tomographic maps for peak position and concentration.  The tomographic 
system predicted the position of the plumes accurately, with a maximum 
deviation of one foot.  Concentration was predicted by the tomographic maps 
with a range of 4%-50%; many of the estimates were within 10% of the GC 
analyzed concentrations. The effect of ray configurations, number of rays, 
scanning speed, and reconstruction algorithms was found to have considerable 
impact on the accuracy of the OP-FTIR/CT maps.  Optical remote sensing and 
computed tomography show promise as a method to produce two-dimensional 
concentration maps of an entire room with good spatial temporal resolution.

<H1>Indoor Air Quality II Papers (227-235)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>227. Swab Sampling for Fungi as a Diagnostic Tool in Indoor Air Quality 
Studies.</H2>
<B>P. Morey</B>, Clayton Environmental Consultants, Inc., Gettysburg, PA; K. 
Foarde, Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC<P>
A study on the occurrence of culturable fungi detectable by swab sampling on 
the louvers of supply air vents was performed in response to an occupant 
complaint that molds from diffusers were causing sick building syndrome and 
building-related illness problems.  Fungi were removed by sterile swab from 
surfaces delineated by a 1x5 cm sterile template pressed onto the visually 
dirtiest portion of each diffuser. Approximately 25 samples were collected 
from office areas where the complainant had worked.  Additionally, similar 
numbers of samples were obtained from diffusers in non-complainant areas in 
the same offices as well as from a nearby hotel. In the laboratory, swab 
samples were eluted into sterile fluid and were processed by serial dilution 
on malt extract and DG-18 culture media (limit of detection is approximately 
4 dfu/cm&#178;).  Over 90% of the isolates on both media from offices and the 
hotel were <I>Cladosporium</I>.  The total concentration of fungi varied 
enormously (up to 5 orders of magnitude) among samples in each sample group 
(complainant offices, control offices, hotel), and thus significant 
differences between total fungi concentration between sample groups were not 
found.  The highest concentration of fungi (approximately 16<I>6</I>/cm&#178;) 
was found on a diffuser above a food processing area in the hotel.  Yeasts 
were the predominant fungi isolated from diffusers with wet surfaces. 
Variation in total fungi concentration of up to 4 orders of magnitude were 
found between the visually cleanest and dirtiest areas of the same diffuser. 
The study shows that background concentrations of fungi on diffusers varies 
enormously.  While swab sampling of diffuser surfaces may be useful as part 
of an overall microbial evaluation protocol, this technique alone cannot be 
used to validate the presence or absence of building complaints.

<H2>228. Emission of Bacterial Aerosol from the Fish Aquarium.</H2>
<B>J. Pastuszka</B>, R. Gorny, D. Lis, Institute of Occupational Medicine, 
Sosnowiec, Poland<P>
Due to their effects on health, bioaerosol particles play an important role 
in the indoor exposure. For our study of the emission of viable bacteria from 
the aquarium water, a special, simple laboratory setup was designed.  The 
20-min samples were collected with six-stage impactor at a flow rate of 28.3 
l/min on typical agar. Samples were incubated and the bacteria counts are 
reported as colony forming units in air (CFU/m&#179;).<P>
We found that bacteria can enter and be dispersed into the air from bubbles 
bursting from the microbially laden aquarium water, i.e., the emission of 
bacteria is generated by the air dispenser. The concentration of airborne 
bacteria rapidly increased when the air dispenser started work but reach the 
peak only after one to three hours.  Although the concentration of bacteria 
increased in all size range, a special high increment was observed for the 
viable particles with aerodynamic diameter between 3.3 and 4.7 &#181;m.  The 
maximum of the total bacteria concentration was from 3 to 35 times higher 
than the starting level (before switch on the air dispenser) depending on the 
concentration of bacteria in water.<P>
The discovery of this source aerosolized microorganisms from aquarium water 
suggests that a potential health hazard may be created by inhaling bacteria 
of aquarium origin.

<H2>229. Development and Evaluation of a Method for Characterizing Laser 
Printers.</H2>
<B>M. Gressel</B>, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Since the energy crisis of the early 1970s, buildings have become more energy 
efficient through such measures as the reduction of outdoor air supplied to 
the building and tightening of the building envelope.  During this time, 
complaints about the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) have become common. 
Research has been conducted on ventilation and microbial contamination, but 
little has been done to evaluate activities contributing to poor IEQ. In 
addressing this research need, a study was conducted to evaluate the effects 
of laser printers of IEQ. This project's goal was to develop a method for 
determining the emission rates for ozone, particulates, and volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs), and to provide emission rates for a limited number of 
printers. ASHRAE Standard 62-1989 includes the Indoor Air Quality Procedure 
for determining ventilation requirements for occupied spaces.  This procedure 
bases the outdoor air flow rate on maintaining the concentrations of carbon 
dioxide, chlordane, ozone, and radon to specified levels. The standard also 
recognizes that other contaminants may need to be controlled in the indoor 
environment.  This study will provide the emission rate data needed to use 
this procedure.<P>
All tests were conducted in a validated environmental chamber.  A series of 
test runs were conducted on two older printers: an 18 pg/min model and a 8 
pg/min desktop model.  These tests indicated that significant levels of ozone 
were produced, depending on the chamber humidity. The chamber humidity 
increased during the test runs, indicating a water vapor release, most likely 
from the heating of the paper. Particulate levels were extremely low, 
suggesting that printer operation would be a potential source of particulates 
only if a dustier paper were used.  VOC emissions, as measured by thermal 
desorption methods, were low, with major peaks for butanol and xylene.  Since 
this method was found to provide a reliable estimate for the emissions from 
the tested printers, the method should be considered for use by other 
researchers to evaluate other office equipment.

<H2>230. Analysis of the Particle Size Distributions of Household Dust 
Collected by Indirect Dermal Sampling Techniques, Comparison to Hand Rinses, 
and Environmental Factors Influencing the Adhesion of Particles to Human 
Skin.</H2>
<B>R. Edwards</B>, P. Lioy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ<P>
Determination of the potential health risks from exposure to household dusts 
may be performed by direct measurement of the contaminant (or relevant 
biomarker) in the body or by indirect microenvironmental dust sampling of the 
residence of individual.  Accurate determination from indirect 
microenvironmental sampling requires information on the amount of dust that 
is transferred to the body, and on the physical and chemical characteristics 
of the dust.  Estimation of potential health risks from dermal exposure 
requires that the sampling procedure collects the particle distribution 
fraction of the household dust that is representative of the particles that 
adhere to human skin.  The significance of collecting the relevant particle 
distribution fraction becomes apparent if it is determined that the particle 
distributions available for each exposure pathway are significantly different 
and contaminant concentrations and bioavailablity differ between particle 
sizes.<P>
We describe a convenient and accurate methodology using interactive confocal 
microscopy for obtaining the particle distributions from microenvironmental 
dust samples.  The calibration of the instrument as well as analysis of 
several environmental dust samples is presented.  In addition, we describe 
preliminary studies of the seasonal differences in mass loadings and particle 
size distributions of settled household dusts which indicated a change in the 
particle size distribution between seasons.  Over 90% of the settled dust 
particles were below 10 &#181;m irrespective of season.  In addition, the 
winter sample plates collected a significantly greater number of small 
particles <2.5 &#181;m in diameter, although the samples masses were 
significantly larger in the summer.  Factor analysis of the data from 
questionnaire indicated that this change in the particle distribution was 
probably due to combustions emissions within the residence from oil-fired 
forced air heating.  Care must be taken, therefore, when comparing the 
particle size distributions of settled house dusts on surfaces that the 
samples are taken during the same season of the year.<P>
Results of experience will be presented that compare the particle size 
distributions of housedusts obtained from hand rinses with those obtained by 
different indirect dermal sampling techniques (cotton gloves, cotton-tipped 
applicators, Sofwick Sponges <I>TM</I>, synthetic skin and adhesive labels). 
In addition, measurements of the moisture content and sebum content of the 
Stratum Corncum will be examined to determine their effects on the adhesion 
of particles to the human skin.

<H2>231. Re-entrainment of Laboratory Exhaust Hood Contaminants into an 
Office Complex: An Indoor Air Quality Case History.</H2>
<B>D. Vick</B>,  J. Jankovic, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN<P>
For over three years we investigated complaints of various unusual odors and 
unexplained symptoms from occupant of offices in a large laboratory facility 
built in the early 1950s.  The occupants became concerned that chemical 
contaminants were migrating from fume hood ventilation symptoms into the 
unfinished attic and then into their adjacent office areas.<P>
Initial investigation revealed CO2 and CO levels, temperature, relative 
humidity, particulates, and air exchanges all to be within acceptable ranges. 
Charcoal absorption tube samples collected during five odor episodes were 
either below analytical detection limits or orders of magnitude below 
occupational exposure limits for any identified components.  Smoke tubes 
indicate the offices were positively pressurized to the unfinished attic 
area; however, a tracer gas study indicated some infiltration into the office 
air handler located in the unfinished part of the attic.  A separate tracer 
gas study showed that, within five feet, the contaminants were diluted below 
5% of their concentration at the leak sources.  Complaints continued even 
after sealing leaks, installing additional filtration, improving the outdoor 
air chase, and increasing the amount of outdoor air delivered to the 
offices.<P>
Eventually the primary pollutant pathway into the building was identified. An 
exhaust fan on the roof of an adjacent area was found to be out of 
ventilatory balance with other units.  As a result, the "exhaust" fan was 
functioning as an intake, drawing air from the roof into the building at a 
rate in excess of 2000 CFM.  A tracer gas study proved that, depending on the 
direction of the prevailing winds across the roof top, lab hood exhausts 
could be entrained into this adjacent wing. Once inside, pressure 
relationships in the building were such that air flowed from the wing areas 
to a stairwell and then into the attic area.<P>
As a resolution, the exhaust fan was shut down and sealed.  The positive 
pressure side of the lab hood exhausts in the attic were placed on an 
inspection and maintenance schedule for resealing leaking joints and 
replacing missing sample port plugs.  Although the occupants are emotionally 
sensitized to any unidentified odors, the health complaints have ended.

<H2>232. Indoor Air Quality Assessment of Research Facilities at the South 
Pole.</H2>
<B>E. Light</B>, Pathway Diagnostics, Inc., Reston, VA; R. Boehne, Antarctic 
Support Association, Englewood, CO; H. Mahar, National Science Foundation, 
Arlington, VA; J. Bailey, Sigal Environmental, Inc., Washington, D.C.<P>
Indoor air quality (IAQ) issues tend to be more critical when facilities are 
in an extremely cold environment.  The South Pole Station (SPS) consists of 
over 30 research and support buildings located in the coldest and most remote 
place on earth. Unique operating restrictions include limited fuel to heat 
outside ventilation air (mean temperature -56&#176;F) and logistical 
impediments to preventative maintenance.  The authors performed a 
comprehensive IAQ evaluation of SPS facilities including occupant interviews, 
building inspections, and documentation of general IAQ indicators.<P>
While half of the occupants interviewed reported occasional minor 
building-related symptoms, those with a history of mold and dust allergies 
did not report allergy-type symptoms while at SPS. Irritation-type symptoms 
were often related to exposure to motor vehicle emissions.  With relative 
humidity as low as 1%, some irritation symptoms were also caused by dry air. 
Measured chemical pollutant levels were generally higher than typical 
concentrations found in facilities with similar activities.  Other sources 
evaluated included solvent use, soldering, building materials offgassing, and 
smoking. Results of the survey may be of value for very cold weather climates 
and to closed facilities where ventilation is restricted.<P>
HVAC systems maintained a reasonable degree of comfort. Lack of preventative 
maintenance was responsible for poor sanitary condition of humidifiers in 
electronic equipment areas and the potentially dangerous icing of a furnace 
flue.  Carbon dioxide was generally less than 1200 ppm with peaks up to 2200 
ppm in crowded common areas.  Despite many operational constraints, IAQ in 
the SPS buildings was generally adequate to support current missions.

<H2>233. Indoor Air Quality Surveys: How to Be Effective and Efficient with 
Limited Resources.</H2>
<B>P. Ellringer</B>, Tamarack Environmental Consultants, Inc., St. Paul, MN; 
L. Whitcomb, Minnesota Dept. Of Administration, St. Paul, MN<P>
Complaints about indoor air quality from office workers in buildings occupied 
by Minnesota State Agencies have been steadily increasing.  Given the rising 
concern about indoor air quality and the shortage of staff and funding 
available to address these concerns, it became very important to utilize 
these resource as efficiently as possible.  A protocol was developed using 
the NIOSH model, to quickly and effectively perform an initial indoor air 
quality assessment of these buildings, with an emphasis on inspecting the 
heating, ventilating and air conditioning system. Between September 1990 and 
August 1995, 250 indoor air quality surveys, in 150 office buildings were 
conducted.  Major indoor air quality concerns were identified in 88% of these 
buildings with these major concerns broken down into six areas of ventilation 
23%, temperature 12%, inside contamination 13%, outside contamination 6%, 
building products 1% and microbials contamination 34%.<P>
The protocol used to evaluate these buildings and the results of 250 
investigations will be discussed in detail.  Based on these surveys, 
standardized recommendations for controlling common indoor air quality 
problems were developed.  Many of these recommendations have been implemented 
in these office buildings to provide good, healthy environments for office 
occupants. In the majority of follow-up surveys, office occupants have 
expressed satisfaction with their air quality.

<H2>234. Indoor Air Quality Investigations for Litigation Support.</H2>
<B>G. Boothe</B>, S. Hays, Gobbeil-Hays Partners, Nashville, TN<P>
Indoor air quality (IAQ) investigations require industrial hygienists (IHs) 
to utilize a broad range of investigative and scientific skills. Exposure 
sources are often difficult to determine and solutions are not easy to find. 
With the increase in IAQ litigation, there is a concomitant increase in the 
need for highly defensible data.<P>
Attorneys whose primary practice involve IAQ cases were surveyed to determine 
some of the common mistakes made during IAQ investigations which caused data 
to be lost at trial.  Several years of IAQ data were reviewed to identify 
procedures which are important in producing data for litigation support. The 
result is a group of standard procedures designed to increase the quality of 
data produced by IAQ investigations.  These procedures begin with the basic 
tools required to perform an IAQ investigation.  The unique nature of these 
procedures involves identifying and clarifying steps necessary to ensure high 
quality data which can be used in court.<P>
One of the most important procedures for obtaining defensible data is in 
maintaining an excellent "paper trail" throughout the investigation.  It is 
very important to produce clear and reliable field notes and complete legible 
chain-of-custody forms.  Photographic records are often required to document 
investigations and proper procedures must be followed to introduce these 
records in court.  Selecting the right laboratory is essential to obtaining 
accurate and precise data.<P>
It is concluded that IAQ investigations for litigation support require the 
investigator to use special procedures due to the intense scrutiny placed on 
the data by the courts.  Many IAQ investigators are not familiar with these 
requirements, resulting in lost time and data.  An introduction to these 
procedures and a discussion of their merits will enhance data produced during 
all IAQ investigations, and help ensure the defensibility of data produced 
for litigation support.

<H2>235. Occupational Exposure of Non-Smoking Musicians to Environmental 
Tobacco Smoke in Nightclub Environments.</H2>
<B>D. Johnson</B>, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK; R. Rando, D. 
Boatright, Tulane Medical Center, New Orleans, LA<P>
Research has shown certain occupational groups to be at high potential risk 
for exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), including restaurant and 
"public house" staff such as waitpersons and bartenders.  Nightclub musicians 
and support personnel represent another occupational group potentially at 
risk, but for which exposures have not been previously evaluated. The purpose 
of this study was to assess ETS exposures of nonsmoking musicians in 
nightclub environments using five objective and one subjective exposure/dose 
indicators: Total Suspended Particulates (TSP), ultraviolet fluorescent 
fraction of TSP (UVMP), gaseous nicotine, saliva nicotine, and perceived 
smokiness.  The measured exposures were high or higher than those of other 
occupational groups studied to date.  TPS values ranged from 110 to 1714 
&#181;g/m&#179; (mean 502, SD 390 &#181;g/m&#179;). UVPM measurements (mean 
221, SD 95 &#181;g/m&#179;) were associated with gaseous and saliva nicotine 
concentrations.  Paired-sample variation was much higher for TSP than UVPM. 
Correlation of TSP with UVPM, gaseous nicotine, and saliva nicotine was poor. 
These results suggest that TSP should not be used as the sole indicator of 
ETS exposure. Paired-sample gaseous nicotine results were similar, with 
exposures of 28.0 to 50.0 &#181;g/m&#179; (mean 37.1, SD 6.9 &#181;g/m&#179;), 
and were high compared to previous studies. These results suggested that 
nightclub musicians may be exposed to higher concentrations of ETS than some 
other occupational groups.  Saliva nicotine results were consistent with 
those previously reported with regard to the range of values, the large 
variation observed, and the increase in saliva nicotine levels observable 
after only a few hours of exposure. Saliva nicotine results could not be 
correlated with other measures of exposure and did not appear to be a 
reliable biological indicator of absorbed dose.  Saliva nicotine levels were 
comparable to other occupational groups studied, but were lower than previous 
finding for bartenders and waitresses.  Levels ranged from 1.7 to 5.0 
ng/m&#179; (mean 3.4, SD 0.9 ng/m&#179;), and increased with number of 
exposures experienced by the musicians during the workweek, but did not 
correlate with other ETS indicators.

<H1>Lead Issues Papers (143-153)</H1>
<BODY>

<H2>143. Analysis of Lead-Contaminated House Dust and Blood Lead Levels in 
Urban Children.</H2>
<B>D. Jacobs</B>, B. Lanphear, HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control, 
Washington, D.C.<P>
The purpose of this study was to estimate the probability of a child having 
an elevated blood lead level based on known amount of lead dust in the 
child's primary residence and how that lead dust should be quantified.  Two 
hundred-five children aged one and one-half years to two years were enrolled 
in a cross-sectional study in Rochester, N.Y.  Three dust collection methods 
were used to obtain samples from up to 12 sampling locations in each house.  
Other sources of lead exposure were also quantified, including paint, soil, 
water, and other sources.  Socio-economic status and behavioral influences 
were also measured.  Blood lead level and iron status for each child were 
quantified.  Results show that dust lead loading (&#181;g/m&#178;) is a 
significantly better predictor of children's blood lead level than dust lead 
concentration (&#181;g/g) and that significant differences exist among dust 
sampling methods.  Statistical modeling shows that the proportion of urban 
children having elevated blood lead levels increases at dust lead levels 
lower than current HUD and EPA standards.  The results of this study can be 
used to guide the development of a health-based standard for settled leaded 
dust in housing, which EPA is required to establish under Title X of the 
1992 Housing and Community Development Act.  The results also inform the 
selection of the best standard lead dust sampling method and locations to 
determine compliance with such a standard.

<H2>144. Take Home Lead Exposures Among Construction Workers' Families.</H2>
<B>G. Piacitelli</B>, C. Mueller, K. Sieber, E. Whelan, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Para-occupational or "take home" exposures to lead have been reported for 
several industries where lead is used, including battery plants, lead 
smelters, and radiator shops.  However, little information is known about 
take-home exposures in the construction industry, where extremely high 
exposures to lead may occur and where preventive measures such as personal 
hygiene programs are often lacking.<P>
This paper describes a study which assessed take-home exposures among 29 
families of lead-exposed construction workers; 18 neighborhood families with 
no known lead exposures were included for comparison.  Construction workers 
were selected from the New Jersey Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and 
Surveillance Registry while neighbor controls were referred by lead-exposed 
participants.  Environmental sampling was conducted to assess lead 
contamination on participants' hands and inside their cars and homes.  
Handwipe samples were taken using pre-moistened towelettes.  In cars and 
homes, surface lead levels were measured using wipe or vacuum sampling 
methods, depending on the type of surface. Venous blood samples were 
collected from 50 children (31 exposed and 19 controls) under age six.<P>
Lead concentrations (ppm) and lead loadings (&#181;g/m&#178;) were generally 
higher in exposed homes than in control homes.  The area where workers 
changed from work clothes was significantly more contaminated with lead in 
exposed homes (300 vs. 120 ppm; p=0.04) than in control homes. Lead 
contamination in the cars was significantly higher for exposed families 
compared to controls for all locations sampled, including the driver's floor 
and seat, passenger's floor and seat, armrest, and steering wheel.  Mean 
hand lead levels, which are indicative of recent contamination, were similar 
for children in the exposed and control homes (35 and 43 &#181;g/m&#178;; 
p=0.52). A greater percent of exposed children than control children had a 
BLL at or over the CDC intervention level of 10 &#181;g/dl (odds ratio = 
6.1; CI 0.9-147.2). Among exposed families, the child's BLL was correlated 
with lead concentrations measured in most locations in the home and car; no 
such correlations were found for control families.<P>
These findings indicate that workers are inadvertently taking lead from 
construction sites into their cars and homes, thereby potentially exposing 
their family members.  Children whose parents work with lead were six times 
more likely to have elevated blood lead levels that were children of 
neighbors with no occupational exposure to lead.  This study emphasizes the 
need for proper hygiene programs at construction sites, including the use of 
change and shower facilities before leaving work.

<H2>145. Evaluation of the Safety and Effectiveness of Lead-Based Paint 
Hazard Reduction When Conducted by Homeowners.</H2>
<B>L. Etre</B>, S. Reynolds, L. Burmeister, L. Fuortes, University of Iowa, 
Iowa City, IA<P>
Due to the hazards associated with lead-based paint, some states require 
that only professional contractors perform lead abatement.  In the state of 
Iowa, homeowners are advised to remove/repair lead-based paint following 
procedures recommended by the Iowa Department of Public Health.  The 
specific goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 
lead-based paint removal/repair in cases where property owners elected to 
remove lead hazards themselves.  The project in collaboration with the Iowa 
Department of Public Health (IDPH) evaluated whether property owners who 
followed recommended procedures outlined by the IDPH for lead-based paint 
removal could do the work safely by comparing adult blood lead levels before 
and after removing lead-based paint in sample size of 24 homes.  The 
effectiveness of lead-based paint hazard reduction was evaluated by pre- and 
post-surface dust samples collected using commercial wipes wetted with a 
non-alcohol wetting agent, a wipe method currently recommended by HUD for 
dust clearance after lead abatement.  Surface dust samples were digested 
with nitric acid and analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption 
spectroscopy per NIOSH method 7105.  Venous blood samples were collected in 
3-cc EDTA-coated vacutainer tubes and analyzed by flame atomic absorption.  
The geometric mean for the adult blood lead levels prior to lead-based paint 
removal/repair was 3.38 &#181;g/dl (range of 1.3-15.2 &#181;g/dl) and after 
lead-based paint hazard reduction was 3.76 &#181;g/dl (range 1.5-16.8 
&#181;g/dl).  There was no significant difference in blood lead levels after 
lead-based paint hazard reduction.  Also there was no significant difference 
in surface dust lead levels after lead-based paint removal/repair when 
compared to the levels before.  In conclusion, lead-based paint 
removal/repair can be done safely and effectively when conducted following 
recommended procedures.

<H2>146. Airborne Lead Exposures to Residential and Commercial Painters 
During Surface Preparation.</H2>
<B>P. Scholz</B>, G. Lomax, B. Materna, E. Merideth, California Department of 
Health Services, Berkeley, CA<P>
Limited data are available on residential and commercial painters' exposure 
to airborne lead during surface preparation where lead-based paint is 
present.  This kind of data has policy implications for federal and state 
lead hazard reduction regulations.  As part of the 1994-1995 California 
Painters' Project, lead exposure monitoring was conducted at 12 work sites 
in the San Francisco Bay area. Twenty-five full-shift and 54 task-specific, 
short-term (30 min) lead exposure measurements were taken during exterior 
surface preparation. Paint chip samples were taken of all disturbed surfaces.<P>
The full-shift airborne lead exposures (n=25), expressed as 8-hr TWAs, 
ranged from 1-548 &#181;g/m&#179;; the arithmetic mean was 57 
&#181;g/m&#179;.  The results of the task-specific, short-term samples 
(n=54) indicated the following mean exposures: 2.4 &#181;g/m&#179; for heat 
gun; 3.4 &#181;g/m&#179; for wet sanding; 9.8 &#181;g/m&#179; for open flame 
torch; 32.8 &#181;g/m&#179; for HEPA vacuum-exhausted power sanding; 70.5 
&#181;g/m&#179; for dry scraping; 427.7 &#181;g/m&#179; for dry sanding; 
578.5 &#181;g/m&#179; for power sanding without local exhaust.<P>
The data show that full-shift lead exposures to residential and commercial 
painters can exceed the OSHA PEL during surface preparation activities on 
lead-based paint. The short-term, task-specific exposure monitoring 
indicates that uncontrolled power sanding, dry sanding, and dry scraping are 
the highest exposure methods.

<H2>147. Rapid Non-Destructive Determination of Percent Weight Lead Using 
X-Ray Fluorescence.</H2>
<B>D. Sackett</B>, Niton Corporation, Bedford, MA; E. Satrun, C. Parsons, 
Mobil Oil Company, Joliet, IL<P>
OSHA regulations for worker exposure to lead-based paint specify worker 
protection be based on airborne lead levels.  Organizations have thus 
developed data bases to predict airborne lead levels from percent weight 
lead in the paint on structures.  The lead content is usually determined 
via laboratory analysis of paint chips.  X-ray fluorescence (XFR) offers a 
rapid, non-destructive technique for lead paint analyses, but it is not 
widely used because measurements yield the mass of lead, in mg/cm&#178;, 
rather than percent weight. Because little data exists that correlates 
mg/cm&#178; to airborne lead levels, XRF measurements are of limited use in 
predicting airborne lead levels.<P>
We have developed an XRF methodology to rapidly and non-destructively 
determine percent weight lead on a surface, rather than mg/cm&#178; of lead. 
The method requires and XRF measurement,  a non-destructive paint thickness 
measurement, and an assumption of paint density. This method was evaluated 
at several refinery and tank farm sites.  XRF and paint thickness readings 
were performed for 51 surfaces, and paint samples were removed for AAS 
analysis.  The percent of weight lead was determined, and compared to AAS 
results.  The method predicted the percent weight to &#177;40%, with 95% 
confidence.  A 40% variability should be acceptable, given: 1) the range of 
worker protection  ratings on equipment; 2) the fact that surfaces can be 
thoroughly sampled so local variations in lead paint levels, which are often 
far greater than 40%, are detected; and 3) uncertainties in existing 
correlations between surface lead and airborne levels are at least 25-30%.<P>
In conclusion, our method promises to provide rapid, non-destructive 
evaluation of percent weight lead on painted structures.  Thorough 
assessments of lead-levels are no longer prohibitive, allowing better 
decision-making for worker protection.

<H2>148. Massachusetts Department of Labor and Industry's Highway Bridge 
Maintenance Safety and Lead Paint Hazard Training Program: A Proactive 
Approach.</H2>
<B>D. Delikat</B>, Massachusetts Division of Occupational Hygiene, W. 
Newton, MA<P>
The Massachusetts Department of Labor and Industry, Division of Occupational 
Hygiene, has the unique history and expertise for detection and prevention 
of lead exposure and other occupational health problems for over 60 years.  
Massachusetts Highway Bridge Workers are potentially exposed to both health 
and safety hazards at highway bridge work sites.  In order to provide 
persons working on highway bridge work sites with sufficient information 
about lead paint and other hazards commonly encountered and to take 
appropriate actions to eliminate or reduce them, a proactive approach in the 
form of three stand-alone training tools were instituted.  The first tool 
was the formal classroom training which was supplied to approximately 300 
MassHighway employees, engineers and occupational health and safety 
inspectors.  The second tool was a pocket guide which gives a quick 
reference to personal protective measures for working around lead exposure 
hazards.  The third tool was a 15-minute training video which visually 
depicts the hazards commonly encountered at highway bridge cleaning work 
sites.  Although each tool stands alone, each complements the other and 
taken together produces a valuable and powerful training tool.  Because 
occupational lead exposures are not limited to the workplace, education 
using these three training tools may prevent measurable, "take-home" 
exposures to workers' families.

<H2>149. A Study of Effective Protection Factor (EPF) at a Primary Lead 
Smelter.</H2>
<B>T. Spear</B>, J. Bootland, J. Dumond, C. Lloyd, Montana College of 
Mineral Science, Butte, MT<P>
An industrial hygiene study was conducted at a primary lead smelter to 
determine the effective protection factor (EPF) for negative pressure and 
powered air purifying (PAPR) half-mask respirators.  The study involved 101 
paired personal samples taken in six different work areas, in which subjects 
chosen at random from the workforce wore dual sampling pumps connected to 
closed-face 37-mm cassettes.  The cassettes were attached either to the 
workers' lapel (to enable measurement of aerosol concentration outside the 
respirator in the breathing zone) or to a ported respirator (to enable 
measurement of aerosol concentrations inside the respirator). Full-shift 
samples were collected at 2 Lpm, and subsequently analyzed for lead 
according to the NIOSH Method 7082.  Using particle size distribution data 
obtained for the same workplaces, the respirator samples were corrected for 
sampling bias associated with respiratory tract deposition and in-line 
sampling losses (based on the model of Hewett et al., AIHAJ, 1993).<P>
For the plant taken as a whole, the results for the negative pressure 
respirator revealed a mean measured effective protection factor (EPF) of 
6.4&#177;1.6 (mean &#177; standard error), and a mean corrected EPF of 4.5 
&#177;1.2. Approximately 80% of the measured EPF-values, and 90% of the 
corrected EPF-values, were equal to or less than the assigned protection 
factor (APF) of 10.  For the half-mask PAPRs, the mean measured EPF was 
17.6&#177;3.9 and the mean corrected EPF was 11.5&#177;2.2.  Approximately 
90% of the measured EPF-values and 95% of the corrected EPF-values were 
equal to or less than the APF-value of 50.  A high proportion of the 
protected levels of exposure for both respirators were above the PEL.<P>
These results indicate that the APF-values for the respirators in question 
were rarely met in practice, suggesting that the straight application of 
APF-values in choosing respiratory protection equipment may not always be 
appropriate.

<H2>150. Occupational and Childhood Lead Exposure in Armenia.</H2>
<B>L. Saryan</B>, West Allis Memorial Hospital Industrial, West Allis, WI; E. 
Babayan, Institute of General Hygiene, Armenia; I. Vartanian, New York 
University, New York, NY; R. Barseghian, Yerevan Medical University, 
Yerevan, Armenia<P>
Lead exposure is a significant but largely unexamined public health issue in 
emerging countries. Exposure of workers and children may be readily 
estimated by blood lead analysis.  The first comprehensive blood lead level 
(BLL) survey in the Republic of Armenia is presently underway. Over 300 
venipuncture blood samples obtained from adult workers at four 
establishments, and from children living in various districts of Yerevan, 
have been analyzed for lead content.  Analyses were performed by atomic 
absorption spectrophotometry with the application of internal and external 
quality control measures.  Worker BLLs at three establishments (two printing 
factories and a research institute), and administrative workers at a glass 
factory were found to have elevated BLLs (range: 2 to 31 mcg/dL, n=79 
samples). Several production workers at the glass factory were found to have 
elevated BLLs (range: 8 to 89 mcg/dL, n=39 samples) with 49% greater than 
40 mcg/dL and 21% greater than 65 mcg/dL.  Armenian children studied between 
1992 and 1995 were shown to have low to moderate lead absorption (mean 
&#177;SD: 6.5&#177;3.4 mcg/dL, highest value 18 mcg/dL, n=198 samples). None 
of the Armenian children fell into the CDC "medical evaluation" range (>= 20 
mcg/dL). Analysis of 72 paint samples gathered mostly from schools and 
residences in or near Yerevan showed a maximum lead content of 1.22% lead by 
weight (only 4% of these contained greater than 1.0% lead), whereas for 182 
samples received from a large number of residences and schools in Wisconsin 
in 1992, 45% contained greater than 1.0% lead and 30% contained greater than 
5.0% lead.  Lead is definitely present in Armenian paints but appears to be 
restricted to relatively low concentrations.  It is hypothesized on the 
basis of available data that the low incidence of Armenian children with 
very elevated BLL is related to the scarcity of highly leaded paints 
accessible in childhood environments.  Local facilities for routine blood 
lead monitoring, an ongoing program devoted to factory surveillance and 
remediation, environmental reduction, and public education concerning the 
hazards of lead and exposure prevention are necessary.

<H2>151. Investigation of the Use of Salivary Lead to Assess Worker 
Exposures.</H2>
<B>M. Boeniger</B>, K. Ashley, E. Esswein, L. Ewers, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
Background: Blood Pb and urinary Pb are useful biological markers of 
long-term exposure to environmental lead.  But because of their long 
biological elimination half-lives (months to years for different storage 
compartments), they are poor indicators of short-term levels of exposure.  
To determine the contribution of specific activities or the effectiveness of 
modifications and interventions on the level of absorbed uptake, a 
biological indicator of very recent exposures could be potentially useful.<P>
Hypothesis: Salivary Pb should reflect freshly absorbed exposures (i.e., 
endogenous Pb) since saliva draws upon the circulating plasma which is the 
first internal compartment into which absorbed  Pb resides.  In addition, we 
sought to validate the collection procedure so that the results could be 
appropriately interpreted.<P>
Methods: Twelve male workers in a lead battery manufacturing plant 
volunteered to provide saliva samples upon arriving at work, before lunch, 
and at the end of their work shift throughout the work week.  The procedure 
entailed having the worker don a glove, wipe around his mouth with a 
Wet&Dry&#174;, put a short straw between the lips, and expel saliva into a 
clean test tube. Daily personal air samples, the mouth wipe, and towelettes 
used to wipe workers' hands were taken during each period.  Saliva samples 
were analyzed without acid digestion with an on-site portable anodic 
stripping voltametry (ASV) device and in the laboratory after total 
digestion using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS).  
Some of the saliva samples were filtered and analyzed and samples taken 
after mouth rinse with citric acid were compared to those without rinsing.<P>
Results: A total of 141 saliva samples were collected and analyzed. The ASV 
analytical results were significantly lower than the GFAAS results (p&lt;0.001) 
but well correlated (correl. coeff = 0.71), possibly explained if externally 
derived particulate contamination present inside the mouth was made 
available to the GFAAS analysis because of its aggressive digestion 
preparation. Further support of external Pb influence on the saliva sample 
result was found in the stronger association between saliva Pb and external 
mouth wipe Pb (correlation coeff. = 0.4) than with other measures of 
exposure.  Also, rinsing with citric acid reduced the average lead 
concentration (N=11 sets) to 30% of the non-rinsed  concentration, which 
apparently removed a residual Pb contribution that may confound the 
measurement of endogenous salivary Pb. Filtering of the samples through a 
0.45 um filter produced results that were 8-10 times lower than the original 
sample  and these differences were similar  to those seen between  the ASV 
and GFAAS results. The work-shift samples showed that the beginning-of-work 
saliva Pb was significantly lower than both mid-day and end-of-day 
concentrations (p&lt;0.001, both ASV and GFAAS) with progressive increase 
toward the end of the shift, suggesting that the saliva was quickly 
reflecting an exposure to Pb at work.  Bioaccumulation was not indicated by 
day-to-day comparisons between the results, also suggesting that each sample 
reflects primarily that day's exposure, although morning results were much 
higher in these workers than in the investigators' saliva.  The saliva 
concentrations corresponded to other measures of exposure including blood 
Pb, mouth wipe Pb, and personal breathing zone air concentration, but not 
hand Pb.  We believe that salivary Pb testing should be further evaluated 
against short-term exposure but recommend taking samples after a mouth rinse 
if only endogenous Pb is intended to be measured.

<H2>152. Spectral Analysis of Postural Sway in Children with Chronic Lead 
Exposure.</H2>
<B>A. Bagchee</B>, A. Bhattacharya, P. Succop, University of Cincinnati, 
Cincinnati, OH<P>
Upright postural stability is attained by afferent inputs from vestibular, 
proprioceptive, and visual systems that are integrated in the higher centers 
of the central nervous system and cerebellum. Presence of overlapping 
sources of information allows compensation by the remaining systems when one 
or more of these afferent inputs are impaired due to lead (Pb) exposure.  
Stabilogram provides an indirect measure of the postural stability, wherein 
the movement of the center of force under the foot is measured using a force 
platform.  In a prospective study of children exposed to chronic levels of 
Pb exposure, sway measurement was performed on 185 children with known 
histories of low level chronic Pb exposure [mean age= 79.3&#177;22.6 months]. 
The exposure variable was taken to be the average of the yearly maximum 
blood lead level for the first five years of life (PbB).  The subjects 
performed four tasks while standing on a force platform: 1) EO: eyes open on 
firm surface; 2) EC: eyes closed on firm surface; 3) FO: eyes open on a 
compliant foam surface (3 inches thick); and 4) FC: eyes closed on foam 
surface.  The data were analyzed to yield the anterior-posterior (AP) and 
medial-lateral (ML) sway of the body. Spectral analysis was performed on the 
data by obtaining the FFT transforms using a 0-10 Hz filter.  Dependent 
measures included i) energy content; ii) peak amplitude; iii) frequency at 
the peak amplitude. Repeated measures analysis indicated that the energy 
content of the ML sway increased significantly with increasing PbB for all 
tasks [EO: P&lt;0.2; EC: p&lt;0.006; FO: 0&lt;0.025; FC: p&lt;0.01]. The 
peak amplitude of FFT in the ML direction also showed significant slopes 
with increasing PbB exposure.  Spectral values of the AP sway showed similar 
increase with increasing PbB (p&lt;0.5). Increased content of the spectral 
analysis was consistent with clinical cases of non-specific neurological 
damages to the cerebellum. It implies a greater involvement of the 
proprioceptive system as compared to the vestibular system, that decreases 
with increasing age in a normal development.  A Romberg analysis of all 
variables indicated no significant involvement of the visual component, 
consistent with the studies reported for cerebellar disorders caused by 
neurotoxic industrial chemicals.

<H2>153. Performance of Laboratories and Analytical Methods During the First 
Three Years of the Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing (ELPAT) 
Program.</H2>
<B>C. Esche</B>, J. Groff, P. Schlecht, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH<P>
The National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP) recognizes 
laboratories that are capable of analyzing lead in paints, soils, and dusts. 
NLLAP requires successful participation in the Environmental Lead 
Proficiency Analytical Testing Program) (ELPAT). Over the first three years 
of the ELPAT Program, laboratory to laboratory agreement among ELPAT 
reference laboratories averaged 8.5% relative standard deviation (RSD) for 
paint chips, 8.0% for soils, and 10.5% for dust wipes.  Over 90% of 
participating laboratories are able to consistently meet ELPAT performance 
limits. A variety of analytical methods give similar results.  No conclusive 
significant differences were found among most frequently used hotplate 
microwave sample preparation techniques.  In addition, several participating 
laboratories have successfully used ultrasonic extraction methods, a method 
suitable for use at abatement sites.  The three most frequently used 
instrumental techniques, flame atomic absorption (FAA), inductively coupled 
plasma_atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and graphic furnace atomic 
absorption (GFAA) show no statistically significant differences in ability 
to meet ELPAT performance limits. However, small statistically significant 
biases between these methods (generally ICP-AES giving lower results than 
FAA) sometimes occur.  The magnitude of the biases occurring on dust wipe 
samples at low lead concentrations well below current clearance standards 
for housing.  Other instrumental methods that have been used successfully by 
one or more participating laboratories include: ICP-mass spectroscopy 
(ICP-MS), direct current plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (DCP-AES), 
dithizone spectroscopy, and anodic stripping voltametry (ASV).

<H1>Projekt Verfunknetzung Thringen</H1>

Um die katastrophalen Konditionen der <A HREF="http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/info/post/">Deutschen
Telekom AG</A> bzgl. Standleitungen zu umgehen, haben Christian Anger und Co
in <A HREF="http://www.erfurt.thur.de/">Erfurt</A> begonnen Funknetze
aufzubauen.

<P>Die Idee ist simpel: Funkstrecken sind kostenlose Standleitungen. Gerade
im Stadtbereich sind die Stationen eng genug beisammen, um das effektiv
werden zu lassen. Bereits vor mehr als einem Jahr wurde damit im Prenzlauer
Berg Berlin mit dem Projekt
<A HREF="http://fub46.zedat.fu-berlin.de:8080/~huette/prenzlnet/">Prenzlnet</A>
begonnen. Dies ist inzwischen zwar auf den Boden der Kabel zurckgekommen,
aber trotzdem sehr interessant.

<P>Einige <A HREF="testlauf.html">durchgefhrte Tests</A>, u.a. auf dem
<A HREF="altvater.alster.html">Alsterfest</A> in Hamburg, endeten
vielversprechend.

<P><STRONG>Leider versuchen die groen Mitspieler das Projekt zu
zerstren</STRONG>. Mittels einer <A HREF="http://www.fb1.fhtw-berlin.de/people/s78136/prenzlnet/funkgebuehren.html">nderung
der Gebhrenordnug</A> versucht das BMPT diese Lsung gem Absatz C.3 mit
einer Lizenzgebhr von 50Pf pro Einwohner zu sabotieren! Jena mit 100000
Einwohnern wrde somit erstmal schlappe 50000DM Lizenzgebhr kosten. (Dank an
die Scanner in Berlin. Heien Dank.) Glcklicherweise haben wir jedoch schon
begonnen...

<P>Dazu gibt es auch <A HREF="bundeslizenz.altvater.html">einen
Kommentar von Altvater</A>.

<STRONG>Das Problem:</STRONG> Jena ist etwa 15&nbsp;km lang und 1 bis
3&nbsp;km breit und liegt wie eine Banane in einem Tal. In Jena gibt es am
ueren Bananenbogen eine Ausbuchtung, in der der Jugendklub Trend liegt.
Dieser beherbergt den ffentlichen Internetraum des Vereins.

<TD>Wie der Stadtplan zeigt, ist es notwendig, den Raum mit mehreren Sender zu
berlagern. Dies hngt von der Leistungsfhigkeit der eingesetzten

<P>Davon ausgehend, kann mensch sich mehrere Netzbereiche sich berlegen.
Standorte der zentralen Funkstationen wren dabei:
<ul>
  <li>Der Jugendklub Trend, die schon lange darauf warten.
  <li>Horst Schwabe &amp; Steffen Peter, der mit der chinesischen Mauer

Im Prinzip kommen nur 2.4&nbsp;GHz Funkmodems in Frage, da diese das beste
Preis/Leistungsverhltnis bieten. Diese arbeiten im gleichen Bereich, wie
die Microwellenherde und benutzen deshalb <A HREF="tb337.pdf">Spread

wurde von Barry McLarnon zusammengestellt.

sind <A HREF="hausfunkanlage.html">schnurlose Telefone</A>. Eine
entsprechende Diskussion erfolgte auch in den <A HREF="news-technik-gasse.html">News</A>.

<P>Die Inhausverkablung soll nach <A HREF="mailto:steffen.peter@jena.thur.de">Steffen Peter</A>
durch eigene Kabel in den Neubaublcken erfolgen. Dabei sollen im Keller je
ein Rechener fr 2 Aufgnge stehen, von dem aus ein Ethernetkabel den
Elfgeschosser aufwrts zieht. Auf jeder zweiten Etage kann ein 4-er Hub fr
150DM eingeschleift werden, der die Wohnungen anschliet. Stehen die Huser
Eng genug beieinander, sollte auch ein gespanntes Kabel selbst kein Problem
machen. <A HREF="mailto:steffen.peter@jena.thur.de">Mitmacher</A> gesucht!

<H3>Netzwerkprotokolle</H3>

Wenn schon ein dezentrales Funknetz ausgebaut wird, so sollte es sich auch
mehr oder minder selbst verwalten. Dazu kann das Routingprotokoll <A
HREF="rfc1583.txt">OSPF</A> zum Einsatz kommen. OSPF versucht vom jeweiligen
Rechner aus, den besten Weg durch das Verbindungsgewirr. 
Ein (unvollstndiger) <A HREF="gated/natows-slides.skh/html/sue.talks.html">Vortrag</A> von
Susan Hares, Merit Network Inc. verdeutlicht, um was es dabei geht.

<P>Angenommen, es wird an jedem Funkmodem ein Linux-PC aufgestellt und
weiterhin angenommen, dort <A HREF="gated/doc/gated.html">luft</A> ein 
<A HREF="http://www.merit.edu/~gated/doc/main.html">gated</A>, dann ist es
mglich, da jedes Vereineinsmitglied sich an jedem Modem einwhlen kann
(eben wo gerade frei ist) und sofort mit seiner festen Adresse arbeiten
kann. Ebenso ist es mglich, einen am Funkmodem angeschlossenen Rechner ohne
Umkonfiguration in eine andere Funkzelle zu bringen. berlappen sich die
Zellen, ist es auch mglich, whrend der Fahrt zu arbeiten.

<H2>Organisation</H2>

Bekanntermaen ist die vereinsinterne Organisation beschissen. Deswegen ist
es sinnvoll beim Aufbau des Funknetzes so wenig wie mglich Zentralgewalten
zu installeren. Dies kommt dem dezentralen Netzaufbau entgegen und
bekanntlich ist ja ein Netzwerk das Abbild der Organisation dahinter.

<P>Fr das Funknetz heit das ganz klar, da Eigeninitiativen gefragt sind.
Hchstens der Einkauf von Technik sollte koordiniert werden, um als
verllicher Partner dastehen zu knnen und entsprechende Konditionen
aushandeln zu knnen. Ganz besonders gilt die Forderung nach
Eigeninitiativen fr die Schulen!

<H2>Ausblick</H2>

Sollte es gelingen, den Erfurter Erfolg auch in Jena zu realisieren, so
sei jeder dazu aufgerufen kreativ zu experimentieren, was der Vereinzweck ja
ist. Wenn also jemand telefonieren will, oder Duke Nukem bers Netz spielen.
...

<P>Der angekndigte Feldtest von LynxNET (Anbieter: waveacces) wre eher
etwas fr Gera, bei denen die Landschaft besser geeiget ist. Darberhinaus
ist es mit der geringen Teilnehmerzahl in Gera vermutlich zu schwierig es
allein auf die Beine zu stellen. Ein komplettes Stadtnetz dann mit Nutzern
zu fllen, und damit zu finanzieren halte ich jedoch fr problemlos machbar.

<P>Dank der Experimentierfreude des Vereins ist abzusehen, die komplette
Technik auf den neuen Internet Adressierungs Standard <A HREF="rfc1883.txt">IPv6</A>
umzustellen.

<H1>Frage 5 : Helfen elektronische Unterschriften, Dokumentvernderungen oder
    bertragungsfehler festzustellen?</H1>

<p>Eine elektronische Unterschrift ist mehr als eine
handschriftliche Unterschrift dahingehend, da sie sowohl den Inhalt einer
Nachricht als auch die Identitt des Benutzers besttigt. Solange eine
sicherer Hashfunktion (<a href="q94.html">siehe Frage 94</a>) verwendet
wird, gibt es keine Mglichkeit eine Unterschrift von einem Dokument auf ein
anderes zu bertragen oder das Dokument zu verndern. Die kleinste nderung
im Dokument bewirkt, da der berprfungsvorgang scheitert. Deshalb
gestattet es asymmetrische Authentifizierung, die Integritt einer
unterschriebenen Datei zu berprfen. Wenn eine Unterschriftsprfung
fehlschlgt, ist es jedoch meistens schwierig herauszubekommen ob eine
versuchte Flschung oder ein bertragungsfehler vorliegt.</P>

<h3>
Question 94</A>. What is a Hash Function?
</H3>

<P>
A hash function <I>H </I>is a transformation that takes a variable-size
input <I>m</I> and returns a fixed-size string, which is called
the hash value <I>h</I> (that is, <I>h = H(m)</I>). Hash functions
with just this property have a variety of general computational
uses, but when employed in cryptography the hash functions are
usually chosen to have some additional properties.
<P>
The basic requirements for a cryptographic hash function are:
<UL>
<LI>the input can be of any length,
<LI>the output has a fixed length,
<LI><I>H(x)</I> is relatively easy to compute for any given <I>x
</I>,
<LI><I>H(x)</I> is one-way,
<LI><I>H(x)</I> is collision-free.
</UL>

<P>
A hash function <I>H </I>is said to be <I>one-way</I> if it is
hard to invert, where &quot;hard to invert&quot; means that given
a hash value <I>h</I>, it is computationally infeasible to find
some input <I>x</I> such that <I>H(x) = h</I>.
<P>
If, given a message <I>x, </I>it is computationally infeasible
<I> </I>to find a message <I>y not equal to x</I> such that <I>H(x)
= H(y)</I> then <I>H</I> is said to be a <I>weakly collision-free
</I> hash function.
<P>
A <I>strongly collision-free</I> hash function <I>H </I>is one
for which it is computationally infeasible to find any two messages
<I>x</I> and <I>y</I> such that <I>H(x) = H(y).</I> 
<P>
For more information and a particularly thorough study of hash
functions, see Preneel <a href="faqref.htm#Pre93">[Pre93]</a>.
<P>
The hash value represents concisely the longer message or document
from which it was computed; one can think of a message digest
as a &quot;digital fingerprint&quot; of the larger document. Examples
of well-known hash functions are MD2 and MD5 (<a href="q99.html">see Question 99</a>)
and SHA (<a href="q100.html">see Question 100</a>).
<P>
Perhaps the main role of a cryptographic hash function is in the
provision of digital signatures. Since hash functions are generally
faster than digital signature algorithms, it is typical to compute
the digital signature to some document by computing the signature
on the document's hash value, which is small compared to the document
itself. Additionally, a digest can be made public without revealing
the contents of the document from which it is derived. This is
important in digital timestamping (<a href="q108.html">see Question 108</a>) where, using
hash functions, one can get a document timestamped without revealing
its contents to the timestamping service.

Question 99</A>. What are MD2, MD4
and MD5?</H3>

<P>
MD2 
<a href="faqref.htm#Kal92">[Kal92]</a>, MD4 
<a href="faqref.htm#Riv91b">[Riv91b]</a>
<a href="faqref.htm#Riv92b">[Riv92b]</a>, and MD5 
<a href="faqref.htm#Riv92c">[Riv92c]</a> are message-digest
algorithms developed by Rivest. They are meant for digital signature
applications where a large message has to be &quot;compressed&quot;
in a secure manner before being signed with the private key. All
three algorithms take a message of arbitrary length and produce
a 128-bit message digest. While the structures of these algorithms
are somewhat similar, the design of MD2 is quite different from
that of MD4 and MD5 and MD2 was optimized for 8-bit machines,
whereas MD4 and MD5 were aimed at 32-bit machines. Description
and source code for the three algorithms can be found as Internet
RFCs 1319 - 1321 
<a href="faqref.htm#Kal92">[Kal92]</a> 
<a href="faqref.htm#Riv92b">[Riv92b]</a>
<a href="faqref.htm#Riv92c">[Riv92c]</a>.
<P>
MD2 was developed by Rivest in 1989. The message is first padded
so that its length in bytes is divisible by 16. A 16-byte checksum
is then appended to the message, and the hash value is computed
on this resulting message. Rogier and Chauvaud have found that
collisions for MD2 can be constructed if the calculation of the
checksum is omitted 
<a href="faqref.htm#RC95">[RC95]</a>. This is the only cryptanalytic result
known for MD2. 
<P>
MD4 was developed by Rivest in 1990. The message is padded to
ensure that its length in bits plus 448 is divisible 512. A 64-bit
binary representation of the original length of the message is
then concatenated to the message. The message is processed in
512-bit blocks in the Damg&aring;rd/Merkle iterative structure
(<a href="./q97.html">see Question 97</a>), and each block is processed in three distinct
rounds. Attacks on versions of MD4 with either the first or the
last rounds missing were developed very quickly by Den Boer and
Bosselaers 
<a href="faqref.htm#DB92">[DB92]</A> and others. Dobbertin 
<a href="faqref.htm#Dob95">[Dob95]</a> has shown how
collisions for the full version of MD4 can be found in under a
minute on a typical PC. Clearly, MD4 should now be considered
broken.
<P>
MD5 was developed by Rivest in 1991. It is basically MD4 with
&quot;safety-belts&quot; and while it is slightly slower than
MD4, it is more secure. The algorithm consists of four distinct
rounds, which have a slightly different design from that of MD4.
Message-digest size, as well as padding requirements, remains
the same. Den Boer and Bosselaers 
<a href="faqref.htm#DB94">[DB94]</A> have found pseudo-collisions
for MD5 (<a href="./q98.html">see Question 98</a>), but there are no other known cryptanalytic
results. 
<P>
Van Oorschot and Wiener 
<a href="faqref.htm#VW94">[VW94]</A> have considered a brute-force search
for collisions (<a href="./q96.html">see Question 96</a>) in hash functions, and they estimate
that a collision search machine designed specifically for MD5
(costing $10 million in 1994) could find a collision for MD5 in
24 days on average. The general techniques can be applied to other
hash functions.
<P>
More details on MD2, MD4, and MD5 can be found in 
<a href="faqref.htm#Pre93">[Pre93]</a> and
<a href="faqref.htm#Rob95c">[Rob95c]</a>.

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 3: Was ist asymmetrische Verschlsselung?</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Frage 3: Was ist asymmetrische Verschlsselung?</h1>

<p>Herkmmliche Kryptographie basiert darauf, da Sender und Empfnger einer
Nachricht den gleichen geheimen Schlssel kennen und benutzen: Der Sender
benutz den geheimen Schlssel zum Chiffrieren und der Empfnger benutzt ihn
zum Entschlsseln. Die Methode wird <em>secret-key</em> oder <em>symmetrische
Verschlsselung</em> genannt. Das Hauptproblem hierbei ist, da sich
Sender und Empfnger auf den gleichen geheimen Schlssel einigen, ohne da ihn
jemand anders zu Gesicht bekommt. Wenn sie sich an verschiedenen
geographischen Orten befinden, mssen sie einem Kurier, einer
Telefonverbindung oder einem anderen Kommunikationsmedium trauen, um die
Offenlegung des geheimen Schlssels zu verhindern. Jeder, der den Schlssel
whrend der bertragung abfangen oder mithren kann, kann danach alle
verschlsselten Nachrichten lesen, ndern, flschen oder unterschreiben,
indem er diesen Schlssel verwendet. Die Schlsselerzeugung, -bertragung und
-speicherung wird Schlsselmanagement genannt; alle Kryptosysteme mssen sich
damit befassen. Da alle Schlssel eines symmetrischen Kryptosystems geheim
bleiben mssen, haben diese Systeme oft Schwierigkeiten mit einem sicheren
Schlsselmanagement, speziell in offenen Umgebungen mit vielen Nutzern.</P>

<p>Das Konzept der <em>asymmetrischen Kryptographie</em> wurde 1976 von
Whitfield Diffie und Martin Hellman <a href="faqref.html#DH76">[DH76]</A>
vorgeschlagen, um das Schlsselmanagementproblem zu lsen. In ihrem Konzept
hat jeder Beteiligte zwei Schlssel, einen <em>ffentlichen</em> und einen
<em>Privaten</em>. Jeder ffentliche Schlssel wird verffentlicht und der
private Schlssel belibt geheim. Die Notwendigkeit eines gemeinsamen
Geheimnisses zwischen Sender und Empfnger ist damit verschwunden: Jede
Kommunikaton umfat nur ffentliche Schlssel, private Schlssel werden nie
bertragen oder geteilt. Es ist nicht lnger notwendig, einem
Kommunikationskanal hinsichtlich Abhrsicherheit zu trauen. Die einzige
Anforderung ist, da der Zuordnung zwischen ffentlichem Schlssel und Nutzer
getraut werden kann (bspw. durch ein vertrauenswrdiges Verzeichnis). Jeder,
der eine wichtige Information versenden will, chiffriert mit dem ffentlichen
Schlssel, das Chiffrat kann jedoch nur mit dem privaten Schlssel
dechiffriert werden, der sich ausschlielich in der Hand des Empfnger
befindet. Darberhinaus kann asymmetrische Kryptographie nicht nur zur
Geheimhaltung (Verschlsselung) sondern auch zur Authentifikation (digitale
Unterschriften) verwendet werden.</P>

<h2>Verschlsselung</h2>

<img align=right src="al_bob.gif">
<p>Wenn Alice eine geheime Nachricht an Bob senden will, so holt die Bobs
ffentlichen Schlssel aus einem Verzeichnis und benutzt diesen, die
Nachricht zu chiffrieren. Danach versendet sie die verschlsselte Nachricht.
Bob benutzt seinen privaten Schlssel, um die Nachricht zu dechiffrieren und
zu lesen. Kein Zuhrer kann die Nachricht entschlsseln. Jeder kann eine
verschlsselte Nachricht an Bob senden, aber nur Bob kann sie lesen. Es ist
jedoch klar, da niemand den privaten Schlssel von Bob aus dem zugehrigen
ffentlichen Schlssel gewinnen knnen darf.</p>

<h2>Elektronische Unterschriften</h2>

<p>Um eine Nachricht zu unterschreiben, berechnet Alice etwas aus der
Nachricht und ihrem privaten Schlssel. Das Ergebnis wird elektronische
Unterschrift genannt und an die Nachricht angehngt. Bob kann die
Unterschrift prfen, indem er einige Berechnungen mit der Nachricht, der
Unterschrift und dem ffentlichen Schlssel von Alice veranstaltet. Wenn das
Ergebnis einer einfachen mathematischen Gleichung gengt, so ist die
Unterschrift gltig, anderenfalls ist die Unterschrift geflscht oder die
Nachricht wurde verndert.</p>

<p>Eine gutes Buch zur Geschichte der asymmetrischen Kryptographie stammt von
Diffie <a href="faqref.html#Dif88">[Dif88]</a>.

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 9: Wie schnell ist RSA?</title>
</head>
<body>

<H1>Frage 9: Wie schnell ist RSA?</H1>

<p>Eine &quot;RSA Operation&quot; zum verschlsseln, entschlsseln,
unterschreiben oder berprfen ist im Kern nur eine modulare Potenzierung,
die durch eine Folge von modularen Multiplikationen dargestellt werden
kann.</P>

<p>Fr praktische Anwendungen wird ein kleiner ffentlicher Exponent gewhlt.
Tatschlich knnen alle Nutzer den gleichen ffentlichen Exponenten haben,
jeder mit einem anderen Modul. (Es gibt nur einige Einschrnkungen an die
Auswahl der Primfaktoren des Moduls, wenn ein fester ffentlicher Exponent
benutzt wird.) Ein kleiner ffentlicher Exponent macht die Verschlsselung
scheller als die Entschlsselung und die berprfung einer Unterschrift
schneller als das Unterschreiben. Mit den blichen Algorithmen zur modularen
Potenzierung bentigen Operationen mit dem ffentlichen Schlssel
<em>O(k<sup>2</sup>)</em> Schritte, Operationen mit dem privaten Schlssel
<em>O(k<sup>3</sup>)</em> Schritte und die Schlsselerzeugung
<em>O(k<sup>4</sup>)</em> Schritte, wobei <em>k</em> die Gre des Moduls in
Bit ist. (Die <em>O()</em> Notation gibt eine obere Schranke fr das
asymptotische Verhalten eines Algorithmusses an
<a href="faqref.html#CLR90">[CLR90]</A>.) &quot;Schnelle
Multiplikationstechniken&quot;, wie FFT basierende Algorithmen bentigen
asymptotisch weniger Schritte, jedoch werden sie seltener implementiert, da
sie deutlich komplexer und bei kleinen Schlsselgren langsamer als die
blichen Verfahren sind.</p>

<p>Es gibt viele kommerzielle Software- und Hardwareimplementationen von RSA
ebenso Ankndigungen von neueren und schelleren Chips. Auf einem 90Mhz
Pentium hat BSAFE 3.0 (<a href="q173.html">siehe Frage 173</a>) einen
Durchsatz von 21.6 Kbps mit dem privaten Schlssel mit einem 512-bit Modul
und einen Durchsatz von 7.4 Kbps mit einem 1024-bit Modul. Die schnellste
RSA Hardware <a href="faqref.html#SV93">[SV93]</a> hat einen Durchsatz von 
grer 300Kbps bei einem 512-bit Modul, das bedeutet ber 500 RSA
Operationen mit dem privaten Schlssel pro Sekunde. (In dieser Lsung ist
Platz fr zwei parallele RSA Chips <a href="faqref.html#Sha95">[Sha95]</a>,
die zusammen dann 600Kbps schaffen <a href="faqref.htm#SV93">[SV93]</a>.
Bei 970-bit Schlsseln liegt der Durchrsatz bei 185Kbps.) Es wird in diesem
Jahr ein Durchsatz von 1Mbps erwartet.</P>

<p>Zum Vergleich: DES ist sehr viel schneller als RSA. Software-DES ist
generell 100 mal schneller. Hardware-DES ist zwischen 1000 und 10000 mal
schneller, abhngig von der Implementation. Neuere RSA Implementationen
knnen sicher etwas aufholen, da sich der Markt erst entwickelt, jedoch wird

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 4: Was sind die Vor- Nachteile von asymmetrischer Verschlsselung
    im Vergleich mit symmetrischer Verschlsselung?</title>
</head>
<BODY>
<H1>Frage 4: Was sind die Vor- Nachteile von asymmetrischer Verschlsselung
    im Vergleich mit symmetrischer Verschlsselung?</H1>

<p>Der primre Vorteil von asymmetrischer Kryptographie ist die erhhte
Sicherheit und Bequemlichkeit: Private Schlssel mssen nie bertragen oder
jemanden gezeigt werden. Im Gegensatz dazu mssen bei symmetrischer
Kryptographie die geheimen Schlssel (entweder persnlich oder durch einen
Kommunikationskanal) bertragen werden, so da ein Feind die Chance hat, die
geheimen Schlssel bei der bertragung abzufangen.</p>

<p>Ein weiterer wichtiger Vorteil von asymmetrischer Kryptographie ist die
Mglichkeit der elektronischen Unterschrift. Eine Authentifikation mit
symmetrischer Kryptographie erfordert das Teilen eines Geheimnisses und
manchmal auch das Vertrauen in eine dritte Instanz. In Konsquenz kann ein
Sender ein zuvor authentifizierte Nachricht abstreiten, in dem er behauptet,
das das geteilte Geheimnis durch einen der Beteiligten kompromittiert wurde
(<a href="q113.html">siehe Frage 113</a>). Bspw. beinhaltet das Kerberos System
(<a href="q144.html">siehe Frage 144</a>) eine zentrale Datenbank, die Kopien
der geheimen Authentifizierungschlssel alle Nutzer enhlt. Ein Angriff auf
diese Datenbank gestattet Flschungen im groen Stil. Asymmetrische
Authentifizierung andererseits verhindert diese Leugnungsvariante, jeder
Nutzer hat die alleinige Verantwortlichkeit fr den Schutz seines privaten
Schlssels. Deshalb wird diese Eigenschaft der asymmetrischen
Authentifizierung auch <em>Unleugbarkeit</em> genannt.</P>

<p>Ein Nachteil der asymmetrischen Verschlsselung it die Geschwindigkeit:
Es gibt beliebte symmetrische Verschlsselungsverfahren, die deutlich
schneller als jedes momentan verfgbare asymmetrische
Verschlsselungsverfahren sind. Trotzdem kann asymmetrische Verschlsselung
mit symmetrischer Verschlsselung kombiniert werden, um das Beste aus beiden
Welten zu nutzen: Die Sicherheitsvorteile der asymmetrischen und die
Geschwindigkeitsvorteile der symmetrischen Verschlsselung. Die asymmetrische
Verschlsselung wird dazu eingesetzt, den Schlssel der symmetrischen
Verschlsselung zu chiffrieren, mit dem eine groe Menge von Dateien oder
Nachrichten chiffriert wird. Diese Hybridtechnik wird <em>digitaler
Umschlag</em> genannt (Fr RSA Verfahren
<a href="q16.html">siehe Frage 16</a>).

<p>Asymmetrische Kryptographie kann gegen Identittsangriffe empfindlich
sein, auch wenn die privaten Schlssel der Nutzer nicht verfgbar sind.
Ein erfolgreicher Angriff gegen eine Zertifikationsinstanz
(<a href="q127.html">siehe Frage 127</a>) gestattet es einem Angreifer ein
Zertifikat dieser kompromittierten Zertifikationsinstanz zur Bindung eines
beliebigen ffentlichen Schlssels an einen beliebigen Nutzernamen zu
mibruachen.</P>

<p>In einigen Fllen ist asymmetrische Kryptographie nicht notwendig und
symmetrische Kryptographie allein gengt vollauf. Dies betrifft Umgebungen in
denen eine sichere Schlsselvereinbarung mglich ist, beispielsweise durch
persnliche Treffen von Nutzern. Das umfat auch Umgebungen, in denen eine
zentrale Autoritt alle Schlssel kennt und managt, bspw. geschlossene
Bankensysteme. Da die Zentrale bereits alle Schlssel kennt, gibt es kaum
Vorteile, wenn einige nun &quot;ffentliche&quot; und andere
&quot;private&quot; Schlssel genannt werden. Ebenso ist asymmetrische
Kryptographie in Einzelnutzerumgebungen gewhnlich unntig. Bspw. zur
Chriffrierung persnlicher Dateien gengt ein symmetrisches Verfahren der
z.B. das persnliche Passwort als geheimen symmetrischen Schlssel benutzt.
Allgemein ist asymmetrische Verschlsselung fr offene Mehrnutzerumgebungen
bestens geeigent.</p>

<p>Asymmetrische Kryptographie will nicht symmetrische Kryptographie ersetzen,
sondern diese untersttzen, sicherer machen. Der erste Einsatz von
asymmetrischer Techniken war der geheime Schlsseltausch in einem
symmetrischen System <a href="faqref.html#DH76">[DH76]</A> - dies ist nach
wie vor Hauptaufgabe der asymmetrischer Kryptographie. Symmetrische
Kryptographie bleibt uerst wichtig und wird Gegenstand vieler
laufender Untersuchungen und Forschungen. Einige symmetrische Kryptosysteme
sind im Fragenkomplex der Block- und Stromchiffren nher beleuchtet.</p>

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 8: Was ist RSA?</title>
</head>
<body>

<H1>Frage 8: Was ist RSA?</H1>

<p>RSA ist ein asymmetrisches Kryptosystem, da sich zum Verschlsseln und
zur Authentifikation eignet. Es wurde 1977 von Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir und
Leonard Adleman <a href="faqref.html#RSA78">[RSA78]</A> erfunden. Es
funktioniert folgendermaen:
<UL>
  <LI>Man nehme 2 groe Primzahlen <em>p</em> und <em>q</em>.
  <LI>Bilde deren Produkt <em>n=p*q</em>, welches Modul genannt wird.
  <LI>Man whle eine Zahl <em>e</em> die kleiner als <em>n</em> und
      teilerfremd (relativ prim) zu <em>p-1</em> und <em>q-1</em> ist.
  <LI>Finde eine Zahl <em>d</em>, so da <em>(e*d)-1</em> durch
      <em>(p-1)*(q-1)</em> teilbar ist. Die Werte <em>e</em> und <em>d</em>
      werden ffentlicher und privater Exponent genannt.
  <LI>Der ffentliche Schlssel ist das Paar <em>(n,e)</em>, der private
      Schlssel ist das Paar <em>(n,d)</em>.
  <LI>Die Faktoren <em>p</em> und <em>q</em> werden sicher vernichtet oder mit
      dem privaten Schlssel zusammen aufbewahrt.
</UL>

<p>Es wird angenommen, da es schwierig ist, den privaten Exponenten <em>d</em>
aus dem ffentlichen Schlssel <em>(n,e)</em> zu berechnen. Sollte jemand
<em>n</em> in <em>p</em> und <em>q</em> faktorisieren, so kann er natrlich
<em>d</em> berechnen. Deshalb ist die Sicherheit von RSA mindestens an die
Annahme geknpft, Faktorisierung sei schwierig. Ein leichter
Faktorisierungsalgorithmus oder ein anderer funktionierender Angriff wrde
RSA &quot;brechen&quot; (<a HREF="q10.html">Siehe Frage 10</a> und
<a HREF="q46.html">Frage 46</a>).</p>

<p>Im folgenden wird beschrieben, wie man RSA zur Geheimhaltung und
Authentifizung einsetzen kann (Praktisch sieht das leicht anders aus,
<A HREF="q16.html">siege Frage 16</A> und <A HREF="q17.html">Frage 17</A>).</P>

<H2>RSA Verschlsselung</H2>

<P>Alice mchte eine Nachricht <em>m</em> an Bob
schicken. Alice erstellt den Chiffretext <em>c</em> durch modulare
Potenzierung: <em>c = m<sup>e</sup></em> mod <em>n</em>, wobei
<em>(n,e)</em> Bobs ffentlicher Schlssel ist. Sie sendet <em>c</em> an Bob.
Um dies zu dechiffrieren potenziert Bob ebenfalls: <em>c<sup>d</sup></em>
mod <em>n = (m<sup>e*d</sup></em> mod <em>n = m<sup>(p-1)*(q-1)-1</sup></em>
mod <em>n =) m</em>. (Die letzte Identitt ist ein zahlentheoretischer Satz,
nmlich die Eulersche Verallgemeinerung des kleinen Satzes von Fermat.) Da
nur Bob <em>d</em> kennt, kann nur Bob <em>c</em> entschlsseln.</P>

<H2>RSA Authentifizung</H2>

<P>Alice mchte eine Nachricht <em>m</em> an Bob unterschreiben, so da Bob
sicher sein kann, da diese Nachricht authentisch und von Alice ist. Alice
erstellt eine elektronische Unterschrift durch Potenzieren: <em>s =
m<sup>d</sup></em> mod <em>n</em>, wobei <em>(n,d)</em> der private
Schlssel von Alice ist. Sie sendet <em>m</em> und <em>s</em> an Bob. Dieser
prft die Unterschrift durch eine Potenzierung: <em>s<sup>e</sup></em> mod
<em>n</em> mu mit <em>m</em> bereinstimmen, wenn <em>(n,e)</em> Alice
ffentlicher Schlssel ist.</p>

<p>So ist Verschlsselung und Authentifizung ohne Teilung eines Geheimnisses
mglich: Jede Person hat nur die ffentlichen Schlssel der anderen und
seinen eigen privaten Schlssel. Jeder kann Nachrichten verschlsselt senden
oder Unterschriften prfen, aber nur derjenige, der den richtigen privateb
Schlssel hat, kann Nachrichten entschlsseln oder unterschreiben.</p>

<h3>Question 46. What is the Significance
of Factoring in Cryptography?</h3>

<p>Factoring is the underlying, presumably hard problem upon which several
public-key cryptosystems are based, including RSA. Factoring an RSA modulus
(<a HREF="q8.html">see Question 8</a>) would allow an attacker to figure
out the private key; thus, anyone who can factor the modulus can decrypt
messages and forge signatures. The security of RSA depends on the factoring
problem being difficult and the presence of no other types of attack. Unfortunately,
it has not been proven that factoring must be difficult, and there remains
a possibility that a quick and easy factoring method might be discovered
(<a HREF="q49.html">see Question 49</a>), although factoring researchers
consider this possibility remote. </p>

<p>Factoring large numbers takes more time than factoring smaller numbers.
This is why the size of the modulus in RSA determines how secure an actual
use of RSA is; the larger the modulus, the longer it would take an attacker
to factor, and thus the more resistant to attack the RSA modulus is. </p>

<h3>Question 49. What are the Prospects for
a Theoretical Factoring Breakthrough?</h3>

<p>Factoring is widely believed to be a difficult mathematical problem,
but it has not been proved so. Therefore, there remains a possibility that
an easy factoring algorithm will be discovered. This development, which
could seriously weaken RSA, would be highly surprising and the possibility
is considered remote by the researchers most actively engaged in factoring
research. </p>

<p>Another possibility is that someone will prove that factoring is difficult.
Such a development, while unexpected at the current state of theoretical
factoring research, would guarantee the security of RSA beyond a certain
key size. </p>

<p>Even if no breakthroughs are discovered in factoring algorithms, both
factoring and discrete logarithm problems can be solved efficiently on
a quantum computer (<a HREF="q109.html">see Question 109</a>) if one is
ever developed. </p>

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 7: Worin liegt die Bedeutung von Einwegfunktionen fr die Kryptographie?</title>
</head>
<body>

<H1>Frage 7: Worin liegt die Bedeutung von Einwegfunktionen fr die Kryptographie?</H1>

<p>Asymmetrische Kryptosysteme basieren auf einer (angenommenen)
Einwegfunktion mit Hintertr. Der ffentliche Schlssel gibt die
Informationen, welche Einwegfunktion verwendet wird, der private
Schlssel enthlt die Hintertr. Jeder, der diese Hintertr kennt, kann
die Funktion leicht in beide Richtungen berechnen, jedoch kann derjenige,
dem diese Information fehlt, die Funktion nur vorwrts berechnen.
Die Vorwrtsrichtung wird fr die Verschlsselung und
Unterschriftenprfung, die Rckwrtsrichtung fr die Entschlsselung und
das Unterschreiben bentigt.</p>

<p>In fast allen asymmetrischen Kryptosystemen entspricht die
Schlsselgre der Gre der Eingabedaten der Einwegfunktion; je grer
der Schlssel, desto grer der Unterschied in der Rechenzeit fr Hin-
und Rckrichtung (ohne Kenntnis der Hintertr). Fr eine elektronische
Unterchrift,die Jahre gltig sein soll, mu eine Einwegfunktion mit
Hintertr verwendet werden, deren Eingabedaten gro genug sind, um einen
Angreifer ohne Kentnisse der Hintertr, einige Jahre Rechenzeit fr die
Umkehrfunktion aufzubrummen.</P>

<p>Alle praktisch verwendbaren asymmetrischen Kryptosysteme basieren auf
Funktioen, von denen man glaubt, da es Einwegfunktionen sind, dieses
jedoch nicht bewiesen wurde. Das heit, da es theoretisch mglich ist,
einen Algorithmus zu finden, der die Umkehrfunktion ohne Kenntnis der
Hintertr leicht berechnen kann; das wrde jedes Kryptosystem auf dieser
Basis unsicher und nutzlos machen. Andererseits kann die weitere
Entwicklung der Computersysteme zu niedrigeren Grenzwerten bei der
Berechnung von bestimmten Umkehrfunktionen fhren, das wre ein
Meilenstein mit positiven Auswirkungen auf die Kryptographie.</P>

<h3><img align=right src="labmet.gif" alt="FAQ BANNER"></h3>
<h3>
Question 71</A>. What is DES with
Independent Subkeys?</H3>

<P>
The DES algorithm derives sixteen 48-bit subkeys, for use in each
of the 16 rounds, from the 56-bit secret key supplied by the user.
It is interesting to consider the effect of using a 768-bit key
(divided into 16 48-bit subkeys) in place of the 16 related 48-bit
keys that are generated by the key schedule in the DES algorithm.

<P>
While the use of independent subkeys would obviously vastly increase
the effort required for exhaustive key search, such a change to
the cipher would make it only moderately more secure against differential
and linear cryptanalytic attack (see <a href="q58.html">Question 58</a> and 
<a href="q59.html">Question 59</a>)
than ordinary DES. It is estimated by Biham <a href="faqref.htm#Bih95">[Bih95]</a> that 2<sup>61</sup> chosen
plaintexts are required for a differential attack on DES with
independent subkeys, while 2<sup>60</sup> known plaintexts are required for
linear cryptanalysis.

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 27: Ist DSA sicher?</title>
</head>
<body>

<H1>Frage 27: Ist DSA sicher?</H1>

DSA basiert auf der Schwierigkeit, den diskreten Logarithmus (siehe <A HREF="q52.html">Frage 52</A>)
zu berechnen und realisiert die Algorithmen von Schnorr
<a href="faqref.html#Sch90">[Sch90]</a> und ElGamal (siehe <A HREF="q29.html">Frage 29</A>)
Der Algorithmus ist generell als sicher anzusehen, wenn die Schlssellnge
hinreichend ist. DSS wurde ursprnglisch von NIST mit festen 512 bit
Schlsseln vorgeschlagen. Nach heftiger Kritik, die sich speziell auf die
langfristge Wirkung von Unterschriften bezog, hat NIST die Schlssellnge
auf 1024bit erhht.

<p>Die spezielle Ausprgung des diskreten Logarithmus Problems, die in DSA
verwendet wird, ist die Berechnung des diskreten Logarithmus in bestimmten
Untergruppen des endlichen Galoisfeldes <em>GF(p)</em> fr eine Primzahl
<em>p</em>. Dieses Problem wurde zuerst von Schnorr 1989 <a href="faqref.html#Sch90">[Sch90]</a>
fr die kryptographische Anwendung vorgeschlagen. Obwohl keine Angriffe
gegen diese Form des diskreten Logarithmus Problemes bekannt geworden sind,
knnen erst weitere Untersuchungen zu einem vollen Verstndnis der
Schwierigkeit dieses Problems fhren.

<p>Einige Forscher warnen vor der Existenz von "Hintertr"-Primzahlen in
DSA, die ein Brechen des Schlssels leicht ermglichen. Diese
"Hintertr"-Primzahlen sind verhltnismig selten, jedoch knnen sie leicht
durch eine sorgfltige Schlsselgenerierung vermieden werden <a href="faqref.html#SB93">[SB93]</a>.

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 29: Was ist das ElGamal Kryptosystem?</title>
</head>
<body>

<H1>Frage 29: Was ist das ElGamal Kryptosystem?</H1>

<P>
Das ElGamal System <a href="faqref.html#Elg85">[Elg85]</a> ist ein
asymmetrisches Kryptosystem, das auf dem diskreten Logarithmus Problem
basiert. Es enthlt sowohl Verschlsselungs- als auch
Unterschriftsalgorithmen. Der Verschlsselungsalgorithmus prinzipell mit dem
Diffie-Hellman Schlsseltausch identisch (siehe <A HREF="q24.html">Frage
24</A>).

<P>Das System wird durch eine Primzahl <em>p</em> und einer Ganzzahl
<em>g</em>, deren Potenzen modulo <em>p</em> eine groe Anzahl von Elementen
umfat (wie bei Diffie-Hellman), parametrisiert. Der private Schlssel von
Alice sei <em>a</em> und ihr ffentlicher Schlssel sei <em>y =
g<sup>a</sup> (</em>mod <em>p)</em>. Wenn nun Bob Alice eine Nachricht
<em>m</em> schicken will, so whlt er eine Zufallszahl <em>k</em> kleiner
als <em>p</em> und berechnet dann:

<P><em>y<sub>1</sub> = g<sup>k</sup> (</em>mod <em>p)</em> und
<em>y<sub>2</sub> = m </em>xor<em> (y<sup>k</sup> </em>mod <em>p)</em>, wobei

<P>
xor das bitweise ExklusivOder aka Ungleichheit bedeutet. Bob sendet <em>(y<sub>1</sub>,
y<sub>2</sub>)</em> an Alice. Nachdem diese das Chiffrat empfangen hat,
berechnet sie:

<P>
<em>m = (y<sub>1</sub><sup>a</sup> </em>mod<em> p) </em>xor<em>
y<sub>2</sub></em> .

<P>
Der ElGamal Unterschriftsalgorithmus ist dem Chiffrieralgorithmus hnlich,
bei dem ffentlicher und privater Schlssel die gleiche Form haben, jedoch
ist Verschlsselung und Unterschriftenverifizierung sowie Entschlsselung
und Untershreiben das gleiche, wie in RSA (siehe <A HREF="q8.html">Frage
8</A>). DSA (siehe <A HREF="q26.html">Frage 26</A>) basiert teilweise auf
dem ElGamal Unterschriftenalgorithmus.

<P>
Die Analyse auf Basis der besten verfgbaren Faktorisierungsalgorithmen
zeigt, da RSA und ElGamal bei gleicher Schlssellnge hnliche Sicherheit
bieten. Der Hauptnachteil von ElGamal ist die Forderung nach Zufallszahlen
und die etwas langsamere Geschwindigkeit (speziell beim Unterschreiben) Ein
anderer mglicher Nachteil von ElGamal ist, da das Chiffrat doppelt so gro
ist, wie die Nachricht selbst. Dies ist jedoch in Hybridsystemen bei der
Verschlsselung symmetrischer Schlssel vernachlssigbar.

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027632">Question 24</a>. What is Diffie-Hellman? </h3>

<p>The Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol (also called exponential key
agreement) was developed by Diffie and Hellman <a href="faqref.htm#DH76">[DH76]</A> in 1976 and published
in the ground-breaking paper &quot;New Directions in Cryptography.&quot;
The protocol allows two users to exchange a secret key over an insecure
medium without any prior secrets. </p>

<p>The protocol has two system parameters <i>p </i>and<i> g</i>. They are
both public and may be used by all the users in a system. Parameter <i>p</i>
is a prime number and parameter <i>g</i> (usually called a generator) is
an integer less than <i>p</i>, which is capable of generating every element
from 1 to <i>p-1</i> when multiplied by itself a certain number of times,
modulo the prime <i>p</i>. </p>

<p>Suppose that Alice and Bob want to agree on a shared secret key using
the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol. They proceed as follows: First,
Alice generates a random private value <i>a </i>and Bob generates a random
private value <i>b</i>. Then they derive their public values using parameters
<i>p </i>and <i>g </i>and their private values. Alice's public value is
<i>g<Sup>a</sup> </i>mod <i>p</i> and Bob's public value is <i>g<sup>b</sup> </i>mod <i>p.</i>
They then exchange their public values. Finally, Alice computes <i>k<sub>ab</sub>
</i>= (<i>g<sup>b</sup></i>)<i><sup>a</sup> </i>mod <i>p, </i>and Bob 
computes <i>k<sub>ba</sub> </i>= (<i>g<sup>a</sup></i>)<i><sup>b</sup></i>
mod <i>p</i>. Since <i>k<sub>ab</sub></i> = <i>k<sub>ba</sub></i> = <i>k</i>, Alice and Bob
now have a shared secret key <i>k</i>. </p>

<p>The protocol depends on the discrete logarithm problem for its security.
It assumes that it is computationally infeasible to calculate the shared
secret key <i>k=g<sup>ab</sup></i> mod <i>p</i> given the two public values <i>g<sup>a</sup></i>
mod <i>p </i>and <i>g<Sup>b</sup></i> mod <i>p </i>when the prime <i>p </i>is sufficiently
large. Maurer <a href="faqref.htm#Mau94">[Mau94]</a> has shown that breaking the Diffie-Hellman protocol
was equivalent to computing discrete logarithms under certain assumptions.
</p>

<p>The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is vulnerable to a <i>middleperson attack</i>.
In this attack, an opponent, Carol, intercepts Alice's public value and
sends her own public value to Bob. When Bob transmits his public value,
Carol substitutes it with her own and sends it to Alice. Carol and Alice
thus agree on one shared key and Carol and Bob agree on another shared
key. After this exchange, Carol simply decrypts any messages sent out by
Alice or Bob, and then reads and possibly modifies them before re-encrypting
with the appropriate key and transmitting them to the correct party. This
vulnerability is due to the fact that Diffie-Hellman key exchange does
not authenticate the participants. Possible solutions include the use of
digital signatures and other protocol variants (see <a HREF="q25.html">Question
25</a>). </p>

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 26: Was ist DSA und DSS?</title>
</head>

<H1>Frage 26: Was ist DSA und DSS?</H1>

<p>Der Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) wurde vom National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (siehe <A HREF="q146.html">Frage 146</A>)
im Rahmen des Digital Signature Standard (DSS) verffentlicht, der selbst
Teil des US-Regierungsprojektes Capstone (siehe <A HREF="q150.html">Frage
150</A>) ist. DSS wurde vom NIST in Zusammenarbeit mit der NSA (siehe <A
HREF="q148.html">Frage 148</A>) ausgewhlt, um einen elektronischen
Unterschriftenstandard fr die US-Behrden zu erhalten. Dieser Standard
wurde am 19. Mai 1994 verffentlicht.

<p>DSA basiert auf dem diskretem Logarithmus Problem (siehe <A
HREF="q52.html">Frage 52</A>) und benutzt die Kryptosysteme von Schnorr <A
HREF="faqref.html#Sch90">[Sch90]</A> und ElGamal (siehe <A
HREF="q29.html">Frage 29</A>). Es taugt nur zur Authentifikation. Eine
detailierte Beschreibung von DSA findet sich in 
<a href="faqref.html#NIS94b">[NIS94b]</a> oder
<a href="faqref.html#NIS92">[NIS92]</A>.

<p>Das Unterschreiben ist in DSA schneller als die Verifikation, whrend in
RSA es gewhnlich umgekehrt ist. Fr das NIST ist schnelleres Unterschreiben
von Vorteil (Chipkartenauthentifizierungen), aber viele in der Kryptographie
ttige Personen sehen die schnellere berprfung als wichtiger an.
Naccache <em>et al.</em> <a href="faqref.html#NMR94">[NMR94]</A> entwickelte
einige Techniken, die die Effizienz von DSA sowohl fr das Unterschreiben
als auch fr das Verifizieren erhht.

<p>DSA wurde seit seiner Ankndigung von der Computerindustrie kritisiert.
Die Kritik behandelte besonders einige zentrale Punkte (Diese FAQ stammt aus
dem Hause RSA ... -LD):
<UL>
  <LI>Es ist kein Schlsselaustausch mglich.
  <LI>Das zugrundeliegende Kryptosystem ist zu jung und nicht ausreichend
      erforscht, um von der Sicherheit berzeugt zu sein.
  <LI>Die berprfung von Unterschriften ist zu umstndlich.
  <LI>Die Existenz eines zweiten Unterschriftsverfahrens behindert die
      Hard- und Softwarehersteller. Die meisten haben bereits RSA lizenziert.
  <LI>Die Entwicklung von DSA war zu geheimniskrmerisch und berraschend.
      Der Einflu der NSA war zu gro.
</UL>
Andere Kritikpunkte betreffen die Vernderungen, die das NIST am
Originalvorschlag vorgenommen hat. Eine genaue Austellung der Kritikpunkte
kann unter <a href="faqref.html#NIS92">[NIS92]</A> eingesehen werden. Eine
ausfhrliche Antwort darauf findet sich in <a href="faqref.html#SB93">[SB93]</A>.

<H1>Frage 25: Wie funktioniert eine authentifizierte Diffie-Hellman
Schlsselvereinbarung?</H1>

<p>
The authenticated Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol, or Station-to-Station
(STS) protocol, was developed by Diffie, van Oorschot, and Wiener in 1992
<a href="faqref.htm#DVW92">[DVW92]</A> to defeat the middleperson attack on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement
protocol (<a href="q24.html">see Question 24</a>). The immunity is achieved by allowing the two
parties to authenticate themselves to each other by the use of digital
signatures (<a HREF="q3.html">see Question 3</a>) and public-key certificates
(<a HREF="q123.html">see Question 123</a>). </p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the basic idea is as follows: Before the protocol,
the two parties Alice and Bob each possess a public/private key pair and
a certificate for the public key. During the protocol, Alice computes a
signature on certain messages and sends Bob the public value <i>ga </i>mod
<i>p</i> together with her signature and her public-key certificate. Bob
also proceeds a in a similar way. Even though Carol is still able to intercept
messages between Alice and Bob, she cannot forge signatures without Alice's
private key and Bob's private key. Hence, the enhanced protocol defeats
the middleperson attack. </p>

Question
91. What are the Shrinking and Self-Shrinking Generators?
</H3>

<P>
The <I>shrinking generator</I> was developed by Coppersmith, Krawczyk,
and Mansour <a href="faqref.htm#CKM94">[CKM94]</A>. It is a stream cipher based on the simple
interaction between the outputs from two LFSRs (<a href="q89.html">see Question 89</a>).
The bits of one output are used to determine whether the corresponding
bits of the second output will be used as part of the overall
keystream. The shrinking generator is simple and scaleable, and
has good security properties. One drawback of the shrinking generator
is that the output rate of the keystream will not be constant
unless precautions are taken. A variant of the shrinking generator
is the <I>self-shrinking generator</I> <a href="faqref.htm#MS95a">[MS95]</A>, where instead of
using one output from one LFSR to &quot;shrink&quot; the output
of another (as in the shrinking generator), the output of a single
LFSR is used to extract bits from the same output. There are as
yet no results on the cryptanalysis of either technique.

Question 89</A>. What is a Linear
Feedback Shift Register? </H3>

<P>
<img align=bottom src="lfsr.gif">
<A NAME="_Ref345824023">Figure 7</A>. LFSR
<P>
A <I>Linear Feedback Shift Register</I> (LFSR) is a mechanism
for generating a sequence of binary bits. The register (see Figure 7)
consists of a series of cells that are set by an initialization
vector that is, most often, the secret key. The behavior of the
register is regulated by a clock and at each clocking instant,
the contents of the cells of the register are shifted right by
one position, and the exclusive-or of a subset of the cell contents
is placed in the leftmost cell. One bit of output is usually derived
during this update procedure.
<P>
LFSRs are fast and easy to implement in both hardware and software.
With a judicious choice of <I>feedback taps</I> the sequences
that are generated can have a good statistical appearance. However,
the sequences generated by single LFSRs are not secure because
a powerful mathematical framework has been developed over the
years which allows for their straightforward analysis. However,
LFSRs are useful as building blocks in more secure systems (see
<a href="q90.html">Question 90</a>, <a href="q91.html">Question 91</a>
 and <a href="q92.html">Question 92</a>).

<H3>Question
90</A>. What are Shift Register Cascades?</H3>

<P>
A <I>shift register cascade</I> is a set of LFSRs (<a HREF="q89.html">see Question 89</a>)
connected together in such a way that the behavior of one particular
LFSR depends on the behavior of the previous LFSRs in the cascade.
This dependent behavior is usually achieved by using one LFSR
to control the clock of the following LFSR. For instance one register
might be advanced by one step if the preceding register output
is 1 and advanced by two steps otherwise. Many different configurations
are possible and certain parameter choices appear to offer very
good security . For more detail, see an excellent survey article
by Gollman and Chambers <a href="faqref.htm#GC89">[GC89]</a>.

Question
92</A>. What Other Stream Ciphers Are There?</H3>

<P>
There are a vast number of alternative stream ciphers that have
been proposed in cryptographic literature as well as an equally
vast number that appear in implementations and products world-wide.
Many are based on the use of LFSRs (<a href="q89.html">see Question 89</a>) since such
ciphers tend to be more amenable to analysis and it is easier
to assess the security that they offer. 
<P>
Rueppel suggests that there are essentially four distinct approaches
to stream cipher design <a href="faqref.htm#Rue92">[Rue92]</a>. The first is termed the<I> 
information-theoretic
</I>approach as exemplified by Shannon's analysis of the one-time
pad (<a href="q93.html">see Question 93</a>). The second approach is that of <I>system-theoretic
</I>design. In essence, the cryptographer designs the cipher along
established guidelines which ensure that the cipher is resistant
to all known attacks. While there is, of course, no substantial
guarantee that future cryptanalysis will be unsuccessful, it is
this design approach that is perhaps the most common in cipher
design. The third approach is to attempt to relate the difficulty
of breaking the stream cipher (where &quot;breaking&quot; means
being able to predict the unseen keystream with a success rate
better than can be achieved by guessing) to solving some difficult
problem (see <a href="faqref.htm#BM84">[BM84]</A><a href="faqref.htm#BBS86">[BBS86]</A>). 
This <I>complexity-theoretic </I>approach
<I> </I>is very appealing, but in practice the ciphers that have
been developed tend to be rather slow and impractical. The final
approach highlighted by Rueppel is that of designing a <I>randomized
cipher</I>. Here the aim is to ensure that the cipher is resistant
to any practical amount of cryptanalytic work rather than being
secure against an unlimited amount of work, as was the aim with
Shannon's information-theoretic approach.
<P>
See Rueppel's article <a href="faqref.htm#Rue92">[Rue92]</a> or any book on contemporary cryptography
for examples of ciphers in each of these categories. More details
are also provided in RSA Laboratories Technical Report <a href="faqref.htm#Rob95b">[Rob95b]</a>.

Question 93. What is a One-time
Pad?</H3>

<P>
A <I>one-time pad</I>, sometimes called the <I>Vernam cipher</I>
<a href="faqref.htm#Ver26">[Ver26]</a>, uses a string of bits that is generated completely at
random. The keystream is the same length as the plaintext message
and the random string is combined using bitwise exclusive-or with
the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. Since the entire keystream
is random, an opponent with infinite computational resources can
only guess the plaintext if he sees the ciphertext. Such a cipher
is said to offer perfect secrecy and the analysis of the one-time
pad is seen as one of the cornerstones of modern cryptography
<a href="faqref.htm#Sha49">[Sha49]</a>.
<P>
While the one-time pad saw use during wartime, over diplomatic
channels requiring exceptionally high security, the fact that
the secret key (which can be used only once) is as long as the
message introduces severe key-management problems. While perfectly
secure, the one-time pad is impractical. 
<P>
Stream ciphers (<a href="q86.html">see Question 86</a>) were developed as an approximation
to the action of the one-time pad, and while contemporary stream
ciphers are unable to provide the satisfying theoretical security
of the one-time pad, they are at least practical.

Question
86</A>. What is a Stream Cipher?</H3>

<P>
A stream cipher is a symmetric encryption algorithm. Stream ciphers
can be designed to be exceptionally fast, much faster in fact
than any block cipher (<a href="q54.html">see Question 54</a>). While block ciphers operate
on large blocks of data, stream ciphers typically operate on smaller
units of plaintext, usually bits. The encryption of any particular
plaintext with a block cipher will result in the same ciphertext
when the same key is used. With a stream cipher, the transformation
of these smaller plaintext units will vary, depending on when
they are encountered during the encryption process.
<P>
A stream cipher generates what is called a <I>keystream </I>and
encryption is provided by combining the keystream with the plaintext,
usually with the bitwise exclusive-or operation. The generation
of the keystream can be independent of the plaintext and ciphertext
(yielding what is termed a <I>synchronous stream cipher</I>) or
it can depend on the data and its encryption (in which case the
stream cipher is said to be <I>self-synchronizing</I>). Most stream
cipher designs are for synchronous stream ciphers.
<P>
Current interest in stream ciphers is most commonly attributed
to the appealing theoretical properties of the one-time pad 
(<a href="q93.html">see
Question 93</a>), but there have been, as yet, no attempts to standardize
on any particular stream cipher proposal as has been the case
with block ciphers (<a href="q64.html">see Question 64</a>). Interestingly, certain modes
of operation of a block cipher 
(<a href="q83.html">see Question 83</a>) effectively transform
it into a keystream generator and in this way, any block cipher
can be used as a stream cipher. However, stream ciphers with a
dedicated design are likely to be much faster.
<P>
More information about stream ciphers and the various available
algorithms can be found in almost any book on contemporary cryptography
and in RSA Laboratories Technical Report <a href="faqref.htm#Rob95b">[Rob95b]</a>.

<h3>Question 64. What is DES?</h3>

<p>DES is the Data Encryption Standard, an encryption block cipher defined
and endorsed by the U.S. government in 1977 as an official standard; the
details can be found in the latest official FIPS (Federal Information Processing
Standards) publication concerning DES 
<a href="faqref.htm#NIS93b">[NIS93b]</a>. It was originally developed
at IBM. DES has been extensively studied since its publication and is the
most well-known and widely used cryptosystem in the world. </p>

<p>DES is a symmetric cryptosystem: when used for communication, both sender
and receiver must know the same secret key, which is used both to encrypt
and decrypt the message. DES can also be used for single-user encryption,
such as to store files on a hard disk in encrypted form. In a multi-user
environment, secure key distribution may be difficult; public-key cryptography
provides an ideal solution to this problem (<a href="q4.html">see Question
4</a>). </p>

<p>DES has a 64-bit block size (<a href="q54.html">see Question 54</a>)
and uses a 56-bit key during encryption. It is a 16-round Feistel cipher
(<a href="q56.html">see Question 56</a>) and was originally designed for
implementation in hardware. </p>

<p>NIST (<a href="q146.html">see Question 146</a>) has recertified DES as
an official U.S. government encryption standard every five years; DES was
last recertified in 1993, by default. NIST has indicated, however, that
it may not recertify DES again. </p>

<h3>
Question 83. What are the CFB
and OFB modes?</H3>

<P>
The Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode and the Output Feedback (OFB) mode
are two more standard modes of operation 
(<a href="q82.html">see Question 82</a>) for
a block cipher. 
<P>
In <I>CFB mode</I> (see Figure 5), the previous ciphertext block
is encrypted and the output produced is combined with the plaintext
block using exclusive-or to produce the current ciphertext block.
It is possible to define CFB mode so that it uses feedback that
is less than one full data block. An initialization vector 
(<a href="q82.html">see
Question 82</a>) or value <I>c</I>0 is used as a &quot;seed&quot;
for the process.
<P>
<img align=bottom src="cfb.gif">
Figure 5. Cipher Feedback Mode
<P>
CFB mode is as secure as the underlying cipher and plaintext patterns
are concealed in the ciphertext by the use of the exclusive-or
operation. Plaintext cannot be manipulated directly except by
the removal of blocks from the beginning or the end of the ciphertext.
With CFB mode and full feedback, when two ciphertext blocks are
identical, the outputs from the DES operation at the next step
are also identical. This allows information about plaintext blocks
to leak. When using full feedback, the speed of encryption is
identical to that of the block cipher, but the encryption process
cannot be easily parallelized.
<P>
<I>OFB mode</I> (see Figure 6) is similar to the CFB mode except
that the quantity exclusive-ored with each plaintext block is
generated independently of both the plaintext and ciphertext.
An initialization vector <I>s0</I> is used as a &quot;seed&quot;
for a sequence of data blocks<I> si</I>,, and each data block
<I>si </I>is derived from the encryption of the previous data
block <I>si-1.</I> The encryption of a plaintext block is derived
by taking the exclusive-or of the plaintext block with the relevant
data block.
<P>
<img align=bottom src="ofb.gif">
Figure 6. Output Feedback Mode
<P>
Feedback widths less than a full block are not recommended for
security 
<a href="faqref.htm#DP83">[DP83]</A>
<a href="faqref.htm#Jue83">[Jue83]</a>. OFB mode has an advantage over CFB mode
in that any bit errors that might occur during transmission are
not propagated to affect the decryption of subsequent blocks.
However, by changing the ciphertext the plaintext can easily be
manipulated. The speed of encryption is identical to that of the
block cipher. Even though the process cannot easily parallelized,
time can be saved by generating the key stream before the data
is available for encryption.

<h3>
Question 82</A>. What are the ECB
and CBC Modes?</H3>

<P>
When we use a block cipher to encrypt a message of arbitrary length,
we use techniques that are known as <I>modes of operation</I>
for the block cipher. Modes must be at least as secure and as
efficient as the underlying cipher. Modes may have properties
in addition to those inherent in the basic cipher. The standard
DES modes 
(<a href="./q66.html">see Question 66</a>) have been published in FIPS PUB 81
<a href="faqref.htm#NIS80">[NIS80]</A> and as ANSI X3.106 
<a href="faqref.htm#ANS83">[ANS83]</a>. A more general version of
the standard 
<a href="faqref.htm#ISO92b">[ISO92b]</a> generalized the four modes of DES to be
applicable to a block cipher of any block size. The standard modes
are Electronic Code Book (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher
Feedback (CFB), and Output Feedback (OFB).
<P>
In <I>ECB mode</I> (see Figure 3), each plaintext block is encrypted
independently with the block cipher.
<P>
<img align=bottom src="ecb.gif">
<br clear=all>
<A NAME="_Ref345823552">Figure 3</A>. Electronic Code Book Mode
<P>
ECB mode is as secure as the underlying block cipher. However,
plaintext patterns are not concealed. Each identical block of
plaintext gives an identical block of ciphertext. The plaintext
can be easily manipulated by removing, repeating, or interchanging
blocks. The speed of each encryption operation is identical to
that of the block cipher. ECB allows easy parallelization to yield
higher performance. Unfortunately, no processing is possible before
a block is seen (except for key setup).
<P>
In <I>CBC mode</I> (see Figure 4), each plaintext block is exclusive-ored
with previous ciphertext block, then encrypted. An <I>initialization
vector</I> or value <I>c</I>0 is used as a &quot;seed&quot; for
the process.
<P>
<img align=bottom src="cbc.gif">
<br clear=all>
<A NAME="_Ref345823605">Figure 4</A>. Cipher Block Chaining Mode
<P>
CBC mode is as secure as the underlying block cipher against standard
attacks. In addition, any patterns in the plaintext are concealed
by the exclusive-oring of the previous ciphertext block with the
plaintext block. Security of the ciphertext is enhanced as the
plaintext cannot be directly manipulated except by removal of
blocks from the beginning or the end of the ciphertext. The speed
of encryption is identical to that of the block cipher, but the
encryption process cannot be easily parallelized though the decryption
process can be parallelized.

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 47: Has Factoring Been Getting Easier?</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#DE0000" vlink="#804000" alink="#049502">

<h3><img align=right src="labmet.gif"></h3>

<h3>Question 47. Has Factoring Been Getting
Easier?</h3>

<p>Factoring has become easier over the last 15 years for two reasons:
computer hardware has become more powerful, and better factoring algorithms
have been developed. </p>

<p>Hardware improvement will continue inexorably, but it is important to
realize that <i>hardware improvements make RSA more secure, not less. </i>This
is because a hardware improvement that allows an attacker to factor a number
two digits longer than before will at the same time allow a legitimate
RSA user to use a key dozens of digits longer than before; a user can choose
a new key a dozen digits longer than the old one without any performance
slowdown, yet a factoring attack will become much more difficult. Therefore,
although the hardware improvement does help the attacker, it helps the
legitimate user much more. This general rule may fail in the sense that
factoring may take place using fast machines of the future, attacking RSA
keys of the past; in this scenario, only the attacker gets the advantage
of the hardware improvement. This consideration argues for using a larger
key size today than one might otherwise consider warranted. It also argues
for replacing one's RSA key with a longer key every few years, in order
to take advantage of the extra security offered by hardware improvements.
This point holds for other public-key systems as well. </p>

<p>Better factoring algorithms have been more help to the RSA attacker
than have hardware improvements. As the RSA system and cryptography in
general have attracted much attention, so has the factoring problem, and
many researchers have found new factoring methods or improved upon others.
This has made factoring easier for numbers of any size, irrespective of
the speed of the hardware. However, factoring is still a very difficult
problem. </p>

<p>Overall, any recent decrease in security due to algorithm improvement
can be offset by increasing the key size. In fact, between general computer
hardware improvements and special-purpose RSA hardware improvements, increases
in key size (maintaining a constant speed of RSA operations) have kept
pace or exceeded increases in algorithm efficiency, resulting in no net
loss of security. As long as hardware continues to improve at a faster
rate than the rate at which the complexity of factoring algorithms decreases,
the security of RSA will increase, assuming RSA users regularly increase
their key sizes by appropriate amounts. The open question is how much faster
factoring algorithms can get; there could be some intrinsic limit to factoring
speed, but this limit remains unknown. </p>

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 39: What is a Blind Signature Scheme?</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#DE0000" vlink="#804000" alink="#049502">

<h3><img align=right src="labmet.gif"></h3>

<h3>Question 39. What is a Blind Signature
Scheme?</h3>

<p><i>Blind signature schemes</i>, first introduced by Chaum 
<a href="faqref.htm#Cha83">[Cha83]</a><a href="faqref.htm#Cha85">[Cha85]</a>,
allow a person to get a message signed by another party without revealing
any information about the message to the other party. </p>

<p>Chaum demonstrated the implementation of this concept using RSA signatures
(<a HREF="q8.html">see Question 8</a>) as follows: Suppose Alice has a message
<i>m</i> that she wishes to have signed by Bob, and she does not want Bob
to learn anything about <i>m</i>. Let <i>(n,e)</i> be Bob's public key
and <i>(n,d)</i> be his private key. Alice generates a random value <i>r</i>
such that <i>gcd</i>(<i>r</i>, <i>n</i>) = 1 and sends </p>
<center>
<img align=center src="q39_a.gif">
</center>
<p>to Bob. The value <i>m</i>' is &quot;blinded&quot; by the random value
<i>r</i>, and hence Bob can derive no useful information from it. Bob returns
the signed value, </p>
<center>
<img align=center src="q39_b.gif">
</center>
<p>to Alice. Since <i>s</i>'<i>=rmd</i> mod <i>n</i>, Alice can obtain
the true signature <i>s </i>of <i>m </i>by computing </p>
<center>
<img align=center src="q39_c.gif">
</center>
<p>Now Alice's message has a signature she could not have obtained on her
own. This signature scheme is secure provided that factoring and root extraction
remain difficult. However, regardless of the status of these problems the
signature scheme is unconditionally &quot;blind&quot; since <i>r</i> is
random. The random <i>r</i> does not allow the signer to learn about the
message even if the signer can solve the underlying hard problems. </p>

<p>There are potential problems if Alice can give an arbitrary message
to be signed, since this effectively enables her to mount a chosen message
attack. One way of thwarting this kind of attack is described in 
<a href="faqref.htm#CFN88">[CFN88]</A>.
</p>

<p>Blind signatures have numerous uses including timestamping (<a HREF="q108..html">see
Question 108</a>), anonymous access control, and digital cash (<a HREF="q138..html">see
Question 138</a>). Thus it is not surprising there are now numerous variations
on the blind signature theme. Further work on blind signatures has been
carried out in recent years <a href="faqref.htm#FY94">[FY94]</A>
<a href="faqref.htm#SPC95">[SPC95]</A>. </p>

<h4><img align=right src="labmet.gif" alt="FAQ BANNER"></h4>

<h3>Question 75</A>. What is RC2?</H3>

<P>
RC2 is a variable key-size block cipher designed by Rivest for
RSA Data Security. &quot;RC&quot; stands for &quot;Ron's Code&quot;
or &quot;Rivest's Cipher.&quot; It is faster than DES and is designed
as a &quot;drop-in&quot; replacement for DES (<A HREF="q64.html">see Question 64</a>).
It can be made more secure or less secure than DES against exhaustive
key search by using appropriate key sizes. It has a block size
of 64 bits and is about two to three times faster than DES in
software. The algorithm is confidential and proprietary to RSA
Data Security. RC2 can be used in the same modes as DES (<a href="./q66.html">see Question 66</a>).
<P>
An agreement between the Software Publishers Association (SPA)
and the United States government gives RC2 and RC4 
(<a href="q87.html">see Question 87</a>)
special status by means of which the export approval process is
simpler and quicker than the usual cryptographic export process.
However, to qualify for quick export approval a product must limit
the RC2 and RC4 key sizes to 40 bits; 56 bits is allowed for foreign
subsidiaries and overseas offices of United States companies.
An additional string (40 to 88 bits long) called a <I>salt</I>
can be used to thwart attackers who try to precompute a large
look-up table of possible encryptions. The salt is appended to
the encryption key, and this lengthened key is used to encrypt
the message; the salt is then sent, unencrypted, with the message.
RC2 and RC4 have been widely used by developers who want to export
their products; DES is almost never approved for export.

Question 87</A>. What is RC4?</H3>

<P>
RC4 is a stream cipher designed by Rivest for RSA Data Security.
It is a variable key-size stream cipher with byte-oriented operations.
The algorithm is based on the use of a random permutation and
analysis shows that the period of the cipher is overwhelmingly
likely to be greater than 10100. Eight to sixteen machine operations
are required per output byte, and the cipher can be expected to
run very quickly in software. While the algorithm is confidential
and proprietary to RSA Data Security, Inc., it has been scrutinized
under conditions of non-disclosure by independent analysts and
it is considered secure. The RC4 stream cipher has a special status
by which export from the U.S. can often be facilitated 
(<A HREF="q75.html">see Question 75</a>).

<h4><img align=right src="labmet.gif" alt="FAQ BANNER"></h4>

<h3>Question 79</A>. What is FEAL?</H3>

<P>
The Fast Data Encipherment Algorithm (FEAL) was presented by Shimizu
and Miyaguchi <a href="faqref.htm#SM88">[SM88]</A> as an alternative to DES. The original cipher
(called FEAL-4) was a four-round cryptosystem with a 64-bit block
size and a 64-bit key size and it was designed to give high performance
in software. Soon a variety of attacks against FEAL-4 were announced
including one attack that required only 20 chosen plaintexts 
<a href="faqref.htm#Mur90">[Mur90]</a>.
Several results in the cryptanalysis of FEAL-8 (eight-round version)
led the designers to introduce a revised version, FEAL-N, where
N denoted the number of rounds. Biham and Shamir 
<a href="faqref.htm#BS91b">[BS91b]</a> developed
differential cryptanalytic attacks against FEAL-N for up to 31
rounds. In 1994, Ohta and Aoki presented a linear cryptanalytic
attack against FEAL-8 that required 225 known plaintexts 
<a href="faqref.htm#OA94">[OA94]</a>,
and other improvements <a href="faqref.htm#KR95a">[KR95a]</a> followed. In the wake of these
numerous attacks, FEAL and its derivatives should be considered
insecure.

block cipher developed by Massey in 1993 for Cylink Corporation
<a href="faqref.htm#Mas93">[Mas93]</a>. It is a byte-oriented algorithm with 
a 64-bit block size
and, in one version, a 64-bit key size. It has a variable number
of rounds (maximum of 10), but a minimum of six rounds is recommended.
Unlike most recent block ciphers, SAFER has slightly different
encryption and decryption procedures. Only byte-based operations
are employed to ensure its utility in smart card-based applications
that have limited processing power. When first announced, SAFER
was intended to be implemented with a key of length 64 bits and
it was accordingly named SAFER K-64. Another version of SAFER
was designed that could handle 128-bit keys and was named SAFER
K-128.
<P>
Early cryptanalysis of SAFER K-64 <a href="faqref.htm#Mas93">[Mas93]</a> showed that SAFER K-64
could be considered immune to both differential and linear cryptanalysis
(see <a href="q58.html">Question 58</a> and <a href="q59.html">Question 59</a>) when the number of rounds is
greater than six. Knudsen <a href="faqref.htm#Knu95">[Knu95]</a> discovered a weakness in the
key schedule of SAFER K-64 and a new key schedule for the family
of SAFER ciphers soon followed. These new versions of SAFER are
denoted SAFER SK-64 and SAFER SK-128 where SK denotes a strengthened
key schedule. Most recently, a version of SAFER called SAFER SK-40
was announced, which uses a 40-bit key and has five rounds (thereby
increasing the speed of encryption). This reduced-round version
is secure against differential and linear cryptanalysis in the
sense that any such attack would require more effort than a brute-force
search for a 40-bit key.

Question
67. Should One Test for Weak Keys in DES?</H3>

<P>
DES has four weak keys <I>k</I> for which <I>E<sub>k</sub>(E<sub>k</sub>(m)) = m </I>(<a href="q60..html">see
Question 60</a>). There are also twelve semi-weak keys which come

= m</I>. 
<P>
Since there are 2<font size=-2><sup>56</sup></font> possible DES keys the chance of picking a
weak or semi-weak key at random is 2<font size=-2><sup>52</sup></font>. As long as the user-provided
key is chosen entirely at random, they can be safely ignored when
DES is used for encryption. Despite this, some users prefer to
test whether a key to be used for DES encryption is in fact a
weak key. Such a test will have no significant impact on the time
required for encryption.

<h3>Question 43</a>. What is a One-time Signature
Scheme?</h3>

<p>A <i>one-time signature scheme</i> allows the signature of only a single
message using a given piece of private (and public) information. One advantage
of such a scheme is that it is generally quite fast. However, the scheme
tends to be unwieldy when used to authenticate multiple messages because
additional data needs to be generated to both sign and verify each new
message. By contrast, with conventional signature schemes like RSA 
(<a HREF="q8.html">see
Question 8</a>), the same key pair can be used to authenticate multiple
documents. There is a relatively efficient implementation of one-time-like
signatures by Merkle called the Merkle Tree Signature Scheme 
(<a HREF="q35.html">see
Question 35</a>), which does not require new key pairs for each message.

<h3>Question 35. What is Merkle's Tree Signature
Scheme?</h3>

<p>Merkle proposed a digital signature scheme that was based on both one-time
signatures (<a HREF="q43.html">see Question 43</a>) and a hash function
(see <a HREF="q94.html">Question 94</a>) and that provides an infinite tree
of one-time signatures <a href="faqref.htm#Mer90b">[Mer90b]</a>. </p>

<p>One-time signatures normally require the publishing of large amounts
of data to authenticate many messages, since each signature can only be
used once. Merkle's scheme solves the problem by implementing the signatures
via a tree-like scheme. Each message to be signed corresponds a node in
a tree, with each node consisting of the verification parameters that are
used to sign a message and to authenticate the verification parameters
of subsequent nodes. Although the number of messages that can be signed
is limited by the size of the tree, the tree can be made arbitrarily large.
Merkle's signature scheme is fairly efficient, since it requires only the
application of hash functions. </p>

Question 95</A>. What is a birthday

<P>
A <I>birthday attack</I> is a name used to refer to a class of
brute-force attacks. It gets its name from the surprising result
that the probability that two or more people in a group of 23
share the same birthday is greater than 1/2; such a result is
called a <I>birthday paradox</I>. 
<P>
If some function, when supplied with a random input, returns one
of <I>k</I> equally-likely values, then by repeatedly evaluating
the function for different inputs, we expect to obtain the same
output after about 1.2<I>k<sup>1/2</I></sup>. For the above birthday paradox,
replace <I>k</I> with 365.
<P>
Birthday attacks are often used to find collisions of hash functions

<h3>
Question 96</A>. How does the length
of a hash value affect security?</H3>

<P>
The essential cryptographic properties of a hash function are
that it is both one-way and collision-free 
(<a href="q94.html">see Question 94</a>).
The most basic attack we might mount on a hash function is to
choose inputs to the hash function at random until either we find
some input that will give us the target output value we are looking
for (thereby contradicting the one-way property), or we find two
inputs that produce the same output (thereby contradicting the
collision-free property).
<P>
Suppose the hash function produces an <I>n</I>-bit long output.
If we are trying to find some input which will produce some target
output value <I>y</I>, then since each output is equally likely
we expect to have to try <I>2<sup>n</sup></I> possible input values. 
<P>
If we are trying to find a collision, then by the birthday paradox
(<a href="q95.html">see Question 95</a>) we would expect that after trying <I>2<sup>n/2</sup></I>
possible input values we would have some collision. Van Oorschot
and Wiener 
<a href="faqref.htm#VW94">[VW94]</A> showed how such a brute-force attack might be
implemented.
<P>
With regard to the use of hash functions in the provision of digital
signatures, Yuval 
<a href="faqref.htm#Yuv79">[Yuv79]</A> proposed the following strategy based
on the birthday paradox, where <I>n </I>is the length of the message
digest:
<UL>
<LI>Adversary selects the target message to be signed and an innocuous
message that Alice is likely to want to sign.
<LI>The adversary generates <I>2<sup>n/2</sup></I> variations of the innocuous
message (by making, for instance, minor editorial changes), all
of which convey the same meaning, and their corresponding message
digests. He then generates an equal number of variations of the
target message to be substituted.
<LI>The probability that one of the variations of the innocuous
message will match one of the variations of the target message
is greater than 1/2 according to the birthday paradox.
<LI>The adversary then obtains Alice's signature on the variation
of the innocuous message.
<LI>The signature from the innocuous message is removed and attached
to the variation of the target message that generates the same
message digest. The adversary has successfully forged the message
without discovering the enciphering keys.
</UL>

<P>
To avoid an attack that depends on brute-force methods, the output
from the hash function must be sufficiently long.

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 23: Can RSA be Exported from the  United States?</title>

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027630">Question 23. Can RSA be Exported from the
United States?</a></h3>

<p>Export of RSA falls under the same U.S. laws as all other cryptographic
products. </p>

<p>RSA used for authentication is more easily exported than when it is
used for privacy. In the former case, export is allowed regardless of key
(modulus) size, although the exporter must demonstrate that the product
cannot be easily converted to use for encryption. In the case of RSA used
for privacy (encryption), the U.S. government generally does not allow
export if the key size exceeds 512 bits. </p>

<p>Export policy is currently a subject of debate, and the export status
of RSA may well change in the next year or two. For example, a Commerce
Jurisdiction (basically a general export license per Department of Commerce
rather than Department of State approval) has been obtained by Cybercash
for 768-bit RSA for financial transactions. </p>

<p>Regardless of U.S. export policy, RSA is available abroad in non-U.S.
products. </p>

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 31: What are Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems?</title>

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027641"><img align=right src="labmet.gif"></a></h3>

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027641">Question 31</a>. What are Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems?</h3>

<p><i>Elliptic curve cryptosystems</i> <a href="faqref.htm#Mil86">[Mil86]</a>
<a href="faqref.htm#Kob87">[Kob87]</a> are analogs of public-key
cryptosystems such as RSA (<a HREF="q8.html">see Question 8</a>) and ElGamal
(see <a HREF="q29.html">Question 29</a>), in which modular multiplication
is replaced by the elliptic curve addition operation. </p>

<p>The curves used in elliptic curve analogs of discrete logarithm cryptosystems
are normally of the form </p>

<p><i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> + <i>ax</i> + <i>b</i> (mod <i>p</i>), </p>

<p>where <i>p</i> is prime. The problem tapped by the discrete logarithm
analogs in elliptic curves is the elliptic curve logarithm problem, defined
as follows: given a point <i>G</i> on an elliptic curve with order <i>r
</i>(number of points on the curve) and another point <i>Y </i>on the curve,
find a unique <i>x</i> (0 <img src="more.gif"> <i>x</i> <img src="more.gif"> <i>r</i> - 1) such that <i>Y</i>
= <i>xG</i>, i.e., <i>Y</i> is the <i>x</i>th multiple of <i>G</i>. </p>

<p>Until recently, the best attacks on elliptic curve logarithm problems
were the general methods applicable to any group. The methods have a running
time of about a constant times the square root of <i>r </i>on average,
which is much slower than specialized attacks on certain types of groups.
The lack of specialized attacks means that shorter key sizes for elliptic
cryptosystems give the same security as larger keys in cryptosystems that
are based on discrete logarithm problem . However, for certain elliptic
curves, Menezes, Okamoto, and Vanstone <a href="faqref.htm#MOV90">[MOV90]</A> have been able to reduce
the elliptic logarithm problem to a discrete logarithm problem. It is possible
that algorithm development in this area will change the security of elliptic
curve discrete logarithm cryptosystems to be equivalent to that of general
discrete logarithm cryptosystems; this is an open research problem. </p>

<p>Elliptic curve analogs of RSA have been proposed, and they are based
on the difficulty of factoring, just as RSA is. The elliptic curve analogs
do not seem to offer any significant advantage over RSA, as the underlying
problem is the same and the key sizes are similar for equivalent levels
of security. Two of their purported advantages resistance to &quot;low-exponent&quot;
attacks and to signature forgery against a chosen message attack have recently
been shown not to hold (see <a href="faqref.htm#KO95">[KO95]</A> and 
<a href="faqref.htm#Kal95">[Kal95]</a>). </p>

<h3>Question 40. What is a Designated Confirmer

<p>A designated confirmer signature <a href="faqref.htm#Cha94">[Cha94]</a> strikes a balance between self-authenticating
digital signatures (<a HREF="q38.html">see Question 38</a>) and zero-knowledge

anybody to verify a signature, the latter can only convince one recipient

with the signer. A <i>designated confirmer signature </i>allows certain
designated parties to confirm the authenticity of a document without the
need for the signer's input. At the same time, without the aid of either
the signer or the designated parties, it is not possible to verify the
authenticity of a given document. Chaum developed implementations of designated

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 38: What are Special Signature Schemes?</title>
</head>

<h3><img align=right src="labmet.gif"></a></h3>

<h3>Question 38</a>. What are Special Signature
Schemes?</h3>

<p>Since the time Diffie and Hellman introduced the concept of digital
signatures (<a HREF="q3.html">see Question 3</a>), many signature schemes
have been proposed in cryptographic literature. These schemes can be categorized
as either conventional digital signature schemes (e.g., RSA, DSA) or special
signature schemes depending on their security features. </p>

<p>In a <i>conventional signature scheme</i> (the original model defined
by Diffie and Hellman), we generally assume the following situation: </p>

<ul>
<li>The signer knows the contents of the message that he has signed. </li>

<li>Anyone who knows the public key of the signer can verify the correctness
of the signature at any time without any consent or input from the signer.
(Digital signature schemes with this property are called <i>self-authenticating
signature schemes</i>.) </li>

<li>The security of the signature schemes (i.e., hard to forge, non-repudiation,
<a HREF="q3.html">see Question 3</a>) is based on certain complexity-theoretic
assumptions. </li>
</ul>

<p>In some situations, it may be better to relax some of these assumptions,
and/or add certain special security features. For example, when Alice asks
Bob to sign a certain message, she may not want him to know the contents
of the message. In the past decade, a variety of special signature schemes
have been developed to fit security needs in different applications. More
examples of such special schemes are given in <a HREF="q39.html">Question
39</a> through <a HREF="q44.html">Question 44</a> in alphabetic order. </p>

<h3>Question 44. What is an Undeniable Signature
Scheme?</h3>

<p><i>Undeniable signature scheme</i>, devised by Chaum and van Antwerpen
<a href="faqref.htm#CV90">[CV90]</A><a href="faqref.htm#CV92">[CV92]</A>, are 
non-self-authenticating signature schemes (<a HREF="q38.html">see
Question 38</a>), where signatures can only be verified with the signer's
consent. However, if a signature is only verifiable with the aid of a signer,
a dishonest signer may refuse to authenticate a genuine document. Undeniable
signatures solve this problem by adding a new component called the <i>disavowal
protocol</i> in addition to the normal components of signature and verification.
</p>

<p>The scheme is implemented using public-key cryptography based on the
discrete logarithm problem (<a HREF="q52.html">see Question 52</a>). The
signature part of the scheme is similar to other discrete logarithm signature
schemes. Verification is carried out by a challenge-response protocol where
the verifier, Alice, sends a challenge to the signer, Bob, and views the
answer to verify the signature. The disavowal process is similar; Alice
sends a challenge and Bob's response shows that a signature is not his.
(If Bob does not take part, it may be assumed that the document is authentic.)
The probability that a dishonest signer is able to successfully mislead
the verifier in either verification or disavowal is 1/<i>p</i> where <i>p</i>
is the prime number in the signer's private key. If we consider the average
768-bit private key, there is only a minuscule probability that the signer
will be able to repudiate a document he has signed. </p>

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 32: What  are Knapsack Cryptosystems?</title>

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027642">Question 32</a>. What are Knapsack Cryptosystems?</h3>

<p>The Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem 
<a href="faqref.htm#MH78">[MH78]</A> is a public-key cryptosystem
that was first published in 1978. It is commonly referred to as the <i>knapsack
cryptosystem</i>. It is based on the subset sum problem in combinatorics.
The problem involves selecting a number of objects with given weights from
a large set such that the sum of the weights is equal to a pre-specified
weight. This is considered to be a difficult problem to solve in general,
but certain special cases of the problem are relatively easy to solve,
which serve as the &quot;trapdoor&quot; of the system. The-single iteration
knapsack cryptosystem introduced in 1978 was broken by Shamir 
<a href="faqref.htm#Sha84">[Sha84]</a>.
Merkle then published the multiple-iteration knapsack problem which was
broken by Brickell <a href="faqref.htm#Bri85">[Bri85]</a>. Merkle offered a $100 reward for anybody able
to crack the single iteration knapsack and a $1000 reward for anybody able
to crack the multiple iteration cipher from his own pocket. When they were
cracked, he promptly paid up. </p>

<p>The Chor-Rivest knapsack cryptosystem was first published in 1984, followed
by a revised version in 1988 <a href="faqref.htm#CR88">[CR88]</A>. It is the only knapsack-like cryptosystem
that does not use modular multiplication. It was also the only knapsack-like
cryptosystem that was secure for any extended period of time. Unfortunately,
Schnorr and H&ouml;rner <a href="faqref.htm#SH95">[SH95]</a> developed an attack on the Chor-Rivest cryptosystem
using improved lattice reduction which reduced to hours the amount of time
needed to crack the cryptosystem for certain parameter values (though not
for those recommended by Chor and Rivest). They also showed how the attack
can be extended to attack Damg&aring;rd's knapsack hash function 
<a href="faqref.htm#Dam90">[Dam90]</a>.

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 78: What is Skipjack?</title>

<h3>
Question 80</A>. What is Skipjack?
</H3>

<P>
Skipjack is the encryption algorithm contained in the Clipper
chip (<a href="q151.html">see Question 151</a>), and it was designed by 
the NSA (<a href="q148.html">see Question 148</a>).
It uses an 80-bit key to encrypt 64-bit blocks of data. Skipjack
can be more secure than DES 
(<a href="q64.html">see Question 64</a>), since it uses 80-bit
keys and scrambles the data for 32 steps, or &quot;rounds&quot;;
by contrast, DES uses 56-bit keys and scrambles the data for only
16 rounds.
<P>
The details of Skipjack are classified. The decision not to make
the details of the algorithm publicly available has been widely
criticized. Many people are suspicious that Skipjack is not secure,
either due to oversight by its designers, or by the deliberate
introduction of a secret trapdoor. By contrast, there have been
many attempts to find weaknesses in DES over the years, since
its details are public. These numerous attempts (and the fact
that they have failed) have made people confident in the security
of DES. Since Skipjack is not public, the same scrutiny cannot
be applied towards it, and thus a corresponding level of confidence
may not arise. 
<P>
Aware of such criticism, the government invited a small group
of independent cryptographers to examine the Skipjack algorithm.
They issued a report <a href="faqref.htm#BDK93">[BDK93]</A> which stated that, although their
study was too limited to reach a definitive conclusion, they nevertheless
believed that Skipjack was secure.
<P>
Another consequence of Skipjack's classified status is that it
cannot be implemented in software, but only in hardware by government-authorized
chip manufacturers. An algorithm called S1 was anonymously posted
over the Internet in summer 1995, and it was claimed that S1 was
the Skipjack algorithm. It is believed, however, to be a hoax.

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 36: What is Probabilistic Encryption?</title>

<h3>Question 36. What is Probabilistic Encryption?</h3>

<p>Probabilistic encryption, discovered by Goldwasser and Micali 
<a href="faqref.htm#GM84">[GM84]</A>,
is a design approach for encryption where a message is encrypted into one
of many possible ciphertexts (not just a single ciphertext as in deterministic
encryption), in such a way that it is provably as hard to obtain partial
information about the message from the ciphertext, as it is to solve some
hard problem. In previous approaches to encryption, even though it was
not always known whether one could obtain such partial information, neither
was it proved that one could not do so. </p>

<p>A particular example of probabilistic encryption given by Goldwasser
and Micali operates on &quot;bits&quot; rather than &quot;blocks&quot;
and is based on the <i>quadratic residuosity problem</i>. The problem is
to find whether an integer <i>x</i> is a square modulo a composite integer
<i>n</i>. (This is easy if the factors of <i>n</i> are known, but presumably
hard if they are not.) In their example, a &quot;0&quot; bit is encrypted
as a random square, and a &quot;1&quot; bit as a non-square; thus it is
as hard to decrypt as it is to solve the quadratic residuosity problem.
The scheme has substantial message expansion due to the bit-by-bit encryption
of the message. Blum and Goldwasser later proposed an efficient probabilistic
encryption scheme with minimal message expansion <a href="faqref.htm#BG85">[BG85]</A>. </p>

</H4>

<P>
For some time it has been common practice to protect and transport
a key for DES encryption with triple-DES. This means that the
plaintext is, in effect, encrypted three times. There are, of
course. a variety of ways of doing this; we will explore these
ways below. See <a href="q85.html">Question 85</a> for a discussion of multiple encryption
in general.
<P>
A number of modes of triple-encryption have been proposed:
<UL>
<LI>DES-EEE3: Three DES encryptions with three different keys.
<LI>DES-EDE3: Three DES operations in the sequence <I>encrypt-decrypt-encrypt
</I> with three different keys.
<LI>DES-EEE2 and DES-EDE2: Same the previous formats except that
the first and third operations use the same key.
</UL>

<P>
Attacks on two-key triple-DES have been proposed by Merkle and
Hellman <a href="faqref.htm#MH81">[MH81]</A> and Van Oorschot and Wiener <A HREF="faqref.htm#VW91">[VW91]</A>, but the data
requirements of these attacks make them impractical. Further information
on triple-DES can be obtained from various sources 
<A HREF="faqref.htm#Bih95">[Bih95]</a><A HREF="faqref.htm#KR96">[KR96]</A>.
<P>
The use of double and triple encryption does not always provide
the additional security that might be expected. Preneel <A HREF="faqref.htm#Pre94">[Pre94]</A>
provides the following comparisons in the security of various
versions of multiple-DES and it can be seen that the most secure
form of multiple encryption is triple-DES with three <I>distinct

Question 85. What is Multiple
Encryption?</H3>

<P>
Intuitively, we might expect that by encrypting a message twice
with some block cipher, either with the same key or by using two
different keys, then we would expect the resultant encryption
to be stronger in all but some exceptional circumstances. And
by using three encryptions, we would expect to achieve a yet greater
level of security. While there are some more complicated issues
to consider (<a href="q61.html">see Question 61</a>), this is pretty much the case, and
triple-DES has been used for a considerable time as a more secure
cipher for protecting the keys used with single-DES. However,
there are some surprising results when we consider exactly how
much additional protection is provided by using double and triple
encryption.
<P>
For instance, the use of double encryption does not provide the
expected increase in security <a href="faqref.htm#MH81">[MH81]</A> when compared with the increased
implementation requirements, and it cannot be recommended as a
good alternative. Instead, triple-encryption is the point at which
multiple encryption gives substantial improvements in security.
For a more detailed consideration of the situation with DES, see
<a href="./q72.html">Question 72</a>; for more information on multiple encryption in general
see a survey article by Kaliski and Robshaw <a href="faqref.htm#KR96">[KR96]</A>.

<h3><img align=right src="labmet.gif"></h3>

<h3>Question 48. What are the Best Factoring
Methods in Use Today?</h3>

<p>Factoring is a very active field of research among mathematicians and
computer scientists; the best factoring algorithms are mentioned below
with some references and their big-<i>O</i> asymptotic efficiency. <i>O</i>
notation measures how fast an algorithm is; it gives an upper bound on
the number of operations (to order of magnitude) in terms of <i>n</i>,
the number to be factored, and <i>p</i>, a prime factor of <i>n</i>. For
textbook treatment of factoring algorithms, see 
<a href="faqref.htm#Knu81">[Knu81]</a>
<a href="faqref.htm#Kob94">[Kob94]</a>
<a href="faqref.htm#LL90">[LL90]</a>
<a href="faqref.htm#Bre89">[Bre89]</a>;
for a detailed explanation of big-<i>O</i> notation, see 
<a href="faqref.htm#CLR90">[CLR90]</A>. </p>

<p>Factoring algorithms come in two flavors, special purpose and general
purpose; the efficiency of the former depends on the unknown factors, whereas
the efficiency of the latter depends on the number to be factored. Special-purpose
algorithms are best for factoring numbers with small factors, but the numbers
used for the modulus in the RSA system do not have any small factors. Therefore,
general-purpose factoring algorithms are the more important ones in the
context of cryptographic systems and their security. </p>

<p>Special-purpose factoring algorithms include the <i>Pollard rho method</i>
<a href="./faqref.htm#Pol75">[Pol75]</a>, with expected running time <IMG SRC="q48_a.gif">, and the Pollard <i>p </i>- 1 method
<a href="./faqref.htm#Pol74">[Pol74]</a>, with running time <i>O</i>(<i>p</i>'), where <i>p</i>' is the
largest prime factor of <i>p </i>- 1. Both of these take an amount of time
that is exponential in the size of <i>p</i>, the prime factor that they
find; thus these algorithms are too slow for most factoring jobs. The <i>elliptic
curve method </i>(ECM) <a href="faqref.htm#Len87">[Len87]</a> is superior 
to these; its asymptotic running
time is <img src="q48_b.gif">. The ECM is often used in practice to find factors
of randomly generated numbers; it is not strong enough to factor a large
RSA modulus. </p>

<p>The best general-purpose factoring algorithm today is the <i>number
field sieve</i> <a href="faqref.htm#BLP94">[BLP94]</A> 
<a href="faqref.htm#BLZ94">[BLZ94]</A>, which runs in time approximately 
 0(exp(1.9223(ln <i>n</i><sup>1/3</sup> (ln ln <i>n</i><sup>2/3</sup>)). Previously, the most widely used 
general-purpose
algorithm was the <i>multiple polynomial quadratic sieve</i> (mpqs) 
<a href="faqref.htm#Sil87">[Sil87]</a>,
which has running time <img src="q48_d.gif">. This was due to initial inefficiencies
that made the number field sieve less efficient than the quadratic sieve.
Recent improvements to the number field sieve make the number field sieve
more efficient in factoring numbers larger than about 115 digits 
<a href="faqref.htm#DL95">[DL95]</a>.
RSA-129 (<a HREF="q51.html">see Question 51</a>) was factored using a variation
of the quadratic sieve method. It is now estimated that if the number field
sieve had been used, it would have taken one quarter of the time. </p>

<p>Clearly, the number field sieve will overtake the mpqs as the most widely
used factoring algorithm, as the size of the numbers being factored increases
from about 130 digits, which is the current threshold of general numbers
which can be factored, to 140 or 150 digits. A &quot;general number&quot;
is one with no special form that might make it easier to factor; RSA moduli
are created to be general numbers. Note that a 512-bit number has about
155 digits. </p>

<p>Numbers with up to 155 digits or more that have a special form can already
be factored <a href="faqref.htm#LLM93">[LLM93]</a>. The Cunningham Project 
<a href="faqref.htm#BLS88">[BLS88]</A> keeps track of the
factorizations of numbers with these special forms and maintains a &quot;10
Most Wanted&quot; list of desired factorizations. Also, a good way to survey
current factoring capability is to look at recent results of the RSA Factoring
Challenge (<a HREF="q50.html">see Question 50</a>). </p>

<h3>Question 50. What is the RSA Factoring Challenge?</h3>

<p>The RSA Factoring Challenge was started in March 1991 by RSA Data Security,
Inc. to keep abreast of the state of the art in factoring. Since its inception
well over a thousand numbers have been factored, with the factorers returning
valuable information on the methods they used to complete the factorizations.
The Factoring Challenge provides one of the largest test-beds for factoring
implementations and provides one of the largest collections of factoring
results from many different experts worldwide. In short, this vast pool
of information gives us an excellent opportunity to compare the effectiveness
of different factoring techniques as they are implemented and used in practice.
Since the Security of the RSA public-key cryptosystem relies on the inability
to factor large numbers of a special type, the cryptographic significance
of these results is self-evident. </p>

<p>The contest is administered by RSA Data Security with quarterly cash
prices. Send e-mail to <tt>&lt;<a href="mailto:challenge-info@rsa.com">challenge-info@rsa.com</a>&gt;
</tt>for more information. For an analysis of results from the factoring
challenge, see <a href="faqref.htm#FR95">[FR95]</A>. </p>

Question
84. What are the Counter and PCBC Modes?</H3>

<P>
Due to shortcomings in OFB mode (<a href="q83.html">see Question 83</a>) Diffie has proposed
<a href="faqref.htm#Bra88">[Bra88]</a> an additional mode of operation, termed the <I>counter
mode</I>. It differs from OFB mode in the way the successive data
blocks are generated for subsequent encryptions. Instead of deriving
one data block as the encryption of the previous data block, Diffie
proposed encrypting the quantity <I>i</I> + <I>IV</I> (mod 264)
for the <I>i</I>th data block, where IV is some initialization
vector.
<P>
The Propagating Cipher Block Chaining (PCBC) mode of encryption
is another mode of operation using block ciphers. It is used in
protocols such as Kerberos version 4 (<a href="q144.html">see Question 144</a>). 
The PCBC
mode of encryption has not been formally published as a federal
or national standard, and it does not have widespread general
support. The PCBC mode is a variation on the CBC mode of operation
and is designed to extend or propagate a single bit error in the
ciphertext. This allows errors in transmission to be captured
and the resultant plaintext to be rejected. The method of encryption
is given by 
<P>
<img src="q84_a.gif">

and decryption is achieved by computing

where <I>m0<img src="q84_c.gif"> c0</I> is the initialization vector.

<h3>Question 76. What is RC5?</h3>

<p>RC5 <a href="faqref.htm#Riv95">[Riv95]</a> is a fast block cipher designed by Rivest for RSA Data Security.
It is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size, a variable
key size, and a variable number of rounds. The block size can be 32, 64,
or 128 bits long. The number of rounds can range from 0 to 255. The key
can range from 0 bits to 2048 bits in size. Such built-in variability provides
flexibility in levels of security and efficiency. </p>

<p>There are three routines in RC5: <i>key expansion,</i> <i>encryption
</i>, and <i>decryption</i>. In the key-expansion routine, the user-provided
secret key is expanded to fill a key table whose size depends on the number
of rounds. The key table is then used in both encryption and decryption.
The encryption routine consists of three primitive operations: addition,
bitwise exclusive-or, and rotation. The exceptional simplicity of RC5 makes
it easy to implement and analyze. Indeed, like RSA, RC5 can be written
on the &quot;back of the envelope&quot; (except for key expansion). </p>

<p>The security of RC5 is provided by the heavy use of data-dependent rotations
and the mixture of different operations. In particular, the use of data-dependent
rotations helps defeat differential and linear cryptanalysis (see <a href="q58..html">Question
58</a> and <a href="q59.html">Question 59</a>), and Kaliski and Yin 
<a href="faqref.htm#KY95">[KY95]</A>
found that RC5 with a block size of 64 bits and 12 or more rounds provides
good security against differential and linear cryptanalysis. </p>

<p>RSA Data Security is in the process of patent application for RC5. </p>

Export of DES, either in hardware or software, is strictly regulated

government rarely approves export of DES, despite the fact that
DES is widely available overseas; financial institutions and foreign

Question 98</A>. What are pseudo-collisions?
</H3>

<P>
<I>Pseudo-collisions</I> are collisions for the compression function
(<a href="q97.html">see Question 97</a>) that lies at the heart of an iterative hash
function. While collisions for the compression function of a hash
function might be useful in constructing collisions for the hash
function itself, this is not normally the case. While pseudo-collisions
might be viewed as an unfortunate property of a hash function,
a pseudo-collision is not equivalent to a collision, and the hash
function can still be secure. MD5 (<a href="q99.html">see Question 99</a>) is an example
of a hash function for which pseudo-collisions have been discovered
and yet is still considered secure.

Damg&aring;rd and Merkle 
<a href="faqref.htm#Dam90">[Dam90]</a>
<a href="faqref.htm#Mer90a">[Mer90a]</a>
 greatly influenced cryptographic
hash function design by defining a hash function in terms of what
is called a compression function. A <I>compression function</I>
takes a fixed length input and returns a shorter, fixed-length
output. Then a hash function can be defined by means of repeated
applications of the compression function until the entire message
has been processed. In this process, a message of arbitrary length
is broken into blocks of a certain length which depends on the
compression function, and &quot;padded&quot; (for security reasons)
so that the size of the message is a multiple of the block size.
The blocks are then processed sequentially, taking as input the
result of the hash so far and the current message block, with
the final output being the hash value for the message (see Figure 8).

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 66: How Does One Use DES Securely?</title>

<p><img align=right src="labmet.gif" alt="FAQ BANNER"></p>

<h3>Question 66. How Does One Use DES Securely?</h3>

<p>When using DES, there are several practical considerations that can
affect the security of the encrypted data. One should change DES keys frequently,
in order to prevent attacks that require sustained data analysis. In a
communications context, one must also find a secure way of communicating
the DES key to both sender and receiver. Use of RSA (<a href="q8.html">see
Question 8</a>) or some other public-key technique for key management solves
both these issues: a different DES key is generated for each session, and
secure key management is provided by encrypting the DES key with the receiver's
RSA public key. RSA, in this circumstance, can be regarded as a tool for
improving the security of DES (or any other secret-key cipher). </p>

<p>If one wishes to use DES to encrypt files stored on a hard disk, it
is not feasible to frequently change the DES keys, as this would entail
decrypting and then re-encrypting all files upon each key change. Instead,
one should have a master DES key which encrypts the list of DES keys used
to encrypt the files; one can then change the master key frequently without
much effort. Alternatively the user may wish to use a dedicated file/disk
encryption program like RSA Secure (<a href="q175.html">see Question 175)</a>.
</p>

<p>Aside from the issues mentioned above, DES can be used for encryption
in several officially-defined modes (see <a href="q82.html">Question 82</a>
and <a href="q83.html">Question 83</a>), and these modes have a variety
of properties. ECB (electronic codebook) mode simply encrypts each 64-bit
block of plaintext one after another under the same 56-bit DES key. In
CBC (cipher block chaining) mode, each 64-bit plaintext block is XORed
with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted with the DES
key. Thus the encryption of each block depends on previous blocks and the
same 64-bit plaintext block can encrypt to different ciphertext depending
on its context in the overall message. CBC mode helps protect against certain
attacks, but not against exhaustive search or differential cryptanalysis.
CFB (cipher feedback) mode allows one to use DES with block lengths less
than 64 bits. Detailed descriptions of the various DES modes can be found
in 
<a href="faqref.htm#NIS80">[NIS80]</A>. </p>

<p>In practice, CBC is the most widely used mode of DES, and it is specified
in several standards. For additional security, one could use triple encryption
with CBC (<a href="q73.html">see Question 73</a>). </p>

<h3>
Question 73</A>. How does One Use
Triple-DES in CBC Mode?</H3>

<P>
Until recently, the most significant use of triple-DES 
(<a href="q72.html">see Question 72</a>)
was for the encryption of single DES keys, and there was really
no need to consider how one might implement various block cipher
modes (see <a href="q82.html">Question 82</a> and <a href="q83.html">Question 83</a>) when the block cipher
in question is actually one derived from multiple encryption.
However, as DES nears the end of its useful lifetime (<a href="./q65.html">see Question 65</a>),
more thought is being given to an increasingly widespread use
of triple-DES.
<P>
In particular, there are two obvious ways to implement the CBC
mode (<a href="q82.html">see Question 82</a>) for triple-DES. With single-DES in CBC
mode, the ciphertext is exclusive-ored with the plaintext before
encryption. With triple-DES however, we might use feedback around
all three DES operations from the ciphertext to the plaintext,
something which is called outer-CBC. Alternatively, we might run
the feedback around each individual encryption component, thereby
making, in effect, triple-(DES-CBC). This is referred to as inner-CBC,
since there are internal feedbacks that are never seen by the
cryptanalyst.
<P>
Performance-wise, there can be some advantages to use the inner-CBC
option, but research has established that outer-CBC is in fact
more secure <a href="faqref.htm#Bih95">[Bih95]</a>. Outer-CBC is the recommended way for using
triple-DES in the CBC mode.

Question

<P>
IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) <a href="faqref.htm#LMM92">[LMM92]</A> is the
second version of a block cipher designed and presented by Lai
and Massey <a href="faqref.htm#LM91a">[LM91a]</a>. It is a 64-bit iterative block cipher with
a 128-bit key and eight rounds. While the cipher is not Feistel
(<a href="q56.html">see Question 56</a>), decryption is carried out in the same manner
as encryption once the decryption subkeys have been calculated
from the encryption subkeys. The cipher structure was designed
to be easily implemented in both software and hardware, and the
security of IDEA relies on the use of three incompatible types
of arithmetic operations on 16-bit words. The speed of IDEA in
software is similar to that of DES.
<P>
One of the principles during the design of IDEA was to facilitate
analysis of its strength against differential cryptanalysis (<a href="q58.html">see
Question 58</a>); IDEA is considered to be immune from differential
cryptanalysis. In addition, no linear cryptanalytic attacks on
IDEA have been reported and there is no known algebraic weakness
in IDEA. The most significant cryptanalytic result is due to Daemen
<a href="faqref.htm#DGV94a">[DGV94]</A>. He discovered a large class of 251 weak keys 
(<A HREF="q60.html">see Question 60</a>)
for which the use of such a key during encryption could be detected
and the key recovered. However, since there are 2128 possible
keys, this result has no impact on the practical security of the
cipher for encryption. IDEA is generally considered secure and
both the cipher development and its theoretical basis have been
openly and widely discussed.

Question
69. What are the Alternatives to DES?</H3>

<P>
Over the years, various new block cipher algorithms have been
designed as alternatives to DES. One is FEAL (<a href="q79.html">see Question 79</a>),
a cipher for which numerous attacks have been discovered. IDEA
is a cipher designed by Lai and Massey that seems much more promising
(<a href="q77.html">see Question 77</a>) and two more recent designs are RC5 
(<a href="q76.html">see Question 76</a>)
and SAFER (<a href="q78.html">see Question 78</a>). In addition, the U.S. government
announced in 1993 an algorithm called Skipjack (<a href="q80.html">see Question 80</a>)
as part of its Capstone project (<a href="q150.html">see Question 150</a>). Skipjack operates
on 64-bit blocks of data, as does DES, but uses 80-bit keys, as
opposed to the 56-bit keys in DES. However, the details of Skipjack
are classified, so Skipjack is only available in hardware from
government-authorized manufacturers.
<P>
In addition to RC5, Rivest perviously developed the block cipher
RC2 (<a href="q75.html">see Question 75</a>) and the stream cipher RC4 
(<a href="q87.html">see Question 87</a>).
All three algorithms have a variable key size (so that the security
they offer can be adjusted) and all three algorithms are faster
than DES, at least in software. RC2 and RC4 have the further advantage
of special U.S. government status whereby the export approval
is simplified and expedited if the key size is limited to 40 bits.

<h3>Question 65. Has DES been Broken? </h3>

<p>No easy attack on DES has been discovered, despite the efforts of many
researchers over many years. The obvious method of attack is brute-force
exhaustive search of the key space; this takes 2<font size=-2><sup>55</sup></font> steps on average. Early
on it was suggested <a href="faqref.htm#DH77">[DH77]</A> that a rich and powerful enemy could build a
special-purpose computer capable of breaking DES by exhaustive search in
a reasonable amount of time. Later, Hellman <a href="faqref.htm#Hel80">[Hel80]</a> showed a time-memory
trade-off that allows improvement over exhaustive search if memory space
is plentiful, after an exhaustive precomputation. These ideas fostered
doubts about the security of DES. There were also accusations that the
NSA (<a href="q148.html">see Question 148</a>) had intentionally weakened
DES. Despite these suspicions, no feasible way to break DES faster than
exhaustive search (<a href="q57.html">see Question 57</a>) was discovered.
The cost of a specialized computer to perform exhaustive search (requiring
3.5 hours on average) has been estimated by Wiener at one million dollars
<a href="faqref.htm#Wie94">[Wie94]</a>. </p>

<p>The first attack on DES that is better than exhaustive search in terms
of computational requirements was announced by Biham and Shamir 
<a href="faqref.htm#BS93a">[BS93a]</a>
using a new technique known as differential cryptanalysis (<a href="./q58.html">see Question
58</a>). This attack requires the encryption of 2<font size=-2><sup>47</sup></font> chosen plaintexts (<a href="q63.html">see
Question 63</a>), that is, the plaintexts are chosen by the attacker. Although
it is a theoretical breakthrough, this attack is not practical because
of both the large data requirements and the difficulty of mounting a chosen
plaintext attack. Biham and Shamir have stated that they consider DES secure.
</p>

<p>More recently Matsui <a href="faqref.htm#Mat94">[Mat94]</a> has developed 
another attack, known as
linear cryptanalysis (<a href="q59.html">see Question 59</a>). A DES key
can be recovered by the analysis of 2<font size=-2><sup>43</sup></font> known plaintexts and the first
experimental cryptanalysis of DES was successfully achieved in an attack
requiring 50 days on 12 HP 9735 workstations. Clearly however, this attack
is still impractical. </p>

<p>The consensus is that DES, when used properly, is still secure and that
triple encryption DES (<a href="q72.html">see Question 72</a> and <a href="q85.html">Question
85</a>) is far more secure than DES. Both single and triple encryption
DES are used extensively in a wide variety of cryptographic systems. </p>

<h3>Question 41. What is a Fail-stop Signature
Scheme?</h3>

<p>A <i>fail-stop signature scheme</i> is a type of signature devised by
van Heyst and Pederson <a href="faqref.htm#VP92">[VP92]</A> to protect 
against the possibility that an
enemy may be able to forge a person's signature. It is a variation of the
one-time signature scheme (<a HREF="q43..html">see Question 43</a>), in which
only a single message can be signed and protected by a given key at a time.
The scheme is based on the discrete logarithm problem. In particular, if
an enemy can forge a signature, then the actual signer can prove that forgery
has taken place by demonstrating the solution of a supposedly hard problem.
Thus the forger's ability to solve that problem is transferred to the actual
signer. (The term &quot;fail-stop&quot; refers to the fact that a signer
can detect and stop failures, i.e., forgeries. Note that if the enemy obtains
an actual copy of the signer's private key, forgery cannot be detected.
What the scheme detects are forgeries based on cryptanalysis.) </p>

<p>LUC is a public-key cryptosystem 
<a href="faqref.htm#SS95">[SS95]</A> developed by a group of researchers
in Australia and New Zealand. The cipher implements the analogs of ElGamal
(<a href="q29.html">see Question 29</a>), Diffie-Hellman 
(<a href="q24.html">see Question 24</a>), and RSA 
(<a href="q8.html">see Question 8</a>) over Lucas sequences. LUCELG is the Lucas sequence analog of ElGamal,
while LUCDIF and LUCRSA are the Diffie-Hellman and RSA analogs. Lucas sequences
used in the cryptosystem are the general second-order linear recurrence
relation defined by </p>

<p><i>T<sub>n</sub> = PT<sub>n</i>-1</sub> - <i>QT<sub>n</i>-2</sub> </p>

<h3>Question 45</a>. What is the Factoring Problem?</h3>

<p><i>Factoring</i> is the act of splitting an integer into a set of smaller
integers (factors) which, when multiplied together, form the original integer.
For example, the factors of 15 are 3 and 5; the factoring problem is to
find 3 and 5 when given 15. Prime factorization requires splitting an integer
into factors that are prime numbers; every integer has a unique prime factorization.
Multiplying two prime integers together is easy, but as far as we know,
factoring the product is much more difficult. </p>

Question
81. What is Blowfish</A>?</H3>

<P>
Blowfish is a 64-bit block cipher developed by Schneier 
<a href="faqref.htm#Sch93">[Sch93]</a>.
It is a Feistel cipher (<a href="q56.html">see Question 56</a>) and each 
round consists
of a key-dependent permutation and a key-and-data-dependent substitution.
All operations are based on exclusive-ors and additions on 32-bit
words. The key has a variable length (with a maximum length of
448 bits) and is used to generate several subkey arrays. This
cipher was designed specifically for 32-bit machines and is significantly
faster than DES. There was an open competition for the cryptanalysis
of Blowfish supported by <I>Dr. Dobb's Journal</I> with a $1000
prize. This contest ended in April 1995 
<a href="faqref.htm#Sch95a">[Sch95a]</a> and among the
results were the discoveries of existence of certain weak keys
(<a href="q60.html">see Question 60</a>), an attack against a three-round version of
Blowfish, and a differential attack against certain variants of
Blowfish. However, Blowfish can still be considered secure, and
Schneier has invited cryptanalysts to continue investigating his
cipher.

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 37: What is the Rabin Signature Scheme?</title>
</head>

<h3><img align=right src="labmet.gif"></a></h3>

<h3>Question 37. What is the Rabin Signature
Scheme?</h3>

<p>The Rabin signature scheme <a href="faqref.htm#Rab79">[Rab79]</a> 
is a variant of the RSA signature
scheme (<a HREF="q8.html">see Question 8</a>). It has the advantage over
RSA that finding the private key and forgery are both provably as hard
as factoring. Verification is faster than signing, as with RSA signatures.
In Rabin's scheme, the public key is an integer<i> n</i> where <i>n </i>=
<i>pq</i>, and <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are prime numbers which form the private
key. The message to be signed must have a square root mod <i>n</i>; otherwise,
it has to be modified slightly. Only about 1/4 of all possible messages
have square roots mod <i>n</i>. </p>

<p>Signature: <i>s</i> = <i>m</i><sup>1/2</sup> mod <i>n</i> where <i>s</i> is the
signature </p>

<p>Verification: <i>m</i> = <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> mod <i>n</i> </p>

<p>The signature is easy to compute if the prime factors of <i>n </i>are
known, but probably difficult otherwise - anyone who can forge the signature
can also factor <i>n</i>. The provable security has the side-effect that
the prime factors can be recovered under a chosen message attack. This
attack can be countered by padding a given message with random bits or
by modifying the message randomly, at the loss of provable security. (See
<a href="faqref.htm#GMR86">[GMR86]</a> for a discussion of a way to get around the paradox between provable
security and resistance to chosen message attacks.) </p>

<h3>
Question 74</A>. What are G-DES, DESX?
</H3>

<P>
G-DES was devised by Schaumuller-Bichl to improve on the performance
of DES by defining a cipher based on DES with a larger block size,
but without an increase in the amount of computation required
<a href="faqref.htm#Sch83">[Sch83]</a>. It was claimed that G-DES was as secure as DES since
the cipher was based on DES. However, Biham and Shamir showed
that G-DES with the recommended parameter sizes is easily broken
and that any alterations of G-DES parameters that result in a
cipher faster than DES are less secure than DES 
<a href="faqref.htm#BS93b">[BS93b]</a>.
<P>
DESX, another variant of DES, is supported by RSA Data Security's
toolkits (<a href="q173.html">see Question 173</a>). The only difference between DES and
DESX is that the input plaintext is exclusive-ored with 64 bits
of key material before encryption with DES and the output is exclusive-ored
with 64 bits of either related or unrelated key material. The
security of DESX against differential and linear attack (see 
<a href="q58.html">Question 58</a> and <a href="q59.html">Question 59</a>) is equivalent to that of DES with independent
subkeys (<a href="q71.html">see Question 71</a>), while the security against exhaustive
search is greatly increased.

No, DES is not a group (<a href="q61.html">see Question 61</a>). This issue was settled
only after many years of speculation and circumstantial evidence
<a href="faqref.htm#CW93">[CW93]</A> and this result seems to imply that techniques such as

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027644">Question 34. What is the McEliece Cryptosystem?</a></h3>

<p>The McEliece cryptosystem <a href="faqref.htm#Mce78">[Mce78]</a> is 
a public-key encryption algorithm
based on algebraic coding theory. The system uses a class of error-correcting
codes, known as the Goppa codes, for which fast decoding algorithms exist.
The basic idea is to construct a Goppa code as the private key and disguise
it as a general linear code, which is the public key. The general linear
code cannot be easily decoded unless the corresponding private matrix is
known. </p>

<p>The McEliece cryptosystem has a number of drawbacks. These include large
public-key size (in excess of one megabit), substantial expansion of data,
and possibly a certain similarity to the knapsack cryptosystem. Korzhik
and Turkin <a href="faqref.htm#KT91">[KT91]</a> reported a polynomial-time attack 
on the system, but
it is not yet clear whether the attack is effective. Gabidulin, Paramonov,
and Tretjakov <a href="faqref.htm#GPT91">[GPT91]</A> proposed a modification 
of the McEliece cryptosystem
by replacing Goppa codes with a different algebraic code and claimed that
the new version was more secure than the original system. However, Gibson
<a href="faqref.htm#Gib93">[Gib93]</a> later showed that there was not 
really any advantage to the new
version. </p>

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 42: What is a Group Signature?</title>

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027653">Question 42. What is a Group Signature?</a></h3>

<p>A <i>group signature</i>, introduced by Chaum and van Heijst 
<a href="faqref.htm#CV91">[CV91]</A>,
allows any member of a group to digitally sign a document in a manner such
that a verifier can confirm that it came from the group, but does not know
which individual in the group signed the document. The protocol allows
for the identity of the signer to be discovered, in case of disputes, by
a designated group authority who has some auxiliary information. Unfortunately,
each time a member of the group signs a document, a new key pair has to
be generated for the signer. The generation of new key pairs causes the
length of both the group members' secret keys and the designated authority's
auxiliary information to grow. This tends to cause the scheme to become
unwieldy when used by a group to sign numerous messages or when used for
an extended period of time. Some improvements 
<a href="faqref.htm#CP94">[CP94]</A>
<a href="faqref.htm#CP95">[CP95]</A> have been made
in the efficiency of this scheme. </p>

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027629">Question 22. Is RSA Patented?</a></h3>

<p>RSA is patented under U.S. Patent 4,405,829, issued September 29, 1983
and held by RSA Data Security, Inc. of Redwood City, California; the patent
expires 17 years after issue, in 2000. RSA Data Security has a standard,
royalty-based licensing policy which can be modified for special circumstances.
The U.S. government can use RSA without a license because it was invented
at MIT with partial government funding. </p>

<p>In the U.S., a license is needed to &quot;make, use or sell&quot; RSA.
However, RSA Data Security usually allows free non-commercial use of RSA,
with written permission, for academic or university research purposes.
Furthermore, RSA Laboratories has made available (in the U.S. and Canada)
at no charge a collection of cryptographic routines in source code, including
the RSA algorithm; it can be used, improved and redistributed non-commercially
(see <a HREF="q174.html">Question 174</a>). </p>

   <title>Kryptographie FAQ: Frage 30: What are Elliptic Curves?</title>
</head>
<body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#DE0000" vlink="#804000" alink="#049502">

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027640"><img align=right src="labmet.gif"></a></h3>

<h3><a  NAME="_Toc349027640">Question 30. What are Elliptic Curves?</a></h3>
<p><i>Elliptic curves</i> are mathematical constructions from number theory
and algebraic geometry, which in recent years have found numerous applications
in cryptography. </p>
<p><b>Figure 1. Elliptic curve addition.</b> </p>
<img align=left src="ellip.gif">


<p>An elliptic curve can be defined over any field (e.g., real, rational,
complex). However, elliptic curves used in cryptography are mainly defined
over finite fields. An elliptic curve consists of elements (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)
satisfying the equation </p>

<p><i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> + <i>ax</i> + <i>b</i> </p>

<p>together with a single element denoted <i>O</i> called the &quot;point
at infinity,&quot; which can be visualized as the point at the top and
bottom of every vertical line. Addition of two points on a elliptic curve
is defined according to a set of simple rules (e.g., point <i>p<sub>1</sub> </i>plus
point <i>p<sub>2</sub> </i>is equal to point -<i>p<sub>3</sub> </i>in Figure 2). The addition
operation in an elliptic curve is the counterpart to modular multiplication
in common public-key cryptosystems, and multiple addition is the counterpart
to modular exponentiation. Elliptic curves are covered in more recent texts
on cryptography, including a informative text by Koblitz

<H1><A NAME=SECTION00320000000000000000> Executive Summary</A></H1>
<P>
The Merit GateDaemon Project produces <b> GateD</b>, a
modular software program which supports multiple routing protocols and 
protocol families.  The project was originally supported by the National 
Science Foundation starting in 1987.  The software was first used to 
interconnect the original NSFNet and the emerging &quot;regional&quot;networks, and 
later for connecting sites within the regional networks.  GateD is now used 
by hundreds of organizations worldwide.
<P>
Merit's goal is to provide a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; software
platform to support the latest routing protocols for the
Internet. The software provides a convenient and effective
platform for routing protocol research and development. With the
current focus in the Internet community on finding solutions to
the scaling problems attending the rapid growth of the Internet,
the need for GateD as a research and prototyping platform will
continue to increase. It is used as a de facto  reference
implementation for many routing protocols.
<P>
The GateDaemon software can be used to bootstrap and support the
production of interoperable networking products. It gives
organizations access to leading edge network research and
implementations without tremendous startup investments. The
software is tested extensively by users throughout the Internet
community before the code is released and offered in production. Because of
its widespread use both as public domain software and as the
heart of many commercial products, it is a powerful deployment
mechanism for necessary routing enhancements needed to sustain
the current growth of the Internet.
<P>
GateD software is available via the web, anonymous ftp, and gopher for
individual use. It is licensed for redistribution, free of
charge, to anyone, as long as they agree to return any
enhancements of general interest to the project for
redistribution. This approach has been overwhelmingly successful,
especially in encouraging users to contribute changes and new
protocol implementations. Contributions of protocol enhancements
and implementations are integrated into the public distribution
package. Organizations are much more willing to let their
employees make their work freely available to the Internet as a
whole, when they know that many other organizations will be doing
so as well. In fact, the transfer of technology from academia to
private industry and vice versa is well demonstrated by this
project.
<P>
The demands from the user community continue to outpace the
resources currently available to the project. Cornell created
the GateDaemon Consortium to foster and expand the development of
the GateDaemon software.  Merit began a new era of fostering this work 
in September of 1995.   Instead of adopting a licensing or
royalty fee structure, the Merit Gated Consortium will 
continue to use membership fees to augment grant and proposal
funds and provide the resources to the Internet community for the year 2000.  
Merit intends to extend the benefits of membership to provide additional
benefits such as additional test tools to aid router software
development and testing.
<P>
The consortium sponsors in-depth technical seminars on new GateD features and
capabilities. Members participate in active discussions on new
features and delivery goals with the GateD developers.
Internships and residencies are available to member organizations
who wish to send staff members to Merit  to work with the
development team. Improved communications about the project and
Consortium activities are available both in hardcopy and
electronically. In all, the Consortium invigorates and enhances
the already successful collaborations of researchers and
developers by making it easier for new organizations to
participate.
<P>
Merit shall continue to seek support from agencies or
organizations, such as NSF, whose role it is to support research,
the national information infrastructure, and the welfare of the
Internet as a whole. Membership in the Consortium is open to any
organization in any country with an interest in the Internet or
in internetwork routing protocols. Membership, while strongly
encouraged, is not a prerequisite for a redistribution license.
Corporations who wish to support specific enhancements to the
GateD code may submit separate development projects to be
considered. These projects will be evaluated on an individual
basis.
<P>
Your contribution as a member in the Consortium makes it possible
to deploy excellent routing protocol implementations available
throughout the Internet, an important benefit to operators,
developers, and users alike. GateD has proven its worth to
the community over the last several years.
The issues that must be addressed in the next four years are more
complex than ever before. The Internet will continue to
experience tremendous growth. Collaboration between industry and
research is vital to successfully address the challenges that
growth will bring. GateD is at the very heart of the solutions
that must be created.

<P>
The Cornell Gatedaemon Project produces &quot;GateD&quot; (pronounced gate-
dee), modular routing software used worldwide to interconnect
packet-switched networks. It supports multiple IP and ISO network
routing protocols. It is used by researchers, implementors, and
industry as:
<P>
<UL><LI> a platform for new network routing protocol deployment
<LI> a source of routing protocol reference implementations to
     test against
<LI> a distribution mechanism of new protocol implementations
<LI> a bootstrapping facility providing the core for the
     development of commercial products
<LI> a means of access to leading edge network research and
     development
</UL>
<P>
The GateDaemon Consortium presents a formal structure to support
and expand the current successful collaborations already in place
to develop GateD functionality.  The consortium will:
<P>
<UL><LI> improve communication about and interchange of key technologies
<LI> allow functionality needed by the community to be delivered on a more 
     timely basis
<LI> build a broader funding base for a predictable future
<LI> streamline licensing procedures
<LI> improve technology transfer between academic and industry

<P>
GateD is a modular software program consisting of core services, a
routing database, and protocol modules supporting multiple routing
protocols (RIP versions 1 and 2, DCN HELLO, OSPF version 2, EGP version
2 and BGP version 2 through 4.) GateD was first used to interconnect
the NSFNET and the emerging regional networks, and to implement
filtered routing based on policy. GateD allows the network
administrator to control import and export of routing information by
individual protocol, by source and destination autonomous system,
source and destination interface, previous hop router, and specific
destination address. The network administrator can specify a preference
level for each combination of routing information being imported by
using a flexible masking capability. Once the preference levels are
assigned, GateD makes a decision on which route to use independent of
the protocols involved.
<P>
GateD is designed to handle dynamic routing with a routing database
built from information exchanged by routing protocols.

File names referred to in this document will be noted with the <tt>
typewriter</tt> style. For instance <tt> /etc/gated.conf</tt> is the
configuration file used by <b> gated</b>. When the full path of the file
is not provided the root of the path is from the root directory of the
source code. If gated as been unpacked in <tt> /usr/local/gated</tt>, then
the file <tt> src/task.c</tt> refers to <tt> /usr/local/gated/src/task.c</tt>.
Commands which should be run from the operating system command
interpreter will be displayed in <tt> typewriter</tt> style as well. <tt>
echo &quot;Hello world&quot;</tt> will print <tt> Hello world</tt> on the screen!
<P>
As for any syntax description, keywords and special characters that the
parser expects exactly are displayed using <b> boldface</b> style.
Parameters are specifying in the <i> italic</i> style.  Parameters shown
in square brackets (`<tt> [</tt>' and `<tt> ]</tt>') are used to show optional
keywords and parameters.  The vertical bar (`<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img2.gif">') is used to
indicate between a choice of optional parameters.  Parentheses (`<tt>
(</tt>' and `<tt> )</tt>') are used to group keywords and parameters when
necessary.
<P>
For example, in the syntax description:
<P>
<PRE><TT> <b> autonomoussystem</b> <i> autonomous_system</i> [ <b> loop</b> <i> number</i> ]
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The square brackets say that the <b> loop</b> parameter is optional.  The
keywords are <b> autonomoussystem</b> and <b> loop</b>.  Since <i>
autonomous_system</i> is in the <i> variable definition</i> style, it is a
parameter that needs to be provided.
<P>
C library calls, as well as system calls will be displayed in <i> italic</i>
style.

<P>
<b> Gated</b> is a very complex system which often turns out to be a source of
frustration for the new users. The present section is an attempt to
provide a few guidelines for people not familiar with <b> gated</b> and
explains how to start with gated. Do not forget that Gated transforms
your Unix box into a Internet router, and that you must be familiar with
the IP protocol and IP routing protocols in order to design a correct and
efficient routing scheme.
<P>
The first thing to do in to install <b> gated</b> on your system if it is
not installed yet. Chapter <A HREF="node10.html#installgated">3</A> explains where to get gated,
how to build and install it. It also lists advices for some operating
system.
<P>
Then the configuration of <b> gated</b> is the next step. <b> gated</b>
relies on a configuration file (usually <tt> /etc/gated.conf</tt>) to tell
it what to do. Since <b> gated</b> runs routing protocols and transforms
you Unix system into a router, its configuration parameters can be very
complex. Chapter <A HREF="node15.html#configgated">4</A> details the syntax and semantic of a
configuration file. This chapter is very long due to the numerous
protocols and features <b> gated</b> can support. You may not need to
read the whole chapter but just the introduction, the sections about
route preference, tracing, and any section about the protocols you plan
to run on your router. The policy section is also very important
(section <A HREF="node19.html#routingpolicy">4.4</A>) and has applications for almost any kind
of configuration.
<P>
The next stage is to start and control the execution of <b> gated</b>.
<b> gated</b> command line syntax and options, and the tool to control <b>
gated</b> (start, stop, reconfigure) are explained in
chapter <A HREF="node45.html#operation">5</A>. This chapter also presents some tools to
monitor the RIP and OSPF protocol operations.
<P>
If something goes wrong at any time of this process, or if gated is not
behaving as you planed, chapter <A HREF="node52.html#faq">6</A> tries to solve the most common
problems people can experience when using gated. It won't give you
all the answers to your questions but provides good leading tracks to solve
your problems. Also note that section <A HREF="node44.html#configexample">4.29</A> lists a few
most common configuration files, which illustrate the use of the different
statements in the configuration file. Some standard router setups are
presented there and can be used for a base to your configuration.
<P>
People using gated can also join a few mailing lists. The gated consortium
official lists are <tt> gated-people@gated.merit.edu</tt> for general question
about <b> gated</b> and <tt> gated-alpha@gated.merit.edu</tt> for questions about
the alpha release of <b> gated</b>. The developers and technical people can also
be reached on <tt> gated@gated.merit.edu</tt> or <tt> gated-bugs@gated.merit.edu</tt>
for bug reports.
<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node53.html#developer">7</A> is reserved for the <b> gated</b> developers or anyone
involved in porting a new protocol into <b> gated</b>. It details some
of the basic <b> gated</b> internal mechanisms.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Hawaii is...</FONT></P>

<P>A great place to take pictures... to live... to visit ...to play and
enjoy life. We have turtles and dolphins... sunsets and great hiking trails.
We have moonlit beaches and rare native birds only found in these islands.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">So here are the visions of this place Hawaii. It
is home for many of us... it is a nourishing center of life floating in
the middle of the pacific... it is our home. We invite you to come and be
in the heart of this land and experience for yourself the message it will
bring to you.</FONT></P>

         terms to describe the act of 'celebration' than the Hawaiian

The HMAUS web pages were advertised in

THINGS TO DO WITH OUR LOGO
</B>
</font>
<P><FONT FACE="palatino,times" size=3>

Recently, I've been receiving several requests for HMAUS t-shirts and mugs. Do they know something
I don't?
<p>
One of the things HMAUS will be pushing into action in 1997 is our line of promotional products
displaying
the now-famous pineapple. In the mainland and around the world, collecting merchandise from
different user groups is a popular trend. And, because we're located in Hawaii, our products
would be even more valuable!
<P>
We're looking into producing several types of products: t-shirts, mouse pads, mugs, stickers,
and patches. If you know of any sources we could work with (designers, t-shirt factories, etc.),
please let <A HREF="mailto:ev@tapa.com">Eugene</A> or <A HREF="mailto:bryanv@lava.net">myself</A> know. We're in the hunt for price quotations and proposals.
We'd also like to hear from you any other promotional ideas!
<p>
And, everytime I bring up the HMAUS logo, I must thank <A HREF="mailto:melsoft@aol.com">Mel Fowler</A> for turning our yucky black
logo into a thing of beauty! If I were you, I'd take a minute and send him a personal e-mail
thanking him for what he's done for HMAUS!

<H3>Non-Working Spouses Receive a $2,000 IRA Break</H3>

<P>Spread the News! Part of the Small Business Job Protection Act that was
passed into law in August and goes into effect January 1, 1997 contains
a provision that allows non-workng spouses to contribute $2,000 per year
into an IRA. This new law defines a non-working spouse as someone who earns
less than $2,000 per year. Prior to passage of this act, non-working spouses
were allowed only a $250 contribution, so this is an eight-fold increase!</P>

<P>This new law DID NOT change the rules that prevent many families from
deducting IRA contributions. If a spouse is covered by an employer retirement
plan at work and the adjusted gross income for the two is under $40,000
there may be a full deduction for IRA contributions. However, if a spouse
is covered by an employer retirement plan and the joint adjusted gross income
is $40,000 to $50,000 there will only be a partial deduction allowed. This
is reduced until the adjusted gross income hits $50,000 and at that time
no deduction is allowed.</P>

<P>The Small Business Job Protection Act also waived the requirement that
pension benefits begin distribution at age 70 1/2 if the employee is still
working.</P>

<P>If you bought a Supra V.34 modem on or after April 1, you will get
a free upgrade, regardless of which model you have. If you have a
SupraExpress, it will require an upgrade kit that costs $10. If you
have a SupraFaxModem 28.8, enter the modem command ATI7 from a
terminal emulator. If the response includes the hexadecimal number
04BC, you'll need a hardware upgrade kit that includes a new
data-pump chip; it costs $40. But if the number is 05BA, you won't
need to pay a cent; just flash the ROM using a program to posted on
Supra's Web site
(<A HREF="http://www.supra.com/">http://www.supra.com/</A>). The
SupraSonic will be upgradable for free via flash ROM. For the full

   <DD><B>Abstract: Mouse Balls Available as FRU (Field Replacement
   Unit)</B>
   
   <DD>Mouse balls are now available as FRU. Therefore, if a mouse
   fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a
   ball replacement. Because of the delicate nature of this
   procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by
   properly trained personnel.
   
   <DD><BR>
   
   Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining
   the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and
   harder than foreign balls. Ball removal procedures differ
   depending upon the maker of the mouse. Foreign balls can be
   replaced using the pop-off method.<BR>
   
   Domestic balls can be replaced using the twist-off method. Mouse
   balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive
   handling can result in sudden discharge.
   
   <DD><BR>
   
   Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse can be used
   immediately. It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of
   spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction, and
   that any customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel
   of removing these necessary items.
   
   <DD><BR>
   
   To re-order, specify one of the following:
   
   <DD>P/N 33F8462 - Domestic Mouse Balls
   
   <DD>P/N 33F8461 - Foreign Mouse Balls

<P>A local (Hawaii) subscriber to the AOL Internet service was
somewhat taken aback yesterday when he logged on his computer to send
an e-mail to a friend. A message came on that stated, "This service
is available from the U.S. and Canada Only." He suggests AOL might be
on line for a Statehood Recognition Award, a dubious distinction not
bestowed on any one of late, since most folks have come around to
discovering Hawaii is part of the United States. Maybe that's why
people who once subscribed to AOL before dumping it in favor of a
local Internet service provider, refer to it as "America Off Line" or
"America Outta Line"...</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>Ultimate Freedoms</FONT></P>

<P>Updated 21 July 1996</P>

<P>Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These are our rights
and freedoms guaranteed to all Americans by the Constitution of the
United States. These rights, however, do not extend to American
citizens who are terminally ill. In this section we seek to examine
the flagrant abridgement of these freedoms of citizens facing death.

<BR>

Welcome to my site on the World Wide Web. I hope you will take the
time to explore. There is a lot of good stuff here. I want support
from you for my campaign for the State Senate 12th District. That is
Makiki, Tantalus, and Ala Moana.<BR>

<BR>

I urge all voters to start judging policies and the elected officials
who support them based on the results. In Hawaii our roads, schools,
property crime rates, and business climate are among the worst in the
nation. The only power you the voter has to improve this is to vote
out incumbents. It's that simple.<BR>

<BR>

None of us can be an expert on everything. We know our own field and
hobbies, but can't be expected to have the time or ability to sort
out all the arguments advanced for or in opposition to the numerous
issues that come before the legislature. I promise to do that work
for you as best I can. I will always support the case that has the
better arguments on its side; popular or not. Many popular policies
have led to dismal failures. This is because politicians test the
winds to find and follow uniform public opinion. What they should do
is research the situation and support the best solution to the
problem.<BR>

<BR>

I will always try to stand up for the best thing, for the right
thing, for all of our people.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=CENTER>The fight against the growth of social
and economic problems that face our neighborhoods in Hawaii now
demands new and innovative solutions from legislative leaders who are
not afraid to face serious issues and solve them.<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="3"><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Consider the Advantages of Tax Favored Annuities</H2>

<P><BR>
It has been said that three things can happen to you. You can die too soon,
you can become disabled, or you can live too long. The last of these requires
that each of us make advance plans to assure sufficient funds for our retirement
years.<BR>
<BR>
Deferred annuities provide an opportunity to accumulate these funds on a
tax-favored basis. As a flexible cash accumulation vehicle, such annuities
can be purchased by either a single payment or multiple payments over a
number of years (often referred to as a modal or flexible premium annuity).
In either case, prior to the annuity starting date, the cash values of the
annuity accumulate tax-deferred, with specific contractual guarantees and
at competitive rates of interest.</P>

<H3>LIVE</H3>

<P>For the annuitant who lives to retirement, the annuity can provide a
guaranteed income for life. The actual amount of each payment will depend
upon the values which have accumulated prior to retirement and the desired
frequency of payments.</P>

<H3>DIE</H3>

<P>If the annuitant dies prior to the annuity start date, the then existing
values could be used to provide either a lump-sum payment or an ongoing
income to one or more beneficiaries. The specific amount and duration of
these payments will depend upon the particular settlement option selected.</P>

<H3>QUIT</H3>

<P>Should the annuitant decide to surrender the contract prior to the annuity
starting date, the then existing values could be taken in a lump-sum cash
payment, or applied towards a settlement option providing ongoing income
payments. Before making a decision,the tax implications of each of these
options should be carefully considered.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, it is possible that the annuitant might die after the annuity
starting date. To protect a surviving spouse, or other beneficiary, the
annuitant can elect a settlement option providing somewhat reduced annuity
payments in return for ongoing payments to a survivor. Other options are
also available:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Payments could be elected to begin prior to normal retirement age;
  </LI>
  <LI>Payments could be guaranteed for a minimum number of years; </LI>
  <LI>Payments could be elected for a fixed number of years. </LI>
</UL>

&quot;It's difficult to comprehend that Gil Amelio, while on the board of
directors of Apple, was unaware of the firm's problems and recommended no
solutions (one of the tasks of the board). Yet he was tapped to turn the
firm back from the grave. His multimillion-dollar salary was, in his words,
'What the market would bear.'&quot;

Be really careful when deleting (HTML) tags -- remove both the open and
close tags or you can make a real mess of your page, and spend a lot of
time trying to track down the offending tags. This is especially true if
you make the mistake of removing an open tag from a pair of tags and the
close tag from another pair.

Having trouble connecting at faster than 9600 with your new 14.4 or 28.8

Don't use the old one. Chances are that your old cable was not &quot;hardware
handshaking.&quot; If you need a &quot;hardware handshaking&quot; modem
cable, check out the Macintosh mail-order catalogs. Prices are about $10
plus shipping.

&quot;Although specifications have not been released, Apple and IBM executives

<H3><TT>What is ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease)? </TT></H3>
<TT>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease of the
nervous system, affecting the brain cells (motor neurons) that carry impulses
from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles. This disorder generally affects
both upper and lower motor neurons resulting in muscular weakness and the
progressive wasting of muscles that have lost their nerve supply. Degeneration
of these neurons causes muscle weakness, and muscle loss, usually starting
in the hands and arms and then spreading to other parts of the body. Difficulty
with speaking, swallowing, and breathing ensues, and death usually follows
within 3 to 5 years. Onset commonly occurs between the ages of 35 and 65,
slightly more frequently in men than in women. ALS is also called Lou Gehrig's
disease after the baseball star who died of it. There are a number of different
forms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and other motor neuron diseases with
similar symptoms. </TT>
<H3><TT>Symptoms</TT></H3>
<TT>The early symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) include slight
muscle weakness, clumsy hand movements, and/or difficulty performing tasks
that require delicate movements of the fingers and/or hands. Muscular weakness
in the legs may cause tripping and falling. People with Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis may have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and speech may be
slowed. Other symptoms of this disorder include progressive weakness of
the lips and impairment and/or loss of function of the tongue, mouth, and/or
voice box (bulbar symptoms). Leg cramps may occur during the night, most
frequently in the calf and/or thigh muscles. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
may progress quickly or slowly, and gradually additional muscles become
involved.<BR>
<BR>
Other symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis may include the uncontrolled
twitching of muscles (fasciculations), stiffness in the legs, and/or coughing.
People with this disorder may also have exaggerated deep muscle reflexes.
Severe weight loss occurs in approximately 5 percent of cases. As the ability
to move becomes progressively impaired, people with this disease are at
increased risk for respiratory failure and abnormally low levels of oxygen
in the blood (anoxia). People with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are also
at increased risk for acute inflammation of the lungs, caused by the inhalation
of food or stomach contents (aspiration pneumonia). An overall decrease
in the ability to move may also result in inadequate nutrition.<BR>
<BR>
The most common form of motor neuron disease, ALS strikes an estimated 2
to 7 out of every 100,000 persons in the United States. Research thus far
has failed to establish any definite cause, although slow-acting viruses
have been suspected and, in a small percentage of cases, a genetic link
might be involved. No specific treatment yet exists, and patients can be
aided only by supportive therapy.</TT><BR>

<H3><TT>Causes</TT></H3>
<TT>The exact cause of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is unknown. Allergic
responses, infectious and/or viral agents have been proposed as possible
causes of this disorder, but none has been proven. Approximately 5 to 10
percent of all cases of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are hereditary.<BR>
<BR>
Researchers have found the defective gene responsible for the inherited
form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The gene is inherited as an autosomal
dominant genetic trait and is located on the long arm of chromosome 21.
In the small percentage of cases that are inherited, it is not yet known
if this defective gene causes Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or predisposes
a person to this disease. A genetic predisposition means that a person may
carry a gene for a disease but it may not be expressed unless something
in the environment triggers the disease.<BR>
<BR>
In 1992 researchers at Johns Hopkins Hospital proposed that glutamate, an
amino acid responsible for carrying messages between brain cells (neurons),
may have a role in causing ALS. Glutamate in large quantities may kill neurons.
In the brain, after glutamate does its job of transmitting messages, it
is reabsorbed by a special protein called a transporter. In ALS researchers
suspect that this transporter is defective and may not absorb enough glutamate.
These studies were conducted on brain tissue donated by ALS patients who
had died. More research is needed to determine if this theory about glutamate
is accurate, and if drugs can be developed to alter the glutamate absorption
process.<BR>
<BR>
There is no difference in the symptoms of the sporadic or familial forms
of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Therefore, the discovery of the location
of this gene may benefit people with both forms of the disorder (inherited
or non-inherited).</TT><BR>

<H3><TT>Related Disorders</TT></H3>
<TT>Symptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis:<BR>
<BR>
Primary Lateral Sclerosis is a rare neurological disorder characterized
by progressive weakness of the muscles of the face, arms, and legs. The
loss of neurological function occurs slowly and results in spastic movements
of the hands, feet, and/or legs. Dragging of the feet is typically followed
by the inability to walk. Sensory function and intellectual capabilities
are generally unaffected.<BR>
<BR>
Kugelberg-Welander Syndrome (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) is a rare inherited
neurological disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of the
motor neurons. The symptoms of this disorder include progressive weakness
and loss of muscle tissue, especially in the legs and an uncoordinated gait.
This is typically accompanied by a loss of reflexes in the legs. People
with Kugelberg-Welander Syndrome may have difficulty climbing stairs and
may lose bowel control. <BR>
<BR>
Focal Motor Neuron Disease affects only one area of the body, most commonly
the shoulder girdle. The disease progresses over several months, leaving
the patient with a fixed impairment of function. Some patients later develop
more extensive motor neuron disease. If focal motor neuron disease is considered
as a diagnosis, care should be taken to exclude other causes of focal atrophy.<BR>
<BR>
Progressive Bulbar Palsy is a variant of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis characterized
by weakness and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles innervated by the cranial
nerves (i.e., lips, tongue, and voice box). Symptoms may include difficulty
speaking and swallowing.<BR>
<BR>
Progressive Muscular Atrophy is a variant of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
characterized by lower motor neuron involvement. This form of the disease
is characterized by weakness and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles of the
lower body, particularly the legs. If upper motor neuron symptoms do not
occur, usually within two years, then it is unlikely that Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis will develop.<BR>
<BR>
Pseudobulbar Palsy is a variant of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis characterized
by spastic muscle weakness and the loss of muscles that are innervated by
the cranial nerves. Typically the tongue, throat, and face are affected.
The eyes are not affected. Some people with this disorder also experience
uncontrollable laughing and/or weeping.<BR>
<BR>
Benign Focal Amyotrophy is a variant in which muscle weakness and wasting
are limited to a single limb. The early symptoms of this disorder may resemble
those of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.<BR>

<P><TT>I don't know how new this restaurant is, but my friend Jim told me
about it. He said he didn't know the name of the place, but that it was
a good place for lunch. For a downtown restaurant in Honolulu, lunch is
where the money has to be made.<BR>
<BR>
Cafe VIII 1/2 is tucked right in between Yong Sing Restaurant and the Bank
of America building on Alakea Street. It has about a dozen tables inside
and a few street side. The interior is quite plain. The waitress slaps down
a sheet of butcher paper for the table covering and later comes around to
place a baguette on it.<BR>
<BR>
Jim said they usually include balsamic vinegar, but on this occasion, it
appears that it was forgotten and only olive oil was placed on the table.
Cafe VIII 1/2 was pretty busy when we arrived at 11:45, perhaps because
it was a Friday. My client, Jim, said that the reason why this Italian restaurant
was different was because the fare had a Vietnamese bent. This piqued my
curiousity as the menu listed Italian dishes and gave no hint of anything
Vietnamese. <BR>
<BR>
Before telling you about the food, I feel compelled to make this warning.
If your intention is to conduct business over lunch, forget it. The sound
system volume settings were far too high.<BR>
<BR>
I first thought of having a sandwich and considered ordering the Salciccia,
Spadaro's sausage, bell peppers, and tomato sauce on como bread, with greens
and potatoes. I changed my mind when our waitress made the special of the
day sound enticing, rottini with Italian sausage.<BR>
<BR>
The serving size would be suitable for most lunch appetites. The rottini
was cooked just right, slightly firm, and covered with enough sauce to flavor,
but not smother it. I especially liked the sun-dried tomatoes. They added
a nice zest to the dish. This and the slightly spicy sausages rounded out
the entree to make it a pretty good lunch.<BR>
<BR>
Would I come back again? I suppose I would definitely say yes if the sound
system volume was lowered. One last thing to consider, for those who work
outside of downtown Honolulu, give yourself lots of time to find parking.
As it is I might patronize it again, only if an opportunity arose. <BR>
<BR>
The dish I had was certainly flavorful and something I might order again.
The menu doesn't list a whole lot of dishes, but they look like they would
be interesting to try. Almost half of them are designated vegetarian. As
I reflect on the experience, I find myself asking, &quot;Where was the Vietnamese?&quot;

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I>An open letter to Hemlock Hawaii members &amp;
other Terminally ill Americans</I></B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Aloha my friends,<BR>

<BR>

<B>First,</B> as a member of our Hemlock Society ohana here in
Hawaii, I write to you with an update on some of the most recent
developments within the US Court system regarding important <I>'Right
to Die' </I>issues that are presently before the U.S. Courts.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Second,</B> as an individual with an untreatable and 'terminal'
<A HREF="../ALS/index.html">neuromuscular illness</A> <I>-commonly
known as Lou Grehig's Disease</I>- I'd like to personally encourage
you to support our efforts across Hawaii to create a heightened level
of public awareness for the desperate plight of the terminally ill in
gaining our freedom and civil rights.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Today, </B>this struggle has now escalated into a war within the
US legal system for our Constitutionally guaranteed rights to 'Die
with Dignity'. Rights that have currently been abridged by US Supreme
Court Justice Sandra O'Conner's injunction order of May 29th.<BR>

</P>

<H3><I><FONT SIZE=4>Background:</FONT></I></H3>

<P><B>March 6th, San Francisco, US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals *</B>
<I>[see note at end of this article] </I>- following many years of
contested legal wrangling throughout the courts of Washington and
Oregon states, the 9th Circuit Court upheld the Constitutional Rights
of the terminally ill and ruled in favor of physician assisted life
termination for mentally competent, terminally ill persons who wish
to end their life. This ruling frees medical practitioners to legally
prescribe and administer lethal drugs to terminal patients.<BR>

<B>April 2nd, New York, US 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals*</B> <I>[see
note at end of this article] </I>- following many years of contested
legal battles -some dating back to 1992- throughout the courts of New
York and Vermont states, the 2nd Circuit Court upheld the
Constitutional Rights of the terminally ill and ruled in favor of
physician assisted life termination for mentally competent,
terminally ill persons who wish to end their life. This ruling frees
medical practitioners to legally prescribe and administer lethal
drugs to terminal patients.<BR>

<BR>

<B>May 29th, Washington DC, US Supreme Court</B> - The Hon. Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, the Supreme Court judge immediately responsible
for the 9th Circuit issued a 'stay' against the Circuit Court's
rulings until she and her fellow Supremo's decide whether or not they
might care to spare the time to 'review' the 2nd and 9th decision.
This 'review' process will drag-on into 1997 and possibly well into
the next century!<BR>

<BR>

<B>Meanwhile,</B> the urgent and pain-filled cries from hundreds of
thousands of Americans who are forced to suffer the daily torture of
terminal illness goes totally unheeded by a legal and medical
establishment more concerned with bureaucratic paper-shuffling and
maintaining its power over the mass of society than clearly showing
moral leadership or human compassion.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Lives in the Balance '96</B></P>

<P><B>I appeal to you,</B> as one of the multitude of the terminally
ill Americans, to <I>please, </I><B>please</B> contact your elected
representatives both in your own State and in Washington DC, and all
nine Supreme Court Justices and beseech those in --what <I>they</I>
regard as positions of-- power to consider the 'review' of the 2nd
&amp; 9th Court's rulings to decriminalize physician-assisted
euthanasia by our nation's highest legal body.<B><I>..as an extremely
urgent matter.<BR>

<BR>

</I>Let your voice be heard.</B> For a more comprehensive list of
legislators, just call me here at 808-922-1801 or fax me at
808-922-8272<BR>

<BR>

If you have questions or you need to contact me, just call me at
808-922-1801 or e-mail me at
<A HREF="mailto:osiris@tapa.com">osiris@tapa.com</A>.<BR>

<BR>

Mahalo a Nui. A hui hou, malama pono,<BR>

<I>(Thank you so much. Again, until we see each other, take
care).<BR>

<BR>

</I><B>Mikki Lawson,</B> <I>Hemlock Hawaii Member<BR>

<H3><CENTER><I>Aloha from the paradise islands of Hawaii.<BR>
Yes, you guessed it...these pages are like no other. <BR>
A celebration of life and the miracle of being.</I></CENTER>
</H3>
Believe me. I really know how short and precious life is because a little
over eleven years ago I was diagnosed with a terminal neuromuscular illness
called <A HREF="../ALS/index.html">Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).</A>
It attacks the central nervous system and slowly paralyzes the body. As
if TG life, love and health wasn't &quot;problematic&quot; enough. So, here
you'll discover how to link-up to your own miracle through the miracles
of others.<BR>
<BR>
From personal experience, I can tell you that &quot;transitioning&quot;
--as opposed to merely &quot;dressing-up&quot;-- takes a number of miraculous
elements to overcome a whole host of odds that, for most TG individuals,
are certainly not stacked in our favor. Some of the less fortunate individuals
will surely perish in the attempt.Yet, that makes the celebration of life's
victory even more wonderfully exhilarating. These pages are dedicated to
that celebration of the pursuit of personal freedom and happiness. 
<H2><CENTER>Here You'll Find</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3><A HREF="../ohana/MMM/index.html">Mikki's Personal Pages</A></H3>
Some information about me and some interests of mine. 
<H3><A HREF="fun/index.html">TG/TS Fun Stuff</A></H3>
I believe we are the true substance of miracles. Heaven knows no greater
joy than knowing you're living a miracle.

This area is not for the faint of heart, but deals with the unvarnished

HEIGHT=173 ALIGN=bottom naturalsizeflag="0"></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>My name is Tracy Ryan. I am the Libertarian candidate
for the State Senate 12th district. I have lived in Hawaii for 21
years and in Makiki for the last 15. I am a staff accountant in a CPA
firm and also hold an active real estate license. I am a 1977 <IMG
SRC="../images/beachgrad.jpeg" WIDTH=149 HEIGHT=129 ALIGN=left
naturalsizeflag="0">graduate of the University of Hawaii at Manoa
with a degree in Anthropology and Psychology.</P>

<P>I ask for your vote and support. I realize many of you are not
libertarisans and are not familiar with our philosophy. We believe in
less government, both in economic terms and social terms. We want
less taxes, less bureaucracy, and certainly less waste and fraud. We
also want the criminal justice system to stick to the business of
protecting lives and property and get out of the business of
criminalizing so called victimless crimes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I hope those of you who have read this far and will keep an open
mind about someone from your community who has a clear cut philosophy
and a genuine desire to serve.<BR>

</P>

<H3><B>The role of government</B></H3>

<P>It's as true today as in Jefferson's day "The government that
governs fewest governs best". We need to look strongly at decreasing
our dependence on government. The government is not a business. It
<IMG SRC="../images/tracy1.jpeg" WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=155 ALIGN=left
naturalsizeflag="0">serves the public as a whole. Things such as
maintaining the roads and sewers come to mind. Its efforts in health,
education, and welfare need rethinking. I'm not arguing the
government has no role to play, but I think we need to consider
privatization and semi-privatization as alternatives. For example
various elements of the state government could be cut loose from
their strict reliance on tax generated income and bureaucratic
control. Most areas in the public health department are not currently
able to receive and use private donor funding. A change towards
greater reliance on private funding could help clear up the State's
budget crises, and allow for tax reductions. I propose amending the
State income tax regulations to allow more favorable treatment for
donations to programs currently run by these State agencies. Private
charities doing similar work could participate. Layers of
administration could be cut, services maintained, and tax money
saved. Our government is too involved in regulating commercial
activities in Hawaii. Having been a small business person myself, I
know firsthand the frustration of being constantly pestered with
forms and requirements from Federal, State and local governments
often duplicating each other. Our state and counties are convinced
they know better than business people how to run their businesses.
</P>

<P>The most pervasive problem is the State's commitment to a
centrally planned economy. Central planning was a disaster in the
communist countries of Eastern Europe and it's crippling us here.
<IMG SRC="../images/tracy2.jpeg" WIDTH=98 HEIGHT=113 ALIGN=left
naturalsizeflag="0">An example of central planning is the Hawaii
Community Development Authority, a State agency that has superceeded
the City's authority for zoning and land use in Kakaako. Most the
existing businesses are "nonconforming" based on the rules drawn up
by this agency. This means a buyer may not be allowed to continue to
operate a business upon purchasing it. This stifles the freemarket
and the growth it should be allowed to create. Our housing costs are
far above what they would be if the freemarket was given a chance.
Thousands of acres of land are idle here that could be built on. The
government protests that they are trying to protect the uniqueness
and beauty of Hawaii by restricting development. This is proved wrong
over and over again as some of the most scenic places are down zoned
to developers with the right connections. So we get the worst of
worlds with both stifling building restrictions, and no real
commitment to protect the areas worthy of protection.<BR>

</P>

<H3><B>Marijuana</B></H3>

<P>I oppose the criminalization of marijuana. The rap that smoking
pot leads to use of so called hard drugs isn't true. There are tens
of thousands of people here who regularly smoke pot, but only a
handful who use hard drugs. The argument that most hard drug users
started out with pot is reasoned backwards. One could just as readily
argue for a law against beer, since most smokers of marijuana drank
beer first. Our government's policies aimed at marijuana eradication
have chocked the supply of this relatively harmless drug and caused
people to begin using cheaper drugs such as ice, which may indeed be
dangerous.</P>

<P>Marijuana also has medical uses, such as in the treatment ofthe
nausea that accompanies chemotherapy.</P>

<P>I do not advocate the use of this or any other intoxicant. I
believe it is time we gave up trying to condemn and incarcerate those
who use it. Let's face it, almost everyone in Hawaii knows someone
who uses marijuana. Yet how many of you have called the police to
turn in a friend or relative for so doing? The answer to this
question should tell you what you really think about this law.<BR>

</P>

<H3><B>Hard Drugs</B></H3>

<P>There are many addictive and potentially dangerous drugs available
in our community. The police, courts, and prisons have been
repeatedly turned to stem the tide. The fact is our country is
fighting a losing battle to stop drug use. The criminal justice
system is causing more harm than good.</P>

<P>The problems relating to drug addictions were far less in the
earlier decades of the century when heroin, cocaine, and other hard
drugs were legal and readily available. What the so called "war on
drugs" has done for us is create a criminal world of violent drug
dealers and thieving addicts. What we have spent millions of dollars
to prevent has instead been made worse by our actions.</P>

<P>A hard core addict will do whatever he feels he needs to secure a
supply of his drug. The government's efforts cause the price of the
drug to skyrocket forcing the addict to steal and commit other
crimes. We must start looking at drug addicts as people with a
medical rather than a criminal problem. Legal access to certain hard
drugs for registered addicts could be a component in this change.
This would cripple the illegal drug industry by removing 90% of their
customers. Addicts could be motivated in constructive ways if control
of the drug rested in legal rather than illegal hands.<BR>

</P>

<H3><B>Taxation and corruption</B></H3>

<P>It's simple to say our taxes are too high. They are. We've been
overtaxed in Hawaii for years. It was less than ten years ago the
State had built up a 500 million dollar surplus. Yet the real problem
remains spending. Our legislature and previous governor wasted that
surplus in an orgy of unnecessary, often foolish, projects. Political
insiders were rewarded with every manner of consulting contract,
construction contract, or unneeded employment. Within in a few years
the State found itself broke and facing an economic recession.
Everyone I know has been hurt. What solutions do these leaders offer?
Cutting welfare payments to the disabled (but not the able bodied),
limiting ambulance service to the Leeward coast, and doing away with
tax credits for the poor. Now they debate finding new revenues from
gambling, and from taxing retirement pensions. I wonder why the
government sees gambling as a criminal offense if you or I do it, but
okay if they get a piece of the action.</P>

<P>We need to cut spending and waste so we can cut taxes. We
especially need to cut taxes on the working poor. People trying to
survive on five of six dollars an hour should not pay any tax. We are
far too quick to help the non working poor with welfare and benefits
and far too slow to help the ones who try to survive by the sweat of
their brows. We need to raise the amount a person has to earn before
he pays State income tax and we need to reduce the State excise tax.
</P>

<P>I realize many of you are registered Democrats and feel a strong
sense of loyalty to that party and its candidates. I want to suggest
to you that your interests are not best represented by continuing
that support. We all know how wasteful and irresponsible our State
government has become. When one hears the news reports of portable
school rooms built at a cost of $500,000 instead of $60,000 due to
"engineering studies" one can't help but cringe. Yet stories like
these continue to come to light. All the while our incumbent
representatives shrug and play see no evil, hear no evil, speak no
evil. Your interests are not being represented and your loyalty to
this party is not being returned.</P>

<P>Libertarians oppose the use of coercion and force. I believe we
need to respect each other's choices and differences and not allow
the government to constantly try to enforce other people's visions
and ideas on us. If we can learn to do this we can live in a better
society without big brother government constantly being turned to
resolve one issue or another.<BR>

<P>Aloha,<BR>
<BR>
My name is Mikki Lawson, at last count I was 45 years young. Before my illness
I worked as a graphic artist/designer and advertising art director and I'm
a 1970 graduate Camberwell School of Art, London, England.<BR>
<BR>
<B>As an experienced design and communication arts professional,</B> I possess
over twenty years of advertising, publishing and pre-press experience. I've
been fortunate to have worked, worldwide, on many major international accounts
- <I>Aloha Airlines, ARCO; Bayer Chemicals; California Federal Savings;
Capital Investment, Chanel; Clairol; Great Western Savings; Hilton Hotels
International; Hughes Aircraft; Knapp Publications; Litton Industries; Lloyds
Bank; Lockheed Avionics; Midland Bank; Mortenson Construction; Northrop
Corp.; Pacific Resources Inc.; ITT Sheraton Hotels, Hawaii; Teledyne; and
United California Bank</I>.... to name only a few.<BR>
<BR>
I'm ex-Anglo, now a US-citizen living in Honolulu, Hawaii/USA since 1972
where I currently live together with my transsexual 'sister' who is my caregiver,
and who was born on the same year, same month and has the same last name
as mine. Her name is Erin Lawson and she's from Baltimore, MD...and she's
a wounded TS angel sent from heaven.<BR>
<BR>
I was diagnosed with <A HREF="/ALS/index.html">ALS/MND</A> in May of 1985
at the age of 34. At that time my physicians rendered the reasonably standard
prognosis -- along with the, also standard, set of medical disclaimers --
of between 3-5 years of degenerative life expectancy.<BR>
<BR>
Today, almost eleven years later, apart from two brief periods of catastrophic
muscular weakness and temporary confinement to a wheelchair for a few months...I
have been able to overcome most of the challenges and have managed to regain
some strength... but since July of `95 I've been mostly disabled and dependent.
However, I remain confident at overcoming this neuromuscular killer and
leading a near as 'normal' life soon.<BR>
<BR>
Originally born male, I've been transgendered ever since I can remember.
Currently, I am a Type V, M2F TS. And although there have been long -- far,
far <B>tooooooo</B> long -- periods during my life where I've tried to deny
my special qualities and to live as just <I>'one-of-the-boys'</I>, I've
never desired physical intimacy with a another woman or to function sexually
as a male.<BR>
<BR>
I'm attracted to men and feel blessed with the talents that God and hormones
have given me to please them. <B>Like most people,</B> I've made some serious
mistakes in my life. However, I consider myself as 'normal' and because
of my recent brushes with terminal neuromuscular illness, I know how important
it is to enjoy whatever time is available.<BR>
<BR>

O'Connor<BR>
<BR>
<B>Current Objectives: </B>Since July of 1995 I've been severely disabled.
During this time of declining health I've been given the unique opportunity
to reflect for <B>long</B> periods of time in a wheelchair and in `<I>solitary
confinement</I>' on the `Quality' of my life... past, present and perhaps
future?<BR>
<BR>
I'm acutely aware of the grim and terminal prognosis for most ALS/MND victims.
However, I do believe in miracles and the healing power of love to conquer
all. It is my fervent wish to be happy until the end... and to die happily
in the arms of a lover. <BR>

<H2><I>I'd Gone Wild...</I> The Voodoo Child </H2>
<I>The night I was born,<BR>
Lord, the sky turned a 'fire' red<BR>
Yes, my mother cried out,<BR>
&quot;Oh, the gypsy was right!!!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Preface</B><BR>
For almost half a century, my TG life has been -- at one-and-the-same moment
in time -- full of both joy and despair... of fullfillment and emptiness...
of flamboyance and silence...of yin and of yang. The miracle of powerfully
balanced forces in perfect opposition. Forces that now compel me to open-up
and share my life for the edification of others... as that life starts its
final close-down phase.<BR>
<BR>
I'm certain there will be a zillion pivotal events that I've forgotten or
may -unintentionally- have left-out or 'blocked-out'. However, I'll try,
as best as I am able, through the laughter and the tears, to recall the
events as they happened... and my thoughts at the time. <BR>
<BR>
I intend to -wherever possible- avoid lurid or graphic and detailed descriptions
of sex, violence and of specific criminal acts, <I>unless</I> I feel it
absolutely necessary to assist in achieving a more accurate understanding.
<BR>
<BR>
Obviously, I could have said nothing and passed-away like most naked-apes
leaving little else behind other than memories and questions. Or worse yet,
children. <BR>
<BR>
Is there an all-powerful, resonating force that consciously holds the cosmos
together and has some planned purpose for our existence? Are there 'magic
moments' in a person's life when everything is irrevocably changed? Perhaps,
we might discover the answer as I write. <BR>
<BR>
This is as much a life journey of discovery for a mind/spirit/body connection
as a document of events. Do we each have our own spiritual guides/gods/angels?
If so, then mine must be a modern incarnation of the goddess Venus Castina.

<P><B>Wednesday Morning At 5-o-Clock...</B><BR>
Eleven years ago I was diagnosed with the mysterious and terminal neuromuscular
illness, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which has currently left me quadriplegic
and which I am trying to fight with everything I have. <BR>
<BR>
Statistics indicate the incidence of this condition to affect 1:100,000...
so it's officially a <I>'rare disease.' </I>Only 10% of those diagnosed
with the disease survives longer than five years after the diagnosis. Which
puts my survival rate now in excess of 1:1,000,000! Also, I should mention
that -as of 5-31-96- because there are no 'official' tests for the condition,
other than observation by a neurologist and certain EMG probing... ALS has
a reasonably high incidence of misdiagnosis. <BR>
<BR>
It's difficult for most human beings to accept a 'terminal' diagnosis. And
I feel that there maybe a remote possibility that I may have somehow psychosomatically
induced this illness upon myself through decades of neglect to avoid facing
deep-seated inner conflicts of mind/spirit/body. <BR>
<BR>
Alternatively, this very long-winded missive (typed one keystroke at a time
with a mouth-stick held between my teeth) may ultimately prove to be <B>the
longest suicide note in human history</B> <I>Guinness Book of Records...</I>
please note. <BR>
<BR>
Here, we can discover that I never really was much of a writer. And much
of my rambling text, I'm certain, won't make much sense on first review.
That's not because I seek to be obtuse or to obliquely fain sophistication
but because --not concerning myself with a narrative or with grammar or
rules, but, like Virginia Wolfe, merely a stream of consciousness-- I intend
to make a single, one-time draft and be done with it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>...As the Day Begins</B><BR>
Some of the details contained here are already well-known to many who claim
they 'know' me. However, most of the information is known to only a few.<BR>
<BR>
The room is dark now. In darkness there exists an intimate anonymity. Things
that could never be broached ....things I still find difficult to articulate
verbally...are now, herein, set in digital stone... <BR>
<BR>
<B>First,</B> and upfront... I've never liked who I was... wrong body, wrong
sex, wrong place, wrong time. But I think that's the normal human condition!<BR>
<BR>
'Life' for most naked apes is an unsatisfactory condition, filled with too
many vexations and too few <I>easily</I> enjoyable pleasures. <BR>
<BR>
I think that my own self-termination was inevitable... set in motion somewhere
around the age of 9 years old... I guess it was around that general time
too, just before the onset of puberty came the awful acknowledgment that...life
roles were not to be a matter of choice and I was not going to grow-up to
be either fair or 'desirable'. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A Life Sentence</B> However, I had absolutely no knowledge at that time
just how profoundly being encased and imprisoned in unacceptable flesh would
ultimately affect every fiber of my being... but I already digress... <BR>
<BR>
<I>Born under a Bad Sign<BR>
I been down since I began to crawl<BR>
If it wasn't for Bad Luck <BR>
(Yes, If it wasn't for <B>real</B> Bad Luck) <BR>
If it wasn't for Bad Luck<BR>
I wouldn't have no Luck at all</I><BR>
<BR>
I guess the only way I can detail this 'history of events' is to start at
the beginning... <BR>
<BR>
<B>I was conjured into flesh...</B>I am told...at the stroke of midnight
on a cold November 4, I don't remember because I probably wasn't there.
My parents were both London lower-working class. I was the second of two
children born to Robert and Ellen 'Nelly' Lawson. At the time of my birth
both of my parents were both 37 years old. Too old to bear children in those
days. <BR>
<BR>
Why they considered themselves qualified to bring a second child into 'being'
I'll never really know. They were desperately hoping for the 'perfect' family...<I>a
boy and a girl.</I>..and they already had a six year old boy...my birth
was not a joyous event. <BR>
<BR>
I was christened 'Michael John Lawson' at Holy Trinity Church, Kingsway,
Holborn. <BR>
<BR>
I have no memory before the age of 3 years. My earliest recollection is
of my mother <I>dressing</I> me... I believe we were a very average family.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>...What Did We Do That Was Wrong?</B><BR>
I don't want to dwell too heavily on my family, or sibling rivalry or parental
neglect. We were a very average, hardworking, lower-class family, living
in a post-war, newly built, fairly spacious, two-bedroom council flat in
the central London working-class ghetto. 'Holborn'. <BR>
<BR>
My parents worked hard to pay the bills, kept me and my brother clothed,
fed and housed. Parents never abused us and I believe they loved both my
brother and myself as much as it was possible for them to love. We were
never close or physically affectionate to each other. Shared no dreams or
hopes or secrets. We were a family. <BR>
<BR>
Get a map of London and check-out the High Holborn, Drury Lane area... historically
London's <I>'red-light'</I> light district since the 1600s... the road from
Newgate Prison to the public gallows at Tyburn... the back-drop for Hogarth's
<I>'Rake's Progress'.</I>.. a fertile hunting ground for Royal Navy 'Press
Gangs' of 1700s... the birthplace and 'stomping' ground for Nell Gwyn, the
beautiful hooker and Mistress of Charles II... and my family's square-mile
haunt since the 1700s. An area that sustained heavy damage during WW2 from
the German Luftwaffe 'blitz' bombing and later from Nazi V1 and V2 rocket
attacks... thanks to Werner Von Braun!<BR>
<BR>
I grew up in the rubble, ruins and scars of a World War that I was told
we, the British, had won... yet in a time of drab austerity, food rationing,
free orange juice and the Marshal Plan. A time of Vera Lynn music, nuclear
testing, the Korean War and the 'iron curtain' and the seemingly constant
threat of atomic war. <BR>
<BR>
It always seemed to me that my parents lived their lives in fear of the
authorities. <BR>
<BR>
I probably was a precocious child... from 3-5 years old I attended <I>'The
Foundling' </I>a progressive pre-school at Coram's Fields, London W.C.1.
I hated being treated like a child. Hated clowns, balloons, rhymes, singing
children's songs, ice cream, Jello and anything that was directed 'down'
to kids. I disliked most of the other kids. Hated boys and mostly played
with and made friends with girls -- Patricia Holden and Patricia O'Neal
who became life-long friends well into our mid 20s. <BR>
<BR>
It often occurred to me that most of these 'teachers' could not hold down
a regular job. Hated every kind of 'function' that I would get dragged along
to with the rest of the herd. Specifically, the 1953 coronation celebration
for Elizabeth II. <BR>
<BR>
<B>...We Didn't Know it Was Wrong...</B><BR>
I attended the Holy Trinity Church, London on Sunday mornings... and Sunday
School after the church service. I was escorted to and from church by Mr.
Mills, a young man with ambitions to be a missionary to Africa. On Sundays
my Mom would spend most of the day in the kitchen, my Dad would spend most
of the day at the Pub, my brother seemed perpetually in the hospital and
Mr. Mills and his girlfriend would take me to parks and zoos and museums
and generally play with me and keep me entertained. However, the religious
stories I found unconvincing. <BR>
<BR>
At around 6-7 years of age, without understanding how procreation or how
sex really '<I>worked</I>' I 'knew' that I would never be able to have children...or
be a collaborator in conjuring spirits to 'being'. I'm still uncomfortable
about the conjuring of spirits into flesh. <BR>
<BR>
1954 I started school at St George's Infant School, Queen Square, Holborn
W.C.1. and quickly achieved an undeserved reputation as a troubled kid and
playground fighter. I ceased attending school between the age 7-8 and was
truant for almost 7 months. My parents never found out until the school
'officer' turned-up one evening at tea-time and spilled the beans. <BR>
<BR>
Because we never had a phone (not many working-class families did) and I
had intercepted all mail as it arrived at their home... it came as a complete
surprise... the first...it seems...of many. <BR>
<BR>
My truant days were filled with a street education of learning to shoplift,
steal, have money, fun and protect my friends in crime who stole <I>with</I>
me and who stole <I>for</I> me. I stole from everyone... kids, shops, hotels,
houses, cars, my parents, parking lots, churches, pubs...everyone was a
target of opportunity, I had little or no fear of opposition (I was far
too stupid). I looked angelic and I had a talent for theft. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Oh my goddess.</B>.. seems like around those years I also spent a lot
of time in and out of hospitals with stomach problems and food poisoning
-<I>salmonella.</I> I hated hospitals. That awful clinical smell. Doctors
who always seemed to want to make a <I>'rectal exam'</I> before even asking
my name. I got very blazah about being 'probed' and... well...after a while
it was so routine it seemed '<I>pleasurable</I>'. <BR>
<BR>
At 8 years old I was arrested and judged to be a 'problem' child. A manipulative,
malevolent influence that could corrupt other children into stealing. I
was probably a precocious, strong-willed child who hated school, teachers
and most boys. <BR>
<BR>
I was suspended from St. George's and sent to St Alban's Primary School...
a school some distance from my housing project with kids drawn from different
communities... and placed on a tighter 'leash'. I was there under duress,
was supposed not to be violent to others and not to get into trouble. <BR>
Therefore, I never openly threatened other children, I generally played
alone or with other girls, and delighted in seriously intimidating boys
and being ultra-violent in very isolated and private situations, away from
public view. I think I was perceived by other kids as perhaps a little 'rough'
and somewhat 'homicidal' child. <BR>
<BR>
I tried to drown myself in the deep-end of the Oasis swimming pool when
I was 9 years old but was '<I>saved</I>' by my uncle Bert. <BR>
<BR>
I never did like 'authority' or any form of 'orchestrated' activity. Today,
I still don't. <BR>
<BR>
I attended St.Alban's from age 8 to age 11. I believe I mixed well --or
at least rendered a convincing performance of mixing well-- with other children.
My friendships were pretty evenly divided between girlfriends and boyfriends.
Interests and games about equally divided. <BR>
<BR>
<B>...Quietly Turning the Backdoor Key... </B><BR>
Friendships were entirely platonic until I was 10-yrs old, when I had my
first romantic/sexual encounter with an older boy. He was 13, well-developed,
unbelievably horny and had a fascination with kissing and fondling me. <BR>
<BR>
Although I could not get erections myself at that age, I found it very pleasurable.
As two children, we explored and experimented a lot...I'll refrain from
explicit descriptions of specific acts, except to say that I really did
feel empowered to be gifted with the ability to pleasure a boy to climax
inside of me. Other boyfriends followed, yet, all very innocent and pleasurable.
All of which only served to reinforce my belief that I should have been
born a fairer sex. <BR>
<BR>
I can't actually say that, at the age of 11-12 that I found boys -or girls
for that matter- sexually attractive or exciting. I guess that it was just
that boys somehow found me desirable in some way! Even though I really don't
think my mannerisms were the slightest bit feminine then. <BR>
<BR>
However, after reading <I>Reverse Sex</I> and <I>April</I>, I knew that
I wanted to take a similar path...but I also knew I could not do it alone...I
would need a mentor... <BR>
<BR>
[...which subsequently led to the question I've always asked myself and
has permeated my life...&quot;where IS a good mentor when you need one?&quot;...]
<BR>
<BR>
I found out where April Ashley lived... at an apartment in Dolphin Square
in SW1 London. I spent many days waiting outside the upscale apartment complex
not far from the Houses of Parliament, but alas, I only caught a glimpse
of her in the passenger seat of a Jaguar driving away. She was 27 years
old at the time...and I was 11. <BR>
<BR>
I've no idea what I would have said if we had actually met face-to-face.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Stepping Outside She is Free</B><BR>
At the age of 11 my life started going in a number of very different directions
at the same time. <BR>
<BR>
I started at St. Martin's-in-the-Field Secondary School in the same class
as Patricia Holden and the same school as Jeff who was two-years my senior
and another school sex partner of mine, George Chapman, three-years my senior
-- who later committed suicide in 1970 by a drug overdose. <BR>
<BR>
At 11, I started to experiment with drugs -mostly speed at that time- and
with 'dressing-up' and learning how to use cosmetics... with the help of
a boyfriend's older sister and my 14 and 17 year old cousins Jean and Colleen...
which quickly became a favorite pastime of mine -- it was all very innocent
-- I didn't find it sexually stimulating...just good fun and very educational.
<BR>
<BR>
However, my father was less than enthusiastic about his son in make-up and
heels, he got a tad upset and tried to ban me from wearing girls' clothes...
he said that I &quot;look like a little teenage 'brass' (prostitute)&quot;...
which I thought was great... being not even 13 years old yet! <BR>
<BR>
Along with making the adjustment to the new school I became increasingly
aware that rumors about my sexual activities had preceded me. Therefore,
both openly in class and in the playground -- and more intimately and violently
away from public view -- I confronted those boys....and some girls... who,
just on hearsay, thought it might be fun to taunt me on the subject.It was
<I>quickly</I> 'hushed-up'. <BR>
<BR>
By the end of the first year, by the time I was 12, nobody at St. Martin's
was inclined to 'mess' with me. Then a larger 'reputation' established itself
for me at school as a kid with a penchant for intimate, sadistic terrorism.
I was harassed by older, senior prefect boys until I put two of them in
hospital... for which I was publicly cained, by the headmaster, in front
of the entire school, 18 strokes. <BR>
<BR>
I pretty much dropped-out of school around 12 1/2 until 15 years old and
only made the obligatory appearances for class and choir practice that I
had to... so as not to draw attention to my absence. <BR>
<BR>
It might appear a little incongruous that on the one-hand I was somewhat
of a violent delinquent child...and on the other an angelic choirboy/girl...but
as I already stated, my life was moving in different directions. <BR>
<BR>
St. Martin's-in-the-Field had one of the best track records in England for
the quality of its children's choir and was responsible for supplying the
children's chorus for The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. I was considered
by the ROH as a gifted child soprano -- seems almost embarrassing to say
that now -- I was most definitely stage-struck. I sang in the 1960/62 ROH
productions of Carmen, Peter Grimes, Volkzec and Tosca, under the direction
of ROH's Kathleen Harrison. My parents took no interest in my artistic activities
and only attended a performance once. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Waiting to Keep an Appoint She Made...</B><BR>
During the second season at ROH, Covent Garden I fell in '<I>love</I>' with
a 33 year old member of the ROH chorus. He taught me opera...and I taught
him Rhythm-n-Blues. <BR>
<BR>
Outside of school and apart from torrid love bouts in Malcomb's flat, I
became adept at all kinds of petty criminal activity, the details of which
I won't expound on except to say that at one extreme it would involve ultra-violence
and extortion... and at the other extreme... gentle and loving encounters
in some of London's ritziest hotels and apartments with men. I think I did
it for both the joy of giving them ecstacy and for getting paid to do something
that I enjoyed. <BR>
<BR>
I felt blessed and talented...every inch as good as, <I>if not even better
than,</I> Christine Keeler or Mandy Rhys-Davis, both of whom I aspired to
be like...and...I also learned how to drive and steal cars, motorcycles
and scooters. <BR>
<BR>
At 15, I left school at the earliest opportunity. I became a somewhat androgenous
'mod' but my body and musculature was developing along unmistakably masculine
lines... these were physical attributes which I simply did not know how
to stop. <BR>
<BR>
Plus, there was seemingly nobody I could turn to for help. Hormone therapy
and SRS at that time '62-'64 was something most people hardly even knew
existed. I drifted in and out of various punk jobs. Made most of my money
at night. I somehow drifted into a 'twilight' existence and into using drugs,
mostly fashionable drugs of the day ...speed, cocaine and acid. <I>Lots
and lots of acid.</I><BR>
<BR>
Even drugs represented a dichotomy for me. The reasons I took them wasn't
to be hip. I really loved all of these drugs because they made me feel like
a speeding filly, prevented erections and, I believe, enhanced the pleasure
of sex. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls, <BR>
It's a mixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up world, Except for Lola. Lo lo lo Lola.
Lo lo lo Lola. <BR>
<BR>
</I><B>&quot;Daddy Our Baby's Gone&quot;</B><BR>
I half lived away from home. I hated Holborn and the 'ghetto-tribe' and
started 'sleeping' around. It was a half life in more ways than two. <BR>
<BR>
I started to go to a gay/draggy nightclub in Soho called <I>'The Huntsman'</I>
on my own and soon found people who seemed like me. I started to '<I>dress</I>'
at night and frequent other 'festive' drag clubs and bars, and, at 15 years
old, (looking like a girl of 20) I was considered good at it. I was <I>convincing</I>
and what was referred to as '<I>natural</I>'. I felt I was finally escaping
the drab confines of my <I>ghetto</I>. <BR>
<BR>
For me, the clothes and cosmetics were fun from an aesthetic point of view...
I don't think they sexually stimulated me... not just wearing clothes and
make-up... except I did find that having sex with guys when I was '<I>dressed</I>'
seemed somehow more natural and satisfying. <BR>
<BR>
I never considered what I was doing -- at that time -- to be anything other
than a hetero-like response to men. I've never had any sexual desires for
females. <BR>
<BR>
Preparation for these evenings - mostly Friday and Saturdays - was very
much a ritual taking most of the day at an older drag queen friend's place.
Deedee, as she liked to be called, had become something of a mentor for
me... except she/he liked having sex only with real women... not that I
ever wanted sex from a drag queen...it just seemed odd to me that somebody
who was such a drag and drug enthusiast couldn't see that... horny young
men are the best experience in life!<BR>
<BR>
The ritual of transformation, body-cleansing, evacutating and make-up- made
me feel like I was transforming into what I called a <I>'Warrior of Love'</I>
and the make-up was my 'war-paint' and mask. <BR>
<BR>
Although nobody could ever love me the way I needed to be loved, for a short
period, from about the age of somewhere around 15 years old to around 16...
I had possibly the best and worst time of my life. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best,</B> because I enjoyed the drugs, the clothes, the make-up, the
hair-styles, the perfumes, the music, the drugs, the dancing, the sweat,
the bodies bathed in amphetamine perspiration, shocking people, confusing
people, forbidden acts in the back of London cabs, the whole 60s <I>'dolly-bird'</I>
thing. Very Felliniesque. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Didn't I see you, Down in Hemlock Road,<BR>
Back In 1966,<BR>
You were a draggy, little leather queen, <BR>
Wearing heels and white lipstick,<BR>
Your lashes smashes half the man,<BR>
Your sweat shines sweet and strong,<BR>
You organ's working perfectly,<BR>
But it's a part you won't turn-on.<BR>
<BR>
Come now, gentleman,<BR>
Your love is all I crave<BR>
You'll still be in this circus,<BR>
When I'm laughing,<BR>
In my grave.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Worst,</B> because it was more than a x2 life lived in a twilight
world... and apart from Deedee and a 29-year old, overly zealous and bisexual
drag-queen friend, Colin (Colleen) -who I later found-out had committed
suicide in a 1973 drug OD- I had no real close friends outside the 'straight'
ghetto. And even in the '60s, 'Gay Lib' seemed not to have come to working-class
Holborn. <BR>
<BR>
I remember often returning home to my parents house about 5:00 am Sunday
morning coming-down frantically trying to remove make-up and shower before
they woke-up. Always a little paranoid I'd missed a spot. I did a couple
of times. Nobody noticed or said anything. I preferred to sleep at Deedee's
and relax. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Sunday morning on the side-walk,<BR>
Wishing Lord, that I was stoned,<BR>
'Cause there's something 'bout a Sunday,<BR>
Makes a body feel alone.<BR>
And there's nothing short of dying,<BR>
Half as lonesome as the sound,<BR>
Of a lonely city sidewalk<BR>
Sunday morning, 'coming-down'.</I><BR>
<BR>
What I was doing at 15 and 16 was way, way beyond the comprehension of almost
all the kids -both sexes and persuasions- that I grew-up with. <BR>
<BR>
I think it was around the time, just before my 16th birthday <I>-not that
my family ever celebrated birthdays- </I>I saw myself '<I>dressed</I>' and
it was the first time I saw the male child slipping into manhood...the dream
was <B>melting</B> and sliding away <BR>
<P><CENTER><B>[...and I'll never have that recipe again :- ( ] </B></CENTER>
<P>It was an awful revelation. Worse than <I>'Fear and Loathing'</I>. That
acid induced vision caused me to totally stop the pursuit of an obviously
unrealistic dream of ever becoming '<I>real</I>'. <BR>
<BR>
I turned back to more drugs... violence and theft. And embraced the 'mod'
and emerging 'skinhead' lifestyle &lt;though I would <I>never</I> cut my
hair THAT short&gt;. -<I>see the movies Quadraphenia and Clockwork Orange
for historical reference-</I> Tried out for Royal Air Force selection at
Caldwell -<I>shades of T.E. Lawrence</I>- got turned-down. And ended-up
at 16 1/2 working in the art dept of a large London ad agency. <BR>
<BR>
In many ways... what happened after aborting the pursuit of the dream of
ever attaining a persona of desirability... well it seems inconsequential
now... even though my over-compensatory, male-chick persona of those years
makes the criminal and violent activities of <I>Clockwork Orange</I> appear,
by comparison, like a children's Disney cartoon. We <I>never</I> drank milk
either.<BR>
<BR>
I avoided all sexual activity and relationships from the age of 16 1/2 until
I was 21 years old and at college.<BR>
<BR>
However, several decades have now been spent marking time... college...
working...racing...music ...friendships... drugs...'mones... many different
relationships... some with other transsexuals... sort of TG lesbian relationships
in a curious way... living <I>my</I> life vicariously through <I>theirs</I>...
but for many years the dream was utterly lost. <BR>
<BR>
I became lost as one of the herd... 
<H2>Is It Tomorrow... Or Just the End of Time?</H2>
The months between '65 and --when I started art college in-- '66 were times
I'm not proud of and have no wish to recall. I went <B>way</B> 'over-the-top'
on the male-chick persona... and maimed and injured many people trying to
prove I was a real <I>'mean-mother'</I> with a serious sadistic bloodlust.
May the gods forgive me for what I did to other human beings during these
months of unbridled rage and testostorone excess. However, as soon as I
started my art studies I calmed-down. 
<H2>'scuse me...While I Kiss This Guy!!!</H2>
I was 21 years old, finishing my final year at art college in London, England...
and going 'steady' with a horny 24 year-old fine art student, Paul, who
was <I>very</I> into my 'tranny' trip. He encouraged me, found a doctor
and paid for my first series of hormone treatments which took place over
the next year and a half.<BR>
<BR>
The doctor was located on Wimpole Street, London W.1. and the series of
treatments turned-out to be very different from anything that I'd imagined.
But then, at 21, I really didn't know that much about hormones or hormone
therapy. I'd somehow thought it would simply involve a series of injections
and probably a bunch of pills? <I>Wrong!</I><BR>
<BR>
Initially, the doctor gave me -- what I later came to learn was -- a fairly
standard litany and precursor to almost any female hormone therapy for a
male TS. <BR>
<BR>
MDs tell you what they feel that you might perceive as a <I>'downside' </I>to
the treatment. Emphasizing the fact that this kind of hormone therapy will
result in the loss of the ability to achieve 'erections' and that after
a year of therapy this effect can be permanent and may cause testicular
atrophy and penile shrinkage; loss of ability to achieve male orgasm; increased
size, softness and sensitivity of breasts and hips.<BR>
<BR>
Naturally, when I heard this for the first time, I responded warmly as I've
never been responsible - <I>then or now </I>- for penetrating anyone...
that's just never been my trip.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Then, I thought I would just get a shot</B>... However, I was informed
I would receive a time-release, lower-abdominal implant. I'd never heard
of that technique before. Looking similar to a short shoelace, each drug
implant -- a combination of estrogen and progesterone -- is very potent
and time releases over a six-month period. <BR>
<BR>
Under a local anesthetic, an incision was made in my lower stomach, the
implant was then inserted through a stainless steel tube, then the incision
was sealed with two sutures. It was relatively pain free and Paul drove
me home. <BR>
<BR>
Some of the hormone effects were almost immediate though not visible, others
started to manifest themselves over the next week or so. I felt very euphoric
all the time. In particular, I was first struck by the increased sensitivity
and softness of my skin, the reduced growth of facial hair and the substantial
increase in feeling and sensitivity to touch in my inner and outer thighs
and how much this added to the pleasure of physical intimacy and provided
some of the most profound sexual experiences of my life. <BR>
<BR>
After a week, the hormones released me of all male abilities and reduced
ejaculations to a few drops of clear, viscous fluid. However, I was totally
unprepared when I first started to experience <I>delayed</I>' and then <I>spontaneous</I>
orgasms as I'd never heard of anyone having that before. <BR>
<BR>
After we both graduated, even though we cared very deeply for each other,
we just seemed to drift apart. Paul moved back to Manchester and I went
back to live a 'cloaked' existence with my parents in central London. I
dropped hormone therapy for the next 4.5 years... until I moved to San Francisco
CA in 1975.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Life in SF in the mid-70s</B> was like a never-ending party. I met a
very special person called Joey who was very much like me in many ways.
We both liked the weekend SF drag scene and we both worked as rock-n-rollers
during the week for most of the time. However, it was fortunate that unlike
me, Joey was more into screwing queens than actually being one.<BR>
<BR>
This was also the time where --for just this one time-- I'm ashamed to say
that I tarnished my 'unblemished' record of having sex exclusively with
men... and I let myself be talked into consenting to have sex with a long-time
female friend from England. We had been good friends for years and she was
fully aware of my alternative orientation. Shirley's philosophy was of the
'<I>one-good-fuck-and-you'll-be-alright'</I> school of thought. She got
me drunk and worked very assiduously at motivating me... however, I had
to fake it... just to get it over with.<BR>
<BR>
I started hormone therapy again for the balance of '76 with a doctor who
was located just off of Geary Blvd near Van Ness, but this time it was a
combination of bi-weekly injections of Estradiol and Hydroprogesterone,
plus a B12 shot, and daily 2.5 mg Premarin tablets. The results were familiar
but less dramatic than the lower-abdominal, time-release implants I had
received half a decade before in London.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Life in the Fast Lane </B>In the beginning of '77 I moved from SF to
the Silverlake area of Los Angeles. I was socially mobile and appeared to
move easily between 'straight' and alternative lifestyles. However, I relinquished
dressing even part-time until 1980 when a latino TS friend moved-in with
me. In retrospect, this was a mistake. For the next 3.5 years I lived an
increasingly dysfunctional lifestyle... way too much alcohol, way too many
drugs -- hormones intermittently -- way too few really nice guys in my life,
and way, <B>way</B> too many frustrations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>In 1984 I moved to Honolulu, Hawaii </B>and into my apartment in Waikiki,
right across the street from Hamburger Mary's and Hula's, two of the city's
liveliest gender-friendly nightspots. That year I started to experience
weakness on my right-side, a weakness that I attributed to a motorcycle
racing accident that occurred when I was 19 years old. However, after nine
months of neurological testing I was diagnosed with ALS and given only a
few years of life expectancy. <BR>
<BR>
Muscle weakness led to muscle cramps... which in turn led to using pain
killing drugs... supplemented by other illicit drugs... and finally to using
-- hormones intermittently -- copious amounts of narcotics and alcohol...
replete with an undiscriminating and risky love life... which went on for
about 4 years... until Kelly entered my life and saved me from myself.<BR>
<BR>
<B>By late1987, </B>I was already a wreck and, worse yet, not dead! So,
when I met Kelly, who was a 44 year-old Hawaiian TS and we became sisters,
both of us made a promise to each other to live for each other and to care
for each other. It was a surprising and secure TS relationship and it worked
wonderfully for six years. <BR>
<BR>
Kelly was much more consistent about regular hormone use for the both of
us than I was throughout the whole time we were together. However, early
in '94 Kelly was diagnosed with lung cancer... and that September, after
a spirited struggle, Kelly surrendered to the illness and passed-away at
6:43 am on the morning of September 7th 1994 with just the two of us together
in the hospital room. I cried continuously for six weeks. 
<H2>Meet You in The Next World...And Don't Be Late</H2>
<B>Nothing could ease my sense of loss</B> and hormones made me <I>more</I>
emotional. Until my birthday came around in early November and I thought
that 'the day of my birth' would provide an excellent moment in time to
end my life. So, early on the morning of November 5... I opened a bottle
of 151 proof Barcadi, mixed a cocktail containing 90 Halcyon sleeping tablets
and the contents of 30 Tylox pain-killer capsules with a little 151 and
Coke...had a few drinks... sung<I> 'Happy Deathday to me'</I> and <I>'For
She's A Jolly Good Fellow'</I> and swallowed down the lethal mix... <B>Finally,
I was at peace.<BR>
</B><BR>
After I collapsed, a curious chain of events took place that would prompt
even a disbeliever...to believe in a resonating cosmic force! This chain
of events ultimately conspired to foil a well-planned and well-executed
euthanasia program...<BR>
<BR>
<B>I was revived in the ER of Queen's</B> (aptly named) Medical Center and
I was 'super-pissed' at my so-called 'friends' and the medicos for their
preclusion of my constitutionally guaranteed rights to freedom and their
fascist presumption at determining what 'they' felt was 'right' for me!
<BR>
<BR>
However, in the 19 months that have now elapsed since my thwarted effort
for freedom... 11 of the past months now spent as a quadriplegic in the
solitary confinement of a wheelchair... I look back at my life... and although
conventional medical wisdom and my so-called 'friends' can't turn back the
clock... hormones have been, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the shining
beacons of my existence on this beautiful marble planet, Earth.<BR>

<P><B>1956--1960</B><BR>
As a child who really didn't read a lot of 'serious' books, there were a
number of works that I read during my formative childhood years --8 to 11
years old-- that were influential to me and probably go a long way to indicating
my interests as a child... <BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="60%"></CENTER>
<P><B>The Last Enemy</B> <I>Richard Hillary</I> <BR>
Autobiography of a young downed and horribly burned Royal Air Force, 'Battle
of Britain' Spitfire pilot and his personal struggle to overcome the challenges
and pain of severe burns. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reverse Sex</B> <I>Jacques Dumont </I><BR>
Autobiography of Connicelle, one of the world's first and certainly most
glamorous male to female sex-change transsexuals. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Knights of the Bushido</B> <I>Unknown </I><BR>
Japanese military conquest and defeat in Indo-China and the Pacific 1933-45.<BR>
<BR>

<P><B>1960--1970</B><BR>
Later as a teenager and into my college years... I became an avid reader
and researcher... to list books by title would take too long... however
writers and poets who's body of works I found inspirtional during the 1960s-70s
who immediately spring to mind would be-- Yukio Mishima, Marshal McLuhan,
Krishnamurti, Edward Arthur Waite, Alistaire Crowley, Germaine Greer, Alan
Ginsberg, Anais Nin, Tom Wolfe, Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs, Virginia
Woolfe, Leonard Cohen, Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury.<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="60%"></CENTER>
<P><B>1970--1995</B><BR>
During the past quarter of a century, like many independant creative business
professionals, I've consistently been preoccupied working 10-16 hours a
day --many of those hours spent reading operational and software manuals,
trade and technical magazines, update notices, etc-- to find the time to
devote to 'recreational' reading...<BR>
<BR>
However, there are a number of authors, mainly in the SF field, that have
illuminated my life during this time... and have provided a universe of
joy and inspiration during some difficult --and at times, suicidal-- years.<BR>

<P>An annuity is a series of payments made at regular intervals. You can
buy annuity contracts from life insurance companies. In return for premiums
that you pay, the company will pay you an annuity.<BR>
<BR>
The main reason to buy an annuity contract is to obtain an income, usually
for retirement purposes. An annuity contract is not a life insurance policy
or a health insurance policy. It is not a savings account or savings certificate,
nor should it be bought for short-term purposes.<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="3"><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Types of Annuity Contracts</H2>

<P>Annuity contracts may be classified in a number of ways. The most common
classifications are set out below.<BR>
</P>

<H4>Annuity contracts may be either immediate or deferred. </H4>

<P>Immediate annuity contracts provide income payments that start shortly
after you pay the premium. Deferred annuity contracts provide income payments
that start later, often many years later.<BR>
</P>

<H4>Annuity contracts may be either single premium or installment premium.</H4>

<P>Single premium contracts require you to pay the company only one premium.
Installment premium contracts are designed for a series of premiums. Most
of these are flexible premium contracts; they allow you to pay as much as
you wish, within specified limits. Others are scheduled premium contracts
which specify the size and frequency of your premiums.<BR>
</P>

<H4>Annuity contracts may be either individual or group. </H4>

<P>Individual contracts cover only one or two persons. Group contracts cover
a specified group of people.<BR>
</P>

<H4>Annuity contracts may be fixed, variable or a combination of both.</H4>

<P>During the deferred period of a fixed annuity contract, premiums (less
charges) are accumulated at rates of interest set by the company. The amount
of each annuity payment is determined when payments begin. During the deferred
period of a variable annuity, the value of the accumulated premium (less
charges) varies with the performance of a specified pool of investments.
The amount of annuity payments also varies with the performance of the pool.
Combination annuities allow you to put part of your premium in a fixed annuity
and part in a variable annuity.<BR>
<BR>
Some companies offer deposit fund arrangements under the provisions of their
life insurance policies or annuity contracts. These arrangements allow you
to pay amounts, in addition to your premiums, which will be accumulated
at interest in much the same way as under a deferred fixed annuity contract.
The balance of this guide deals specifically with deferred fixed annuity
contracts and, therefore, is generally applicable to deposit fund arrangements
also. </TD></TR>

are explained below.</P>

<H3>Charges</H3>

<P>Considerable diversity exists in the types and amounts of charges. Some
charges may be fixed at issue; others may be charged by the company from
time to time. A typical contract might contain one or more of the following
types of charges. Companies may refer to these charges by different names.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Percentage of Premium Charge.</I></B> This charge, often called a
load, is deducted from each premium paid. The percentage may reduce after
the contract has been in force for a certain number of years or after total
premiums paid have reached a certain level.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Contract Fee.</I></B> This is a flat dollar amount charged either
at issue or annually.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Transaction Fee.</I></B> This is a charge per premium payment or other
transaction.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Surrender Charge. </I></B>This charge is usually a percentage of the
value of the contract or of premiums paid. The percentage may be reduced
or eliminated after the contract has been in force for a certain number
of years. Sometimes the charge takes the form of a reduction in the interest
rate credited. In some cases, the charge is eliminated if the interest rate
declared by the companies falls below a certain level.</P>

<H3>Interest</H3>

<P>The interest used to accumulate contract values may never be less than
the guaranteed rate stated in the contract. In practice, the interest rate
actually used by a company, usually referred to as the current rate, is
often higher. The company may change the current rate from time to time,
but it cannot be lower than the guaranteed rate. Companies differ substantially
in their methods of determining the current rate.</P>

<H3>Benefits</H3>

<P>Annuity contracts provide a number of benefits. While the annuity income
benefit is the primary one, the other benefits set out below are also important.</P>

<H3>Annuity Income Benefit</H3>

<P>Income payments are usually made monthly, although other frequencies
are available. The amount of the annuity payments is based on both the value
of the contract and the contract s benefit rate when annuity payments begin.
This benefit rate depends on your age and sex, and the annuity form you
have chosen.<BR>
<BR>
Annuity contracts contain a table of guaranteed benefit rates. Most companies
periodically develop current benefit rates as well; these rates are subject
to change by the company at any time. When the annuity payments begin, the
company will determine the amount of each payment according to the current
benefit rates then in effect if these are more favorable to you. If the
guaranteed benefit rates would provide higher income payments, those rates
will be used. Once payments begin, they are unaffected by any future rate
changes.<BR>
<BR>
The most commonly available annuity forms are:<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Straight Life. </I></B>The annuity is paid as long as you are alive.
There are no further payments to anyone after your death.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Life with Period Certain. </I></B>The annuity is paid as long as you
are alive. If you die before the end of the period referred to as the certain
period, the annuity will be paid to your beneficiary for the rest of that
period. Typical certain periods are 10 or 20 years.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Joint and Survivor.</I> </B>The annuity is paid as long as either
you or another named annuitant is still alive. In some variations, the annuity
is decreased after the first death. A period certain must also be available
with this form.</P>

<H3>Death Benefit</H3>

<P>Most contracts provide that, if you die before the annuity payments start,
the contract value will be paid to your beneficiary. Some contracts provide
that the death benefit will be the total premiums paid if that amount is
greater than the value of the contract at death.</P>

<H3>Surrender Benefit</H3>

<P>Most annuity contracts allow you to surrender your contract if income
payments have not yet started. Upon surrender, the contract terminates.
The surrender benefit is equal to your contract value less surrender charge,
if any.<BR>
<BR>
Many annuity contracts also provide that you may withdraw a portion of your
contract value, under certain conditions, without terminating the contract.
A surrender charge may be deducted from the amount withdrawn.</P>

<H3>Waiver of Premium Benefit</H3>

<P>Some companies offer a benefit which will pay premiums for you if you
become disabled. A charge is made for this benefit.<BR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="3"><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>How to Buy an Annuity</H2>

<P>Buying an annuity contract is a major financial decision which should
be considered carefully.</P>

<H3>Contract Summary</H3>

<P>You will receive a Contract Summary when an annuity contract is delivered
to you, or you can ask for one now. You should review this statement thoroughly.<BR>
<BR>
Accumulated values and surrender values under the contract are illustrated
for various years on this statement. During the first few years, these values
may be less than premiums paid. This is why and annuity should not be purchased
for short-term purposes.<BR>
<BR>
Also illustrated is the yield on gross premiums at the end of ten years
and at the time income payments are scheduled to begin. Since it takes into
account not only the interest credited under the contract, but also the
effect of all charges, the yield on gross premiums is a figure you can use
to compare annuity contracts. Be careful in comparing this figure with yields
available on investments. The tax treatment of annuity earnings is usually
substantially different from that of earnings from investments. Also, only
annuity contracts offer life income and waiver of premium benefits.<BR>
<BR>
As stated at the beginning of this guide, the main reason to buy an annuity
contract is to obtain an income. Therefore, you should also review the life
income figures shown in the Contract Summary.<BR>
<BR>
You will note that all values and income figures are shown on both a guaranteed
and current basis. Illustrations on the guaranteed basis show the minimum
values and income which could be paid under the contract. Illustrations
on the current basis show the values and income which would be paid if the
current interest and benefit rates for the contract were to continue in
effect for the period shown. Since it is impossible to predict the future
course of interest and benefit rates, you will have to decide for yourself
how much to rely on the current basis values when making your purchase decision.</P>

<H3>Other Points to Consider</H3>

<P>Be certain that you understand the effect of all charges that will be
made under the contract.<BR>
<BR>
Check whether the annuity contract allows you to change the amount of your
premium payments. Find out what happens if you stop paying premiums altogether.<BR>
<BR>
You may want to obtain and compare Contract Summaries for similar contracts
from several companies. Comparing these should help you select a good buy.<BR>
<BR>
If you are buying an annuity contract for an Individual Retirement Account
(IRA) or another tax deferred retirement program, make sure that you are
eligible. Also, make sure that you understand any restrictions connected
with the program.<BR>
<BR>
If you are shown a presentation which illustrates tax savings, find out
what assumptions are used. Be sure the assumptions apply in your case.<BR>
<BR>
A good agent can help you choose the right annuity contract. Remember that
the quality of service that you can expect from the life insurance company
and the agent is an important factor also.</P>

<H3>Read the Contract</H3>

<P>When you receive your annuity contract, read it carefully. Ask the agent
and the company for an explanation of anything you do not understand.<BR>
<BR>
If you have a specific complaint or cannot get the answers you need from
the agent of company, please contact your state insurance department. </TD></TR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="3"><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Qualified Retirement Plans</H2>

<P>Qualified retirement plans can be established in a variety of ways. Pension
plans, profit-sharing plans, and 401(k) plans can be installed in a corporation,
a partnership or a sole proprietorship. With a simplified employee pension
plan, employer contributions can be made to each employee s individual retirement
account. An individual retirement account (IRA) can also be established
by many taxpayers.<BR>
<BR>
To better appreciate the advantages of qualified retirement plans, we can
compare the results obtained when funds are invested outside a qualified
plan...for example, in certificates of deposit, savings accounts, or treasury
bills.<BR>
<BR>
Assume that there are $1,000 of before-tax funds available for investment
per year over the next 20 years. If after-tax dollars were invested outside
of a qualified plan, assuming a 28 percent tax bracket, of the original
$1,000 only $720 per year would remain after-taxes for investment. The earnings
on such a non-qualified investment will also be taxed, which means that
although the investment might pay 8 percent interest, it would yield only
5.76 percent after-taxes. The reduced funds available for investment, combined
with the reduced after-tax yield, means that in 10 years $9,926 will have
accumulated, and in 20 years $27,302.<BR>
<BR>
However, a qualified plan offers the opportunity for substantially increased
accumulations, because there are no current taxes on contributions, and
no current taxes on investment earnings. A tax deferred growth of 8 percent,
will accumulate $15,645 in 10 years, and $49,423 in 20 years. This tax leverage
offered by the qualified retirement plan means that each year $1,000 will
actually be invested, and a full 8 percent rate of interest will actually
be credited, neither being subject to current income taxation. Although
payments received during retirement will be taxable, after-tax income will
usually far exceed that available with a non-qualified investment. </TD></TR>

<P>There are two types of adjectives in the Japanese language. The two types
are referred to as I adjectives and NA adjectives. In the next three lessons
we will learn about I adjectives.</P>

<P>I adjectives, like the English adjective, modify or describe nouns. In
Japanese I adjectives can have verb-like qualities.</P>

  <B>Mikki's Note:</B> These days the web changes at an alarming speed! However,
  we -- who live lives of transition -- understand &quot;change&quot; a lot
  more intimately than most human beings on this planet. So, as times change,
  people change, fashions change, hairstyles change, boyfriends (thank God)
  change, web sites change, medical science and techniques change, technology
  changes, yes ... and even web addresses change. <BR>
  <BR>
  So, if you come across interesting new T* sites that you think would be
  of interest to our community. Or, if there is something here that is incorrectly
  listed, or there's a group or organization that you know of that provides
  support, just let me know, and I'd be happy to list / link it to our Tapa
  T* Community site.<BR>
  <BR>
  Stay in-touch with the happenings of our global T* Community. Keep the
  faith.</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- to describe lifestyles in transition. <BR>

<H3>Preface</H3>
First, let me preface this entire section by saying that I am not a medical
doctor, a pharmacist or any kind of therapist... I am merely a 45 year-old,
N-European Caucasian, Type V, M2F TS, who has been using (some would say
'flirting with') hormones, on and off, since my early 20s. <BR>
<BR>
Although much of the information contained below is available from various
works of reference --both medical and pharmaceutical -- the clinical data
has been augmented by my personal experience.<BR>
<BR>
None of the following info should be taken to indicate an endorsement for,
or a disclaimer against, any specific product or type of therapy. The information
is offered simply for the enlightenment of persons who have an interest
in M2F gender transition.<BR>
<BR>
<B>By no means</B> do I consider my own, still transitioning, life to be
a shining example of success... or an example to be held-up for anyone to
follow. <BR>
<BR>
<B>In fact, quite the reverse</B>... I've probably made every mistake that
there is, I'm 45 years old, still not transitioned, now disabled and --
so they tell me,&quot;terminally ill&quot; -- it has only been within the
last few years have I finally overcome my own lifelong problems with drugs,
alcohol and poor nutritional habits. However, it is because I've made such
colossal mistakes and errors in judgment that others can now benefit from
my very humble lifetime of experience.<BR>
<BR>

<H3><BR>
I Sting the Body Eclectic</H3>
Like most aspects of human chemistry and of psycho-neuro immunology, the
endocrine system --which controls the body's production and balance of hormones,
including sex hormones -- is still, at best, only loosely understood. Even
though there are licensed MDs whose knowledge is seemingly endless and who
specialize in endocrine 'medicine'... there are, unfortunately, no real
'experts' on either generic body chemistry or more specifically on 'your'
body and its unique chemistry. <BR>
<BR>
Therefore, please, please be advised that hormone therapy, even under the
direction of a seemingly qualified and licensed physician, is not a magic
potion that delivers either instant or necessarily pain-free results. This
type of drug therapy is not for the faint-of-heart. It demands an astronomically
high-degree of personal motivation and fortitude. It's very long-term -usually
lifelong- and is fraught with many health risks and requires constant, lifelong,
self-monitoring.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, self-monitoring and self-awareness play an increasingly vital role
as the therapy progresses -- so too, does increased awareness and attention
to more general aspects of health and personal hygiene such as nutrition,
exercise, mental outlook, and sobriety -- because this type of long-term
use of drugs to alter body chemistry and physical form inevitably places
some degree of increased strain on your system and the body's primary organs
of the intestine, liver and kidneys. Any use of illicit drugs or the intake
of alcohol must be strictly controlled.<BR>
<BR>
<B>It's unfortunate</B> that many of us who suffer with gender identity
difficulties frequently try to repress those feelings and have attendant
personality problems stemming from that central dysphoria which often --
sometimes due to hormone induced mood swings -- drives us to seek shelter
and comfort from other prescription or illicit drugs... or alcohol... or
into casual and unsafe sex... to ease our pain and quell the flames of this
living hell. This struggle takes its own, frequently fatal, toll on a body
and soul already under stress and in the throws of transition and must be
recognized early as being detrimental and an impediment to the success of
hormone use. 
<H3>'mones and their use</H3>
As a group of drug products, 'hormone' drugs and the fields of human endocrine
medicine are relatively new, most of today's commercially available synthetic
drugs tracing their development back to the 1950s and 60s.<BR>
<BR>
Short, though their operational histories are it is, I believe, of critical
importance for every person contemplating the use of hormones to recognize
the primary reasons for their development and to become as knowledgeable
about these drugs, their effects, side-effects and contra indications as
is humanly possible.<BR>
<BR>
There are a number of excellent reference works on prescription drugs, one
that is considered by most physicians as the 'authorative' work is <I>The
Physician's Desk Reference</I> (PDR) <I>of Prescription Medications</I>.
I would earnestly suggest that you acquire a reference guide -- either printed
or electronic -- that is up-to-date and that you can work with. And, that
if you're currently taking prescription medications that were prescribed
to you by a physician, other than the one you are seeing, be certain to
make the physician aware of the drugs you're already taking. <BR>
<BR>
The questions below are basic and typical of the type of those posed by
many interested in gender transition.<BR>
<BR>
QUESTION: <I>What are hormones?</I><BR>
ANSWER: Hormones are naturally produced and controlled by the body's own
endocrine gland system and are extremely complex, long-term chemical excitors
and inhibitors responsible for everything from brain chemistry, physical
development, hair, skin, sex drive, libido, musculature, fat distribution,
gender characteristics, etc. The body's production of hormones shifts and
changes with age, environment, diet, exercise and stress. All of which are
inextricably linked to the aging process itself.<BR>
<BR>
In terms of their chemical nature, hormones are classified as follows:<BR>
&#183; Biogenic Amines (epinephrine, norepinephrine)<BR>
&#183; Amino Acids (thyroxine)<BR>
&#183; Peptides (vaspressin)<BR>
&#183; Proteins (pituitary growth hormone, parathyroid hormone insulin,
glucagon)<BR>
&#183; Steroids (aldosterone, cortisol, androgenic hormones)<BR>
&#183; Prostaglandins<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
QUESTION: <I>What are steroids?</I><BR>
ANSWER: This term can be confusing. When I first think of 'roids, I think
of 'Anabolic Steroids' that are taken by young males obsessed with sports
and their personal athletic abilities and by professional male bodybuilders
seeking greater muscle definition. However, I subsequently discovered that
it was a term that is generally applied to lipids that contain a hydrogenated
cyclopentanoperhydophenanthrene (what a word!) ring system. Some of the
substances in this group are progesterone, adrenocortical hormones... So,
the bottom-line is sometimes steroids are hormones and vice-versa.<BR>
<BR>
QUESTION: <I>What are androgens and anti-androgens?</I><BR>
ANSWER: No real easy answer... but in its most simplest androgens promote
physical male attributes and anti-androgens inhibit the production and effects
of male hormones.<BR>
<BR>
QUESTION: <I>When is it best to start (HRT) hormone reassignment therapy?</I><BR>
ANSWER: The closer to puberty hormone reassignment therapy is started the
more effective the treatment. This raises a whole host of questions about
making 'life decisions' at an early, and perhaps premature age. Certainly,
if the therapy had been more widespread and had I been aware of its availability
as a young child growing up in the 1950s, I often wonder if I would have
been able to convince my parents to consent to me starting HRT early.<BR>
<BR>
QUESTION: <I>How do female hormones affect a male body?</I><BR>
ANSWER: Quite simply, it depends on the particular male body! There are
however some general effects that are considered as almost universal result
of HRT on the typical male bio-system... <BR>
&#183; Loss of male sex drive<BR>
&#183; Inability to achieve erection<BR>
&#183; Promotion of secondary female sex characteristics<BR>
&#183; Increased difficulty in achieving orgasm<BR>
&#183; Decrease in semen fluid<BR>
<BR>
QUESTION: <I>What are the methods of hormone delivery?</I><BR>
ANSWER: As with many drugs, there are basically four methods available.
Each method of delivery has its respective advantages and disadvantages
in terms of placing increased demands and stress on the body's primary organs
of intestine, liver, kidney and heart. Four methods are...<BR>
Orally (pills); <BR>
Intramuscular (injection); <BR>
Time-Release (implant); <BR>
Dermal (skin patch/creme)<BR>
<BR>
QUESTION: <I>What are the types, names, of popular drugs employed in M2F
transition and available in the U.S.?</I><BR>
ANSWER: <BR>
<B>Estrogen: </B>One of most widely prescribed estrogen drugs in the world
is Premarin (the drug taking its name from its source of origin Pregnant
mares urine... which, over recent years, has sparked concern for way in
which battery live-stock are frequently treated inhumanely and the questionable
wisdom of using medications derived from 'stressed-out' animals to treat
humans). Premarin along with other estrogen drugs is available in a wide
diversity of forms and strengths, the most popular being daily pill form.<BR>
<BR>
Although these estrogen drugs were primarily developed to treat a much wider
spectrum of prospective ailments than gender transition... today, estrogen
therapy forms the basis for TS-HRT and the promotion and development of
female sex characteristics in a male TS..<BR>

<BR>
<B>Progesterones</B> Progestins are essential in physical transition of
most M2F TSs. Not only in the promotion of secondary female characteristics
and body fat redistribution, but are a pre-requisite for the development
of lactating milk sacs within the breasts.<BR>
<BR>
Again, while no FDA approved drug has ever been developed specifically for
the treatment of M2F TSs, a number of progesterone drugs have found favor
with physicians and the TS community alike.<BR>
<BR>

Provera (Medroxyprogesterone (me-DROX-ee-proe-JES-te-rone) <BR>
<BR>
<B>Anti-Androgen</B> This type of drug is frequently used in the treatment
of M2F TSs to inhibit the production of male hormones and breakdown testosterone
resistance and allow the newly introduced estrogen and progesterone drugs
to be more effective. Though many drugs have anti-androgen properties, none
were specifically developed for that purpose. However, a number of medications
have achieved popularity in this application including Aladactone.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Favored for Anti-Androgen Use in the U.S. --</B><BR>
Aldactazide (Spironolactone (speer-on-oh-LAK-tone) <BR>
and Hydrochlorothiazide <BR>

and Hydrochlorothiazide <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
QUESTION: <I>Are there organic and natural sources of hormones?</I><BR>
ANSWER: There are a number of plants, herbs and compounds for which hormonal
effects are claimed... though I've found them less than effective and a
waste of time, effort and money. But each person must find out for themselves.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>HOW WEALTH IS CREATED... AN EXAMPLE OF BAD
REASONING </B></P>

<P>Free enterprise works. Many people today are confused. They
believe the government plays a constructive role when it interferes
in the economy. Let me give an illustration of how people are led
astray by the old example of the broken window. This is the story
about a man who throws a brick through the plate glass window of a
baker. He flees when the angry baker comes out screaming and shaking
his fist. Soon a crowd gathers looking at the broken window and the
shattered glass on all the pretty cakes. Talk turns to replacing the
window. The event should certainly lead to the employment of some
glazier to replace the window. Someone suggests a new plate glass
window of its size would cost about $300. So now a glazier will get
$300 worth of trade. Plus with the money he has earned he will
certainly have more money to buy tools and supplies and consumer
goods. So many others will benefit from his stoke of luck. In time
the man who threw the brick begins to seem more of a public
benefactor than a villain as the crowd thinks of all the economic
activity he's created.<BR>

<BR>

The problem with this reasoning is it forgets the baker will have to
take $300 he had saved, (and could have spent on something else), and
must now spend it on the window. He could have spent it on a new suit
thus giving trade to some tailor. The tailor could have spent the
money just as the glazier might. He would create the same amount of
economic benefits. But since the window is now broken the interests
of the tailor are never considered because he is never brought into
the picture. He remains invisible.<BR>

<BR>

Yet this is far from an even trade. The community is out one plate
glass window. Sure it will be replaced. But if it were not for the
brick thrower, both a suit and a window could have existed where now
there will only be a window. The lesson is that in thinking about
economic events and their consequences it is never proper to think
only of how they effect one segment of society or what they will mean
in the short term. Proper economic thinking considers the effects on
all elements of society and how these effects will play out in the
long term.<BR>

<BR>

GOVERNMENT SPENDING DOESN'T CREATE ECONOMIC GROWTH<BR>

<BR>

Government officials are constantly trying to tinker with the economy
to help one group or another without seeing the negative overall
consequences. It wasn't long ago that almost any public project could
be sold to the taxpayers on the grounds it would create jobs.
Certainly building a road or a bridge will require the employment of
many workers. Yet since inevitably these projects are financed by
taxes no net increase in employment will occur. This is for the
simple reason that the money removed from the private sector in taxes
is no longer available to fulfill the countless desires that ordinary
taxpayers could have put it to. The money spent in filling these
desires would have created economic activity and thus employment too.
But these economic activities are never seen. Just like the tailor in
our first example they remain invisible to the public.<BR>

<BR>

It is important to add that this argument is not one against all
public works. If a bridge or road project is clearly needed for
traffic flow than it can be justified. It is the creation of economic
activity or of jobs that should never be used as an argument in favor
of a public project. The reason for this is that the economic
activity created by building a $100 million bridge must inevitably
require the destruction of economic activity in the private sector.
Because the private economy is always a more effective engine of
economic growth than the government the amount of economic activity
destroyed will always be more than that created.<BR>

<BR>

All business in the private sector survive by offering something we
want for a price we will pay. The strict rule of competition
guarantees us that businesses that can't do this fall by the wayside.
These tough requirements push all private business in the direction
of maximizing productivity. The maximization of productivity puts the
most goods and services on the market at the best possible price. The
net effect of everyone trying to be productive to meet the demands of
the market must causes the economy to grow in the direction of full
production and maximum output. It is this natural flow that leads to
full employment. An economy fully involved in its natural pursuit of
growth will use all the labor it can find.<BR>

<BR>

Government is constantly worried about unemployment since an
unemployed voter is an unhappy voter. However, much of what the
government does increases unemployment rather than reduces it. This
comes from the failure to look at policies in the context of the
entire economy rather than just one group or segment. An example
might be government's attempts to subsidize a fading industry. (Such
as sugar or pineapple here in Hawaii.) When private companies get
into trouble it is because there is either too little demand for
their product or competitors can produce it more efficiently than
they can. In the case of Hawaii's agricultural dinosaurs foreign
competition was blamed. In the case of the buggy industry the
automobile was blamed. In both cases it was the market's natural
direction to produce the products the public wants at the best price
that was the real cause. Attempts to stop this from happening hurt
everyone. It is true that large numbers of agricultural workers faced
dislocation with the winding up of our local sugar industry. It is
equally true that the taxes used to support their industry would
dislocate even more workers in other industries. To take taxes away
from economic activities that are strong and healthy to support ones
which are weak is counterproductive to the interests of the
community. The capital and labor released with the closing down of
old and inefficient firms is needed to fuel the growth of new
industries and productive firms. In the case of the dislocated
workers their unemployment insurance and other direct benefits are
far less intrusive to this process of economic growth than keeping
them on in unproductive companies.<BR>

<BR>

THE IMPORTANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY AND SAVINGS<BR>

<BR>

Government policies should not focus blindly on the reduction of
unemployment. Countries like India have a far higher percentage of
people working than we do. What they lack is the productivity our
work force has. Therefore they lack the real economic benefits that
come, not from full employment, but from full production. Government
must understand that the free market system will naturally direct the
factors leading to increased production to those most capable of
using them. The factors are labor, capital, and land. The business
people who utilize them to create economic growth constitute one last
factor; entrepreneurship. Competition among the "entrepreneurs" leads
to those best qualified having the most factors at their disposal.
This leads to the most effective economic growth.<BR>

<BR>

Workers are made more productive by the use of more capital assets.
These are the machines we employ to do our work. They are the reason
a 20th century secretary can produce far more copies of a document in
a hour than say a medieval monk could writing by hand. It is the
accumulation of capital assets that make business efficient and
workers productive. America's great wealth in capital assets is the
principal reason we don't have to work as hard as people in third
world countries and can enjoy higher standard of living to boot.<BR>

<BR>

True capital assets are those used directly in the production of
goods or services. Durable consumer goods are another part of the
increase in wealth that is funded by higher productivity. These are
things like houses and cars that are expensive and last a long time.
It is the combination of true capital assets, (those used in
production), and durable consumer goods that make up the increase in
wealth over time. In our personal lives we obtain these items through
hard work and savings. It is the net effect of the hard work and
savings of all the people in the community that leads to the increase
in the standard of living free enterprise promises. What is
surprising is how many people fail to understand that what's good for
them as individuals is good for the society as a whole. Antiwork and
antisavings policies are more often than not part of our government's
economic policy.<BR>

<BR>

When people save they really invest. This is except for the few
eccentrics who hoard fortunes under the mattress. The savings not
available for immediate use are loaned out by a bank or other
mechanism to fund someone's business or new house or whatever. It
must be understood that it is things that are being loaned not money.
Money is just a contrivance we use to keep track of economic
transactions. You do not create wealth by loaning money. The idea
that both the saver and the borrower now have the money thus doubling
the wealth is nonsense. This is because at any given time the amount
of actual things that exist is finite. It is always things being
loaned not money. The homeowner is actually borrowing the house not
the mortgage money. The businessman borrows the construction
equipment and laborers to build his project. Loan officers are
trained to see to it only the most qualified people get to use the
money that has been voluntarily entrusted to them. This is in keeping
with the workings of the free market that directs resources to the
best potential users.<BR>

<BR>

Now consider what happens when the government borrows money.
Government officials love to do this since people see it as less
painful than paying taxes. It is often worse. When government borrows
it competes with everyone else who wants to borrow for the use of the
things to be borrowed. The government takes an amount of economic
resources away from the private sector in relationship to its total
spending without regard to the method of finance. This is because it
is borrowing or taxing away actual tangible things rather than money.
Money has no actual economic existence. Since government is not
directed by the rules of the free market it doesn't use those things
as efficiently as the private sector would. When it borrows it taxes.
When it goes to deeply into debt higher direct taxes, (usually aimed
at the most productive elements in the economy), must inevitably
follow.<BR>

<BR>

THE CONVENTION CENTER<BR>

<BR>

Consider for a minute the convention center the State of Hawaii is
now building. The State is spending 350 million dollars of public
money to complete a project no one in the private sector would touch.
No private investor was willing to risk their money to build and own
a convention center of the scale and cost requested by Hawaii's Hotel
industry. That should pretty much tell you what the best private
businessmen think of the likelihood this venture will be profitable.
Yet the taxpayers money is to be risked in this undertaking by State
officials whose knowledge of business comes from books and
consultants rather than from the competitive world that private
investors are familiar with.<BR>

<BR>

It seems the Hotel industry has convinced the State of Hawaii that we
"need" a convention center. Yet they are unwilling to build it
themselves. This is no different than a small shopping center telling
the government they need a nearby lot razed and a paved for
additional parking. It's clear how they will benefit, but a mystery
how that constitutes a public purpose. The Hotel industry has already
conned the government into limiting the number of Waikiki Hotel rooms
to 37,000. This has kept out competition and allowed existing hotels
to avoid spending money upgrading their deteriorating buildings. Now
they want the tax payers to build them a convention center and
subsidize the maintenance of it for decades into the future. There is
no reason why we should give in to this. The visitor industry is a
private not a public interest. The free markets will ultimately work
to insure we continue to have visitors and their money coming into
our state. Public areas such as the airports, roads, beaches, and
parks, are the government's responsibility. Building commercial
structures is not.<BR>

<BR>

The 350 million dollars the convention center will cost us is 350
million dollars that could have gone to promote economic growth in a
thousand different ways. Ways that are now to be unseen just as the
tailor was unseen in our first example. This is not all, because our
state has an unfortunate history of wasting our tax money on big
ticket white elephant projects. Spending Federal money on them only
helps us if one chooses to forget the IRS payments we all have to
make. The H&copy;3 project that took twenty years and cost a billion
dollars is money that could have enriched us in far more productive
ways.<BR>

<BR>

Since it should be clear that the free market will inevitably strive
to please the desires of the public in the most effective way it
should also be clear that removing labor and capital from its control
and putting them at the disposal of government functionaries should
only be done where it is clear the private sector cannot readily
perform the task at hand. The projected benefits should be those that
can be enjoyed by the public as a whole rather than some powerful
interest group.<BR>

<BR>

I favor policies aimed at reducing government spending. Government
should ultimately be doing only those things the private sector and
private sector non profits cannot do. In "Economics 102" I discuss my
views on helping the poor and the working man. For the other elements
of society it should be clear they are best helped by being left
alone.</P>

For decades the Democratic party has put itself forward as the
champion of the poor and the working class. In the views of many it
seems there is a constant struggle between rich and poor,capitalist
and laborer to obtain the benefits from our economy. The truth is
we're all in the same boat. We all compete againsteach other on the
small scale, but on the large scale therelationships between the
classes haven't changed much no matter what the government policy has
been.<BR>

<BR>

For example the percentage of the gross national product attributed
to wages between 1935 and 1939 was almost identical to the period
between 1956 and 1960. It is almost always about 69%. Profits are
almost always 6%. What changes in time is not the way the pie
isdivided up but the size of the pie itself. Economics is not a
zerosum game. We enrich ourselves by hard work and savings, not
byattempting to change the rules of the market place.<BR>

<BR>

THE HISTORICAL VIEW<BR>

<BR>

Poverty in this country decreased in every decade between 1900
and1960 except for the depression period of the 1930's. This
wasbecause of the enormous increase in capital assets
businessacquired. Capital assets are the machines that improve worker
productivity. These productivity enhancing machines enabled
theAmerican working class to achieve a standard of living
unparalleledin the history of labor. It was their increased
productivity thatenabled our country to put out vast amounts of goods
and servicesat low cost. This is what creates a high standard of
living andultimately reduces poverty.<BR>

<BR>

What frightens people is the history of the hard workingconditions,
they've been told about, during the period around theturn of the
century. No one is anxious to return to a countrywhere the working
class worked a 72 hour week and still lived inabysmal poverty. The
rich of the time lived in great houses atNewport and elsewhere.
People attribute this wealth distributionallocation as natural to the
free enterprise system. This is notthe case.<BR>

<BR>

America in 1870 had a growing manufacturing base and a populationof
under forty million. By 1910 we were an industrial giant witha
population of over ninety million. In that short forty years
oureconomic growth had sucked up available labor like a vacuum
cleanerin its drive to increase productivity. Millions of poor
unskilledlaborers entered the US from Europe and found ready
employment. The rate of growth overused labor. But the long work
weeks ofthose times and impoverished conditions were not much
differentfrom what ordinary people had experienced for thousands of
years inpreindustrial times. The accumulation of savings in the hands
ofthe rich and middle classes made sure capital could increase
andpoverty eventually be reduced. The point is America was not richin
capital before the great wave of immigration andindustrialization. It
could not have supported the enormousincrease in population in
anything but poverty. Due to thesacrifices made by this generation
future generations of workerscould count on a better life and higher
standard of living.<BR>

<BR>

The America of today is not like the America of a century ago.
Releasing the forces of the free market will not reduce workers
topoverty but will increase their standard of living just as it did
in the past.<BR>

<BR>

LABOR LEGISLATION<BR>

<BR>

Legislation passed to help workers has been a mixed bag at best
interms of helping them. The government's may reasonably claim
apublic interest in passing laws aimed at protecting health
andsafety. Laws aimed at raising real wages cannot help workers as
awhole and seldom help anyone. The shortening of the work week from72
hours to first 60, than to 48, may be justified in terms ofprotecting
the health of the work force. It must logically reducereal wages. Our
country's increase in labor productivity in thiscentury allowed us to
decrease average work hours while stillincreasing our standard of
living. The most recent decrease to theforty hour week gave us more
leisure, but less wealth. Since thenwe see that the time leisure time
that was at first created has infact been made up for in the increase
of two earner families, thegrowth in the number of people who work
two jobs, and the manypeople who work long hours on a salaried or
commissioned basis. Only by increasing our productivity can we
increase our wages. This is because the more we all produce the more
we all have. Thefree market has found ways to override the forty hour
week. Thatis because the amount of wealth such work hours created
proved lessthan the amount American's desired.<BR>

<BR>

Trade Unions do a valuable service to their members in protectingthem
from exploitative employers. To do this they need thegovernment to
protect their right to organize and to strike. WhenUnions influence
government to pass mandatory benefits for allworkers in the economy
they do not help their members. This issince now those benefits are
no longer subject to negotiation. Thebenefits mandated by government
may not be what all workers orother unions want. Benefits come as
part of a compensationpackage. It is a mistake to view them as paid
for by management. They are actually paid for by a reduction in funds
available tolabor in form of wages. This reduction takes either the
directform of a smaller paycheck or the indirect form of
inflation.'<BR>

<BR>

So mandatory benefits are not principally paid for by workers
notemployers. The cost of workman's compensation insurance and
otherbenefits are tied to an employer's payroll. They are linked to
thenumber of workers and the amount of their salaries. These
benefitscome directly out of the 69% commonly allocated to total
wages inthe economy and not out of the 6% allocated to profits. The
lawsof economics dictate this. Politicians strive to obscure this
factby making most mandated benefits nontaxable and nonincluded
inworkers gross income reports. This is only an accounting trick.<BR>

<BR>

There is no way labor can, on net, benefit itself at the expense
ofmanagement. Attempts to do so create inflation, unemployment, anda
reduction in the standard of living. Individual unions may dobetter
in some industries. This is why people join them. Theoverall effect
of mandating benefits is to depress the portion ofwages we actually
see in our paychecks.<BR>

<BR>

Most employees do want and often need the benefits that
accompanywages as part of their compensation package. The issue isn't
thevalue of the benefits. It is the government deciding for
workerswhat benefits they must have then misleading them about who
ispaying for it.<BR>

<BR>

THE MINIMUM WAGE<BR>

<BR>

The minimum wage is often sighted as a boon to workers at the lowend
of the productivity latter. This is probably the silliest ideaever
dreamed up as a way of helping people. It does not and cannotgive any
worker a higher standard of living than his productivityallows. It
creates unemployment which reduces the overallproductivity of the
economy. It creates the ready pool ofunemployed workers that are a
constant threat to job security. This does not help wages. It also
creates inflation that eats awayat the paychecks of every worker.<BR>

<BR>

Let's look at an example of how the minimum wage effects labor.
Suppose a businessman can afford to pay $12.00 per hour to have abit
of unskilled work done. He hires three men to do it and paysthem each
$4.00 per hour. Then the government comes along and sayshe must pay a
minimum wage of $5.50 per hour. So then he fires oneof his three
workers. With two workers left the work gets harderto finish on time.
It is done less well and with more effort by twothan it was by three.
Meanwhile one worker who had a $4.00 perhour job has now got a zero
dollar per hour job since he has beenfired. While unemployed he
stills needs food and shelter sosomeone must step in to provide these
things. Unless he hasacquire a nest egg on his $4.00 per hour wage
his support must nowcome from the work done by others. The economy
has lost thebenefits of this man's labor and he has lost the
satisfaction ofsupporting himself. The overall effect is the
reduction ofproductivity as workers with marginal skills are now
contributing nothing to the economic well being of the community.<BR>

<BR>

Workers who were making $5.50, or above, before the minimum wagewere
being paid based on their productivity. All of them are hurt.
Inflation comes as there are now fewer goods and services produced.
The inflation reduces the pay of the worker who was making $5.50per
hour before it became the minimum wage. Plus he losesnegotiating
strength with his employer due to the rise inunemployment that has
occurred. No one has gained anything for thesimple reason that wealth
is not created by the stroke of agovernment pen. If it were we could
simply legislate a minimumwage of twenty or fifty dollars an hour and
expect to be rich andhappy ever after.<BR>

<BR>

If the company tries to simply raise it's prices to make up for
theincreased cost of unskilled labor inflation is the result.
Thisinflation will move throughout the entire economy as everyone
makesadjustments in turn. This inevitably erodes the real purchasing
power intended by the creation of a minimum wage.<BR>

<BR>

In Hawaii we saw the effective minimum wage rise by almost two
dollars per hour above the legal minimum in the late eighties
andearly nineties. We had unemployment on Oahu of less than 1%.
Employers were competing with each other for the small availablel
abor pool. One well known restaurant brought in unskilled workersfrom
Micronesia, paid them $1.50 above the legal minimum and put them up
in housing. This shortage of labor drove up wages throughthe old and
familiar mechanism of supply and demand. What caused the shortage was
an ocean of foreign capital flowing into our stateand driving the
economy towards full production. If Hawaii'slegislature was serious
about raising the wages of unskilled laborhere they would take steps
to encourage capital investment in ourislands by altering the
anti-savings and anti-capital elements of our tax code.<BR>

<BR>

We should be concerned about the standard of living of thoseworking
at low paying unskilled jobs. We must understand that theminimum wage
doesn't help them. The only way they can earn more isto become more
productive. This is in fact what happens to mostpeople if they stay
in the labor force. Keeping many able bodiedpeople in idleness
because the minimum wage has eliminated many lowpaying jobs doesn't
allow those people to gain the work experiencethey need to acquire
genuine increases in their wages. We may lookat other means at
helping the poor and the working poor. Privatecharities can help with
housing and other essentials. Thegovernment could help these folks
far less harmfully with suchoptions as tax credits, or housing
vouchers. Still all thegovernment ideas are ultimately harmful to the
economy as a wholesince they divert resources away from individuals
who will use themto the greatest net benefit for the economy. These
measures should only be warranted where people or their children face
hungerand hopelessness.<BR>

<BR>

WELFARE<BR>

<BR>

This leads us to a discussion of the poor and of our social
welfaresystem. In a civilized society the essential needs of
survivalshould be provided to everyone in genuine need. American's
shouldnot face starvation and hopelessness whether it be due to
misfortune or their own irresponsibility. Aid should be givenbased
solely on the need not the circumstances that created it.<BR>

<BR>

The public welfare system doesn't work that way. It has
facilitatedsingle parent families by denying benefits where two
parents are ina home. In prior generations a teenage girl had three
option whenshe found herself pregnant out of wedlock. She could get
married,give up the baby for adoption, or file a paternity suit.
Sheseldom could look to her parents to pay for the kid's
upbringing.Parents in those days expected her to marry. She and the
child'sfather were to be held responsible. Nowadays, if the father
stayswith her the child must be supported by the income earned by
theyoung couple. If he disappears the mom get a monthly check. Thisis
wrongheaded. The father should be in the picture if notphysically at
least financially. If the two of them together runinto a financial
crises then they should be helped. Their should beno discrimination
based on them being together rather than apart.<BR>

<BR>

Young mothers who do end up alone should be allowed to work
withoutlosing needed benefits. They should be encouraged to reduce
expenses by setting up house with another adult, perhaps anothergirl
in a similar situation. Then one of them could babysit whilethe other
worked. Only by allowing young people the right to work and save can
they ever get out of poverty. Giving people onwelfare a lifelong
series of checks while denying them benefits should they find work
doesn't allow them to improve their jobskills or begin savings.
Direct and demonstrable economic needshould be the criteria for aid
given without regards to employment.<BR>

<BR>

The aid is best given by private charities. Government may playthe
donor of last resort, but in doing so should do it at thecounty or
local level and not through some big bureaucracy following federal
rules and guidelines. The emphasis on aid should be immediate help
with a plan to get the person back on their feet.It should not bs
seen as a lifelong entitlement.<BR>

<BR>

Keeping large numbers of employable people outside of the workforcel
imits overall productivity. In the case of the three workers
whobecame two workers, (in our example of the minimum wage,) keeping
people from working means there will be fewer goods and
servicesproduced. This means a smaller amount for everyone to share.
Usingthe tax code to help the working poor is a better government
policythan our current welfare system. This tax help policy is still
asubsidy and therefore takes some of the productivity out of the
economy. It at least does not deny to the economy the contributions
that people now on welfare could provide throughtheir labor.<BR>

<BR>

We must ultimately understand that the taxes used to pay forwelfare
limit economic growth and therefore job creation in theprivate
sector. By reducing the portion of the poor's economic needs which
are funded in this manor we will help to create thejobs they need to
support themselves.<BR>

<BR>

Since we declared "War on Poverty" in the sixties the trend
towardsthe reduction of poverty in our country that had been a
crowningachievement of this century has stopped. (First it slowed and
inthe seventies it reversed itself.) The principal reason is that
inthe past poor people were encouraged to marry and stay together.
Their work was welcomed by our economy. Many of them did get
aheadthrough hard work and savings. These are the means that
individuals use to achieve economic growth. The sum of all the
individuals doing things this way creates growth for the nation. Our
welfare system actively discourages all of these positivetraits while
offering a lifetime of checks as an alternative. Thechecks are never
large enough to provide those on welfare thestandard of living they
want. The threat of losing this cash flow keeps them from working and
getting the job experience they need.<BR>

<BR>

THE DISABLED AND ELDERLY<BR>

<BR>

There will always be many people who can't support themselvesthrough
their own labor. In cases where they do not have othermeans of
support they should receive aid. Private aid fromorganizations like
the Salvation Army, or the IHS is preferred topublic aid. Private aid
comes voluntarily and with less regulationsand overhead. Public aid
as a last may still be given. It should be there as the first line of
help I believe that private charitiescan support the poor and the
disabled if we change the income taxcode to give donations to support
them more favorable treatment. We also need to reestablish the basic
virtue of taking some personal responsibility for those in need. Too
many people shrugand think if they pay their taxes they've been
charitable. If I amproved wrong about private organization's ability
to adequately support those in need I will endorse other
measures.<BR>

<BR>

One possible means of supporting disabled people is the so
called"Lottery of the Blind". In Spain the blind operate their
ownnationwide lottery. They do all the work and keep all the money.
There is plenty of money earned in this fashion to support all of
Spain's blind. Such a system here could work to employ and supportour
disabled. I do believe such a lottery would be preferred to alottery
controlled by the legislature.<BR>

<BR>

In summary I will say that the Democratic Party's continual claim
that they are the party of the poor and the working class should
beviewed in relation to the actual result of the programs they have
fostered. For the most part they have done more harm than good. We
must judge public policies and the political leaders who supportthem
by the results. Political leaders love to call each other names and
mock each others positions. If we listen only to thisnoise and do not
evaluate results we will continue to have the bad results we have had
so far.</P>

<BR>

<BR>

I support the complete and immediate legalization of Marijuana. This
means possession, production, and sale with no more restrictions than
those currently applicable to alcohol or tobacco products.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>I look to the following points in favor of this
position. </B></P>

<P>1. Marijuana was legal and widely used in this country until the
1930s without ill effect on the national well-being.<BR>

<BR>

<B>2.</B> The <I>"Reefer Madness"</I> and <I>"Weed With Roots in
Hell"</I> campaign that led to its illegality in 1937 was not
supported by any scientific evidence. In fact evidence suggest it was
funded in part by manufacturers of synthetic fibers who had a vested
interest in eliminating natural hemp as a competitive product in the
manufacture of rope and other products.<BR>

<BR>

<B>3. </B>After exhaustive study the Nixon commission on drugs could
find no harm in its use and in 1971 recommended its legalization. I
believe this recommendation was ignored because the people who used
marijuana were viewed as enemies of the administration, (hippies,
anti-war demonstrators, etc.). Had the profile of the typical user
been a "hard hat for Nixon" there is no doubt in my mind it would be
legal today.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.</B> Only after years of illegality was any serious attempt made
to find harmful effects associated with Marijuana use. After repeated
attempts it detractors finally resorted to experimentation that so
blatantly ignored scientific standards as to make a mockery of its
findings.<BR>

<BR>

<B>5.</B> The medical benefits of Marijuana particularly in treatment
of the nausea associated with cancer treatment are well
established.<BR>

<BR>

<B>6.</B> No one who argues that Marijuana is harmful to the
individual has been able to argue that incarcerating them is not
harmful.<BR>

<BR>

<B>7.</B> The cost to the criminal justice system to arrest,
prosecute, and incarcerate, individuals under these laws is diverting
scarce resources from legitimate crime fighting.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I>Against some of the points above were the
following arguments.</I></B></P>

<P><B>1.</B> Marijuana causes apathy and lack of ambition. This may
be true in the small percentage of users who become hard core "pot
heads." It is not by any means characteristic of the vast majority of
users any more than a skid row alcoholic represents most drinkers.
The fact is even the most serious marijuana smokers are capable of
supporting themselves in contrast to the serious alcoholics. How this
argument supports imprisoning people is not at all clear.<BR>

<BR>

<B>2.</B> Marijuana is a carcinogenic similar to tobacco. See faulty
studies referred to in #4 above. Again even taken at its face value
this argument does not support illegality. Hang gliding, skydiving,
and surfing, are all popular recreational activities which are
clearly dangerous yet no one suggests making them criminal.<BR>

<BR>

<B>3.</B> Marijuana leads to "hard drugs." There are so many
fallacies connected to this argument it is difficult to organize
their rebuttal. The traditional argument reports that 97 to 99% (or
some other high percentage), of say heroin addicts started drug usage
with marijuana. It is a backwards correlation that shows no evidence
of cause and effect. One can demonstrate its fallacy by applying the
argument to other circumstances. For example one could say 99% of
shark attack victims learned to swim before they were attacked,
therefore learning to swim causes shark attacks. Anyone can quickly
point out the ridiculousness of this correlation by inquiring as to
the millions of swimmers who are never attacked. The fact is only a
small fraction of marijuana users ever go on to hard drugs.<BR>

<BR>

The second fallacy is that people who use hard drugs "started' with
marijuana. Virtually every one of them drank beer or smoked
cigarettes prior to using marijuana. Yet no one argues for laws
against these two drugs on the grounds they lead to marijuana
use.<BR>

<BR>

The problem is that in including a harmless drug such as marijuana in
the same category as cocaine or heroin the government loses
credibility with the segments of the public they are trying to
educate. Cocaine was spreading like wildfire in this country in the
early eighties since people didn't take the government's positions
seriously. Only widespread evidence of cocaine's potential for harm,
(that was reported in the independent press), led people away from
it. In short crying wolf about marijuana has hurt rather than helped
our country deal with its drug problems.</P>

<BR>

<BR>

Hawaii Opposes Prostitution Enforcement is a group that believes that
private sexual activities between consenting adults are not the
business of government. The government has no business criminalizing
such perfectly lawful activity merely because an exchange of money is
involved. We do not challenge the government's power to regulate
commerce. However, here we believe the government must have a clearly
defined and readily demonstrable position.<BR>

<BR>

In passing the current prostitution law our legislature could not
find compelling evidence that the law served any of it's classically
defended objectives such as the suppression of STD's or the
protection of women and girls from exploitation. They defined he
public purpose in the law as public demand.<BR>

We did random calling via the phone book last year to inquire as to
peoples attitudes towards the law. We talked to over a hundred people
and found approximately 70% were in favor of legalizing prostitution.
Other reports support this. I understand the Mayor polled his own
cabinet recently and found almost all of them agreed legalization is
the better way to go.<BR>

<BR>

Unfortunately, opponents to the change in law we seek are very adept
at rounding up like minded people to direct complaints to elected
officials. This has caused fear among our legislature and council
members. One only need to look at Waikiki to see how this happens.
The "<I>Advertiser</I>" did a story in January of 1994 about the
problem of streetwalkers there. There was plenty of negative quotes
from the vice squad and the citizens group making complaints. Yet
when the reporter asked people at random, on the sidewalks near the
prostitutes, positive comments out numbered negative ones by four to
one. If prostitutes are irritating people are they any worse than the
sidewalk preachers screaming out scripture or the people who come to
your door to sell and preach. Why should those people be protected by
free speech guarantees while words from a prostitute can get her
thirty days in jail?<BR>

<BR>

There are certainly problems relating to prostitution. The peoplewho
like to harp on them never seem to understand that prostitutes are a
lot of different people with a lot of different experiences. Some are
abused by pimps and some aren't. Some steal and some don't. Some grab
and hassle passers by and some don't. Some have terrible drug
problems and some don't. The law makes all the problems worse and
harms a number of people who had no problem to begin with.<BR>

<BR>

Some will argue that prostitutes are so badly treated that what
weneed to do is "help" them by strict enforcement of <I>"John
Laws"</I>. These people tend to see prostitution as equivalent to
rape and Johns as disgusting users of women. The argument fails in
its inability to distinguish between coercion and reward. Those who
coerce or have knowledge of it may be culpable. With legal
prostitution the women would have the same protections from the
department of labor, etc. as in any other workers.</P>

HEIGHT=73 ALIGN=bottom naturalsizeflag="3"><BR>

To be brief there is very little left of the Bill of Rights. For the
last thirty years the federal government has systematically
compromised them. Of course the federal government was not entirely
to blame. in former times many of the states abused their power by
instituting racist and segregationist measures. This led the federal
government to rightly intervene in the 1960's. Unfortunately in so
doing the Feds took the attitude that the federal government could
dictate to the States on any and all issues regardless of
constitutional authority. At this point we lost the ninth and tenth
amendments to the Constitution that sought to limit federal authority
to only those powers directly listed in the Constitution. All the
states lost the power to determine how to deal with such issues as
crime, welfare, the public schools, even the speed limit without any
rationale except the attitude of the US congress that they were the
unquestioned experts on all topics.<BR>

<BR>

A further blow was dealt to the ninth amendment (that served as a
disclaimer to the Constitution) in 1987's infamous Hardwick case. The
ninth amendment briefly indicated that just because a personal
liberty isn't listed in the Constitution doesn't mean it doesn't
exist. Obviously no document could ever list all freedoms. However,
in the Hardwick case, that dealt with sodomy, the Supreme Court held
anti&copy;sodomy laws to be constitutional on the grounds no right to
sodomy appeared spelled out in the document. Many anti-gay people
hailed this as a victory. What no one realized was the underlying
shift in the entire basis of Constitutional law that the justices had
to go through to reach their conclusion. The decision you see could
only have been reached by viewing the Constitution as a limitation of
personal rights rather than of government powers.<BR>

<BR>

The Warren Court made a number of decisions that outlined the rights
of accused persons. Controversy followed as these decisions often
seemed to allow guilty persons to escape the law on "technicalities".
By the Nixon years, with crime on the rise, a clamor began to appoint
"law and order" judges who would limit the protection of accused
persons. Again elements of the public failed to appreciate the
protections they strove to limit were needed to protect innocent
people from warrantless of even malicious prosecutions. The endless
and fruitless war on drugs that also began under the Nixon
administration gave additional ammunition to these "strip the bill of
rights" types. This attempt to deal with a social and health problem
with criminal law was bound to fail. Yet as its failure became more
and more obvious the blame was continually put on insufficient police
powers rather than faulty logic.<BR>

<BR>

The fourth amendment required searches to be made only after a
warrant is issued based on an oath of affirmation and describing the
place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. Searches
based on anonymous and dubious tips are now conducted all the time.
Police have been given wide ranging powers to search people, or their
property, based on the policeman's professional hunches. In fact,
when the exact wording to this fourth amendment was introduced by a
South Carolina Congressman into the 1994 Federal anti-crime bill it
was voted down 316 to 79.<BR>

<BR>

The property seizure laws pretty well complete the picture of
Americans loss our protection from overzealous law enforcement. These
seizure laws have stood up to Constitutional questioning on the
sophistry that it is the property that is tainted and not the
individual. The rules of evidence are ignored. There's no presumption
of innocence, so you have to prove you aren't guilty. You can't
demand a jury trial. You can't confront the person who made the
accusation against you. There is no court appointed attorney (even if
the government has just bankrupted you) and your property can be
taken without compensation. In other words say goodby to the fifth,
sixth, seventh, and eighth amendments.<BR>

<BR>

The seventh amendment requires a jury trial for amounts in dispute of
more than $20. The fine in Hawaii for prostitution is $500. Yet the
courts have ruled that people charged with prostitution are not
entitled to a jury trial. Figure that one out.<BR>

<BR>

The eighth amendment prohibits excessive fines. In the case of asset
seizures the fines can be defined as unlimited. Is that not
excessive?<BR>

<BR>

The first and second amendments are constantly being attacked and
fought over. Religious conservatives want to water down the
prohibition against the government establishing religion that's in
the first amendment. Censorship groups want to limit the right of
free speech. Simple minded patriots want to punish political
protesters who burn the flag. At least the courts are still
protecting the first amendment, but who can say what will happen if
our elected leaders start off on a program of appointing "family
values and patriotism" judges just as the last twenty years have seen
the appointment of "law and order" types with disastrous effects on
our liberties.<BR>

<BR>

The second amendment which allows people to own guns is always in
controversy. In the main there is the desire to prevent crime,
although the link between crime and guns has never been established.
The percentage of citizens who owned a gun in the colonial days the
framers of our Constitution were familiar with was certainly higher
than it is today. Yet they did not have anywhere near the crime we do
now. What's often forgotten in the gun controversy is that
individuals rights are supposed to pre-empt government power in this
country. To disarm the populace implies all power belongs to the
government.<BR>

<BR>

We must argue for our freedoms. We don't have to fight and die for
them as our colonial forefathers did. But if we do not begin to
support only those candidates who stand firmly behind the
Constitutional limits on government authority we may indeed lose just
what they fought so hard to gain for us.</P>

<BR>

The Democratic Party of Hawaii has no typical member. They are very
proud to try to represent everyone. Indeed the vastly differing
stands on issues voiced by various elements in this party attest to
this.<BR>

<BR>

What is disturbing is the extent to which issues and principals seem
to take a back seat to retaining power. A political party that seeks
to expel people who have publicly supported members of other parties
is putting party loyalty before public interest.<BR>

<BR>

This is a party who rejected ideas from Ann Kobayashi and Donna Ikeda
when they were Republicans. After switching parties they became
powerful committee chairs whose ideas were praised and copied. Such a
simplistic approach may serve the party's desire to retain a monopoly
of power, but only does harm to you the voting public.<BR>

<BR>

The Democratic Party of Hawaii once did stand for something. For
decades many intelligent and hardworking residents were limited to
performing physical labor by an inherent racism. When they got there
chance at politics the Democratic Party was their friend. No one can
blame them for giving this party their loyalty and support. Times
have changed since 1954. Asian Americans make up the backbone of our
business community. As such they know full well how the intrusiveness
of Hawaii's busybody state government adversely effects the lives of
our people. They vote for democrats who continue to back policies
appropriate to a bygone era. Why not look to a new party and it's
ideas?<BR>

<BR>

I know if you have bothered to read this you are intelligent and open
minded. I hope you will considered the programs I put forth as in
your interests and will give me your support.</P>

If you are a small business person in Hawaii and you do not support
my election you are out of your mind. I will be a true and committed
friend to those who want government out of your hair. I will also
fight to keep the government form using your tax money to subsidize
big businesses that have more clout than you do. The government
should neither hamper you or favor them.<BR>

<BR>

I am not a Republican. I am a Libertarian. I have nothing to gain
from such an association except principal. One reason I am running
for office is because we have so few people in our legislature who
will stand up for any principals. My stands onending the drug war and
legalizing marijuana may not be yours. You should know they are the
views now held by many leading conservatives such as William F
Buckley, Jr, and the "National Review" (see 2/9/96 issue).<BR>

<BR>

In truth many of you may find some of my views to be quite out ofstep
with your own. You may be interested in a "family values"agenda which
runs against the tone of my campaign. However, since you are reading
this I must assume you are not anxious to give your vote to my
opponent. In doing so you will only be contributing to the
perpetuation of the monopoly of power long held by the Democratic
Party. Please do not do this.</P>

<BR>

I have been working for six years to improve the lives of
transgendered people. One of the principal reasons I became active in
politics was to abolish the laws crininalizing prostitution. Such
laws fall with disproportionate weight on transgendered persons.<BR>

<BR>

In the 1995 legislative session bills aimed at increasing the
penalties for persons offering sex for money by the respective
judiciary chairmen; (Terrance Tom in the House and Rey Graulty in the
Senate). They wanted to put prostitutes to get a six month mandatory
sentence. I received help from the ACLU and the Libertarian Party of
Hawaii. It was not enough to see the bill pass both houses of the
legislature with only two opposing votes. Those votes came from
Republican women. All the Democrats sat by while it passed. Many of
those same Democrats will be recommended to you as pro-gay, by gay
Democrats who seem to forget the term "gay, lesbian, and
transgendered" community includes transgendered persons.<BR>

<BR>

The struggle for personal liberty is everyone's struggle. To fight
for one's own rights while turning a blind eye on injustices
elsewhere does one no credit.<BR>

<BR>

Many of you heard the Democratic Party functionary who was given a
forum at the Gay Pride Rally on June 29th. He made excuses and
apologies. Do you really believe Bill Clinton was "forced" by the
Republicans to support legislation against gay marriage? Do you
really believe the party that has controlled both legislature and
governorship since that controversy began four years ago has not
blocked it's implementation? If I were governor there would be no
appeal made in court at all. It's really that simply done.<BR>

<BR>

I hope this will open your eyes to looking hard at alternatives. I
know many of you have voted Democrat before, not out of inclination,
but out of repulsion from the anti-gay attitudes of their opponents.
Please do more to investigate the Libertarian Party. Do not rely on a
few rumors or negative remarks about us spread by Democratic
acquaintances.<BR>

<BR>

Please do support me. I am a candidate who runs out of anger at the
injustice and stupidity of the system. There will be few of my ilk
available in this campaign.</P>

<BR>

CRIME AND ITS PREVENTION<BR>

Crime in Hawaii and nationwide is an enormous area of concern. For
the last thirty years crime rates have been higher than in prior
decades. People look to government to perform the role of controlling
crime and of giving them a feeling of safety. However, things do not
seem to be getting better.<BR>

<BR>

We first need to examine the question of what is or isn't a crime. A
crime is a violation of a person's rights, be it by physical assault,
property theft or damage, or some type of fraud. This concept of
criminal conduct is so basic that all peoples and all governments
have agreed to sanctions against persons who commit such acts.
Unfortunately, governments have had a bad tendency to "criminalize" a
vast number of activities which do not fit this model.<BR>

<BR>

Political opponents of the regime, social nonconformists, those who
engage in potentially unhealthy behavior, or public scapegoats, are
too often included in the list of criminals. A worst example might
come from Germany under the Nazi's. There it was considered a
criminal act to hide Jews in your home in an attempt to protect them
from the Holocaust. After World War II the victors prosecuted not the
violators of these laws, but the individuals who enforced them. This
was because it was clear the Nazi laws were in themselves criminal
under the international understanding described above.<BR>

<BR>

In our country people have become confused on the point of what is or
is not criminal behavior. The belief is that since we live in a
democratic country with majority rule, government has the legal
authority to criminalize all sorts of behavior which is not
inherently criminal. We mistakenly believe our constitution will
protect us from excesses. What Americans do not appreciate is that
virtually all constitutions say many of the same high minded things
about personal liberty as ours does. Uninformed people reading the
constitution Stalin gave to the USSR or the Red Chinese constitution
might think those countries were models of freedom and democracy.<BR>

<BR>

What we are protected by is our will and ability to fight for our
constitutional rights, both enumerated and not. Our legal codes are
cluttered with inappropriate laws. Some, such as those preventing
interracial marriage have disappeared. Others, such as those
prohibiting sodomy, and prostitution, still exist in many
jurisdictions. But the area where the most problems and confusion
occurs is with our drug laws. There is nothing criminal about using
drugs under the proper definition of crime. Such behavior may be
stupid, unhealthy, even dangerous, but not criminal. The rationale
behind making such behavior criminal was that drug use rendered
people dysfunctional and therefore a burden or menace to others.
Criminal penalties were to be used to achieve social engineering.<BR>

<BR>

Despite the ridiculous failure of the prohibition of alcohol
lawmakers went right ahead thinking the same approach would work well
with such substances as heroin. It should have been obvious that
simply attempting to make heroin unavailable to those addicted to it
would not cause them to act in pro-social or constructive ways. The
opposite conclusion should have been reached. The anti-drug laws
restored to organized crime the sources of revenue that it had lost'
following the repeal of prohibition. Prohibiting drugs made them more
profitable to the gangsters who supplied them and added to the push
to addict more people.<BR>

<BR>

As prices rose addicts were forced to turn to other crimes
(principally theft and drug dealing) to support their habits. The
drug addiction problem got worse instead of better. Twenty-five years
after President Nixon declared war on drugs the situation has become
worse not better. We have spent billions of dollars and incarcerated
millions of nonviolent, nondangerous people with no noticeable
improvement and no end in sight. Politicians play to public anger and
frustration by jumping over themselves to see who can make the
toughest laws and build the most prisons. Yet that approach has no
track record of success.<BR>

<BR>

Our country has been blinded by its anger over drugs into rejecting
any proposed solutions that don't extract some sort of revenge on the
people involved. We must learn to understand that the function of law
enforcement is not revenge, but crime reduction. Ending the federal
drug war and allowing the states to experiment with various other
models will save billions of dollars and reduce crime more than any
other plan.<BR>

<BR>

CURING ADDICTION<BR>

Looking at heroin addiction on its face it would seem that what was
best for the addict would also be best for society. Treating addicted
people as if they have a health rather than a criminal problem makes
the most sense. For example the best thing for the addict would be to
go through a good rehab program and kick drugs entirely.<BR>

<BR>

The best inpatient programs cost much less than incarceration and are
seven times more effective.<BR>

<BR>

The second best option would be a methadone maintenance program. In
this case methadone replaces heroin as the addictive drug.<BR>

<BR>

The benefit is that methadone addiction is no where near as
dysfunctional. These people can work and support themselves. Since it
was the dysfunction of drug addiction which constituted the rationale
for criminalizing it in the first place this option is clearly in
line with conventional thinking. Suppose the rehab and methadone
options aren't available. The next best option for all concerned
would most certainly be to allow heroin addicts to obtain heroin.<BR>

<BR>

A medically supervised program of treating heroin addiction with
heroin insures the dosage is safe and the addict is not unduly
endangering himself. By removing his need to come up with hundreds or
thousands of dollars each week to buy heroin it also dramatically
reduces property crimes in the community at large. Finally it removes
the market from the control of the criminal drug empires. This option
is obviously an improvement over the current situation.<BR>

<BR>

I have used heroin as an example because of its long history and well
known properties. I do not claim expertise in the pharmacological
properties of all the various drugs now available. I do suggest that
in all cases a medical and scientific approach to limiting the harm
done by drugs in our society is preferred to the present one.<BR>

<BR>

THE CORRECT FUNCTION OF PRISONS<BR>

The concept of revenge and punishment goes to the second major
problem in law enforcement today; that of our prisons. Prison does
not seem to be providing much of a deterrent. The problem is not, as
is commonly assumed, the fault of the prisons "coddling" inmates or
in the sentences being too short. I can tell you no one wants to go
to prison. In the case of most of the victimless crimes the
individual is acting under extremely compelling reasons.<BR>

<BR>

A heroin addict doesn't stop needing heroin because its illegal. It
should be stated that in order to serve as an effective deterrent the
potential law breaker must feel he has a choice not to commit the
crime and a good possibility of imprisonment when he does. Most
criminals don't think this way. It is noncriminals who are in
actuality deterred.<BR>

<BR>

In the public's rush to make prisons more of a deterrent and extract
revenge on criminals we have allowed our prison population to grow
and the prisons themselves to become terrifying dens of the worst
kind of antisocial behavior. The public is outraged whenever a
murderer or rapist gets out early. In fact they have good reason to
complain as the average sentence served by such villains is half what
is was in 1980.<BR>

<BR>

The reason is that prisons are overcrowded with nonviolent drug
offenders serving mandatory sentences that the paroling authorities
cannot overrule. There are 450,000 people in jail in this country
right now for possession of marijuana. Murders and rapists are being
let out early so that these people can serve their full terms. We
certainly need to release the prisoners who pose no threat so the
dangerous ones can be kept behind bars.<BR>

<BR>

In addition we need to make fundamental changes in the way prisons
are operated to reduce the high rate of repeat offenders. Nine out of
ten men in the under thirty age group repeat offenses after being
released from jail. This indicates there is a problem. The problem is
that the inmates run the prisons. The guards may be there to prevent
escape, but in prisons in this country inmate societies control the
lives of the people incarcerated.<BR>

<BR>

In these societies all the worst elements, <I>(aggression, violence,
rule by the strong, duplicity, etc.)</I> are rewarded. The prisoners
play macho games with each other rather than learning how to
cooperate and get along the way they should. The horrors I've
described are often defended "by get tough on crime types" in the
mistaken belief that brutalizing convicts will scare people into not
committing crimes. Such tactics may work on you or me in reinforcing
our honest ways, but they haven't created any reduction in crime by
those less rationally inclined. The real downside is that men come
out worse men than when they went in. And sooner or later virtually
everyone who goes in comes out. San Francisco is experimenting with a
different kind of prison.<BR>

<BR>

As was reported on "60 Minutes" they've constructed a jail designed
and run by a former inmate. The concept involved complete control
twenty four hours a day of the inmates lives by the prison officials.
No opportunity is given for prisoners to interact in the negative
ways common in prisons. The prisoners learn the rules of life the
prison system wants them to learn and not the law of the jungle they
learn in other prisons.<BR>

<BR>

Early returns show a marked decrease in repeat offenders. This may
indeed be a better way to process offenders through the system. In
short to be effective prisons should assume most inmates will one day
return to open society. Given this they should take steps to insure
ex-convicts have learned how to live without victimizing others. All
who commit legitimate crimes should spend some time in jail. Only
those who commit heinous and violent crimes need the long sentences
called for so universally now for all lawbreakers. Even in such cases
where we may feel we can never release a particular person there
should still be some concept of helping him find personal
redemption.<BR>

<BR>

This idea of penance is what the American penitentiary system is
supposed to be about.<BR>

<BR>

YOUNG OFFENDERS<BR>

We have a growing problem in Hawaii connected to youth gangs. These
gangs have shown a tendency to become increasingly violent on the
mainland and we should be concerned about that here. What we first
need to do is look at our overall policy has it relates to teenagers
in Hawaii and how that policy as changed in the past ten years. Back
then we had no youth gang problem. So why do we have one now?<BR>

<BR>

If we look at government's approach to teen policy since 1986 we see
a consistent pattern of distrust and antipathy. This started with
raising the drinking age to 21, and continued with the introduction
of youth curfews, a 2.0 GPA requirement for student participation in
school sports and other activities, and vigorous enforcement of
status offenses. Status offenses are activities perfectly legal in
adults that can land a youth in a detention facility. Recently
attempts were made to raise the driving age. Compounded with this
attitude that our kids can't be trusted is terrible neglect of our
public schools.<BR>

<BR>

The physical condition of many existing school buildings and the
years it takes and ridiculous padding of costs involved in building
new schools is a statewide scandal. Kids are required to stay in
school until age 18 like it or not. The penalty for truancy can be
imprisonment.<BR>

<BR>

When looking at the overall picture it should seem no surprise that
many kids have become hostile. Learning comes from giving kids
responsibilities and letting them make their own mistakes. Certainly
they must learn the consequences of criminal misconduct. Where our
system falters is in seeming to prejudge all youth as potential
criminals. This attitude coming from the adult world does not sit
well with youth.<BR>

<BR>

A sixteen year old who doesn't want to be in school shouldn't be
compelled to be there. His presence will not enhance the learning
experience of the other students and he can't be forced to actually
learn something. We have a good GED program in Hawaii. I think it's
better for older teens who want to drop out at sixteen to learn about
the world to be permitted to do so. Later when they are motivated to
learn they can go for their GED. The 2.0 rule was intended to help
motivate marginal students to study harder. Unfortunately, like other
attempts to use force on teens it led to unforseen and unwanted
consequences.<BR>

<BR>

The increase in gang activity can perhaps be more directly traced to
this silly, albeit well intentioned, attempt to improve students
study habits than any other policy. Mainland cities with gang
problems have tried all sorts of free sports leagues and other
activities for youth, to keep them out of trouble. Why in Hawaii
which had no gang problem did we try the exact opposite approach.<BR>

<BR>

The situation here is not out of control yet. We are still better off
than cities such as Los Angeles. But the direction is not
encouraging. Instead of doing more of the same things that
facilitated the growth of gangs here you'd think people would be
arguing we reverse direction. No. After all that would be common
sense. Public policy in this country is being driven by the engine of
public anger and the desire for punishment, "get tough" and all the
other code words that boil down to ignoring the essential motivating
factors in human relationships.<BR>

<BR>

CONCLUSION<BR>

Most of us know that negative consequences can be expected when we
let go of our tempers. In our personal lives we strive to tackle
problems with reason and patience. Can't we see that what is good for
us personally is also good public policy. Our entire criminal justice
system is being driven by our anger and desire for revenge. What we
need is a cool analysis of what will make us safer.<BR>

<BR>

The word respect looms very large. Our lack of respect for other
people be they teenagers, drug addicts, or whatever doesn't make them
respect us, our rights, or our property. We can reduce crime, treat
addiction, and make our streets safe again. But these things will
never happen as long as our policies remain so confused, misdirected,
and improperly motivated.</P>

<BR>

<BR>

I was born Richard Ford on December 16, 1955 in Yonkers, NY. My
unmarried mother gave me up for adoption. Child and family serivess
of Connecticut placed me within four months with a middle class
family from a small New England town.<BR>

<BR>

I embarked on my childhood as Timothy Ryan. I spent most of these
years (1960 to 1974) in the town of Old Saybrook, CT. Saybrook
provided a nice combination of small town charm and suburban
awareness. It was and is primarily supported by the various
industries in the area.<BR>

<BR>

I had in all appearances a normal childhood. I played actively with
the area boys, went to school, and to church and didn't think of
myself as being more unusual than anybody else. Our family included
two parents and an older sister Derry. My paternal grandmother lived
in a house in the back yard. We had a lovely 18th century colonial
house..<BR>

<BR>

My mother was born Deborah Seal Heyl to an old Philadelphia family.
She is a 1946 graduate of Bryn Mawr University. She spent most the
time I grew up taking care of us kids and keeping house. She has a
great facility in the use of language something that apparently
rubbed off. She was a good mother who I could always count on.<BR>

<BR>

My father, Douglas Cargill Ryan, met my mom at Pelham (NY) High
School. His father was in advertising in New York. My Dad graduated
from the Coast Guard Academy. After leaving the service he pursued a
career as a mechanical engineer. In the 60's he found the business he
really was excited about. At that point he became a manufacturer of
reproduction colonial style iron and tinware. I like to say he was a
blacksmith, because in common parlance this was a lot of what he
was.<BR>

<BR>

My father choose a career in his late thirties that involved his
talent and love for handmaking things with his deep interest in
colonial America. It was hard financially to make such a venture a
go, but he worked his tail off for years to accomplish it. Eventually
he acquired a reputation for craftsmanship and expertise throughout
the North Eastern United States.<BR>

<BR>

I came to Hawaii in 1974 to attend UH. I liked Hawaii and stayed.
After collage I worked as an auto parts buyer, the manager of an
office that processed agreements of sale, and in bookkeeping and tax
preparation. I also owned a beauty shop for many years.<BR>

<BR>

After long unhappiness I took steps to change my gender. This process
took time, pain, and money. It taught me that things can be
accomplished with preparation, hard work, and patience. It also
taught me to love myself and accept the path that had been laid out
for me. Since 1991 I've been Tracy Ryan.</P>

<B>Tracy Ryan - Leadership for the Future of Hawaii.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

Hawaii has a long tradition of transgendered culture. In ancient
Hawaii there were the "mahus". Some of the other non western cultures
who've contributed to Hawaii have also had a traditional role for the
non traditional male.<BR>

<BR>

Modern times have not been as friendly. Hawaii has been influenced by
the larger American culture to look with disparaging eyes on the
transgendered. For decades most survived through prostitution. A few
made their way as entertainers. Even there many opportunities that
should have been theirs were denied them.<BR>

<BR>

In the mid sixties the famous "Glade" opened its doors to female
impersonation. In the early days everything was live including the
band. Tourists would come from Waikiki to the Chinatown red light
district to catch this remarkable show and see entertainers of the
quality of Brandy Lee.<BR>

<BR>

In the late sixties a judge convicted a local "queen" for attempting
to deceive a man in Chinatown. In so doing he commented she could
have avoided prosecution by wearing a button that proclaimed her true
gender. For some time the cops had fun insuring all the queens wore
buttons saying "I'm a boy." Thankfully, by the seventies that system
had ended.<BR>

<BR>

In the seventies the high campy drag faded as the new world of
hormones and surgeries became more available. The Glade ran on with
talent, but with fewer and fewer live vocals and smaller audiences.
Chinatown's vice still thrived thanks to the military, but the
tourists were few and far between.<BR>

<BR>

In more recent times public acceptance of the crossliving lifestyle
has increased. It has become easier for queens to find "straight"
jobs. Many of Hawaii's transgendered people are hairdressers, or
entertainers, or prostitutes. Some of them are office workers and
professionals. Yet prostitution remains the employer of last resort
for many of them even today.<BR>

<BR>

PAGEANTS<BR>

Hawaii's transgendered population is of mixed ethnicity. We have many
strikingly beautiful queens of Polynesian, and Asian ancestry. We
show them off in some of the most exciting pageants anywhere.<BR>

<BR>

The largest and oldest is the "Universal ShowQueen Pageant". It's
held every spring in the Pacific Ballroom of the Ilikai Hotel. The
producers, Desire St. Tropez and Jason Kina, put on a big and
exciting event every year. The contestants compete in evening gown,
talent, showqueen costume.<BR>

<BR>

Monica Mon'et productions offers us the Boa Arts Ball. This consists
of three separate competitions in one evening. There is the Queen of
Queens with swimsuit, talent, and evening gown portions. There is a
closet queen portion which features contestants first appearing as
men and then as women. The third part is the Golden Goddess for those
over forty. This event has taken place at the Dole Cannery Ballroom.
This locale has one of the best lobby areas of any of the pageant
locations.<BR>

<BR>

The Miss Island Goddess is another big local event featuring a
competition of "drag". It is produced By Stuart Young and Simeon Den.
The 1995 one drew over a thousand peoplee. This pageant's special
flair is a division called "Hairdos Galore".<BR>

<BR>

In recent years we have also been favored by Ross Tengan's production
of Miss Galaxy and Requel G Gregory and Alvin Lock's production of
Miss Continental Hawaii.<BR>

<BR>

THE IMPERIAL COURT OF ALL HAWAII<BR>

The Imperial Court is an organization mixing pageantry and charitable
work. It is part of a nationwide system of courts that raises money
for gay supported charities. Typically the court has an emperor and
empress as well as other title holders. These are chosen by vote at
annual events which are part party and part spectacle. Transgendered
people typically play a large part in these courts. The empress is
usually a male to female transgendered person. Many of our most
dedicated and talented sisters have lent their time to this
worthwhile organization.<BR>

<BR>

HAWAII TRANSGENDERED OUTREACH<BR>

HTGO is a social and support group for transsexuals and
transvestites. Auntie Joan and I founded it in 1990. Since then over
two hundred people have attended our meetings. Many more have taken
advantage of our Newsletter, and other outreach activities. HTGO is a
501(c) recognized charity. I have recently ended six years as
president. Rebecca who has taken over for me will do a great job.

<HEAD><TITLE>Dennis Derryberry, EFF Executive Administrator</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<H2>Dennis Derryberry</H2>
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/EFFdocs/about_eff.html">EFF</A> Executive 
Administrator<BR> <A 
HREF="mailto:dennis@eff.org">dennis@eff.org</A><P>

<H4>Bio</H4>

<I>Dennis Derryberry</I> came to the <A HREF="http://www.eff.org">Electronic 
Frontier Foundation</A> a day or two after President Clinton signed the 
Telecommunications Reform
legislation back in February. He began as a volunteer intern,
assisting wherever possible as EFF entered its most active period
to date, gathering up to a million hits in a day and a sustained
daily average close to 300,000. This firing-line initiation
effected his joining the EFF staff during the height of the Federal
District Court challenge to the unconstitutional Communications
Decency Act.<P>

As Executive Administrator, Dennis spends most of his day in communication
with other people who are interested in learning more about EFF work and
issues. Dennis regularly responds to press inquries, information seekers,
and requests for EFF involvement in speaking engagements and public
education projects. Working with other staff members, he aims to create an
effective EFF presence in the discussion and development of policies
affecting civil liberties an responsibilities online.<P>

Raised in the Constitution State, Dennis studied literature, religion and
philosophy, and German as a <A HREF="http://www.duke.edu">Duke
University</A> undergraduate, then journeyed west to archive the past and
configure a future. In the high-country, second-wave retreat of <A
HREF="http://www.themaestro.com/JH/">Jackson Hole, Wyoming</A> Dennis
created career subdirectories in journalism, music and service/tourism
while enjoying the recreational perks of small-town life in the mountains.
Eventually, the desire for more diverse access to current events and
culture prompted Dennis to move to San Francisco at the end of 1995.<P> 

Dennis believes that education, debate and responsible action can
produce some astoundingly positive results, both on a personal
level and at the level of government legislation and global
participation in the new communications era established by the
Internet.<P>

Building on a general affinity for the open exchange of ideas and
privacy of personal information, a few films also influenced
Dennis's decision to work for EFF. Dennis believes in the
<I>Terminator</I> movies and <I>Logan's Run</I> and some of the cool parts of
<I>Lawnmower Man</I>. He's also a reader and thinks that a really juiced
up notebook computer with a secure wireless modem and is Douglas
Adams's the <I>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</I>--a few years down the
road and beyond a number of challenging and uncertain forks. Dennis
recently finished <I>The Foundation</I> the first
book in Isaac Asimov's <I>Foundation Trilogy</I> series. His favorite
books include Edward Abbey's <I>The Fool's Progress</I> and John Irving's
<I>A Prayer for Owen Meany</I>.<P>

Dennis has recorded and published some of his original songs, fiction and
poetry and continues to develop many works-in-progress. The lyrics of his
most recent creation, &quot;eFrontier Fundamentals&quot; are <A 
HREF="http://kragar.eff.org/~dennis/eFF.html">available online,</A> and 
in fact he recently performed this at the <A 
HREF="http://www.edencast.com">Eden 
Music Festival</A>, an EFF benefit concert produced by ICONcerts:<P>

Derryberry being interviewed by <A 
HREF="http://www.mediacast.com">MediaCast</A>'s Jon Luini in the netcast trailer at the Eden Music Festival.<P>

In addition to speaking his mind on civil liberties and other issues, Dennis 
loves to ski and to build things and dreams of playing on 
the <A HREF="http://www.golf.com">PGA Tour</A> someday.<P><P><P><P>

to do so until he sold it in 1988.<P> 

He has been co-writing songs with the Grateful Dead since 1971. He's

to be among "<a href="100visionaries">100 Visionaries</a> 
Who Could Change Your Life," he is generally content to work on changing 
his own. <p>

Finally, he recognizes that there is a difference between information and 
experience and he vastly prefers the latter.<P>

elcome to Selena Sol's Public Domain Script Archive. Feel free to browse 
through the resources I have compiled and sign the 
<A HREF = "http://www.eff.org/~erict/Guestbook/guestbook.html" 
   TARGET = "Resource Window">guestbook</A> or the
<A HREF = "http://www.eff.org/cgi-bin/Selena/Mailing_list/mailing_list.cgi"

customization issues with others, please visit the 
<A HREF = "http://www.sidestreets.com/info/sssa/">The Selena Sol Script Archive

<B>Why is This Page Here?</B><BR>

The goal of the site is mainly to document the work that I have done so
that perhaps other programmers can learn from the way I do things and
hopefully evolve my ideas so I can learn too. 

<BR><IMG SRC = "../Graphics/Buttons/dot_clear.gif" BORDER = "0" HSPACE = "8"
         VSPACE = "8">

In the following pages I have included both working examples of my scripts
as well as the text of the code so that you can have one window open with
the code and the other with the working script.  Hopefully this design
will help you figure out how I did what I did, so that you can take the
ideas and run with them for your own needs. (There are also some other
various "bookmark type" resources I've compiled). 

<BR><IMG SRC = "../Graphics/Buttons/dot_clear.gif" BORDER = "0" 
         HSPACE = "8" VSPACE = "8"><BR>
<B>Other Things You Should Know</B><BR>  

These scripts come with no promises or guarantees.  The original intent
was not to distribute code, but to share ideas.  As it so happens, many
people have been able to successfully port these scripts to their servers
around the world. But customizing is "not" a 30 minute process!  I do my
best to write simple and portable code, but what you see is what you get. 
Better documentation and better code will come in time, but I have two
jobs and full time school, so be patient.  Also, please read the <A HREF =
"faq.html">FAQ</A> before emailing me with questions :)_ and by all means,
if you succesfully debug a script on your location, please send me a
description of what you did so I can add it to the FAQ. 

<BR><IMG SRC = "../Graphics/Buttons/dot_clear.gif" BORDER = "0" 
         HSPACE = "8" VSPACE = "8"> 

However, before going straight to the archives, please read through the 
following information.

<TD>Firstly, if you support freeware and have some scripts to contribute,
please send me the functional URL and the plain text URL so I can list
them as offsite resources.  
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC = "../Graphics/Scripts/two.jpg"></TD>
<TD>Also, if you use one of my scripts, please let me know.  I would
like to create a link to your site in order to add depth to the presentation 
of the scripts by allowing people to learn from others' 
interpretations.  Similarly, please consider adding to the Customization 
FAQ by emailing me your experiences. </TD>

<TD>Further, as always, my personal 
<A HREF="../Library/Intellectual_property/page_copyright.html" 
TARGET = "Resource Window">Intellectual
property</A> beliefs go for this page.  However, please be aware that as
I've made my initial journeys into the land of CGI, many others have
helped me knowingly and not, so be especially moral about your usage of
this work.</TD>

Feel free to cite, sample, steal, sell, reference, borrow or plagiarize

   hazy memories of Franklin Ave. Elementary School,

As things began to fall apart in Los Angeles, Eric returned to academic 
life and completed BAs in Political Theory and Cultural Anthropology at UCLA.
I've not much to say about UCLA except that it was there that Professor 
Louise Krasniewics baptized me, dipping my head backwards into the warm 
current of cyberspace.  I had found my country, my religion, my home.  
Two years later Douglas Rushkoff gave me a name...Cyberia...and the EFF 
gave me a banner to wave, but I get ahead of myself.

Off to Cannes, Monte Carlo, Madrid, Barcelona.

<I>I think that it is best when traveling to spend some time alone, some 
time with a close friend and some time with a big group of strangers.
Cities and experiences taste very different.  And for goodness sakes, 
give yourself at least three months to travel (never enough time though).</I>

Rome, Athens and the Islands.  Ios...huh...what happened...Heidi, Mark,

<CENTER><H2>YOUR FAVORITE COLOR IS THE KEY TO YOUR SEXUAL LIFE</H2></CENTER>

RED
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
People who like red tend to be tigers in the sack. They are easily
aroused and enjoy sex in every way imaginable. Once the sexual spark
is lighted, it may take hours to extinguish. When two reds get
together, the ensuing erotica would make Lady Chatterly blush. Lovers
of red tend to be the aggressors and weaker colors should beware!
</BLOCKQUOTE>   

PURPLE
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Lovers of purple frequently consider themselves too regal for a fun
romp in the sack. Women sometimes are the type who hate to muss their
hair. Men are businesslike in their approach to lovemaking. In both
sexes, purple partners are more concerned with their fulfillment then
anyone else's gratification.
</BLOCKQUOTE> 

BLACK
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Black color preferences point to black sex. These people are the
misfits of the sex world and seek each other in kinship. They tend to
prefer perverted sex and are usually masochistic or sadistic in
nature. They are moody people and often perform at their peak when under 
stress or during unhappy times. Police psychologists claim that
many sex offenders prefer the color black. And it is no coincidence
that the uniform of mobsters and teenaged gangs is black attire.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

GREEN
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Those who prefer green are fresh and innocent in their approach to
sex. Women who love green will make love like virgins all their life.
And a man may also be a trifle clumsy and awkward, but in a charming
and endearing sort of way. Green lovers are gentle but not passionate.
If chosen as a mate, one will never need worry about infidelity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>   

PINK
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
Persons who like pink show a reluctance to mature in sexual matters.
Women tend to tease; to promise more than they intend to deliver. In
some cases, they flaunt their femininity - but because they secretly
hate men. A great percentage of prostitutes boast entire lingerie
wardrobes in pink. Men who like pink are the type who will make three
dates for the same evening and not keep them, preferring to pick up a
dish in some bar instead. Pink indicates a tendency to squander money.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

ORANGE
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Lovers of the color orange lean toward sexual fantasies. The sex act
is regarded as a dramatic role, a one act play in which they are the
star. Foreplay is as important as the act of love. They whisper sweet
nothings, meaningless dialogue they feel fits their image. Orange
people often do not experience orgasm - but they put on a damn good
act. Men tend to pull their partner's hair and women tend to leave
welts on their sex partner's back!
</BLOCKQUOTE>   

BROWN
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
[Can't read the first lines] ... Sex is a 24-hour a day thing to them.
They tend to say "I love you" often enough. Snuggling by the fire,
walking in the rain or catching snowflakes on their tongue ins a
turn-on to a lover of brown. They need lots of time and privacy to
make love. But their emotions are such that one harsh word could end
an affair. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

GRAY
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The color gray is preferred by people who are indecisive. They can't
get excited about anything - including colors - so they choose a
noncommittal shade. Men who prefer gray look at sex as a means of
relieving tension - nothing more, nothing less. It's "wham, bam, thank
you ma'am". Women don't make love, they have intercourse. They count
the cracks in the bedroom plaster until the sex act is over with and
done. When a gray marries another gray, the marriage is made in
heaven. But when teamed with another color, the gray spouse considers
the other's infidelity a blessing.

<A NAME = "blue">BLUE</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
Lovers of blue are wonderful sex partners. They are sincere,
affectionate and sensitive to their partner's needs. They consider
lovemaking a fine art and their approach is elegant. Men who love blue
are like concert pianists; delicately ravaging their partner like they
would play a baby grand. Women in the blue category enjoy sex to the
fullest. They are exciting partners but their passion might be
compared to tidal waves rather than fiery aggression. Both men and
women enjoy foreplay and the aftermath of lovemaking as much as the
act. In marriages, a blue person is a wonderful mate - never failing
to please the spouse and never seeking outside interests.

YELLOW
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you tend to favor yellow, your sexual drives are complex and lean
toward the adaptable. The favorite color of homosexuals is yellow! but
don't panic - not everyone who wears yellow is queer. In most cases
the person will accommodate to the stronger partner's desires in a
passive manner. You will never enjoy sex to the fullest, but you will
never turn down an invitation from someone you enjoy or admire.
