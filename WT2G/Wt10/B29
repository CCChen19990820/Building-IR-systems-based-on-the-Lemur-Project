<h2>MARY JANE IS NO FLORENCE<br>
NIGHTINGALE: THE TRUTH<br>
ABOUT MARIJUANA'S<br>
MEDICINAL USES</h2>

<p>

If a bill before the House makes its way into law, the federal
government would have to make the switch from uprooting and destroying
marijuana crops to growing its own fields of plants for large-scale
distribution.

<p>

Once again, pro-drug groups are trying to convince America that
marijuana must be considered a legitimate medicine. Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) introduced H.R. 2618 last November, which would
&quot;provide for the therapeutic use of marijuana in situations
involving life-threatening or sense-threatening illnesses and
to provide adequate supplies of marijuana for such use.&quot;[1]

<p>

The specified illnesses are to be limited to glaucoma, AIDS wasting
syndrome, nausea resulting from chemotherapy, and spasticity resulting
from multiple sclerosis (MS), paraplegia, and quadriplegia. However,
the bill does leave room for those with other illnesses to apply
for marijuana use through the Food and Drug Administration.[2]

<p>

Basically, the bill is another effort to reclassify marijuana.
Currently, marijuana is under Schedule I, meaning it is unable
to be prescribed, has a high potential for abuse, is not currently
accepted for medicinal use, and has a lack of safety. Rescheduling
marijuana would place it under Schedule II, which includes drugs
currently accepted for medical use that have a high potential
for abuse, but are still able to be prescribed.[3] Cocaine is an
example of a Schedule II drug.

<p>

The bill calls for an Office for the Supply of Internationally
Controlled Drugs to be established under the Department of Health
and Human Services. That office would be responsible for making
sure there is an adequate supply of the drug for &quot;legitimate
medical, research, scientific, and export needs of the United
States.&quot; This supply would come from bidders or, if there
weren't enough domestic growers, from direct importation.

<p>

The office would provide the seeds to those whose bids to grow
marijuana are accepted. Those seeds, in turn, would be obtained
as follows: &quot;[L]egitimate commercial producers of marijuana
or, if this is not feasible, the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
the Attorney General through the Drug Enforcement Administration,
or the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide the Secretary with
an adequate supply of seeds capable of germination.&quot;

<p>

The marijuana would be distributed to doctors who have said they
intend to use the drug only on consenting patients with one of
the aforementioned illnesses. The doctors would be approved by
sending in applications which the office would approve or deny
within 30 days. According to the bill, if the office does not
respond within that time, doctors could consider themselves approved.

<p>

The use of marijuana as medicine has stirred considerable controversy.
Marijuana advocates insist it carries valuable medical benefits
and claim it is actually more harmful to prohibit the sick from
smoking it. Most of the medical community sees it differently,
however. Few doubt that marijuana (cannabis) does have a certain
degree of medical effect. The problem is the marked disadvantages
crude marijuana carries with it. Smoked marijuana has too many
negative side-effects to warrant its use as a drug.

<p>

Of course, the utility of marijuana as a true medicine too often
takes a back seat to other interests. The pro-marijuana movement,
led by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML) and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), certainly has a
well-known ulterior motive for pushing marijuana as a medicine.
Dr. Janet Lapey, a pathologist who is now president of Concerned
Citizens for Drug Prevention, said members of NORML have frequently
cited the medicinal marijuana issue as a red herring to gain a
toehold in legalizing all marijuana use.[4] (In fact, the pro-drug
<I>High Times</I> magazine characterized drug proposals like 
marijuana-as-medicine as being mere first steps that were &quot;far 
short of the DPF's ultimate goals, which include decriminalization of 
all illegal drugs.&quot;[5])

<p>

Marijuana simply is not the equal of other therapeutic drugs already
on the market. In fact, the American Medical Association, the
American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology,
the American Cancer Society, and the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society all deny that marijuana should be construed as medicine.[6]
After the DEA reviewed a petition for the possible rescheduling
of marijuana, Robert Bonner, the Administrator of Drug Enforcement
at the time, wrote, &quot;Relying on the same scientific standards
used to judge all other drugs, FDA experts repeatedly have rejected
marijuana for medical use.&quot;[7]

<p>

The active medical and psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is
delta-nine tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A synthetic THC called
dronabinol has been marketed as the drug Marinol since 1985.[8] Thus,
what medical good there is in marijuana has already been separated
from the problematic vegetable tissue of the cannabis plant. However,
even this purified and tested drug is not well received because
of its serious side-effects. Dr. Eric A.Voth is an assistant professor
of medicine at the University of Kansas and chairman of the International
Drug Strategy Institute. He has treated drug addicts for 10 years,
and recently testified at a congressional hearing on the legalization
of marijuana. Voth asserts, &quot;The negative side-effect profile
for marijuana, even dronabinol (Marinol), far exceeds most of
the other effective agents available.&quot;[9] Voth backs this assertion
by citing a study which ranked non-inhalant THC as only sixth
in preference among oncologists for the treatment of severe nausea,
and only ninth for mild nausea.[10]

<p>

Crude marijuana has even less to recommend it. First, no approved
drug is smoked. In the same way that tobacco is known to induce
lung cancer, smoking marijuana increases chances of cancer, too.
Billy Martin, a professor at the Virginia Commonwealth University's
medical college, said, &quot;There is good scientific evidence
showing adverse effects of smoking marijuana. Certainly it has
much higher tar content than cigarettes.&quot;[11] One study found
that marijuana smoking resulted in up to four times the respiratory
burden of an equivalent amount of tobacco smoking.[12] A September,
1993, National Institute on Drug Abuse update reported, &quot;Daily
use of one to three marijuana joints appears to produce approximately
the same lung damage and potential cancer risk as smoking five
times as many cigarettes.&quot;[13]

<p>

When marijuana supporters advocate smoking the drug for the rest
of a patient's life (for conditions like MS or glaucoma), it seems
strange to promote a &quot;treatment&quot; that could very well
promote disease and hasten death. Moreover, at a time when tobacco
products are roundly criticized, legalizing a similar product
for supposedly medicinal purposes would be hypocritical.

<p>

Besides the adverse effects of smoking, marijuana use is related
to amotivation syndrome in chronic users, characterized by a loss
of energy, general apathy, and impairment of concentration. Sedation
and lethargy are very common. Acute negative psychological effects
could include flashbacks, panic attacks, and disorientation.[14]

<p>

Additionally, for each of the diseases listed in Frank's bill,
scientific studies and the vast majority of doctors cast doubts
on marijuana's usefulness compared to currently approved drugs.

<p>

Simply put, glaucoma is gradual blindness caused when fluid pressure
inside the eye (intraocular pressure) is too high. Crude marijuana,
like alcohol ingestion, can reduce that pressure. But to arrest
glaucoma's progress, marijuana would have to be ingested chronically
-- every day of a patient's life -- in order to be effective.
On the topic of glaucoma, a 1994 Drug Enforcement Administration
manual cited Dr. Keith Green. Green has served on the boards of
eight ophthalmological journals, and performed extensive research
on the relationship between marijuana and glaucoma. According
to the manual, Dr. Green &quot;suggests that in order to decrease
intraocular pressure, one would have to smoke the equivalent of
six joints a day.&quot;[15]

<p>

In studies analyzing the effect of marijuana on glaucoma, heavy
doses were needed to reach the point at which intraocular pressure
was reduced. In some studies, the effect of the necessary dosage
of marijuana caused patients to become quite drowsy. Researchers
reported, &quot;Our subjects were sometimes too sleepy to permit
measurement of intraocular pressures. . . three hours after 
intoxication.&quot;[16]

<p>

A 1994 Drug Watch publication entitled, &quot;Glaucoma: Is Marijuana
a Safe and Effective Treatment?&quot; reported that &quot;the
country's leading ophthalmologists are 'chagrined' and 'disturbed'
to hear that claims are being made touting marijuana as a treatment
for glaucoma.&quot;[17]

<p>

Vomiting because of chemotherapy treatment is a serious concern
of cancer patients and their doctors. While smoked marijuana has
some ability to control vomiting, doctors still say it is not
as effective as other, safer drugs. In an overview of antiemetic
(anti-vomiting) drugs in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>,
the authors addressed cannabis derivatives that were used as antiemetics.
Dronabinol usage entailed serious side-effects, including &quot;dysphoria,
hallucinations, sedation, vertigo, dry mouth, and disorientation,
and are therefore seldom used as first-line antiemetic therapy.&quot;
The authors do find hope in cannabinoids, though: &quot;Synthetic
cannabinoids with no psychotropic activity have antiemetic 
activity.&quot;[18] Thus, cannabinoids could lead to anti-vomiting drugs 
in the future that don't have the mindbending effects that marijuana and 
its active ingredients have. This does not mean, of course, that crude
marijuana is that hope. Scientific studies have shown that marijuana
is not preferable to Marinol, which is itself not preferable to
other anti-vomiting drugs.[19]

<p>

Neither should marijuana be used as a treatment for spasticity
resulting from neurological disorders. The DEA manual, written
by Tom Pool, claimed, &quot;Experts on MS absolutely reject this
proposition.&quot;[20] Pool quotes Dr. Donald Silberberg, the Chair
of the Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine: &quot;The use of (marijuana), especially for
long-term treatment. . . would be worse than the original disease
itself.&quot;[21]

<p>

Of course, some MS sufferers adamantly claim marijuana helps control
their spasticity. These subjective anecdotes, unfortunately, have
not been borne out in clinical studies. One recent study indicated
that even while MS patients thought they were being helped by
smoking marijuana, their actual balance and coordination were
made worse.[22]

<p>

Using marijuana for treating AIDS patients brings more concerns.

<p>

Pool wrote, &quot;First, studies conducted at the Virginia Medical
College suggest that the THC in marijuana damages the immune system,
making the patient more susceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza
while at the same time increasing the severity of any illnesses
that the patient has. Clearly, the last thing that a patient with
AIDS needs is to have his or her immune system weakened. Second,
the marijuana smoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients.&quot;[23]

<p>

Advocates of medicinal marijuana continually make claims that
might lead the unsuspecting to believe that marijuana is actually
a miracle drug. For example, one pamphlet published by the Colorado
Hemp Initiative Project stated, &quot;Cannabis is two to three
times as effective as are currently legal medicines for reducing
Intra-Ocular Pressure, without toxic side-effects or damage to
liver and kidneys associated with presently approved drugs.&quot;[24]
Yet, in an evaluation of glaucoma treatment published in the <I>New
England Journal of Medicine</I>, marijuana isn't even mentioned
-- odd, if it is indeed two to three times as effective as any
other drug.[25]

<p>

Voth summarized the issue by noting, &quot;The pro-drug lobby
would have the public and policy makers incorrectly believe that
crude marijuana is the only treatment alternative for masses of
cancer sufferers who are going untreated for the nausea associated
with chemotherapy, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and other 
ailments.&quot;[26]

<p>

Pro-marijuana arguments heavily rely on anecdotal evidence instead
of controlled studies. Many people make the claim that marijuana
use has helped control aspects of various diseases. However, anecdotes
are notoriously inaccurate or statistically misleading.

<p>

Robert Peterson, the director of Michigan's Office of Drug Control
Policy from 1991-1995, wrote, &quot;One must look closely at anecdotal
evidence. In some of the most celebrated cases, the individual
smoked pot before he or she ever got ill. Marijuana is addictive
and addicts tend to feel better when they receive their drug.
. . . There is no doubt that using a euphoric drug such as marijuana,
alcohol, cocaine or heroin will make a sick person feel better.
That does not make a drug a medicine.&quot;[27]

<p>

The DEA petition echoes Peterson. &quot;Sick people are not objective
scientific observers, especially when it comes to their own health.
We all have heard of the placebo effect. Patients have a tendency
to respond to drugs as they believe is expected of them. . . Stories
of marijuana's benefits from sick people with a prior history
of marijuana abuse may be based on rationalizations caused by
drug dependence, not on any medical benefits caused by the drug.&quot;[28]

<p>

Legislators considering legalizing marijuana as a type of folk
medicine should also consider the secondary effects of that action.
Past experience has shown that it is not uncommon for drugs distributed
by doctors that are otherwise illegal to spread from the patient
to his or her acquaintances and friends. Also, public attitudes
toward marijuana as a recreational drug probably would begin to
change if medicinal uses were approved. Already, youth are beginning
to see marijuana as a benign or even beneficial drug due to some
highly successful propaganda by groups like NORML. If, as the
evidence suggests, marijuana will not add anything to the American
medicine cabinet, any increased collateral use and resulting damage
would have to be added to the cost of rescheduling crude marijuana.

<p>

Certainly, pro-marijuana groups have performed admirably in disseminating
their views. Now, the voices of the objective medical establishment
need to match their enthusiasm, and inform the public of the truth
about medicinal uses of marijuana and the motivations behind the
arguments.

<title>DO WE NEED A DRUG CZAR?</title>
<body>

<h2>DO WE NEED A DRUG CZAR?</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
A Senate committee voted to abolish the White House drug czar
and move its function to the Treasury Department saving $10 million
next year.  Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) explained, &quot;If
this administration will not facilitate and prosecute the drug
war, then Congress is forced to do it for them.&quot;  Clinton
promises to veto the bill if the final version eliminates the
Office of National Drug Control Policy.
<P>
Shelby says the administration is sending &quot;a mixed message
to America's youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.
 I object to the administration's handling of this issue, its
lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;   He blames drug czar
Lee Brown for &quot;lack of visibility&quot; in fighting illegal
drug use and trafficking.
<P>
Senator Shelby is correct about &quot;a mixed message.&quot; 
The Clinton administration has overseen an all-out retreat in
the drug war.
<P>
At a hearing before a House committee earlier this year, former
First Lady Nancy Reagan said, &quot;Why is it we no longer hear
the drumbeat of condemnation against drugs coming from our leaders
and our culture?&quot;  Former drug czar William Bennett echoed
Reagan's point, there is &quot;no viable effort by the Clinton
Administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign
supply control.&quot;  And former DEA director Robert Bonner stated,
&quot;I believe that there has been a near total absence of presidential
leadership by President Clinton in the fight to turn back illegal
drug use in this country.&quot;
<P>
At the same hearing Lee Brown began his testimony with an unusual
and telling aside.  He told the committee, &quot;I am extremely
disappointed by the way that you have structured this hearing.
 You have placed me on the third panel to testify, following the
appointees of the last administration.  This is contrary to established
precedent in the House for scheduling of administration witnesses
regardless of which party sits in the White House.&quot;
<P>
The administration's anti-drug record possibly explains the House's
witness sequence and the low esteem accorded Dr. Brown.  Even
Democratic Congressmen piled on the drug czar.  Rep. Charles Rangel
(D-NY) said, &quot;I've been in Congress for over two decades,
and I have never, never, never seen a 
president who cares less about this issue.&quot;  Rep. John Conyers
(D-MI) told Lee Brown during the drug czar's confirmation hearings,
&quot;Either the president is with you, or he has just given you
a chair at the cabinet level...If it is the latter, you are getting
ready to be the biggest fall guy in the Clinton Administration.&quot;
<P>
Probably the latter is closer to the truth.  The question remains,
should Congress discard the drug czar's post because Clinton isn't
committed to the war?  After all, when the ONDCP was established
by Congress in 1988, it was authorized to develop and coordinate
the policies, goals, and objectives for the drug fight.  What's
lacking in this administration is vision and leadership.  Snuffing
out an issue coordinator at the cabinet level is not the right
decision.
<P>
Senator Shelby would transfer the drug czar's responsibilities
to the Treasury Department.  But placing drug policy under Treasury
might further taint drug enforcement given the problems now linked
with the ATF.   Other anti-drug efforts like prevention and treatment
would likely suffer.
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin supports the existing drug office.
 &quot;ONDCP is critical,&quot; says Rubin, &quot;because it is
a neutral agency coordinating all the 50 agencies with anti-drug
roles.&quot;  Even Attorney General Janet Reno sees a &quot;need
to continue a strong and coordinated effort&quot; played by the
drug czar.  
<P>
Brown defends his post:  &quot;The deletion of funding for the
ONDCP will undercut the President's ability to fight drugs and
drug-related crime, which recent polls confirm are America's greatest
fear.&quot;  He points out that 77 million Americans report some
history of using illicit drugs.
<P>
Brown shouldn't be faulted for his boss's apparent indifference
to the drug problem.  One of the czar's primary duties is to advise
the president.  But if his advice is ignored and Clinton fails
to personally support the drug war, it will languish.
<P>
Brown said that &quot;Shutting off the relatively small $9.9 million
for our office will do irreparable damage to the nation's ability
to have a coordinated anti-drug strategy.&quot;  Of course he's
right.  Treasury cannot effectively coordinate government-wide
anti-drug efforts.  Eliminating Brown's job because his boss doesn't
care is wrong.
<P>
This nation needs a coordinated anti-drug program and it begins
with a committed president.  The drug czar is an important player,
but he can't take the lead alone.  
<P>
With abuse rates rising and the culture glamorizing illicit drugs,
now is not the time to abandon what the czar's office represents:
a coordinated anti-drug commitment.
<P>

<title>SEX-TROUBLED NAVY SHOULD DEEP-SIX PORNOGRAPHY SALES</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>SEX-TROUBLED NAVY SHOULD<br>
DEEP-SIX PORNOGRAPHY SALES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>
<p>
In the wake of the rape of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by a
U.S. sailor and two Marines and the groping of a female sailor
by a drunken chief petty officer on a commercial flight, Admiral
Jeremy Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations, has called for A
Day of Introspection for service men and women to consider the
issue of sexual harassment.
<p>
Whether &quot;introspection&quot; can help is anyone's guess,
but if our nation's military leaders are really serious about
combatting improper sexual activity by service personnel, they
will move quickly to stop the save of sexually explicit materials
on military bases.
<p>
Believe it or not, the federal government is the country's largest
distributor of pornographic materials.  By selling sex magazines
to U.S. Armed Forces through the military exchange system, the
government spreads smut tax-free and at discount prices.
<p>
Most Americans (51 percent) favor banning the sale of pornographic
materials on military bases, according to a new national survey
conducted for the Family Research Council by Voter/Consumer Research,
a Maryland-based pollster.  Not suprisingly, support for this
measure is particularly high among women.
<p>
To date, the Navy's solution to the problem of sexual harassment
and misconduct has been both misguided and ineffective.  The positive
effects of sexual harassment classes have been more than offset
by assigning more women to the close quarters environments of
naval aviation and combat ships.
<p>
Evidence of this is the recent deployment of the <I>USS Eisenhower</I>,
to the Mediterranean for six months.  The crew included 415 women,
a large number of whom became pregnant, engaged in extramarital affairs,
and returned to publicize incidents of sexual misconduct.  Experienced
sailors were not surprised by the <I>Eisenhower</I> results. 
Any skipper of a coed ship can relate incidents of fraternization,
granting of favors for sex, on-board pregnancies, etc. 
<p>
Navy regulations already prohibit the sale of materials that &quot;inspire
or encourage lust, particularly in the young, by exploiting indecent
or undue exposure, exaggerating sexual characteristics of male
or female figures, or by showing suggestive obvious passionate
actions or poses.&quot; 
<p>
The Navy's hesitancy to dump this trash may be because commanders
lack the courage to enforce the regulations or fear First Amendment
challenges.   At least one ship commander ignored such possible
constraints and did the right thing.
<p>
The captain of the <I>USS America</I> received a complaint about
a magazine sold in his ship's store.  The April, 1984 issue of
<I>Hustler</I> magazine included graphic pictures of a woman engaging
in a sex act with a crucifix.  The ship's supply officer was ordered
to deep-six the magazine.
<p>
In many cases, commanders may not understand the connection between
sexually explicit material and sexual misconduct.  They can't
&quot;connect the dots.&quot;
<p>
Pornographic material, like alcohol, is a powerful stimulant.
 Beginning with &quot;soft&quot; pornography sold in Navy stores,
the desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more
explicit, more deviant images in order to reach the previous level
of sexual arousal.  Gradually, the addict becomes desensitized
even to the more explicit material and  may act out sexual fantasies
inspired by the material.  Such activities may include promiscuity,
exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, sex with children, rape,
sadism or homosexuality.
<p>
Army exchanges sell this trash, too. <i>Hustler,</i> one of the
more perverse of the &quot;mainstream&quot; magazines,  is sold
openly at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where military personnel
find one of the largest government-sponsored displays of erotic
material in the world.
<p>
Submariners at Groton, Connecticut can also choose from a wide
selection of pornography.  Even in Washington, D.C., the Pentagon
Book Store sells nine &quot;soft-porn&quot; magazines and two
sexually explicit homosexual magazines, the latter belying DOD's
commitment to &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell.&quot;
<p>
Under current policy, military exchange managers select magazines
based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case
of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition of &quot;obscenity&quot;
outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case <i>Miller vs. California</i>.
<p>
The <I>Miller</I> criteria were written to protect freedom of
speech and expression but there are kinds of speech and expression
not protected by the Constitution. These include, among others,
slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling
&quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater, copyright violations and
child pornography.
<p>
Navy regulations allow commanders to ban materials that could
incite sexual harassment in the workplace.  According to the Navy,
the workplace is &quot;an expansive term for military members
and may include conduct on or off duty, 24 hours a day.&quot;
 This includes off-duty in an off-base military community, on
commercial airplanes, at aviation conventions and on the high
seas.
<p>
Marine commanders at Camp Lejeune applied this concept of  &quot;off
duty&quot; to a local purveyor of pornography.  Eugene's Arcade
was placed off limits to military personnel. The shop's owner,
Eugene Enslin, filed a suit alleging violation of his constitutional
rights of free speech.  U.S. District Court Judge W. Earl Britt
dismissed the lawsuit, concluding that, &quot;A military commander
has an overriding duty to safeguard the morals, welfare and discipline
of his men.&quot;
<p>
A 1992 Department of the Navy memo states: &quot;A commanding
officer has broad responsibility to ensure the effective and efficient
operation of his/her command... [and] has authority to regulate
or ban activities that may be detrimental ... to good order, discipline,
and morale among command personnel.&quot; It is clear that commanding
officers may restrict base exchanges from selling materials that
promote illicit or offensive behavior.
<p>
In a 1992 letter to the Navy's Assistant Secretary for Manpower
and Reserve Affairs, the Navy Exchange Commander wrote: &quot;I
believe strongly that our Navy...should establish a Navy-wide
policy which states that material inconsistent with its core values,
which is demeaning to men or women of our Navy and which is contrary
to good order and discipline, will not be sold in exchanges.&quot;
<p>
In a 1992 memo to the Chief of Naval Operations, Captain P. W.
Kelley, a Navy lawyer, stated: &quot;In view of the mission of
the exchange system... adult periodicals can be excluded from
exchange shelves.&quot;
<p>
Several years ago, Americans learned that topless and bottomless
&quot;performers,&quot; male and female, were appearing under
military auspices at U.S. military bases in the Pacific.  When
these incidents were publicized, the Navy banned the sex shows.
 It argued, &quot;The issue of moral acceptability aside, on-base
activities such as these contribute to creating an environment
in which all females are regarded with less or no respect, and
abusive behavior toward all women is not only passively accepted
and condoned but encouraged.&quot;
<p>
It is clear that the Navy understands the detrimental effect of
pornographic materials and explicit sex-related entertainment.
 It is also clear that policies are in place to limit the availability
of such material or shows to service members.  The fact that defies
logic is that the services remain in the porn business.  Why?
<p>
Given the rise in sexual assaults and the growing attention devoted
to sexual harassment, the Navy must stop the sale of pornography through 
military installations. Unscrupulous businessmen are willing to sell the 
trash, but must taxpayer funded stores peddle depraved material at cut-rates 
and tax-free to servicemen worldwide?
<p>
Eckerd Drugs and 7-Eleven have voluntarily decided not to sell
sexually explicit material despite the loss of potential profits.
 Why does the U.S. government, which should stand for what is
right and moral in our country, not have the social conscience
of these commercial firms? 
<p>
Commander-in-Chief Bill Clinton has the unilateral authority to
remove pornographic material from military stores.  With the stroke
of a pen, his executive order could prohibit the sale of sexually
explicit materials in base exchanges all over the world.  Such
an order would surely be upheld in the courts, especially if based
on long respected claims of military deference.  We are waiting,
Mr. President.

<title>FAITH-BASED PRISON PROGRAMS CUT COSTS AND RECIDIVISM</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>FAITH-BASED<br>
PRISON PROGRAMS<br>
CUT COSTS AND RECIDIVISM</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Crime in America seems out of control.  The government's response
has been to build more prisons and keep convicts behind bars longer.
But that won't cut growing incarceration costs and high recidivism
rates. Such cuts should be the goal, and faith-based prison programs
can help.

<p>

&quot;I believe moral rehabilitation,&quot; says Burl Cain, warden
of the Louisiana state penitentiary in Angola, &quot;is the only
true rehabilitation there is.&quot;[1]

<p>

Although most Americans support punishment for criminal offenders,
there is a growing consensus that there is more to solving the
crime problem. &quot;The nation's crime and prison problem is
fundamentally a moral and spiritual problem,&quot; says Richard
Rettig, chairman of University of Central Oklahoma's sociology
and criminal justice department.  &quot;We should bring the criminal
abusers not to a punishing environment which hurts and kills,
but unto a God that heals,&quot; Rettig says.[2]

<p>

Whitney Kuniholm is the executive vice president of Prison Fellowship,
the world's largest prison ministry.  Kuniholm explains, &quot;You
can have job programs, literacy programs, drug programs and educational
programs, but unless something changes on the inside [of the person],
that stuff isn't going to make a difference.&quot;[3] Inmates agree.

<p><ul>

<li>Bill McCall, a convicted murderer in Indiana, explains, &quot;Before
I became a Christian, there was no way I could deal with what
I had done.  But now that I know God has forgiven me, I can forgive
myself.&quot;[4]

<p>

<li>Mark Wiggins, a Texas inmate convicted of possession of a
sawed-off shotgun, says, &quot;I was just out of control, totally
out of control.  I had no love, no sense of caring, no sense of
anything.  I just...didn't care.&quot;  Wiggins says he became
a Christian through the unswerving efforts of his wife.  He says
he was simply tired of losing and wanted to change.  &quot;Now
I feel a sense of peace inside of me that I've never felt,&quot;
he says.[5]

<p>

<li>Ex-convict Billy Greer, once an armed robber and drug dealer,
has been out of prison and straight for three years.  &quot;I
place God first and I'm able to overcome the temptation,&quot;
says Greer, &quot;because God, to me, is greater.&quot;[6]

</ul><p>

North Carolina's former secretary of corrections, Aaron Johnson,
says Prison Fellowship's religious programs made his prisons more
manageable.  &quot;There was a change in the environment in those
prisons.  Infraction rates went down in almost every prison.&quot;[7]
This is good news for taxpayers because these programs lead
to lower operating costs, more frequent parole, and reduced recidivism.

<p>

Cost-conscious states are taking notice.  Texas Governor George
Bush may soon give approval for a private, faith-based prison.
Not only does the program promise to save the taxpayer millions
in operating costs, but it gives hope to Texas citizens that fewer
convicts will leave prison only to commit more crimes.

<p>

Before considering the benefits of faith-based prison programs,
however, consider a profile of the worsening crime problem and
America's prison system.  This profile will help one appreciate
just how desperate we are for better solutions.

<p>

<center><h3>SOCIETY COPING WITH CRIME</h3></center>

<p>

The U.S. has tripled its prison population in the past 15 years,
and the Rand Corporation projects it will double again over the
next decade.[8] Meanwhile, prison costs doubled to $24.6 billion
over the past decade, and experts foresee substantial increases
in the future.

<p>

A U.S. Justice Department study found that more than half (62.5
percent) of all released state prisoners are rearrested for a
felony or serious misdemeanor within three years, and almost half
(41.4 percent) return to prison.[10] This is in spite of a serious
decline in the crime clearance rate (the rate at which police
identify and arrest suspects).  Since 1955, the probability of
a murderer being arrested has declined 26 percent, and for a rapist
the probability has gone down 27 percent.[11]

<p>

Keeping chronic and violent criminals in jail makes sense.  &quot;All
of us look at the futility of having to spend money on prisons,&quot;
says John Engler, governor of Michigan, &quot;but we recognize
the public necessity.&quot;[12] That's why Virginia's governor, George
Allen, ended parole and more than doubled expected prison time
for many offenders.  &quot;People were disgusted with the dishonesty
and leniency of the system,&quot; Allen says.[13]

<p>

Americans aren't so concerned about punishing criminals as they
are about keeping the fox out of the chicken coop.  For example,
a 1994 nationwide Wirthlin Group poll asked, &quot;What do you
feel is the main purpose of prisons?&quot;  To that question,
61 percent said, &quot;to keep criminals out of society.&quot;[14]
Almost three in four (73 percent) Americans told <I>ABC News</I> 
that they approve of building more prisons so that
longer sentences can be given to prisoners.[15]

<p>

John J. DiIulio, a criminologist and Brookings and Manhattan Institute
scholar, explains that there are financial benefits to locking
up chronic criminals.  &quot;It costs society at least twice as
much to let a prisoner loose than to lock him up.&quot;[16] In fact,
according to Patrick Langan, a senior statistician with the Justice
Department, tripling the prison population from 1975 to 1989 likely
prevented 390,000 murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults
in 1989 alone.  Given that each murder costs society $2.4 million,
each rape $60,000, each arson $50,000, imprisoning violent criminals
can be a bargain.

<p>

Indeed, many Americans are persuaded that prisons are worth the
cost.  According to William and Mary College economists Thomas
Marvell and Carlisle Moody, 21 crimes are averted for each criminal
who is kept off the street.[18] That translates into hundreds of
billions of annual savings in costs to society.

<p>

The enthusiasm for more prisons and longer sentences is not universal,
however.  Alvin Bronstein of the ACLU's National Prison Project
opposes the current rate of incarceration.  &quot;There is a spirit
of meanness, selfishness and punitiveness,&quot; says Bronstein,
&quot;that seems to have no bounds.&quot;[19] Tim Matthews of the
American Probation and Parole Association says, &quot;It doesn't
take an Einstein to tell you if prison were the answer, crime
should have dropped.&quot;[20]

<p>

The immediate answer, of course, is that crime <I>has</I> dropped.
Violent crime was down 5 percent in the first half of 1995 and murder 
dropped 12 percent, the largest drop in the murder rate in years and six 
times larger than the drop in the same period in 1994.[21]

<p>

Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee
on Crime, worries that these latest crime statistics &quot;will
give us a false sense of security.&quot;[22] This is especially true
for young offenders, where problems have been growing in recent
years -- and are apt to get worse before they get better.

<p>

There are some clear-cut social and demographic trends that make
it very probable that today's shocking rate of youthful violence
will explode over the next decade.

<p>

By the year 2005, the number of teens from 15 to 19 years of age
will increase by 23 percent, and a very large proportion of these
teens will be coming from homes without fathers.  Given the clear
and established correlation between father absence and crime,
some experts estimate that violent crime like murder could increase
to 40,000 killings per year -- up 60 percent from current levels.[23]

<p>

James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of
California, Los Angeles, warns, &quot;There's a tornado coming.
We can't stop it.  We have to prepare for it.&quot;[24] The future
portends escalating violent crime and a growing need for prisons
and longer sentences unless something dramatic is done.

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICAN PRISONS: PUNISHMENT OR REHABILITATION?</h3></center>

<p>

The question that must be answered is, &quot;What are prisons
supposed to do?&quot;  The U.S. has a history of vacillating between
rehabilitation and punishment for inmates.  The pendulum is now
moving away from rehabilitation.

<p>

&quot;I'm sick and tired of these people getting by with murder
and rape and child molestation and just being allowed to be in
jail.&quot;[25] Illinois Senator Adeline Geo-Karis said these words
just before the state senate approved legislation setting up a
chain gang program. She explained, &quot;I say, let them out
in the rock pile to pay their penalty. No more mollycoddling!&quot;[26]

<p>

A 1995 <I>Time/CNN</I> poll found that two in three Americans
(67 percent) believe prisons are too lenient.[27] Two-thirds favor
chain gangs and half would deny inmates television and barbells.[28]
Texas Senator Phil Gramm says, &quot;We've got to stop building
prisons like Holiday Inns.&quot;[29]

<p>

Within the penal system, there are a variety of prisons and operating
philosophies.  There are ultra-maximum-security prisons like the
one near Florence, Colorado.  Here are housed the nation's 484
toughest federal prisoners.  The 428,000-square-foot facility
has 168 videocameras and 1,400 electronically controlled gates.
Each cell has unmovable cement furniture and a small black-and-white
TV.[30]

<p>

Despite its effectiveness, James Joy, Colorado's ACLU director,
says, &quot;The prison is designed to drive people crazy, to break
them psychologically, by locking them up with no meaningful human
contact.&quot;[31]

<p>

Sheriff Joe Arpaio runs a no-frills prison for Maricopa County,
Arizona. He has organized prisoners into chain gangs, houses
them in tents in the scorching desert sun and feeds them baloney
sandwiches with no coffee. Inmates are denied broadcast television
but given educational programming. &quot;I want to make this
place so unpleasant that they won't even think about doing something
that could bring them back,&quot; says Arpaio. &quot;I want them
to suffer.&quot;[32]

<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich has called for a fundamental overhaul
of the prison system.[33] He's joined by Rep. James Moran (D-Va.),
who wants a better balance between punishment and rehabilitation.
America needs &quot;an effective criminal justice system,&quot;
says Moran, &quot;not only punishing offenders, but also on teaching
the skills and discipline necessary to keep them from becoming
repeat offenders.&quot;[34]

<p>

The cadillac of prisons is located in Bradford, Pennsylvania.
McKean Medium-Security Prison is labeled by some as a &quot;resort&quot;
or &quot;country club.&quot;  The taxpayer pays $15,370 for each
inmate per year.[35]

<p>

DiIulio says, &quot;McKean is probably the best-managed prison
in the country, and that has everything to do with a warden named
Dennis Luther.&quot;  Luther's success is attributed to his philosophy
of building a &quot;prison culture&quot; that includes unconditional
respect for inmates as people.  Luther explains, &quot;If you
want people to behave responsibility, and treat you with respect,
then you treat other people that way.&quot;[36]

<p>

Nearly half (47 percent) of McKean inmates are enrolled in education
classes.  According to DiIulio, &quot;In some prison systems,
cost-effective management is possible only because programs keep
prisoners busy, with less supervision than you'd need otherwise.&quot;[37]

<p>

McKean is the exception among prisons.  Most prisons are by design
very inhospitable places.  William Weld, governor of Massachusetts,
expresses a widely-held view about prisons saying they should
be &quot;a tour through the circles of hell,&quot; where inmates
learn only &quot;the joys of busting rocks.&quot;  The fact that
most prisons are &quot;a tour through the circles of hell&quot;
explains why an inmate serving a life term in New Jersey said,
&quot;You create Spartan conditions, you're gonna get gladiators.&quot;[38]

<p>

This inmate's perspective is understandable and all too common.
According to former Arkansas corrections commissioner Don Hutto,
&quot;One prison I worked in had a sewage problem....But the state
budget people told me it would take four years to get the money
for a new sewage treatment plant....The inmates knew they were
at risk and they protested.  We had to discipline them, even though
they had a good case. It was like that with nearly all the projects
I tried to get started, and then people wonder why there's a prison
riot.&quot;[39]

<p>

Incarceration has at least four social benefits:  retribution,
deterrence, rehabilitation and incapacitation.[40] Recent trends
have been weighed more heavily on the side of retribution and
incapacitation. Meanwhile, prisoners are more diverse, harder
to control and often re-enter society better criminals than ever
before.  Evidence abounds that our penal system is failing to
curb recidivism and costs, and in many instances prisons serve
as advanced training centers for more sophisticated or violent
crimes.

<p>

Overcrowding is driving a rush to build new facilities, such as
in Texas, which has launched a prison construction boom to raise
its capacity from 38,000 in 1987 to 150,000 by 1997.[41] The U.S.
has 1,037 state and federal prisons which are operating at between
17 and 36 percent above capacity.[42]

<p>

Incarceration costs are also rising.  For 1995, states appropriated
$18 billion for corrections, making this the fastest-growing item
in state budgets.[43] According to the Justice Department, the average
annual spending per prisoner is $15,586 for the states and $14,456
for federal prisons.[44] These figures do not include hidden and
indirect costs which significantly elevate the outlays to anywhere
from $25,000 to $40,000 per prisoner.

<p>

A number of factors drive escalating costs -- more inmates, numerous
drug-addicted and violent offenders (who cost more to supervise
than other prisoners), more prison gangs and other anti-social
groups, diverse ethnic make-up, more elderly prisoners who require
special care, and the unprecedented explosion of prisoner lawsuits.
The most expensive prison service, however, is health care.

<p>

Prisoner health care takes 21 percent of the typical state's corrections
budget.[45] The high costs are dictated by the generally rising costs
of health care in society, but also because inmates are far more
likely to have chronic diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis than
the general population.  Annual health care costs per prisoner
range from $634 per inmate in Louisiana to $3,264 per inmate in
Massachusetts.[46]

<p>

<center><h3>PRISONS FOR PROFIT</h3></center>

<p>

Jimmy Turner, now a prison warden with the for-profit Corrections
Corporation of America (CCA), spoke of the Texas state prison
system, explaining, &quot;We were taught that communication only
went one way....A prisoner did what you told him. That works,
if you can afford to let prisoners get angry and tear up the place.
No one is going to care if he wrecks a $1,500 sink in his jail
cell. The state will foot the cost.&quot;[47]

<p>

Many states are seeking commercial prison alternatives because
costs are spiraling out of control.  CCA is the largest private
operator of prisons in the U.S.  The chairman of the CCA said,
&quot;It seemed such a logical idea when we started....As long
as there's a monopoly, there is going to be inefficiency, and
government is the biggest monopoly of all.&quot;[48]

<p>

CCA contends that it can build prisons cheaper and run them better
than can the government.  &quot;Anyone who has worked in prisons
learns pretty quickly that when people are treated humanely, in
a way that maintains their dignity, the environment is safer,&quot;
says Don Hutto, who helped found the corporation in 1983, &quot;but
that's not what often happens in public prisons.&quot;[49]

<p>

James Wiedenman, a CCA shift commander, prefers CCA's approach,
explaining, &quot;The atmosphere in those places [state-run prisons]
was awful....The prison administration was even more of an enemy
than the inmates were.  You didn't see the warden for more than
once in six months....Most of us [guards] got into this business
because we like what we do, but if I hadn't moved into the private
sector, I think I would have found another career.&quot;[50]

<p>

<center><h3>PRISON POPULATION</h3></center>

<p>

In 1994, 1.6 million people were in federal, state and local prisons
and/or jails.  That's 387 incarcerated Americans per 100,000 population,
up from 139 in 1980, making the U.S. the leading jailkeeper in
the western world.[51] More than half (60 percent)[52] of all federal
prisoners are serving time for drug-related offenses, while 94
percent[53] of state prisoners are serving time for violence-related
offenses.

<p>

Most prisoners have long criminal histories beginning with extensive
juvenile records. Two out of three prisoners have served time
in a juvenile institution, but their juvenile files are seldom
available to judges when deciding on adult sentences.[54]

<p>

What's more frightening than the offenses for which these inmates
are currently serving are those crimes they committed for which
they were never convicted.  In the late 1970s, the Rand Corporation
surveyed prisoners in Texas, Michigan and California and found
that the median number of admitted crimes committed by each inmate
in the year prior to their incarceration was 15.[55]

<P>

Most state inmates become hardened veterans of the prison system.
More than 60 percent have been incarcerated before, and nearly
all of these (91 percent) have been in jail or prison for an offense
within the five years preceding their current offense.[56] Convicted
rapists and murderers are by far the most likely of all felons
to return to prison.[57] Only 19 percent are serving their first
sentence.[58]

<P>

The typical prisoner is poorly educated.  Seven in 10 inmates
have no high school diploma, and most (66 percent) are illiterate
with limited marketable skills.[59] Three-quarters are drug or alcohol
abusers at the time of incarceration, and most female inmates
leave children behind when they go to prison.[60]

<P>

The prison culture is often as bad as or worse than the lifestyles
inmates left behind.  Prisons are filled with some of society's
worst offenders.  Besides a host of bad company, the prisoner
experiences many deprivations which include restricted movement,
loss of possessions, loss of autonomy, and reduced contact with
family. Prisoners live in a very regimented, highly regulated
environment designed to control every aspect of behavior.

<p>

Male prisoners must often fight to survive.  They must be constantly
on guard for personal safety.  Homosexual rape is common, especially
for new inmates.  Gangs often define and control the prison experience.

<p>

<center><h3>DOES PRISON REHABILITATION WORK?</h3></center>

<p>

The taxpayer has a right to expect the prison system to be more
than a holding tank or a revolving door for criminals.  Most prisons,
however, are little more than expensive warehouses within which
inmates finely hone their criminal skills.

<p>

A 1974 review of 231 prison rehabilitation studies found that
correctional treatment showed no effect on recidivism. Robert
Martinson published a review, &quot;What Works - Questions and
Answers About Prison Reform,&quot; which helped move the rehabilitation
pendulum toward &quot;nothing works.&quot;[61] But Martinson's analysis
lacks support from some contemporary experts.

<p>

&quot;You are not going to rehabilitate the chronic offender,&quot;
says DiIulio, &quot;but it is also wrong to say we are not going
to rehabilitate anybody.&quot;[62] Most prison officials agree.

<p>

In 1994, the Senate Judiciary Committee polled prison wardens
to discover their views on rehabilitation.  Wardens overwhelmingly
favor prison rehabilitation programs.  Ninety-three percent favor
literacy and other educational programs, 92 percent favor vocational
training, and 89 percent favor drug treatment.[63]

<p>

J. Michael Quinlan, a former director of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, supports rehabilitation because it makes prison operations
more efficient.  &quot;It is absolutely the most important ingredient
in managing a safe and secure institution,&quot; says Quinlan,
&quot;to keep the inmates productively occupied, in either work
or education or drug treatment or structured recreation.&quot;[64]
Quinlan says, &quot;It is really a question of do we want to
pay now, or do we want to pay later.&quot;[65] Ninety-five percent
of inmates return to the streets. If they have been sitting idly
in prison, their chances of recidivating are higher than if they
have been involved in productive programs.[66]

<p>

Most prisoners are poor employment candidates.  A 1991 Justice
Department survey found that most (70 percent) prisoners earned
less than $15,000 in the year before their arrest.[67] A prison term
also worsens their job prospects.  These facts should support
efforts to increase inmate skills so as to improve their post-prison
employment chances.

<p>

A 1993 study by the Federal Bureau of Prisons found that many
prisoners want to participate in education programs to improve
their chances of finding a job, and thus not committing a crime
after release.[68] Numerous other studies have also found a strong
relationship between prison education and lower recidivism.[69]

<p>

Paul Barton, the co-author of a 1996 prison-based Educational
Testing Service study, found &quot;[s]olid information...about
how low the literacy level of prisoners is in relation to what
the job market needs.&quot;  Barton said, &quot;Education may
not be the sole answer to cutting recidivism, but the evidence
shows that it helps.&quot;[70]

<p>

Barton's study found that two-thirds of all inmates are substantially
behind the general population in literacy, even lower than the
average unskilled laborer. He said, &quot;They're not going to
make it when they get out. This is where a whole lot of our youth
are these days, especially minority youth.  For many of them,
it's their last chance for education.&quot;[71]

<p>

Prison-based work experience is another form of rehabilitation.
Thomas Townsend, president of the Corrections Industry Association,
says, &quot;It is a matter of public safety: inmates who have
worked in prison and gained new skills have a significantly better
chance of not returning to crime and prison.&quot;[72]

<p>

Former Attorney General Edwin Meese favors prison-based programs
as a means of reducing recidivism. &quot;Prison industries is
one management strategy that shows promise,&quot; explains Meese,
as a way to &quot;reduce recidivism and increase public safety.&quot;[73]

<p>

A 1991 Federal Bureau of Prisons study followed 7,000 inmates
after release.  Those who worked in prison had a 35 percent decrease
in recidivism the first year.[74] Prison-based work programs also
save on operating costs.

<p>

Prisoner wages are garnished to help pay for incarceration costs.
At least 25 states now have contracts with private firms that
employ inmates.[75] But such work programs are restricted by two
1930s-era federal laws that limit interstate commerce in prison-made
goods.

<p>

<center><h3>FAITH-BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS</h3></center>

<p>

Now that we have an overview of the prison problem and the most
popular approaches to dealing with the incarcerated, let's look
at other programs that have proven to be effective and most efficient
-- faith-based programs.

<p>

Todd Clear, a Rutgers University criminologist, says, &quot;Religious
programming is the single most common form of institutional program
for inmate management and rehabilitation.&quot;[76]

<p>

Jailhouse conversions are viewed skeptically by judges and parole
boards.  John Wiley, a UCLA law professor, cautions, &quot;There's
such an incentive to fabricate [a conversion] that it's difficult
to be convincing....The problem is that the best evidence of a
genuine conversion comes after the person leaves the prison.&quot;[77]

<p>

Wiley says people are often too quick to label conversions as
fake. &quot;Actually,&quot; says Wiley, &quot;prison is the kind
of environment that might well prompt a conversion.  It's a shattering...monkish
existence...a complete change in your life.  Sure, some turn to
the worst instincts.  But I don't think it's implausible that
some turn to the best.&quot;[78]

<p>

Todd Clear, who is also a fellow at the National Institute of
Justice, believes spiritual commitment makes a difference.  &quot;Prison
is designed as an experience to pull people out of their realities
so they can, in fact, confront who they are and what they've done
and try to commit to a different version of themselves....I mean,
we would want people who go to prison to admit that they did wrong....These
religious traditions fit into what we really want prison to do.&quot;[79]

<p>

Louisiana prison warden Cain agrees with Clear.  &quot;All these
men were looking for was something, just looking for something
to hang their hats on.  We ought to be ashamed for what we hadn't
done for them before. They were ready for God.  They were probably
more ready than anyone. Even though some of these people may
never be free from this place, they'll be free with eternal life.
That's what it's all about.&quot;[80]

<p>

Charles Adkins, an Indiana state prison official, says religion
is one of several rehabilitation avenues.[81] But it's the only approach
that addresses the root problem -- a moral crisis inside the inmate.

<p>

Paul Robinson, a law professor at Northwestern University, dissects
the root of crime.  Robinson asks, &quot;Why do people obey the
law?  People obey the law because they fear the disapproval of
their social group and because they generally see themselves as
moral beings who want to do the right thing as they perceive it.&quot;[82]
The fact that many offenders come from social settings that approve
of anti-social behavior might, in part, explain their crime history.

<p>

&quot;Reinforcing the compliance powers of the social group and
personal morality,&quot; says  Robinson, &quot;could reduce crime
even if policing and prosecuting functions cannot be made more
effective.&quot;[83] Perhaps  this is why religion has been effective
for some prisoners.  Inmates who simultaneously experience a changed
personal morality (salvation or conversion) and then are totally
immersed in a faith community experience religion's life-changing
power.

<p>

Religion serves four roles in prison.  First, it provides answers
to the prisoner's questions about life.  Second, it provides rules
to adhere to, which makes inmate management easier.  Third, it
is experiential. In other words, something intrinsic takes place
(salvation or conversion) which is evident to the inmate and later
to those around him. Finally, religion plays a social role bringing
together like-minded inmates for worship, Bible study and other
faith-related activities. This togetherness gives the inmate
a sense of belonging and positively impacts the prison's culture.[84]

<p>

There is evidence that religion helps make prisons more manageable.
A 1992 Rutgers University study found that prisoners often seek
God to cope with inmate life, which is marked by depression, guilt
and self-contempt.[85] Todd Clear, the Rutgers researcher, found
that highly religious inmates evidence lower rates of depression
and commit fewer disciplinary infractions than other inmates.
In another study, correctional officials from three states credited
Prison Fellowship's religious programming with improved morale,
lower rates of depression and fewer disciplinary infractions.[86]

<p>

Inmates who are highly religious while in prison also tend to
have lower recidivism rates. A 1990 Prison Fellowship study of
360 ex-convicts found that only 40 percent of those who were heavily
involved in religious programs committed new crimes after release
compared with 51 percent of the non-religious group.[87] Although
this isn't an especially large margin, it's better than recidivism
results attributed solely to education, work or drug treatment
programs.

<p>

A 1996 Prison Fellowship study of 201 inmates involved in religious
programs found that high participation in Bible studies is related
to lower likelihood of arrest during the one-year follow-up period.[88]
A 1992 Prison Fellowship study of 225 New York inmates also found
that high religious program participation meant lower odds of
being re-arrested.[89]

<p>

<center><h3>BRING MORE RELIGION TO PRISON</h3></center>

<p>

If religion works better than other forms of prison rehabilitation,
then the taxpayer ought to favor more religious programming.
There is a problem however and it has more to do with what goes
on inside the prison than laws separating church and state functions.

<p>

Suzanne McElwain, chief chaplain at the Luther Luckett Correctional
Complex, La Grange, Kentucky, says, &quot;It's not cool to be
a Christian on this yard.&quot;[90] She finds that many inmates believe
Christ was killed on the cross because he wasn't smart enough
to avoid it.

<p>

&quot;We've got a lot of unchurched men here,&quot; says McElwain,
&quot;a lot of unbelievers, and a lot of people with an unhealthy
(image of ) God.&quot;[91] If religion is to help change inmates,
these barriers must be removed.

<p>

One means of removing these barriers is to embrace a prison concept
that involves all inmates in a prison-wide faith-based program.
Sociologist Rodney Stark writes in the <I>Journal of Research
in Crime and Delinquency</I>, &quot;Religion only binds people
to the moral order if religious influences permeate the culture
and the social interactions of the individuals in question.&quot;[92]

<p>

A prison operated on a faith-based philosophy offers great promise.
Such an approach would introduce into the prison many desirable
attributes.  It opposes antisocial values, emphasizes responsibility
and accountability, advances non-deviant over socially deviant
behavior, promotes reconciliation, seeks to mediate conflict,
and champions social support and comfort for those in need.[93]

<p>

Although such a program is not for every inmate, it will work
for many.  For example, the Association for Protection and Assistance
of the Sentenced (APAC) is based on a unique prison model started
in Brazil 20 years ago.  The program restores inmates to responsible
and productive relationships with their communities, families
and Creator. It also promises to reduce prison costs and reduce
recidivism. Prison Fellowship researched the approach and found
that ex-convicts who completed the Brazilian program had an incredibly
low four percent recidivism rate.[94]

<p>

The first APAC program could be run in Texas by the Community
Corrections Institution, a faith-based nonprofit organization.
CCI proposes to run a corrections institution for Texas for 90
percent of the current per prisoner cost and promises to reduce
recidivism by half.[95]

<p>

CCI's program will provide jobs and job training for up to 500
residents per facility.  It will satisfy all statutory requirements
for a penal institution, and it guarantees accreditation by the
American Correctional Association.  It will teach inmates marketable
skills and assure that skills will be marketable upon release.
It will also pay prevailing wages for the skills learned.  Inmates
will contribute to room and board, support their families, make
restitution to victims, establish savings accounts and have spending
accounts.[96]

<p>

To be eligible for the CCI facility, inmates must be at least
one year, but no more than two years, from initial parole eligibility
or mandatory release.  They must agree to stay at least one year
and make themselves available for all programs, services and employment.[97]

<p>

On May 8, 1996, CCI representatives met with representatives of
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice System to discuss key
points of a Texas-based APAC program.[98] CCI answered the Justice
System's legal questions:

<p><ul>

<li>A corrections program may be authorized for management by
nongovernment participants to further state interests and secular
purposes. State interests include lower incarceration costs,
lower recidivism rates and lower, long-term state expenses.

<p>

<li>The state must give a contractor the discretion to provide
religious or values elements without necessarily causing impermissible
state endorsement, so long as inmates voluntarily participate.

<p>

<li>Nonreligious elements can be funded with direct state support,
but religious elements should not be funded without legal authority.

</ul><p>

CCI's proposal satisfies these legal requirements.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Bill Glass Prison Ministry goes across the country spreading the
Gospel to hungry inmates.  &quot;I give myself to going to prisons,&quot;
says Glass, &quot;because men in prison...have come to a point
they realize they have a need, and they're willing to trust the
Lord...and what we're trying to say is that you can have a new
life.&quot;[99]

<p>

Chuck Colson, Prison Fellowship's founder and himself a former
prisoner, says prison may just be one of the best places to start
over again.  &quot;The Gospel is better news in prison than anywhere
else,&quot; says Colson, &quot;because these people really understand
the depths of their own sin.&quot;[100]

<p>

Religious rehabilitation programs work for many prisons.  They
provide a moral compass for inmates who have been led astray by
a corrupted value system. Work, education and drug programs,
although important, can't change the inner man which is the target
of faith-based programs.

<p>

The prisoner who acquires an intrinsic faith has a better chance
to live a crime-free post-prison life.  For those who must remain,
they are easier (translated less costly) to manage.  The taxpayer
collects the benefits from a rehabilitation philosophy that embraces
the life-changing power of religious faith.  It is an experiment
well worth trying.

<h2>THE FACTS ABOUT<br>
TEEN DRUG ABUSE:<br>
WHAT THE SURVEYS SAY</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Parents are rightfully concerned about and possibly confused by
the recent flurry of teen drug abuse reports.  The numbers seem
high and appear to be getting worse.  This paper will profile
the latest reports focusing on drug abuse by adolescents (ages
12 to 17).

<p>

The studies found:

<p><ul>

<li>Teenagers in trend-setting California are abusing drugs at
levels that rival peaks more than a decade ago.

<p>

<li>There is a significant downward shift in the number of teens
who perceive drug risks.

<p>

<li>Boomer parents seriously underestimate drug experimentation
among teenagers.

<p>

<li>Parents who talk to their teenagers about drugs can make
a significant difference.

<p>

<li>In 1995, heroin- and marijuana-related emergency room episodes
rose 19 and 17 percent, respectively.

<p>

<li>Most of the rise in heroin abuse is due to increased snorting
and smoking rather than needle injecting.

<p>

<li>Black teenagers are the most affected by the surge in marijuana
abuse (up 195 percent for males and 253 percent for females).

<p>

<li>Nearly half (44 percent) of all high school students smoked
cigarettes at least once last year.

<p>

<li>There is conflicting evidence that cigarettes may or may not
act as a gateway to illicit drug abuse.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>1995 NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE</h3></center>

<p>

On August 20, 1996 the federal government reported that adolescent
drug abuse is rising fast.  Alarms over the drug scourge sounded
across the country.

<p>

Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, warned,
&quot;Drug, alcohol and tobacco use by young people is a poison
in the well of our national future.&quot;  White House Drug Policy
Director General Barry McCaffrey said, &quot;We must not allow
drug use by young Americans to return to the disastrous levels
of the 1970's and early 1980's. That would be a tragedy.&quot;[1]

<p>

The 1995 National Household Survey (NHS) on Drug Abuse found that
an estimated 12.8 million Americans were current illicit drug
users.  In 1992, the rate of past-month illicit drug abuse by
adolescents (ages 12 to 17) reached a low of 5.3 percent. By
1995 it had climbed to 8.2 percent and now it is at 10.9 percent.
That is a 105 percent increase over the past three years.[2]

<p>

The NHS is a representative national sample and has been done
annually since 1971.  Since 1992, the survey has been supported
and directed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA), which is part of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.

<p>

In 1995, the teen drug of choice was marijuana.  The rate of past-month
use of marijuana jumped 33 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Since
1992, the rate has more than doubled.

<p>

The abuse of so-called &quot;hard&quot; drugs is especially alarming.
The NHS found that past-month adolescent abuse of cocaine shot
up 166 percent between 1994 and 1995, and LSD abuse rose 55 percent.

<p>

Perhaps more alarming are the number of recent first-time abusers.
Looking back over the past three decades (1964 to 1994), the
number of first-time adolescent abusers (ages 12 to 17) across
many illicit drugs has increased dramatically and especially over
the past four years. Consider the facts.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. Since 1991 the number of first time adolescent
abusers has risen 95 percent. Looking back three decades to 1964
there were 4,400 first-time marijuana users while in 1994 there
were 74,200.  That's an incredible increase of 1,600 percent.
<I>(Marijuana First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure
1)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. The number of first time adolescent cocaine
abusers has risen 820 percent since 1964 and 127 percent in just
the past three years.  In 1964, there were 1,100 first-time abusers
and 10,200 first-time abusers in 1994.<I>(Cocaine First-Time Adolescent
Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 2)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Inhalants</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time inhalant
abusers has increased 98 percent, and the number of first-time
inhalant abusers has increased 11,100 percent since 1964.  In
1994, NHS found that 22,200 teenagers abused inhalants for the
first time.  <I>(Inhalant First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994,
Figure 3)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogens</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time
hallucinogen abusers has increased 108 percent and the number
of first-time hallucinogen abusers has increased 2,000 percent
since 1964.  In 1994, NHS found that 23,300 teenagers abused
hallucinogens for the first time.  <I>(Hallucinogen First-Time
Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 4)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time heroin
abusers has increased 320 percent and the number of first-time
heroin abusers has increased 600 percent since 1964.  In 1994,
NHS found that 2,100 teenagers abused heroin for the first time.
<I>(Heroin First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 5)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time alcohol
abusers has increased 38 percent and the number of first-time
alcohol abusers has increased 277 percent since 1964.  In 1994,
NHS found that 171,900 teenagers abused alcohol for the first
time. <I>(Alcohol First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure
6)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Cigarettes</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time cigarette
abusers has increased 16 percent and the number of first-time
cigarette abusers has increased 33 percent since 1964.  In 1993,
NHS found that 125,400 teenagers abused cigarettes for the first
time.  The study found that teenagers who smoked were about eight
times as likely to use illicit drugs and 11 times as likely to
drink heavily as nonsmoking teens.  <I>(Cigarette First-Time Adolescent
Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 7)</I>

</ul><p>

The Drug Abuse Warning Network, also conducted by SAMHSA, reported
an increase in drug-related emergency room visits.  There were
531,800 drug-related visits last year, and the greatest increases
were attributed to heroin and marijuana-related episodes (up 19
percent and 17 percent, respectively, from 1994).  The most commonly
reported motive for taking a substance was &quot;suicide attempt
or gesture&quot; (38 percent).[3]

<p>

<center><h3>MONITORING THE FUTURE STUDY</h3></center>

<p>

Another government-sponsored study found similar teenage drug
abuse trends.  &quot;Monitoring the Future:  A Continuing Study
of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth&quot; is conducted by the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.[4] The study surveyed 50,000
8th-, 10th- and 12th- graders from 435 public and private schools
during the spring of 1995.

<p>

The proportion of 8th-graders taking any illicit drug has doubled
since 1991.  Since 1992 the proportion of any illicit drug abuse
has risen 65 percent among 10th-graders and 44 percent among 12th-graders.
The details are outlined below.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. Between 1991 and 1995, lifetime abuse among
8th-graders rose 166 percent (from 6 percent to 16 percent). 
Among 10th-graders annual abuse almost doubled from 15 percent
in 1992 to 29 percent in 1995.  Among 12th-graders annual abuse
increased 59 percent from 22 percent in 1992 to 35 percent in
1995. Nearly one in 20 high school seniors was a daily marijuana
abuser.

<p>

<li><b>LSD</b>. LSD abuse continued to rise.  The proportions
reporting abuse were 3 percent, 7 percent and 8 percent for 8th-,
10th- and 12th-graders respectively. Between 1991 and 1995 annual
abuse rose 76 percent for 8th-graders; 89 percent for 10th-graders;
and 54 percent for 12th-graders. For 12th-graders abuse within
the last month was up 37 percent.

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogens</b>. Hallucinogens other than LSD showed
a smaller increase in 1995. The annual prevalence rates for 8th-,
10th- and 12th-graders were 2 percent, 3 percent and 4 percent,
respectively.

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. Between 1991 and 1995 annual abuse rose 136
percent for 8th-graders; 59 percent for 10th-graders; and 14 percent
among 12th-graders.

<p>

<li><b>Crack cocaine</b>. Between 1991 and 1995 annual abuse
rose 129 percent for 8th-graders; 100 percent for 10th-graders;
and 40 percent for 12th-graders.

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Annual abuse in 1995 was between 1.1 percent
and 1.4 percent for all three grade levels -- a rise of 57 to
150 percent.  The investigators hypothesized that non-injection
forms of use like snorting and smoking account for the recent
rise.  Many heroin abusers reported only non-injectable use (32
percent, 45 percent, and 57 percent of past-year heroin users
for grades 8, 10 and 12, respectively).

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Heavy drinking (five or more drinks in a
row) was reported by 15 percent of 8th-graders; 24 percent of
10th-graders; and 30 percent of 12th-graders.

</ul><p>

Fewer students report seeing drugs as dangerous.  The risk perception
for marijuana dropped from 79 percent of 12th-graders in 1991
to 61 percent in 1995.  There was also a decline in the perceived
dangers of using crack cocaine, cocaine powder, LSD and heroin.

<p>

Lloyd Johnston, principal investigator of the Michigan study,
blames the lack of information and anti-drug emphasis for the
growing drug problem.  &quot;These newest waves of children entering
adolescence,&quot; said Johnston, &quot;have had less opportunity
to learn about the dangers of drugs than did youngsters who grew
up in the eighties.... During the last three or four years the
amount of public attention paid to the drug problem, and its ravages,
has plummeted.  There are dramatically fewer newscasts on the
subject and fewer anti-drug commercials are getting on the air.&quot;[5]

<p>

Johnston says that most Americans still see drugs as dangerous
but warns &quot;there is a clear erosion in these attitudes and
beliefs, and we conclude that this erosion explains most of the
change in their actual drug-using behaviors.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>TREND-SETTING STATE ABUSE UP</h3></center>

<p>

California has long been identified as the nation's trend setter.
A recent report from that state should shock all Americans.

<p>

On August 26, 1996, California's Attorney General released a new
statewide survey that shows drug abuse rising rapidly.[6] Dan Lungren,
the attorney general, said, &quot;In the late 80's, drug use among
California students decreased.  In the early 90's, it mostly leveled
off, with some warning signs of small increases.  Over the past
four years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in drug use
among students -- back to levels that rival peaks ten years ago.&quot;

<p>

The sixth biennial &quot;California Student Substance Use Survey&quot;
polled public school students in grades 7, 9 and 11. Based on
student reports of drug use within the past six months, it found:

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. More than a third (34.2 percent) of 9th-graders
have abused marijuana within the past six months, a 60 percent
rise in four years.  Nearly half (42.8 percent) of 11th-graders
have abused marijuana within the past six months, a 46 percent
rise in four years.

<p>

<li><b>Amphetamine</b>.  More than one in ten (10.8 percent) of
9th-graders have abused amphetamines within the past six months,
a 227 percent rise in four years.  More than one in ten (10.4
percent) of 11th-graders have abused amphetamines within the past
six months, a 53 percent rise in four years.

<p>

<li><b>LSD</b>. Nearly one in ten (9.9 percent) of 9th-graders
have abused LSD within the past six months, a 161 percent rise
in four years.  More than one in ten (10.8 percent) of 11th-graders
have abused LSD within the past six months, a 33 percent rise
in four years.

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Heroin abuse for 9th-graders has jumped from
1.0 percent in the last survey to 2.9 percent, a 190 percent increase
in just two years.  Eleventh-graders have seen a 69 percent increase
in the last four years.

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. Cocaine abuse among 9th-graders has jumped
78 percent in the last four years.  For 11th-graders it has risen
9 percent.

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Most teens have used alcohol in the last
six months (50.3 percent of 7th-graders; 67.2 percent of 9th-graders;
and 75.3 percent of 11th-graders).

</ul><p>

Attorney General Lungren blames parents and the pop culture for
rising abuse rates.  He says some of the parents are abusers themselves.
The glamorization of heroin is the most recent example of media's
drug promotion effort.  &quot;We can look to the advertising business
to spot a trend,&quot; says Lungren. &quot;Companies such as Gucci
and Versace use emaciated, pale models with dark circles under
their eyes, known as the 'heroin chic' look, to sell clothing.
One company goes so far as to have one of its models roll up
his sleeve, as if he is getting ready to 'shoot up.'&quot;

<p>

Lungren called for a &quot;return to the power&quot; of the truth.
&quot;Our national commitment in the 1980s to a cultural discouragement
of drugs with its emphasis on youth prevention and zero tolerance
worked,&quot; said Lungren.

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICA'S LARGEST PARENT GROUP<br>
FINDS HIGH DRUG ABUSE</h3></center>

<p>

The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) announced
that teenagers are using drugs more and too few parents are doing
what they can to prevent it.

<p>

On November 2, 1995, PRIDE reported significant increases in cigarette
and marijuana abuse among students in grades 6 through 12.[7] There
were also rises in cocaine and hallucinogen abuse.

<p>

PRIDE's annual survey, which included nearly 200,000 students,
found the following levels of drug abuse.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana.</b> One third of high school seniors smoked
marijuana in the past year, and 21 percent smoke monthly.  Nine
of 10 marijuana smoking seniors said they started pot smoking
during high school years at ages 14 to 17.  Young blacks are the
most affected by the surge in marijuana abuse.  Use among black
males rose by 195 percent (4.5 percent to 13.3 percent) in the
past four years, and use by black females rose by 253 percent
(1.9 percent to 6.7 percent).

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. PRIDE found a 36 percent increase (3.3 percent
to 4.5 percent) in cocaine use by high school students since 1991-92.

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogen</b>. Use has risen 75 percent (4.4 percent
to 7.7 percent) since 1988-89.

<p>

<li><b>Cigarettes</b>. Cigarette abuse has reached its highest
level since PRIDE began surveying.  Nearly half (44 percent) of
all high school students smoked at least once in the past year,
compared with 37 percent in 1988-89.

</ul><p>

PRIDE found that parents who talk to their teenagers about drugs
can make a difference. Drug abuse declined among students whose 
parents frequently discussed drugs with them.  Among high school 
students whose parents &quot;never&quot; talk about drugs, 
one-third (34 percent) smoked marijuana, versus
one-quarter (24 percent) among high school students who said they
talk with their parents &quot;a lot&quot; about drugs.

<p>

Thomas J. Gleaton, president of PRIDE, said, &quot;The most effective
drug prevention program in the world -- parental intervention
-- is used far less than we think.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>1996 SURVEY BY PARTNERSHIP FOR A DRUG-FREE AMERICA</h3></center>

<p>

Drug surveys have consistently shown that abuse rises as perception
of risk falls.  A recent nationwide survey validates this observation.

<p>

&quot;Changes in attitudes drive changes in behavior,&quot; said
Ginna Marston, director of research and strategic development
for Partnership for a Drug-Free America.  &quot;These findings
tell us one thing:  drug use will continue increasing among teenagers
until these attitudes change.&quot;[8]

<p>

In 1996, PDFA announced the results of its annual Partnership
Attitude Tracking Study.  This is the largest, ongoing body of
research on drug-related attitudes in America.  The survey sampled
teenagers, pre-teens and parents about attitudes, parent-child
communication and risks.  It found:

<p><ul>

<li>Adolescents see fewer physical and social risks in illicit
drugs.

<p>

<li>Most (60 percent) baby boomer parents are drug experienced.

<p>

<li>Three out of four boomer parents do not want their teenagers
experimenting with drugs.

<p>

<li>Boomer parents seriously underestimate drug experimentation
among their teenagers (14 percent of parents believe their children
have experimented with marijuana but 38 percent of teens report
smoking pot).

<p>

<li>There is a communication gap between teens and parents.  Most
parents (95 percent) say they have talked with their children
about drugs, but only 77 percent of teens agree.

</ul><p>

There has also been a shift in the drug risks perceived by teenagers.

<p><ul>

<li>The number of teens who agree with the statement &quot;taking
drugs scares me&quot; declined from 47 percent in 1993 to 36 percent
in 1995.

<p>

<li>The number of teens who agree with the statement that they
do not want to hang around with drug users declined from 55 percent
in 1993 to 39 percent in 1995.

<p>

<li>Teens see less risk in regular and trial use of marijuana.

<p>

<li>Teens see less risk in both crack and cocaine abuse.

</ul><p>

The study speculated about why there has been a drop in perceived
drug risks.

<p><ul>

<li>Select music groups encourage marijuana legalization.   In
1995, Capricorn Records released <I>Hempilation</I>, a benefit
album for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML).  At least 45 bands have declared support for legalizing
marijuana.

<p>

<li>Marijuana abuse is portrayed lightly or as inconsequential
behavior. The number of drug-related stories airing on the three
major television networks between 1989 and 1994 declined by more
than 83 percent (from 518 stories in 1989 to 82 in 1994).  Some
of the programs were veiled drug promotions like <I>ABC</I>'s
&quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
(April 6, 1995) and <I>Discovery Channel's</I> &quot;The War on
Drugs&quot; (June 20, 1995).  Even the network news favorably
profiled marijuana.  For example, <I>NBC</I>'s <I>Nightly News</I>
aired a one-sided viewpoint by Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a member
of NORML.  The <I>NBC</I> &quot;Health News&quot; segment by Robert
Bazell interviewed many people who claim marijuana helps them
with medical problems that include AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma,
and cancer.  <I>NBC</I> ignored more than 10,500 scientific studies
which chronicle the adverse consequences of marijuana use.

<p>

<li>The marijuana fashion craze in the early 1990s attracted wide
media attention.  Companies like Adidas have popularized marijuana
through the introduction of &quot;The Hemp&quot; shoe.  Hemp is
a name for the type of plant from which marijuana is derived.

<p>

<li>The public continues to debate the legalization of drugs.
Several years ago, the Surgeon General called for a study of
drug legalization.  Noted conservative columnist William F. Buckley,
Jr. called for legalization in a widely publicized edition of
<I>National Review</I> (February 12, 1996).  On November 5, 1996
Californians will be asked to decide whether to legalize marijuana
for medicinal purposes.

</ul><p>

&quot;With teenagers seeing fewer risks with marijuana and drug
use,&quot; said Partnership Chairman James Burke, &quot;we can
expect to see another increase in adolescent drug use in 1996....
After years of tremendous progress, the country is losing precious,
hard-won ground in its effort to curb adolescent drug use.  Today's
drug trends are similar to those of the late 1960s, and the outlook
for the near future is disturbing.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>SURVEY LINKS DRUG ABUSE TO POPULAR CULTURE</h3></center>

<p>

Adults and adolescents see popular culture as a major factor in
the recent increase of drug abuse, according to Columbia University
researchers.

<p>

The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia
released a national survey on June 29, 1995 showing that 76 percent
of adolescents and 67 percent of adults blame popular culture
-- television, movies, magazines, and popular music -- for encouraging
illegal drug use.[9]

<p>

&quot;What's at stake here is America's children,&quot; says CASA
president and former HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr.  &quot;We
know that individuals who make it from age 10 to age 20 without
using illegal drugs, without abusing alcohol, without smoking,
are virtually certain never to do so.&quot;

<p>

The Luntz Research Company, which surveyed 2,400 adults and adolescents,
asked, &quot;What is the most important problem facing kids today?&quot;
One-third of the adolescents answered &quot;drugs.&quot;  A distant
second with 13 percent was &quot;crime and violence in school,&quot;
which often also involves drugs.

<p>

<center><h3>TARGETING THE TOBACCO GATEWAY</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton administration has chosen to avoid the epidemic of
illicit drug abuse and/or attack it indirectly via a frontal assault
on tobacco.  It has launched a major assault on teen tobacco abuse
by issuing a presidential executive order to classify nicotine
as a drug.  Apparently the President believes reducing tobacco's
availability will protect teenagers from the temptation of cigarettes
and will impact the illicit drug problem because tobacco abuse
as a gateway to illicit drugs.  But not all experts agree.

<p>

Tobacco is not necessarily a gateway for illicit drugs.  According
to an Abt. Associates Inc. memorandum dated August 28, 1995 and
given to the White House, &quot;Smokers do not necessarily become
marijuana users.&quot;  Abt.'s reports that &quot;about two of
every three marijuana users became marijuana users before they
smoked cigarettes.&quot;[10]

<p>

The &quot;gateway&quot; theory is bolstered, however, by Lloyd
Johnston, the principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future
Study.  He wrote in 1995, &quot;[c]igarette smoking is strongly
correlated with the use of marijuana, and suggest[s] that the
upturn in cigarette smoking during the past four to five years
may well have contributed to the increase in marijuana use of
the same period.  Because smoking usually precedes marijuana use
and teaches youngsters how to take smoke into their lungs to secure
a drug-induced effect, it provides an excellent training ground
for learning how to smoke marijuana.&quot;[11]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Snuffing-out Joe Camel and Mr. Kool are only part of the answer
to the illicit drug plague.  Leaders at all levels must speak
out against the danger of illicit drugs.  Strong law enforcement
must stop the supply, and parents must communicate frankly and
frequently with their children.  Drugs should be demonized not
glamorized by the media.  These changes will go a long way to
increase the perceived level of risk for teenagers.

<p>

The facts about drugs are clear  -- illicit drug abuse is rising.
Now is not the time to divert attention away from the dangerous
threat of illicit drugs.   Most Americans want a tough line on
drugs.  They know that taking a tough line will save lives and
taxpayer money.

PREGNANT WOMEN MAKE<br>
ADOPTION PLANS?</h2>

<p>

A glaring discrepancy exists between what Americans believe and
how they behave regarding adoption as a positive response to crisis
pregnancies. Consider the following data:

<p>

<li>Many Americans believe that adoption is the best response
to an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. A 1995 Family Research Council
survey of 1,000 Americans found that, when presented with four
options to resolve out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancies, 29 percent
of respondents thought it best to &quot;have the child and put
it up for adoption;&quot; 24 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to marry the child's father and have the child;&quot; 11
percent thought it best for the mother &quot;to have the child
and raise it by herself;&quot; and only 8 percent thought it best
for her to have an abortion.[1]

<p>

However, in reality, 46 percent of all the nonmarital pregnancies
in 1991 ended in induced abortion, 10 percent ended in miscarriage,
and 44 percent were carried to term, of which only 2 percent were
placed for adoption.[2] (It is not known whether the mother eventually
married the child's father or chose to raise the child by herself
in the remaining 98 percent of &quot;live birth&quot; cases.)

<p>

<li>Many young, unmarried pregnant women also hold favorable attitudes
toward those who choose adoption. A survey of such women staying
in maternity homes found that the majority, regardless of whether
they were choosing adoption or single parenthood, hold positive
attitudes toward mothers who place their children for adoption.
The respondents believe that a woman who places her baby for adoption
loves the baby, wants the best for the baby, is being a good parent
in a special way, is being responsible, and is neither selfish
nor abandoning the baby.[3] Nevertheless, many of these same unmarried
pregnant women had never considered adoption as an option for
their children.

<p>

Why do so few unmarried women choose adoption in reality when
both they and the general American public hold favorable attitudes
toward adoption? Also, what accounts for the decline of adoptions 
over time? Before 1973, about one in five non-marital births to white 
women was placed for adoption. By the late 1970s, this proportion had 
shrunk to less than one in 10, and by the late 1980s, to one in 30.[4]

<p>

The answer may lie less in the fact that public opinion towards
adoption has changed than in the fact that other options have
overshadowed adoption, making adoption less visible as an alternative.

<p>

The impact of three major social trends during the last two to
three decades may provide some clues to this phenomenon:

<p>

(1) <b>Increasing Social Acceptance of Single Parenthood</b> --
The sheer prevalence of single-parent families has increased the
social acceptability of single motherhood. For example, in 1970,
13 percent of all families with children were single-parent families.
By 1994, more than 30 percent of all families with children were
headed by a single parent.[5]

<p>

The trend towards single parenthood began with the liberalizing
of divorce laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the subsequent
divorce epidemic. Indeed, the number of divorces per year tripled
between 1960 and 1990.[6] But when divorce began to level off in
the 1980s, the growth in illegitimacy continued the trend. In
1970, 11 percent of all births were to unmarried women; in 1980,
18 percent of all births were nonmarital; and by 1991, an astounding
30 percent of all births were out-of-wedlock.[7] Yet, even more significant
than the rise in nonmarital births is the even faster growth in
the <I>visibility</I> of illegitimacy. Adoption helps to mask
the visibility of illegitimacy because the child born out-of-wedlock
is immediately placed in a two-parent home. However, the proportion
of unmarried women choosing adoption dramatically declined during
the same time period that illegitimacy rates rose.

<p>

It is this high visibility of single-parent families that has
made single parenting normative in today's society. Thus, there
is more precedent for young unmarried women to choose single parenthood
and comparatively less incentive for them to place their children
in adoptive homes.

<p>

(2) <b>The Legalization of Abortion</b> -- The introduction of
abortion has greatly diminished the likelihood of choosing adoption
because it has altered the thought processes by which both the
pregnant woman and her counselors approach an unintended pregnancy.

<p>

Before abortion was legalized, women facing a crisis pregnancy
had only to decide among three or four options: adoption, marrying
the father, raising the child herself and/or having her parent
raise the child. Among these options, adoption fared relatively
well as one in five white women chose adoption.

<p>

However, after abortion was legalized, a two-tiered thought process
replaced the previously one-tiered process. The preeminent question
was no longer &quot;Who shall raise this child?&quot; but rather,
&quot;Shall I have this child?&quot; And with that change in question
also came a change in focus from being child-centered to woman-centered.
Thus, it is not surprising that fewer women are choosing adoption
because adoption typically requires a child-centered focus.

<p>

Since the legalization of abortion, pregnancy counselors must
also spend much more time and effort addressing the first question
of &quot;Shall this pregnancy be carried to term or aborted?&quot;
And while this must be the first question addressed, too often
counselors give short shrift to the second question of &quot;Who
shall raise this child?&quot; One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors failed to include adoption as an option
in their counseling. Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. Some
even failed to present adoption as an option because they thought
the girls would not want to hear about it.[8]

<p>

(3) <b>Increasing Availability and Use of Welfare Benefits</b>
-- To the degree financial considerations play a role in whether
a woman chooses to marry, place for adoption, or raise the child
herself, the increasing availability and use of welfare benefits
add weight to the single-parenting option. Beginning in the late
1960s, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Medicaid
benefits for pregnant, single mothers became well-established
and well-used. Both AFDC and Medicaid have grown tremendously
over the last two decades as more and more unwed mothers have
chosen single parenthood. Knowing that they have this &quot;safety
net&quot; on which to fall back, many unmarried women choose to
raise their infants rather than make adoption plans.

<p>

In conclusion, despite the fact that most Americans favorably
view adoption, several major social trends have altered the course
of the discussion and made the adoption option less visible. However,
there is a growing counter-movement to change the terms of discourse
once again and combat the social trends that lead not only to
fewer adoptions, but also to greater numbers of out-of-wedlock
births, abortions, and welfare recipients. During the mid-1980s,
a &quot;new wave&quot; of adoption and maternity services agencies
began opening up in the United States. These include more private
adoption agencies, pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, maternity
homes, and private charitable organizations. The degree to which
these institutions grow more visible and flourish is the degree
to which adoption can grow, narrowing the gap between public opinion
and reality.

<p>

Americans want to protect civil liberties, but they also want
to avoid freeing violent criminals on technicalities while ensuring
that police officers do not abuse their authority. Striking
this delicate balance is the subject of a national debate that
centers on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.

<p>

The Fourth Amendment guarantees &quot;[t]he right of the people
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures[.]&quot;  To protect this right,
the modern judiciary created the exclusionary rule, which says
that prosecutors may not use evidence gathered illegally by the
police.  The rule is intended to keep law enforcement honest.

<p>

Policemen must obtain a warrant prior to searching and seizing.
Otherwise, evidence obtained at a crime scene may be ruled inadmissible
in court.  Judges routinely exclude such &quot;illegally&quot;
obtained evidence and allow criminals to go free. For example:

<p><ul>

<li>Charles Rathbun was arrested for the November 1995 murder
of model Linda Sobek.  He allegedly took Sobek into the California
hills, where he murdered her and buried her body.  During questioning,
Rathbun confessed to the crime and led officials to Sobek's grave.
A California court, however, ruled Rathbun's confession inadmissible
because police had not read him his rights prior to questioning.[1]
He may go free.

<p>

<li>Gary Gauger confessed to the gruesome murder of his parents
in 1993.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  On appeal,
an Illinois court ruled that his confession was inadmissible because
it, too, was illegally obtained.[2] He may go free.

<p>

<li>In 1984, Alfio Ferro was arrested for a fur robbery and murder.
While in custody, Ferro refused to speak with police.  One of
the detectives laid some furs in front of Ferro's cell.  Ferro,
thinking the police had information about the crime, made statements
which were later used against him.  A New York appeals court overturned
his murder conviction, contending that the placing of furs in
front of Ferro's cell amounted to coercion.  Ferro was freed.[3]

</ul><p>

Pending legislation which will alter the exclusionary rule might
have kept these murderers behind bars.

<p>

<center><h3>GROWING NATIONAL INTOLERANCE FOR LEGAL ABUSES</h3></center>

<p>

According to Steven Wagner of Luntz Research, a Republican polling
firm, there is a widespread feeling that the criminal justice
system has broken down and that the breakdown is &quot;the most
visible symbol of the declining moral character of American 
society.&quot;[4] Consider evidence of a wayward justice system.

<p>

In January 1996, at 5 a.m., a New York police officer patrolling
a high-crime area saw four young men loading duffel bags into
the trunk of an out-of-state car.  The men fled when they saw
the officer.  The officer found $4 million worth of cocaine and
heroin in the bags.[5]

<p>

Initially, federal District Court Judge Harold Baer found the
officer's explanation &quot;incredible&quot; and threw out the
trafficker's videotaped confession, saying the arrested driver
could have been an innocent visitor getting help with her luggage.[6]
He denied that the police had &quot;probable cause&quot; for
searching the car.  The judge also said the men fled because of
the police department's reputation for being brutal.  Only after
a buildup of political pressure (including from President Clinton,
who had appointed the judge) did Baer reverse the finding.[7]

<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich called on President Clinton to admit
he had made mistakes in appointing judges &quot;who find technicalities
to release drug dealers and dangerous criminals.&quot;[8] Others
accused Baer of favoring the rights of criminals over public safety.

<p>

Nevertheless, it is not difficult to see why some Americans are
suspicious of law enforcement.  Tales of police corruption, rogue
cops and evidence &quot;planting&quot; fill the media.  Testimony
in the O.J. Simpson murder trial by former Los Angeles detective
Mark Fuhrman eroded confidence in all policemen.  Fuhrman gave
the country a startling example of police brutality and racism.
Fuhrman bragged on tape about police abuses:  &quot;We basically
tortured them. . . .We broke'em.  Their faces were just mush.&quot;[9]

<p>

The widely-publicized Rodney King beating and the recent videotape
of two white deputies clubbing Mexicans near Los Angeles have
revived fears of rogue cops.  The &quot;Good Ol' Boys Roundup&quot;
in eastern Tennessee, where law enforcement agents took part in
racist acts, also add to the public's negative perception of law
enforcement.

<p>

Although these scenes do not represent the hundreds of thousands
of law enforcement officers who do their job well and faithfully
every day, they have undermined public confidence in the justice
and law enforcement systems and have chilled the exclusionary
rule debate.  Americans are confused about calls to reform the
rule.  Should lawmakers leave the rule alone or give police more
authority? Both options have liabilities.

<p>

<center><h3>THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE IN HISTORY</h3></center>

<p>

The exclusionary rule was created by the courts to implement the
Fourth Amendment.  It dates back to colonial times when British
troops broke down doors of homes seeking criminal evidence.  The
framers of America's Bill of Rights had one specific incident
in mind.

<p>

The 1763 case of <I>Wilkes v. Wood</I> clearly illustrates the
need for the Fourth Amendment. British troops, acting without
a warrant, broke into Wilkes' home and seized his private diaries.
Wilkes won his damage action against the colonial government.
His case steeled the Constitution's framers with a desire to
preclude future abuses.

<p>

Although the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights guarantees
to all persons the right to be secure from &quot;unreasonable&quot;
searches and seizures, it does not specify a remedy for violations
of this protection.  This is where the Supreme Court has sought
clarity.

<p>

In the 1820s, an attorney argued before the high court that the
Constitution provided for the exclusion of evidence.  Supreme
Court Justice Joseph Story denied that the Bill of Rights included
the concept of excluding evidence.  Story wrote, &quot;The right
of using evidence does not depend, nor, as far as I have any recollection,
has ever been supposed to depend, upon the lawfulness or unlawfulness
of the mode by which it is obtained.&quot;[10]

<p>

In 1886, however, the high court took the first steps toward creating
the modern exclusionary rule.  In <I>Boyd v. United States</I>,
the Supreme Court decided that using a man's diary or personal
papers as evidence against him in a criminal case would force
him &quot;to be a witness against himself.&quot;[11] Under these
circumstances, the court opined, the use of such evidence could
be denied.

<p>

In 1914, the exclusionary rule was officially created by the <I>Weeks
v. United States</I> decision. The high court determined that
evidence seized illegally had to be excluded.   The court reasoned
that the temptation to make unlawful searches and seizures could
not be checked by the threat of a civil lawsuit alone, and that
forcing law enforcement officials to get proper warrants would
force them to act with restraint. The court also reasoned that
denying police the fruits of unrestrained searches was an appropriate
defense of civil liberties.

<p>

As in the 1949 <I>Wolf v. Colorado</I> case, the high court resisted
forcing the rule on state courts. But in 1961, Chief Justice
Earl Warren led the Supreme Court in <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> to expand
the rule's application to all jurisdictions.  In 1984, it was
modified with <I>Leon v. United States</I>. In this case police
conducted a search pursuant to a search warrant that later was
found to have been defective.  The Supreme Court said that because
the officers believed they were acting properly, denying the evidence
would not deter future misconduct.  This has become known as the
&quot;good-faith&quot; exception.

<p>

The &quot;good-faith&quot; exception has also been applied in
situations where police gathered evidence without a search warrant
but in the reasonable belief that their actions were proper.

<p>

Now that the exclusionary rule has been tried for 80 years, it
has earned both supporters and detractors.  Professor William
Gangi of St. John's University told the Senate Judiciary Committee,
&quot;I see Americans growing increasingly cynical about our criminal
justice system, making derogatory references to 'technicalities'
or to criminals having more rights than their victims. And we
have to ask ourselves, 'Why?'&quot;[12]

<p>

<center><h3>HANDS-OFF THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

Defenders of the exclusionary rule claim it keeps lawmen honest.

<p>

Alan Dershowtiz, Harvard law professor and civil liberties advocate,
cautions that expanding the defendant's rights using the exclusionary
rule is the best way to protect the public from police abuses.[13]

<p>

James Fyfe, a former New York policeman and specialist on police
behavior, warns that &quot;...like some soldiers in a no-win war,
they [policemen] commit atrocities.&quot;[14]

<p>

This warning is not without substance.  The 1994 New York City
Mollen Commission investigated police corruption.  It found the
Department plagued with misconduct.  The Commission also found
that the Department's internal affairs &quot;often minimized and
even concealed corruption rather than rooted it out.&quot;  In
March 1994, 50 cops were arrested on charges of drug trafficking,
extortion, brutality and civil rights violations.[15]

<p>

Recently, Philadelphia had a similar police scandal.  Six rogue
cops pleaded guilty to charges that they framed people, lied to
obtain search warrants and stole money.  At least 42 criminal
convictions have been overturned as a result of these disclosures.[16]

<p>

Some key members of Congress support the exclusionary rule as
a check on police corruption.  On March 7, 1995, Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;The
exclusionary rule enforces the Fourth Amendment by providing a
powerful disincentive to illegal searches by law enforcement
officials. . . .The rule has given prosecutors' offices and police
departments an institutional stake in thorough, lawful police
work.&quot;[17] Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and Rep. Bobby
Rush (D-Ill.) both claim to have been victimized by warrantless
federal searches.[18]

<p>

The American Bar Association also supports the rule.  Michael
McCann, an elected district attorney of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin,
spoke for the ABA at the same Senate Judiciary crime control hearing.
&quot;The rule has worked. . . .It has contributed to substantial
law reform by federal authorities.  It has increased the professionalism
of federal law enforcement officers.  It has vastly enhanced the
integrity of the federal judicial process.&quot;[19]

<p>

Rule supporters point out that complaints of abuse are often unfounded.
They cite four studies that show that the rule is seldom used
to toss out evidence.  A 1979 General Accounting Office report
found that motions to suppress evidence were granted in only 1.3
percent of federal cases.  A 1982 National Institute of Justice
study found that only 0.79 percent of all California felony cases
between 1976-79 rejected evidence because of the rule.  A study
of three midwestern states found the rule was used in less than
half of 1 percent of all cases.  Finally, Professor Wayne LaFave of the
University of Illinois College of Law found, &quot;The most careful
and balanced assessment of all available empirical data show [sic]
that. . .the cumulative loss in felony cases because of prosecutor
screening, police releases and court dismissals attributable to
the acquisition of evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment
is from 0.6 percent to 2.35 percent.&quot;[20]

<p>

Even some peace officers support the rule.  Myron Orfield Jr.,
writing in the <I>University of Chicago Law Review</I>, quotes
the head of the narcotics section of the Organized Crime Division
of the Chicago Police Department:  &quot;In my personal opinion
[the exclusionary rule] is not a detriment to police work.  In
fact, the opposite is true.  It makes the police department more
professional.&quot;[21]

<p>

FBI director Louis Freeh said, &quot;My sense and my experience
have been that over the years, the exclusionary rule has not been
an obstacle to the FBI.&quot;[22]

<p>

John Dawes, a Cobb County, Georgia, homicide detective said, &quot;It's
been my experience that it's better to have a legal search warrant
issued by a judge.  That way, when you're entering, you know that
you're legally entering and legally gathering evidence.&quot;[23]

<p>

Justice Louis Brandeis endorsed placing constraints on law enforcers.
He wrote for the high court in the 1928 case <I>Olmstead v. United
States</I>: &quot;Our government is the potent, the omnipresent
teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by
its example. . . .If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds
contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself;
it invites anarchy.&quot;[24]

<p>

Harvard law professor Carol Steiker echoed Brandeis's views to
the Senate Judiciary Committee at the March 7, 1995 hearing. 
She traced the expansion in the size and strength of our modern
police forces and said, &quot;Today's citizens are much more likely
to face well-trained and well-equipped police than they are to
encounter the anonymous blundering constable [who was once blamed
for making illegal searches]. . . .&quot;  She argues that modern
police are &quot;measured not by fidelity to procedural niceties
but rather by their ability to ferret out as much crime as possible.
In this respect, the Fourth Amendment's warrant clause and the
exclusionary rule are eminently realistic constitutional commands:
each counterbalances the natural incentive to fight crime at
any cost.&quot;[25]

<p>

She cited Justice Brandeis: &quot;To declare that in the administration
of the criminal law the end justifies the means -- to declare
that the government would commit crimes in order to secure the
conviction of a private criminal -- would bring terrible 
retribution.&quot;[26]

<p>

Steiker says the exclusionary rule protects the most vulnerable
citizens from police over-reaching.  Specifically, she contends,
racial minorities are discriminated against by law enforcement
because too often race and class act as proxies for criminality
and too often police subject minority communities to the most
intrusive and offensive law enforcement tactics.[27]

<p>

She further argues that the rule encourages prosecutors and law
enforcement to communicate during the early stages of investigations
so as to develop evidence that can be used in court. Finally,
Steiker believes it protects the judicial process by preventing
government from being implicated in legitimizing unlawful conduct.[28]

<p>

<center><h3>CHANGE THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE</h3></center>

<p>

On the other hand, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, disputes the notion that the exclusionary
rule deters police misconduct.  He argues that there is &quot;little
reliable empirical evidence that police misconduct has been deterred
by the rule.&quot;[29]

<p>

Judge Harold Rothwax, former vice chairman of the New York Civil
Liberties Union during the 1960s says, &quot;The pendulum has
now swung to the point that it unfairly favors the defendant 
[criminal].&quot;[30]

<p>

Judge Rothwax warns, &quot;What's happened is we've really departed
from common sense. . . . The system today seems incomprehensible to 
the average citizen.&quot;[31]

<p>

Steven Brill, editor-in-chief of <I>Court TV</I> and <I>The American
Lawyer</I>, agrees. &quot;There's no doubt that lots and lots
of people of good faith -- who aren't anti-civil liberties and
aren't right-wing zealots -- are increasingly frustrated.&quot;[32]

<p>

Professor Gangi told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;I call
it a disgrace.  Not only has the exclusionary rule failed to work
the magic its proponents promised, but it has eroded citizen confidence
in the competency of government.  And, in my opinion, it also
has thoroughly undermined the nobility of the role once played
by defense counsel.&quot;[33]

<p>

Paul Robinson, a professor at Northwestern University School of
Law, writes in <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, &quot;The exclusionary
rule...suggests a system less strongly committed to doing justice
than to discouraging overreaching by the police.&quot;  He suggests
that police misconduct can be controlled by making offending officers
liable or by helping victims to get compensation from municipalities.
He says, &quot;If limiting overreaching by the police is such
an important goal, why not attack it head-on rather than 'punishing'
the offending officers by letting the criminal go free -- which
punishes society rather than the officers?&quot;[34]

<p>

<center><h3>PENDING LEGISLATION WOULD CHANGE THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

The Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666) would expand
the so-called &quot;good-faith&quot; exception to certain federal
searches without a warrant.  Evidence would be admissible as long
as trial judges determine that police had reason to believe that
their actions were proper.  The bill would not overturn prior
Supreme Court decisions specifying when a warrant must be obtained
prior to conducting a search.

<p>

Professor Steiker admits that this bill would not eliminate the
exclusionary rule but proposes it would admit unconstitutionally
seized evidence when law enforcement agents have a belief in the
legitimacy of their conduct.  She argues that this change ignores
the importance of the rule in the maintenance of judicial integrity
and fails to provide equally effective deterrence of unconstitutional
conduct. Further, she believes it will encourage police overreaching.[35]

<p>

Thomas Davies, professor at the University of Tennessee College
of Law, agrees with Steiker.  He believes H.R. 666 would provide
short-term gains, &quot;but the rule plays a vital role in reaffirming
the rule of law.  [The exclusionary rule and Mirander Waiver rules]
tell police officers that citizen's rights matter.  They allow
honest police officers to respect themselves as upstanding citizens
also.&quot;[36]

<p>

Senator Hatch's legislation, The Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Improvement Act of 1995 (S.3), would eliminate the
rule entirely and establish in its place a civil tort remedy designed
to benefit citizens whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated.

<p>

Hatch argues, the &quot;rule is not compelled by the Constitution.
. . .It is time to revisit this judicially-created remedy.&quot;[37]
He wants to strike the delicate balance between protecting the
rights of the accused from police misconduct while ensuring that
relevant evidence comes before the jury -- so as to put the truly
guilty in jail and achieve justice.
Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School, told the Senate
Judiciary Committee  that the Hatch bill &quot;restores coherence
to our constitutional structure.  It takes the Fourth Amendment
out of criminal procedure, where it does not fit, and puts it
back where it belongs: in constitutional law.&quot;[38] He also
said, &quot;Suppose the bill increases convictions of guilty defendants
by 1 percent.  That's a lot of guilty rapists, murderers, and
robbers, and a lot of victims of crime who can sleep easier.&quot;[39]

<p>

The Hatch bill is not without its opponents.  Senator Kennedy
said that enactment of the Hatch bill &quot;would invite drastically
reduced compliance with the Constitution.&quot;[40]

<p>

Professor Steiker believes that removing the rule would fail to
provide the required deterrent effect and that the tort alternative
is misdirected.  Victims of illegal searches would not bring suit
against police misconduct either because lawyers would be reluctant
to take such cases or the likely awards would be insufficiently
enticing.[41]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

There are competing concepts in the exclusionary rule debate 
-- freedom from police misconduct and justice for the guilty.
We must find a balance.

<p>

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote from his Birmingham, Alabama
jail cell, &quot;Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor,
it must be demanded by the oppressed.&quot;[42] Most citizens would
agree with Dr. King.

<p>

Today, there is ample evidence that some lawmen and judges are
over-stepping their bounds.  This must change.  Congress should
modify the law to simultaneously deny freedom to the guilty, give
incentives for police professionalism and protect civil liberties.
It can start by changing the court-created exclusionary rule.

<p>

Treating addicts is an important part of the nation's drug war.
When abusers are in treatment they aren't committing crimes, and
after treatment some never return to their formerly destructive
ways. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of addicts seek treatment,
usually as part of their punishment, and treatment programs are
limited. More significantly, the government is actively discouraging
some of the most effective programs.

<p>

Faith-based drug treatment programs consistently produce the highest
&quot;cure&quot; rates in the country. In spite of high success
rates and zero cost to taxpayers, the government has often stiff-armed
these programs.

<p><ul>

<li>The Texas Commission of Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA) tried
to shut down faith-based Victory Outreach, which is a rehabilitation
program run by former addicts. Outreach founder Freddie Garcia
said, &quot;We don't use drugs or psychiatrists or any of that,
only Bible study.&quot;[1] Garcia claims a 70 percent success rate
for his privately funded program, while government programs cure
less than 10 percent of their clients and cost hundreds of dollars
per day. He explained, &quot;We believe that sin is the reason
why people take drugs....We believe that the drug addict is a
slave to sin, not to drugs. We believe that drug addiction is
a spiritual problem, and that Jesus Christ is the solution.&quot;[2]
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, &quot;Freddie Garcia has achieved
results that are almost unheard of....All too often the bureaucracy
has tried to put folks like Freddie out of business because they
don't have a Ph.D., or they don't fill out the paperwork right...instead,
they run very inexpensive neighborhood programs that feel more
comfortable to people on the street.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>Teen Challenge of South Texas was almost shut down by TCADA.
Like Garcia's organization, Teen Challenge is a faith-based program
with cure rates of 70 to 85 percent.[4] Teen Challenge has been successfully
treating drug addicts since its founding in 1958. TCADA said that
to get a treatment license Teen Challenge must employ psychiatrists,
masters of social work, certified counselors and other professionals.
It must also embrace a &quot;medical&quot; model for treatment of drug abuse
which presumes that addiction is a disease.[5] But in contrast, Teen
Challenge views addiction as a sin symptomatic of a life out-of-touch
with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Under a &quot;religious&quot;
model, drug addiction is viewed as eminently curable through the
teachings of Christ.

</ul><p>

Robert L. Woodson, Sr., founder and president of the National
Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, says faith-based programs
aren't looking for government funds. They &quot;just [want] to
be left to do [their] Christian work...but...officials...insist
you've got to be certified by the state and comply with rules,
like having a 36-inch door rather than a 34-inch door....The government
officials cling to their regulations, and kids who might be rescued
are sleeping in crack houses or under...bridges.&quot;[6]

<p>

Faith-based programs may not work for everyone, but they are part
of a diverse range of programs fighting addiction. That's why
on May 2, 1996, Texas Governor George W. Bush set up a task force
to study how faith-based community service programs can further
help. The 17-member task force's goal &quot;is to identify ways
that Texas can create an environment where faith-based organizations
will flourish and meet the needs of people in crisis with focused
and effective aid,&quot;[7] said Bush. The task force includes Victory
Outreach's Freddie Garcia and J. Herbert Meppelink, the executive
director of Teen Challenge of South Texas.

<p>

Texas is blazing the trail for the entire nation showing how 
financially-strapped governments can encourage faith-based programs that 
have a long history of meeting critical needs. Unfortunately, the faith 
community and government regulators often disagree over the nature of 
the problem.

<p>

<center><h3>TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT</h3></center>

<p>

There are two major schools of thought about the root causes of
drug addiction. Some argue that it is a disease and should be
treated as such. Others say drug addicts are people whose lives
have gone wrong.

<p>

Many treatment specialists would agree that drug use leading to
addiction is a moral choice and that long-term abuse has physiological
implications. After all, smoking the first marijuana cigarette
or snorting the first line of cocaine is a choice, and there is
medical evidence that increased abuse can lead to addiction which
can have serious, disease-like consequences.

<p>

Hiring a prostitute is analogous to using illicit drugs because
both actions begin with a moral choice and both may cause serious
damage. The sex customer makes a moral decision by hiring a prostitute,
and as a result he may contract a sexually-transmitted disease
(STD) and contribute to crime and to the destruction of his family
and reputation.

<p>

The sex offender can be treated for his disease (the STD), but
unless something is done about his morally-based decision-making
mechanism, he may continue to engage in high-risk and morally
depraved behavior. He needs help to heal both his sexual disease
and his decision-making mechanism.

<p>

Drug addicts also need help with the adverse health consequences
of abuse and with making moral choices. But not everyone agrees
with the dual nature of addiction and its treatment.

<p>

At least one government agency adheres to the disease model. Since
its establishment in 1974, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) has been the lead federal agency for drug abuse research,
looking for causes and effects of drug abuse. It oversees 90 percent
of all funding for drug addiction research nationwide such as
medication research and the new and noninvasive positron emission
tomography (PET) technology which makes it possible to see where
illicit drugs affect the brain. NIDA says that drug addiction
is &quot;a complex disease that can be successfully addressed
by scientific research.&quot;[8]

<p>

There are many non-government treatment specialists who agree.
David E. Smith, a longtime treatment expert and founder of the
Haight Asbury Free Clinics in San Francisco, says that the medical
protocol of his clinics is &quot;the study and treatment of addictive
disease, characterized by the compulsive use of drugs, often with
major physical, psychological and behavioral consequences....Anybody
is liable for addiction, although some are more liable than others.
If your father is an alcoholic, then your son has a four times
higher probability of developing the disease.&quot;[9] This view
suggests that alcohol addiction is genetically predisposed, an
as yet unproven theory.

<p>

Gabriel G. Nahas, professor of anesthesiology at the College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, writes in <i>A
Manual on Drug Dependence</i> that drug dependence is &quot;[r]eversible
and transient at first...[but] after repetitive drug use&quot;
addiction becomes &quot;irreversible and lead[s] to brain pathology
[disease].&quot;[10]

<p>

One of the classic rationales for labeling addiction a disease
is that it encourages abusers to seek help because there is a
lessened sense of guilt. The fact, however, is that most people
in treatment are there because of a run-in with the law and not
because of a desire to go straight. Unfortunately, the disease
approach allows abusers to ignore or explain away their moral
accountability, and consequently addicts perceive themselves as
victims.

<p>

There is a vast but often unheralded faith-based treatment community
that disagrees with the disease model. They argue that addiction
is a reflection of underlying moral or spiritual problems. Teen
Challenge, the largest faith-based treatment network with 120
centers nationwide, argues that addictions are a &quot;manifestation
of larger problems brought about by sin and self-centered attempts
to find meaning and fulfillment in life....When one does not have
a personal relationship with Christ's person, [he] has profound
emptiness that is often filled with misguided and self-destructive
efforts to achieve happiness.&quot;[11] Faith-based treatment will
be discussed in detail later, but first consider a profile of
American drug treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT</h3></center>

<p>

Many in the medical profession have embraced the disease model,
and this has influenced the available treatment modalities. Psychiatrists
are the primary caregivers for addicts and their manual, the American
Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual (DSM-IV), defines
substance dependence (addiction) as a disease. The DSM describes
addiction by the following symptoms: (1) compulsion or loss of
control; (2) tolerance, withdrawal reactions and using the drug
to avoid or interrupt withdrawal reactions and (3) impairment and 
preoccupation with the drug to the exclusion of all pleasures and activities.[12]

<p>

Addiction disease is most often treated using one or more of the
following modalities: detoxification, pharmacological treatment,
therapeutic communities, chemical dependency treatment programs,
and outpatient, drug-free treatment like 12-step programs.

<p>

Detoxification is the process of withdrawal of the drug under
supervision. Unfortunately, most detoxified addicts soon return
to the drug if other support treatment is not provided.[13]

<p>

Methadone maintenance is the most popular pharmacological treatment
for heroin addiction. There are at least 110,000 Americans enrolled
in government-sanctioned methadone programs lasting perhaps 12
months or longer. Methadone maintenance substitutes one addiction
(heroin) for another (methadone) requiring doses once a day. It
prevents withdrawal symptoms and stabilizes the addict. Methadone
patients live more productive lives than heroin addicts.[14] A 1991
NIDA-sponsored study of six methadone programs found that 82 percent
of subjects who left treatment relapsed within a year.[15]

<p>

There are a number of alternatives to methadone such as Naltrexone
and Buprenorphine. NIDA recently developed and the Food and Drug
Administration approved a longer-acting variant of methadone,
levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM). It needs to be taken only once
every 72 hours. There are other drug regimes for alcohol addicts
(antabuse) and cocaine addicts (amantadine, bromocriptine and
fluphenthixol decanoate).[16]

<p>

There are more than 500 residential therapeutic community (TC)
programs accommodating up to 15,000 patients annually. These programs
are primarily publicly funded. Seventy-five percent of the patients
have arrest records and are unemployed. TCs provide a strict environment
with group therapy where former addicts are the counselors. Drug
abuse is considered a disease of the emotions, and the patient
needs to be resocialized. Patients remain in residence up to a
year.[17]

<p>

Chemical dependency treatment programs differ from TCs in the
kind of patients, the length of the program and the level of professional
control. The Betty Ford Center for Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation
is an example where management and housekeeping are in the hands
of paid professionals and workers. Patients pay (hundreds of dollars
per day) for the treatment, stay for about a month and receive
care directed by a medical and mental health team. These facilities
care for about 10,000 people annually.[18]

<p>

Finally, outpatient drug treatment is the most common modality.
It includes 12-step programs which are not physician run and rely
on personal faith. Many people who have gone through other programs
will participate in a 12-step group for long-term help. The process
involves admitting powerlessness, seeking help from God, praying
that God will remove shortcomings, making a moral inventory, seeking
forgiveness, making amends, and helping others. Drug abstinence
is the goal, and participants are expected to attend meetings
daily.

<p>

<center><h3>THE DRUG TREATMENT INDUSTRY</h3></center>

<p>

The drug treatment industry can't meet the demand. The 1996 National
Drug Control Strategy claims that there are 11,800 specialty drug
abuse and alcoholism treatment facilities (both public and private)
for 7.1 million Americans who need treatment. But in 1994, only
1.85 million of the most severely addicted actually received treatment.
Most (62 percent) addicted Americans are men and employed (51
percent) with incomes (55 percent) less than twice the poverty level. 
Their lives are marked by criminal behavior, they rely on welfare assistance,
they lack health insurance, and they tend to be young (many under
age 18).[19]

<p>

Much of the recent public sector treatment growth has been within
the judicially-controlled population. In 1993, an estimated 944,208
people under custody of correctional agencies were also clients
in a drug and or alcoholism treatment program.[20] Of that number,
17 percent (160,573) were in non-government-funded treatment programs.
Most of the government (87.2 percent) and private (94 percent)
clients were in outpatient treatment.[21]

<p>

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the most common &quot;treatment&quot;
modality. In 1995, there were 50,671 known AA groups and 1,150,447
national members.[22] These numbers do not include other 12-step programs
such as Narcotics Anonymous, Al-A-Teen and at least 629 Christian-based
programs.[23]

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG TREATMENT COSTS</h3></center>

<p>

Public-sponsored drug treatment is very expensive. The federal
government will spend $5 billion in 1997 treating mostly 
economically-strapped and criminal addicts.[24] A 1992 National Drug and 
Alcohol Treatment Utilization Survey found 945,000 clients involved in 
federally-funded drug abuse treatment. Most (87 percent) were treated as 
outpatients.[25]

<p>

Federal treatment dollars have grown substantially over the past
five years. From 1989 to 1994 federal drug treatment funds increased
119 percent (or $1.3 billion), but the number of persons treated
has declined while the treatment demands have risen.[26]

<p>

Federal funding of treatment programs generally lacks strict accountability.
In 1996, there were 13 federal agencies that allocated treatment
funds to the states using a variety of mechanisms.[27] A percentage
of those funds are siphoned off for administrative costs at each
government level beginning in Washington, D.C.

<p>

Consider the funds California received from the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) last year.
[SAMHSA is the source of 30 percent of federal funding for drug
abuse treatment and prevention.[28] ] The state took 5 percent for
administrative costs then negotiated with each of the 58 counties
which are responsible for providing treatment programs. But there
is no accountability mechanism. Perhaps that's why the state government
hired the University of California to study whether publicly-funded
treatment programs work. The report is due next year.[29]

<p>

<center><h3>DOES TREATMENT WORK?</h3></center>

<p>

Determining treatment success can be difficult. The National Drug
Control Strategy lists six treatment success measures: reduced
crime, reduced drug use, reduced domestic violence, reduced behavior
at risk for the AIDS virus, increased days of employment, and
positive change in social values and networks.[30] These indicators
are difficult to measure especially among unreliable addicts.

<p>

A common criticism of drug treatment programs and a good indication
of success is the high rate of addict recidivism. Repeat treatment
is very common and may be attributed to the addict not getting
the appropriate help in the first instance. &quot;There is no
single appropriate treatment for addiction,&quot; says Herbert
D. Kleber, the director of the Division of Substance Abuse, College
of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, &quot;any more
than there is for diabetes, hypertension or depression. These
populations are diverse. Some need medication, some need psychological
help, some need lifestyle change. It is critical to match the
individual with the appropriate treatment.&quot;[31]

<p>

Perhaps Dr. Kleber's warning explains why so many abusers drop
out of treatment. AA has found, for example, that 88 percent of
members drop out within a year, and only 20 to 30 percent remain
abstinent for five or more years.[32]

<p>

Mitchell Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House, one of the nation's
two largest residential drug-treatment organizations, says that
30 percent of residents drop out within the first six weeks and
about half make it through the first year.[33] Most therapeutic communities
like Phoenix House see only 10 percent of their patients complete
the program.[34]

<p>

Finishing Phoenix House's comprehensive 18- to 24-month program
is good insurance against relapse. Rosenthal claims that 90 percent
of his graduates are still working and law-abiding five to seven
years later and that 70 percent stay drug-free.[35]

<p>

Rosenthal sees drug abuse as a symptom of a deeper personal disturbance.
He explains, &quot;We have two years to teach industrial-strength
values to those most likely to resist them -- only two years to instill the 
social competence, self-respect, trust in other people, and optimism about 
the future that the addict's community and family did not.&quot;[36]

<p>

Large treatment outcome studies have found mixed &quot;successes.&quot;
The Drug Abuse Research Project Survey (DARPS), a 12-year follow-up
of heroin addicts admitted to methadone, residential, or outpatient
drug-free treatment began in 1969. It found that 83 percent of
the patients had been treated more than once by the end of the
survey and 74 percent had taken methadone at some time. The Treatment
Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS) followed 10,000 abuse patients
three and five years after treatment. Most (95 percent) of individuals
in residential treatment reported more than minimal drug use before
treatment and a substantial reduction after treatment. Additionally,
of those who reported illegal activity before treatment, 97 percent
reported no illegal activity during treatment and more than half
(57 percent) reported a decrease in depression after treatment.[37]

<p>

In 1994, there was a California study of 1,900 addicts in treatment.
The study found that it wasn't necessary to complete the treatment
to yield a savings. Each day of treatment yielded a financial
return to society. Specifically, it was estimated that for 150,000
treated addicts which cost $209 million, the state saved $1.5
billion in reduced social costs, primarily crime.[38]

<p>

The effectiveness of drug addiction treatment is inconclusive.
But we do know that the best results come from intensive, long-term
programs that involve multiple modalities that target the addict's
specific problems.[39]

<p>

<center><h3>NO TREATMENT OFTEN BEST</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that there is a high rate of recovery among addicts
even without treatment. Heroin addicts typically break the habit
in 11 years, and half of all alcoholics free themselves without
outside help.[40]

<p>

A study of self-treated alcoholics found that more than half (57
percent) said they simply decided that alcohol was bad for them
and nearly a third (29 percent) said health problems, frightening
experiences, accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.[41]

<p>

A study of heroin addiction among American soldiers who fought
in Vietnam is most revealing. Two to three years after returning
from Vietnam, despite extremely high rates of addiction, they
were no more likely to be addicts than comparable civilians.[42]

<p>

The Vietnam study found that many soldiers were described as heroin
addicts in order to fit the mold of a drug treatment program.
These people had so many other problems, originating before the
addiction, that the label &quot;addict&quot; is little more than
a convenience, and &quot;treatment of drug abuse&quot; is an inadequate
description of their needs.[43]

<p>

<center><h3>A CASE FOR FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS</h3></center>

<p>

There is room for faith-based programs to compete in the treatment
arena, especially given the poor showing by most publicly-funded
programs. After all, faith-based programs rely on the addict's
relationship with God as a primary treatment modus operandi, and
that appeals to many Americans.

<p>

The typical faith-based drug program is structured like the therapeutic
community approach. Both use former addicts as counselors, seek
to resocialize the addict and usually last for one year. The primary
difference is the faith-based program's philosophy. It claims
that a relationship with Jesus Christ provides meaning and direction
for life which is key to a healthy body, mind and spirit.

<p>

In 1996, a <i>USA Today</i> poll found that 56 percent of Americans
believe that faith helped them recover from an illness.[44] Herbert
Benson, author of <i>The Relaxation Response and Timeless Healing:
The Power and Biology of Belief</i>, supports the faith-healing
connection. &quot;To put it simply,&quot; Benson said, &quot;we're
wired for God...We're the only species that knows it's going to
die and has a belief in something beyond. We have a tremendous
healing capacity if we can tap into what I call the 'faith factor.'&quot;[45]

<p>

Dr. Dale Matthews, an associate professor of medicine at Georgetown
University, reviewed 212 medical studies examining faith and health.
He found three out of every four studies showed health benefits
for patients with &quot;religious commitments.&quot;[46]

<p>

Similar results are found in drug-related studies. In a review
of 20 published studies, 19 (95 percent) showed that religion
plays a positive role in preventing alcoholism. A strong religious
commitment was found to be a consistent characteristic of those
who have not used illicit drugs.[47]

<p>

A study in the <i>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse</i>
found that faith-based addiction treatment programs are superior
to non-faith-based programs. The study concluded that patients
who attended faith-based programs were much more likely
(45 percent to 5 percent) to report abstinence from opium-based
drugs like heroin for one year after the program. The study which
was funded by NIDA also found that faith-based graduates were
subsequently three times more likely to be married and far less
likely to be on either parole or probation.[48]

<p>

While the average American is influenced by religion, mental health
care professionals are far less likely to be so inclined. Three
of every four Americans agree with the statement, &quot;My whole
approach to life is based on my religion.&quot; Only 33 percent
of psychologists, 39 percent of psychiatrists, 46 percent of social
workers and 62 percent of marriage and family therapists agree.
Given these statistics, it is easy to understand the secular bias
of these health professionals who have great say over the type
of care given a patient and the type of programs approved by government
health care advisors.[49]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Most drug treatment doesn't work well and where it does work,
one size does not fit all. A diversity of treatment alternatives
to include low cost taxpayer-free and faith-based programs must
be available.

<p>

Pope John Paul II endorses the church's role in drug treatment.
He spoke to the Italian Federation of Therapeutic Communities
labeling drug abuse a symptom of &quot;a culture starved of genuine
values.&quot;[50] He said the church should have tremendous leverage
in addressing drug addiction.[51]

<p>

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich supports faith-based programs.
&quot;We need to get back to one-on-one missionary work,&quot;
said Gingrich.[52] &quot;We are in the business of changing and saving
people, not maintaining them in their decay. If you don't start
with a faith-based approach, then you haven't started anything...if
you're not improving your life every day, then you're decaying.&quot;[53]

<p>

There are practical reasons for supporting private or community
faith-based alternatives -- such as cost. Taxpayer-funded residential drug
treatment costs far more than many faith-based and taxpayer-free
programs. The 1994 California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment
found that taxpayer-funded residential drug treatment cost $61.47
per person per day and experienced high recidivism.[54] In comparison,
Victory Outreach costs about $25 per person per day and enjoys
very low recidivism.[55]

<p>

The dramatic differences between taxpayer-funded programs and
faith-based programs possibly explains why Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.)
told a Senate hearing on the issue of faith-based programs, &quot;I
believe there are people and groups in America with answers,&quot;
people who are &quot;winning the war on poverty and addiction,
one individual at a time.&quot;[56] He supports their active role.

<p>

Addicts need to be taken off drugs and resocialized. Some are
violent offenders who deserve jail, and others can once again
become productive citizens after help from a diversity of programs
including the Phoenix House, Victory Outreach, The Betty Ford
Clinic and Teen Challenge.

<p>

Government shouldn't try to fight the drug war alone. Rather,
it should focus on supply reduction and push prevention and treatment
efforts down to the community level where programs can be tailored
to local needs.

<p>

The local faith community will play a vital role in prevention
and treatment. After all, the church gives people faith and hope
that there are ultimate meaning and purpose of life. It gives
man answers to great questions of life. It establishes a system
of moral duties which have worked. It also gives direction to
public opinion and provides the basis for social order.

<h2>STORM CLOUDS OR A DRIZZLE?<br>
A LOOK AT A NEW STUDY ON<br>
CHILD CARE</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<p>

<i>Brenda Hunter, Ph.D.</i></center>

<p>

The National Institutes of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) recently released the initial
findings of a new child care study &quot;and fired the shot
heard round the world.&quot;  In this long-term study that plans
to track the effects of child care on children's development
through 7 years of age, the results of phase one rendered a body
blow to mothers choosing to provide full-time care for their babies.
Within days, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> headlines read &quot;Child
Care No Risk to Infant-Mother Ties,&quot; and <I>The Guardian</I>
reported, &quot;Child Care Report Backs Working Mums.&quot;
Meanwhile, mothers here and abroad tried to make sense of a study
that implied &quot;other care&quot; was as good as &quot;mother
care,&quot; at least in terms of a baby's attachment relationship
with his or her mother.

<p>

<center><h3>THE MEANING OF ATTACHMENT</h3></center>

<p>

Just what is meant by the term &quot;attachment?&quot;
In his l969 book <I>Attachment,</I> the late British psychiatrist
John Bowlby wrote about the centrality of the baby's attachment
to his mother which he believed was &quot;the foundation stone
of personality.&quot;[1] Bowlby added that a &quot;young child's
hunger for his mother's love and presence is as great as
his hunger for food&quot; and that &quot;her absence inevitably
generates a powerful sense of loss and anger.&quot;[2] Freud would
agree with Bowlby on the importance of the mother or mothering
figure in the child's early life.  Writing in <I>An Outline
of Psychoanalysis</I>, he described the relationship a child has
with his mother as &quot;unique, without parallel, established
unalterably for a whole lifetime as the first and strongest love
object and as the prototype of all later love relations -- for
both sexes.&quot;[3]

<p>

The formation of attachment -- or
the emotional bond between a mother and her baby -- is a critical
developmental milestone during the first year of life.  In fact,
psychologists Alan Sroufe and Everett Waters call this enduring
bond a &quot;psychological tether which binds infant and caregiver
together.&quot;[4] From his earliest attachments, first to mother,
then to father, a baby develops a sense of his own worthiness,
conscience, and the capacity for intimacy in later significant
relationships.[5] He also learns -- generally by 12 months of age
-- whether or not he can trust his mother to meet his
physical and emotional needs.  If his mother is sensitive, consistent
and responsive in meeting his myriad needs, he is likely to be
securely attached to her.  If she is unpredictable in her ministrations
or rejecting, then the  mother and her baby will tend to develop
an insecure emotional bond or attachment.

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD STUDY</h3></center>

<p>

Just what did the NICHD-supported
scientists discover about the effects of child care on a baby's
attachment to his mother?  The study, which has followed 1,300
families at l0 different sites since 1991, found that child care,
<I>in and of itself</I>, does not harm the baby's emotional
bond with his mother.[6] Indeed, the researchers state that the
type of child care, the quality of care, the number of hours per
week in care and even the age the baby enters care do not create
an insecure attachment.  With this ammunition, the media heralded
the current study as a challenge to, or even  repudiation of,
earlier infant day care research, as well as a blanket endorsement
of child care for employed mothers.  Upon examination, however,
the NICHD study does not quite deliver the broadside to on-site
mothering that the media contends.  In fact, it contains some
important caveats to the central finding that child care neither
helps nor hurts the baby's attachment relationship to his
mother.

<p>

For example, the NICHD researchers
found that if a baby was unlucky enough to have an &quot;insensitive
mother,&quot; then the child care variables mattered.  Thus,
the &quot;dual risk&quot; of an insensitive mother <I>plus</I> 
poor quality child care, <I>or</I> inconsistency of care,
<I>or</I> more than l0 hours per week in care increased the likelihood
that a baby would be insecurely attached to his mother. While
the study did not contain a profile of the insensitive mother
(whether she was divorced, employed, stressed, and lonely, or
married, at home, financially strapped, and depressed), it did
find, as one would expect, that a sensitive mother who was well-adjusted
psychologically was more likely to have a securely attached child
than her insensitive counterpart.

<p>

The NICHD study also found significant
gender differences in terms of the effects of child care on attachment
security.  Infant boys who spent <I>more than</I> 30 hours per
week in child care were at risk for insecure attachment while
girls who spent <I>less than</I> 10 hours per week in care were
&quot;somewhat&quot; more likely to be insecurely attached
to their mothers.  Psychologist Jay Belsky of Pennsylvania State
University, one of the study's researchers, explained these
particular findings this way:  &quot;Separation might prove
stressful for boys, but girls who are at home with mothers extensively
may become too close and enmeshed.&quot;[7] Belsky's interpretation
prompted <I>Washington Times</I> columnist Suzanne Fields to write,
&quot;In other words, mommies who spend a lot of time with their
infant daughters are dangerous to their daughters' mental
health.&quot;[8]

<p>

Additionally, the NICHD study found
that a mother's belief system affected her baby's
attachment security. Those mothers who believed that maternal
employment actually &quot;benefited&quot; their babies'
development placed their children in child care earlier and for
more hours than did those mothers who held &quot;weaker&quot;
beliefs.  Those mothers who felt child care was harmful to their
children but used it anyway tended to have more securely attached
children than their less anxious counterparts.

<p>

How to explain this apparent conundrum?
While some may wonder about the negative psychological implications
of being riven by guilt and anxiety, Belsky suggests, &quot;It
may be that some guilt and anxiety keeps you alert, vigilant and
able to monitor the quality of care.  Being cavalier about the
effects of work turns out to be risky.&quot;[9]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD FINDINGS AND THE ONGOING INFANT DAY CARE 
DEBATE</h3></center>

<p>

Why were the NICHD findings so provocative?
The findings, as <I>The Guardian</I> so aptly stated,
&quot;go to the heart of an enduringly bitter debate&quot;
about the effects of child care on a baby's emotional security
during that critical first year of life.[10] This debate affects
a huge number of American families and touches on an emotion-laden
issue:  How best to raise America's children.  Not only
do more than half the mothers of infants under one year of age
participate in the work force, but in this particular study more
than half of the infants were in some form of child care for more
than 30 hours per week by the end of their first year.[11] In addition,
the NICHD study flies in the face of accumulated evidence since
the early 1980s, which  found that placing a baby in substitute
care, even good quality care, for 20 or more hours per week during
that critical first year, not only increased the baby's
risk of insecure attachment to mother and/or father, but also
was often the harbinger of behavioral and emotional problems later
on.

<p>

<center><h3>EARLIER INFANT DAY CARE RESEARCH</h3></center>

<p>

For example, in l988 researchers
Jay Belsky and Michael Rovine evaluated the effects of child care
on 491 infants and found that those who experienced 20 or more
hours per week of nonmaternal care during the first year of life
were more likely to be classified as insecurely attached to their
mothers than those who spent less time in care.  In l989,
psychologist  Alison Clarke-Stewart found similar results in
her analysis of 1,247 infants.[12]

<p>

When researchers looked at the long-term
effects of infant day care, they often discovered that early entry
into day care signaled later behavioral and emotional problems.
Evidence from as early as the mid-1970s indicates that children
who began child care during their first year were more physically
and verbally aggressive with peers and adults, less cooperative,
and less able to handle frustrations than those who started care
thereafter.[13] For instance, a l985 study at the University of North
Carolina found that children who entered child care during their
first year were more likely to &quot;hit, kick and push other
children&quot; as kindergartners and first-graders than those
who began care later on.[14] In light of these and other findings,
it is not surprising that a full scale ideological war is in progress,
or that the current study produced such a rousing and widespread
media response.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS DID NOT REPORT</h3></center>

<p>

As a psychologist who has followed
the child care debate since the early 1980s, what struck me about
the current study were the findings that never made the newspapers,
namely these statistics:

<p><ul>

<li>About 42 percent of male infants were insecurely attached to 
their mothers when they worked more than 30 hours per week.  (This 
is a hefty number in light of proven male vulnerability to psychological 
and behavioral problems).

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their babies with insensitive 
caregivers, 56 percent of the babies were insecurely attached -- an 
obvious double-whammy for the babies.

<p>

<li>If insensitive mothers placed their babies in child care for more 
than 10 hours per week, between 46-48 percent were insecurely attached 
to their mothers.  (Evidence that simply placing a child in day care 
for more hours does not eradicate the need for time with mother, even 
when she's relatively insensitive.)

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their children in more than one 
child care situation, 44 percent were insecurely attached.  (This 
shows that inconsistent care coupled with an unresponsive mother is 
hazardous to attachment security.)

</ul><p>

These statistics gain significance
when we realize that in cross-cultural attachment research using
the Strange Situation-- the laboratory experiment developed by
psychologist Mary Ainsworth and her colleagues and used by researchers
in the NICHD study to determine attachment security -- about 35
percent of the infants are insecurely attached to their mothers.[15]
In most of the analyses in the current study, the rate of attachment
insecurity among the children is between 42 and 56 percent.  This
difference is not insignificant when translated into emotional
insecurity in children's lives.

<p>

<center><h3>MALE VULNERABILITY</h3></center>

<p>

The findings about infant male attachment
insecurity are particularly noteworthy since previous research
has found that males are generally more vulnerable than females
to a host of physiological and psychological ills.  Not only are
males more susceptible than females to speech, learning and behavioral
difficulties, but they are three to five times more likely to
have reading problems.[16] In the arena of emotional disorders, more
males than females suffer from night terrors, hyperactivity, and
autism.  Moreover, adolescent males have a higher incidence of
schizophrenia, delinquency, academic underachievement, and suicide
than females.  According to psychologist Dee Shepherd-Look, &quot;Until
adulthood, it is difficult to find a pathological condition in
which the incidence among females is higher than among males.&quot;[17]

<p>

What happens when mother returns
to the work force?  Researchers Belsky and Rovine found that,
in terms of attachment security, if a mother worked more than
35 hours per week during the baby's first year of life,
50 percent of the sons were more likely to be insecurely attached
to their fathers.[18] A 1987 study by P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale and
Margaret Owen found similar results.[19] Also, studies of elementary
school children have discovered that boys are more likely than
girls to suffer when mother works outside the home.[20] In light
of earlier and current research, it is reasonable to suggest that
mothers of sons think long and hard about working full-time during
their babies' vulnerable first year of life.

<p>

<center><h3>HIGH QUALITY CARE AND THE INSENSITIVE MOTHER</h3></center>

<p>

As for the insensitive mother and
her baby, the NICHD researchers found that high quality child
care did not entirely compensate for a mother's relative
unresponsiveness.  This was the opposite of what they expected
to find.  In other words, if a baby had an insensitive mother,
the researchers hypothesized that it would be better for that
baby to spend more time away from her in the care of a sensitive
caregiver.  But this did not, in fact, prove true.  Instead, if
the insensitive mother worked part-time rather than full-time,
then her baby was more likely to be securely attached to her (65
percent vs. 56 percent secure, respectively).  This finding supports
the idea that high quality day care does not compensate for mother
care, even when a mother is relatively insensitive.

<p>

It's important to pause at
this point and ask ourselves just how many mothers, some of whom
may be  practicing &quot;defensive careerism,&quot; are able
to be genuinely sensitive and responsive to their babies'
cries and bids for attention, particularly if these mothers are
harried or super-stressed by the multiple demands of their lives?
How is a mother to know for sure that she is creating a secure
emotional bond with her baby as she goes off to work for 10-12
hours per day?  Even this study found that working more than 10
hours per week (that's a mere  two hours per day) puts
the child of the insensitive mother at risk for insecure attachment.
Unless a woman is confident that she is a sensitive mother who
is creating a strong, secure emotional bond with her baby, it
may be wise to err on the side of quantity rather than quality
time during the baby's first year of life.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCERNS ABOUT THE DATA</h3></center>

<p>

A careful review of the NICHD study,
arouses some very real concerns.  First, 20 of the 25 researchers
are women.  Since all scientific study is, to some extent, contaminated
by bias, there is reason to wonder just how many of these researchers
relied on day care for their own children and may, therefore,
have a personal stake in the report's outcome.  In other words,
is the methodology or even the interpretation of the data, in
this instance, subject to serious bias?  When I posed this question
to psychologist Martha Cox of the University of North Carolina,
one of the study's researchers, she admitted, &quot;Most
of us have used early and extensive child care for our children.&quot;
She said that both of her children had been in child care since
they were two months of age.  But she was quick to add, &quot;If
we tried to get value-free researchers, we wouldn't have
anybody doing research.&quot;

<p>

That this issue is not a red herring
is evident in the article written by Dr. Jay Belsky for <I>Zero
to Three</I> in l986 that set off a firestorm among some
of the researchers involved in the NICHD study.  In this article
entitled &quot;Infant Day Care:  A Cause for Concern,&quot;
Belsky not only reviewed disturbing evidence on the effects of
early and extensive child care but admitted that scientists must
struggle to maintain an open mind when it comes to controversial
and emotion-laden issues. He stated, &quot;I am well aware, too,
that my <I>gender</I> and the more or less <I>traditional nature
of my family structure</I> (italics mine) could bias the reading
of the evidence.&quot;[21]

<p>

So how did the NICHD researchers
attempt to control for bias?  While Cox stated that the data were
coded in a central location (The University of Washington in Seattle)
and not by the individual researchers themselves, Belsky told
me in an interview that those who coded  the data knew this was
a study of child care.  &quot;If they erred, they erred on the
side of finding attachment security,&quot; he said.  Then he
added, &quot;If there's bias it could be the readiness
to embrace the finding that kids aren't affected by child
care -- to give the green light to child care.  If this were a
study of cocaine use and researchers found the same effects, who
would say cocaine use doesn't matter?&quot;

<p>

Additionally, the study examined
a mother's attitudes about the &quot;benefit&quot; of
maternal employment on her baby's development and found
that mothers torn by guilt and anxiety were more likely to have
securely attached babies.  Just what are we to surmise from this?
Does this finding imply that it is okay for mothers to be in
turmoil over their employment decisions as long as their babies
are emotionally secure?  As a therapist who works almost exclusively
with women, I would  suggest that it is hardly a positive for
mothers to have their hearts divided.  Over time, guilt and anxiety
tend to produce depression, and no child profits from having a
depressed mother.

<p>

I am also concerned that the NICHD
researchers examined a mother's attitudes when her baby
was one month old.  Mothers often dramatically change their attitudes
toward separation from their babies over the course of the first
six months after delivery.  In my own doctoral research on adult
attachment and attitudes toward employment conducted at Georgetown
University, I interviewed 89 new mothers two to three days after
they had delivered their firstborn infants and then again four
months later.[22] Not surprisingly, I found that over the course
of four months a number of the women had changed their attitudes
about leaving their babies to return to work.  It was not unusual
for them to say that they had fallen in love with their babies
and could not bear to leave them.

<p>

Finally, since much of the attachment
research using the Strange Situation has looked at a baby's
attachment relationship with his parents when he was 12 months
old, and then again at 18 months to track the stability of the
attachment classification, just why did the NICHD researchers
elect to study the babies at l5 months of age? If this &quot;largest,
longest, and most comprehensive study yet&quot; is to challenge
and even repudiate earlier findings, then why not examine the
mother-baby attachment relationship at the usual 12-month marker?
When asked about this, Dr. Cox said, &quot;We were using other
measures at 15 months and so using the Strange Situation then
was optimal for everything.&quot;  She added, &quot;There's
lots of stability (in attachment patterns) in the 12-18 month
range, though there's always a possibility that things
could change developmentally.&quot;  When asked if this difference
in the research design might have affected the study's
outcome, Belsky replied that the researchers had debated this
issue and reached a &quot;compromise solution.&quot;  Yet one
is left with a feeling of nagging doubt.  In the changing world
of infancy and the forging of emotional bonds, do these three
extra months make a significant difference?

<p>

<center><h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3></center>

<p>

Whatever questions the study raises,
in the final analysis, it affirms the importance of mothering.
The study shows that  a mother's sensitivity to her baby
is the most significant predictor of attachment security.  While
it is obviously better for a baby to have a sensitive, well-adjusted
mother, even the presence of an insensitive mother is important
for her baby's attachment security.  Moreover, high quality
care does not eradicate a baby's need for extensive time
with his mother even when  she is relatively unresponsive to his
cues and bids for attention.  In fact, for the insensitive mother
and her child, the NICHD  study affirms the value of part-time
over full-time employment.  Additionally, it  found  that a mother's
attitudes toward employment are crucial in terms of her baby's
attachment security.

<p>

But does this NICHD study categorically
endorse &quot;other care&quot; for babies as the media would
have us believe?  Does it relieve the employed mother's
guilt?  Are we to assume that placing babies in early and extensive
child care carries no significant risk?  As we ponder the findings
of the NICHD study, we need to remember that those researchers
have looked at only one aspect of child development -- attachment.
They have yet to examine children's development in terms
of aggression, social skills, health, capacity for empathy or
intellectual competence.  These qualities will be examined when
the children are 3 and 4 years old.  Since aggression is well
established by age 3 and has been one of the long-term effects
of early and extensive child care, the researchers may find that
the insecurely attached children in this  study are more likely
to be disobedient to adults and bully their peers.  Or they may
not.  Unfortunately, it will be several years before we learn
what these early and provocative findings mean.

<p>

As Belsky said when interviewed,
&quot;It's too early to tell. In my early observations,
lots of child care posed a risk factor. In this study, even more
than 10 hours of care was important. It's the most vulnerable
children who are the most adversely affected.&quot;  In terms
of policy implications, he added, &quot;To presume that the
data carry policy implications at this point is to make decisions
after reading the first chapter of a novel.&quot;  Then changing
his image, Belsky said, &quot;The study shows it's drizzling
now.  It could be a cloud cover or it could be the leading edge
of a storm. We just don't know.&quot;

<p>

As we await later results, we would
do well to look beyond the realm of social science research  to
the cultural landscape where we find other evidence -- disquieting
evidence -- that also merits our consideration.  The indicators
are that children in this country are not faring well.  Increasingly,
we read about acts of rage and violence committed by young children
-- children seemingly without a conscience.  For example, a 6-year-old
boy was recently arrested in Richmond, California, for the attempted
murder of a 6-month-old baby.  (Ironically, his mother works in
a child care agency.)  In Englewood, Colorado, a 10-year-old boy
is being held for fatally beating a 19-month-old girl he was babysitting.
In Lucerne Valley, California, two boys and girls, ages 11 and
12, were arrested for attempting to murder their teacher.[23] Whence
this anger and rage?  How can we begin to understand such violence
in the hearts of some of our nation's children except in
the context of their intimate parental attachments?

<p>

As we continue to make our daily
decisions about how best to rear our very young children and attempt
to understand the results of  scientific study, it may be that
we are doing so, not in a drizzle or even in a storm, but in the
all-too-quiet eye of a hurricane.

<title>THE EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>THE EMPLOYMENT<br>
NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT:<br>
AN UNWARRANTED EXPANSION<br>
OF FEDERAL POWER</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

Touted as a logical extension of Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act,
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (H.R. 1863, S. 972) is actually
a radical change in workplace discrimination law. Backers of ENDA
say, without any credible substantiation, that homosexuals need
heightened protection not afforded to other employees in the workplace.

<p>

But ENDA is being brought up now to complicate efforts to pass
the Defense of Marriage Act. ENDA is bad legislation because it:

<p><ul>

<li>Sets the stage for an enormous expansion of federal power
over employers. This violates the principle of federalism embodied
in the 10th Amendment.

<p>

<li>Guarantees an onslaught of costly litigation which could hurt
small businesses most of all.

<p>

<li>Paves the way for quotas based on sexual preference, regardless
of a provision that stipulates that no quotas are allowed. (Remember
Hubert Humphrey's promise in 1964 that the Civil Rights Act would
never lead to racial quotas?)

<p>

<li>Prohibits employers from disciplining or taking into account
in any way any sexual activity on or off the job by an employee.

<p>

<li>Defines &quot;sexual orientation&quot; so broadly that all
sexual proclivities, from pedophilia to bisexuality, are given
special protection and therefore moral status on a par with sex
within marriage.

<p>

<li>Suggests the federal government is officially supportive of
sexual promiscuity, since bisexuals by definition have sex with
more than one person.

<p>

<li>Creates a broad cultural force that rewards and protects sexual
dysfunction at the expense of traditional marriage and family.

<p>

<li>Poses a serious threat to employers' and employees' freedoms
of religion, speech and association. The law would ensure that
employers could no longer take their most deeply held beliefs
into account when making hiring, management and promotion decisions.
This would pose an unprecedented intrusion by the federal government
into people's lives.

</ul><p>

Homosexual activists claim that as many as 84 percent of the American
people support &quot;equal rights in terms of job opportunities.&quot;[1]
Well, yes. Most Americans believe that homosexuals should have
the same rights all employees have -- but no more than that.

<p>

It depends on how the question is asked. When the question is
asked whether homosexuals should have fewer rights, the same rights
or more rights, a majority says they should have the same rights.
A <I>Newsweek</I> poll in May 1996 asked, &quot;Has the U.S. done
enough to protect gay rights?&quot; Fully 66 percent answered
either &quot;done too much&quot; (40 percent) or &quot;done enough&quot;
(26 percent). Only 27 percent said &quot;more effort needed.&quot;
Polls also show that a majority of Americans believe that it would
be wrong specifically to enact new legislation in this area.[2]

<p>

Sometimes, the question is asked during debates, &quot;Do you
think someone should be fired just for being gay?&quot; Most people
would answer &quot;no.&quot; Few people want gays &quot;discovered&quot;
and fired, and most homosexuals can honestly report no real discrimination
against them. But the loaded question ignores crucial facts, such
as how the person's sexuality was made manifest and whether and
how it affected the workplace or even if children are involved
in any way.

<p>

The Boy Scouts have already suffered numerous legal attacks by
homosexual activists, and ENDA would only make their efforts easier.
There is no protection whatsoever in ENDA for professional Scout
employees. Homosexual activists contend that the Scouts would
be protected in their &quot;primary activities&quot; as a volunteer
group,[3] which is possible, but this could be swept aside by an
activist judge.

<p>

ENDA's sweeping protection based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
eliminates any legitimate questions as to appropriateness of sexual
behavior.

<p>

Here are some examples of how ENDA-like policies have already
been or could be abused:

<p><ul>

<li>In Seattle, a CPA referral specialist, Bryan Griggs, laid
off all of his small staff except his wife in 1994. One employee
later charged Mr. Griggs with discrimination and sexual harassment
under Seattle's gay rights law even though Mr. Griggs did not
even know the man was a homosexual. Before he cleared his name,
Griggs spent thousands of dollars defending himself. The homosexual
employee charged that Mr. Griggs had created a bigoted atmosphere
of hatred toward homosexuals because he aired in the office Christian
talk radio on a station on which he had run advertising and kept
a letter from Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) regarding the issue
of homosexuals in the military. The letter from Rep. Dunn was
included in a packet of letters from a variety of public officials,
including President Clinton. Another employee, who also happens
to be homosexual, submitted an affidavit stating that Mr. Griggs
at no time ever created a hostile atmosphere toward homosexuals
nor did he ever harass the other employee in any way. Even the
liberal <I>Seattle Times</I> editorialized that the complaint
represented an abuse of Mr. Griggs' rights as an employer. The
<I>Times</I> wrote: &quot;Now Griggs unfairly faces spending thousands
of dollars in legal fees to defend himself against a problem he
never knew existed. Already, some are calling this a landmark
test. Frivolous is a better name for it. It is a tortured reach
to redefine 'hostile work environment.' It is a scary assault
on the First Amendment.&quot;[4] Such incidents could become common
on a national scale under ENDA.

<p>

<li>In 1991, Shell Oil was fined $5.3 million for dismissing an
executive, Jeffrey Collins, who had used company equipment at
a Shell subsidiary firm, Triton Biosciences, to produce and copy
a flyer advertising a &quot;safe sex&quot; party for homosexual
men.[5] Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Taber ruled that the California
company violated a policy that it would judge employees only on
job performance and not on activities unrelated to work. The ruling
effectively means that California employers like Shell must turn
a blind eye to even the most outrageous outside &quot;activities&quot;
of employees, even when the employee uses company-owned equipment
to promote them. Taber cited a 1979 California Supreme Court ruling
that employees cannot be fired for off-the-job &quot;political&quot;
activities. Promoting &quot;safe sex,&quot; she reasoned, constitutes
a &quot;political&quot; activity. She also made it clear that
Collins' activities were protected not in spite of but because
of his sexual orientation. &quot;The evidence is overwhelming
that homosexual group sexual activity was beyond the pale of conduct
acceptable to the top management of Shell,&quot; she wrote.[6] Taber's
ruling explored, in her words, &quot;the relatively new issue
of how far a corporation may go in demanding that its managerial
staff, in their respective private lives, deport and conduct themselves
in a manner acceptable to and meeting the corporation's concept
of propriety.&quot;[7] By deciding against Shell, the judge ruled
that private companies cannot discourage employees from participating
in homosexual orgies or any other behavior broadly covered under
&quot;sexual orientation.&quot;

<p>

<li>In Loudoun County, Va., Jeffrey Bruton, a teacher/coach at
a public middle school and high school, was found to have appeared
in several hard-core homosexual porn films.[8] Loudoun School Superintendent
Edgar B. Hatrick III said that the teacher would be dismissed
if the allegations are true because, &quot;We believe that teachers
as people who are chosen to be instructors as well as leaders
of our young people, should be exemplary in their professional
as well as personal lives.&quot; He also said he would ask the
state to revoke Bruton's teaching license. Virginia state law
stipulates that a teaching license can be revoked for &quot;conduct
such as immorality, or personal condition detrimental to the health,
welfare, discipline, or morale of students.&quot; Before the school
acted, Bruton resigned and turned in his teacher's license. Under
ENDA, Bruton could have claimed that his &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
is nobody's business -- certainly not his employer's -- and that
school officials would be discriminating against him if they even
mentioned it.

<p>

<li>In 1993, a computer software company in California hired a
temporary employee, who turned out to have been a man dressed
as a woman. One of the women who worked at the company suspected
the &quot;woman&quot; was really a man, and she warned other women
that &quot;she&quot; might use the rest room. Many of the female
employees opted to go several blocks away to use the rest room
of a fast-food restaurant. When &quot;her&quot; temporary employment
was at an end, the &quot;woman&quot; applied for permanent status.
The employer, who still did not know the &quot;woman&quot; was
really a man, declined on the basis that &quot;she&quot; was overqualified
for the position and also had &quot;a chip on her shoulder.&quot;
The &quot;woman&quot; sued the company, claiming discrimination
based on &quot;sexual orientation.&quot; The employer settled
out of court in 1995, paying the &quot;woman&quot; $600,000, as
well as incurring $600,000 in legal bills. As a result of this
expensive legal attack, the company immediately laid off eight
employees and has not yet recovered, dropping from more than 50
to 30 employees.[9]

<p>

<li>An electrician at a large company in Michigan recently wrote
a letter to company management politely protesting a visit by
two homosexual clergymen who had presented materials claiming
that the Apostle Paul, The Old Testament's Jonathan and David,
and probably Jesus Christ were all homosexual and that the Bible
never really condemns homosexuality. The electrician's letter
rebutted the theories. A copy of the letter was taken from one
employee's personal mailbox and left in the mailbox of a woman
known for her lesbian activism within the company. She complained
that this constituted harassment because of her sexual orientation.
The man whose mailbox the letter had been in originally was downgraded
in tradesman's status, effectively costing him $3,000 to $5,000
per year in salary. Other employees who helped type the letter
were summoned before Human Resources and disciplined individually.
The man who wrote the letter has been told his job is now in jeopardy
and faces more hearings before the Human Resources Department.[10]

<p>

<li>In Hollywood, an orthodox Jew was working at his desk when
two homosexual colleagues stopped nearby. They discussed openly
and graphically a homosexual porn film that one of them had seen.
The Orthodox Jew, who says he has nothing against homosexuals
but does not approve of homosexuality, asked them politely not
to talk about pornography around him. The two men charged him
with sexual harassment. Apparently, any interference with their
enjoyment of a sexually-explicit, &quot;gay&quot; pornographic
film (even after the fact) constituted disapproval of their &quot;sexual
orientation.&quot;[11]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>

<p>

ENDA is so broad that any bizarre sexual behavior would be protected.
Under this legislation, if an employer heard that a highly visible
employee was openly flaunting his sexual tastes, having highly
noticeable adulterous affairs, or discussing his taste for pornography
with other employees, the employer would have no recourse. Even
asking about such activities might be construed as sexual harassment
based on sexual orientation. Since courts consistently have found
that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is meaningless without sexual
activity itself, any legislation based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
defends all sexual behavior and declares it to be irrelevant to
the employer and to customers.

<p>

What at first glance appears to be a harmless gesture of 
&quot;tolerance&quot; toward homosexuals in the workplace actually is 
a mighty weapon to be used against employers, other employees who 
believe that homosexuality is wrong, and against the freedoms of 
association, religion and speech. It would distort the concept of civil 
rights by creating an unprecedented behavioral component whose outer
limits cannot even be imagined.

<p>

<center><h3>KEY POINTS</h3></center>

<p><ul>

<li>ENDA has nothing to do with the Defense of Marriage Act and
should be judged on its own merits at a later date.

<p>

<li>Americans favor equal rights, not special rights, for gays
in the workplace. Homosexuals deserve the same rights as other
Americans -- no more, no less.

<p>

<li>Senators Kennedy, Jeffords and Lieberman dismiss opposition
to ENDA as mere &quot;prejudice.&quot;[12] If they prevail and ENDA
becomes law, then the biblically-held views of millions of Americans
will be actively suppressed by their own government in the name
of &quot;tolerance.&quot;

<p>

<li>ENDA ought to be called the Government Lawyers Expansion Act,
since it would result in so many opportunities for the use of
lawsuits to expand federal power.

<p>

<li>Legitimate minorities will see their own efforts to ensure
equal treatment undermined by this unwarranted expansion of claims
by a group that in no way shares their history.

<p>

<li>As a group, homosexuals enjoy enormous economic and political
power, and are not disadvantaged the way true minorities have
been.[13] Civil rights laws were enacted to
offset discrimination against African-Americans, but homosexuals
can claim no such victim status as an oppressed, poor minority.
They are trying to hijack a movement for their own advantage.

<h2>HOMOSEXUAL GROUP AIMS<br>
TO SILENCE OPPONENTS</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Under the guise of &quot;condemning hate speech,&quot; a homosexual
activist group, Parents, Friends &amp; Families of Lesbians And
Gays (PFLAG) has launched a TV and newspaper advertising campaign
designed to smear and silence opponents of the homosexual agenda.

<p>

Back when it was formed in 1981, the Washington, D.C.-based PFLAG
was a small, obscure group of parental activists. In recent years,
it has become a major player to promote homosexuality as normal
and healthy. PFLAG's mission statement focuses on three areas:

<p><ul>

<li>Support - chapter groups meet in various cities to offer support
and plan strategies;

<p>

<li>Advocacy - testifying and lobbying on both state and federal
levels in favor of homosexual-friendly legislation;

<p>

<li>Education - through the publishing of various &quot;fact&quot;
sheets, audio workshops, conferences and seminars.

</ul><p>

PFLAG's goal in educating society is to &quot;dispel myths, report
on scientific research, [and] explain religious teachings.&quot;[1]
However, the group has disseminated much inaccurate and misleading
information concerning homosexuality. For example, in its brochure
<I>Why Is My Child Gay?</I>, the reader is told that &quot;about
10 percent of the population is gay.&quot; This inflated figure
is based on the discredited works of Alfred Kinsey, author of
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>. The brochure also leads
the reader to believe that scientists have found evidence that
homosexuality is a biological predisposition, but no credible
evidence exists for this assertion.[2]

<p>

PFLAG has amassed considerable financial backing to launch its
latest campaign against opponents of the homosexual agenda. The
$1 million effort follows one of the many blueprints for propaganda
warfare set forth in the book <I>After the Ball: How America Will
Conquer Its Fear of Gays in the 90's</I>.[3]

<p>

PFLAG has chosen a tactic called &quot;Bracketing,&quot; which
is best described by <I>After the Ball</I> authors Marshall Kirk
and Hunter Madsen:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The best way to make homohatred look bad is to vilify those
who victimize gays. The public should be shown images of ranting 
homohaters whose associated traits and attitudes appall and anger 
Middle America. . . .In TV and print, images of victimizers
can be combined with those of their gay victims by a method propagandists
call 'bracket technique.' For example, for several seconds an unctuous
beady-eyed Southern preacher is shown pounding the pulpit in rage against
'those perverted, abominable creatures.' While his tirade continues over 
the soundtrack, the picture switches to heart-rending photos of badly 
beaten persons, or of gays who look decent, harmless, and likable; and 
then we cut back to the poisonous face of the preacher. The contrast 
speaks for itself. The viewer will ordinarily recoil from these images 
of victimizers, thinking automatically: 'I don't like those maniacs,
don't want to be like them, and would be ashamed if others thought I was 
like them. Surely I'm more compassionate and sophisticated, because I 
don't share their irrational hatred of gays.' Every time a viewer runs 
through this comparative self-appraisal, he reinforces a self-definition 
that consciously rejects homohatred and validates sympathy for gay 
victims. Exactly what we want.&quot;</i>[4]

</blockquote><p>

And apparently that is exactly what PFLAG wants, because they've
followed Kirk and Madsen's game plan almost to the letter.

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;One of the two 30-second [TV] spots dramatizes gay-bashing,
where a young man is chased by a group and then beaten; the other depicts 
a young woman holding a gun as she considers suicide. Visuals then cut 
to TV comments from the Rev. [Pat] Robertson, the Rev. Jerry Falwell 
and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).&quot;</i>[5]

</blockquote><p>

The PFLAG campaign, Project Open Mind, is expected to run for
the next two to five years. It is currently being marketed in
Houston, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and Tulsa, Oklahoma. New stations
are being sought in five Midwest and Pacific Northwest markets.
The PFLAG effort coincides with a major effort to press the homosexual
agenda on several fronts:

<p><ul>

<li>Homosexuals in the military - the effort to force the inclusion
of open homosexuals in all branches of the U.S. military;

<p>

<li>Homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; - the campaign to accord marital
status to same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Homosexual adoption - the drive to sanction custody and adoption
of children by same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Civil rights for homosexuals - the wide-ranging campaign to
bully the U.S. legal system into granting special rights and privileges
to homosexuals on the grounds that homosexuals qualify for 
&quot;minority&quot; status.

</ul><p>

Coming under increasingly shrill attack from PFLAG and other homosexual
activist groups are orthodox Christianity and &quot;organized
religion.&quot; On this battleground, however, the homosexual
community seems fragmented over the best way to attack. One segment
of activists believes the best course of action is blatant, 
&quot;in-your-face&quot; defiance. This consists of staged, eye-catching 
media events like gay pride parades. During the June 25, 1995 New York 
City parade, activists, some in nun's habits and others in various 
stages of undress, once again marched past St. Patrick's Cathedral 
carrying signs with such slogans as &quot;Hatred is not sacred.&quot;

<p>

The belief of another faction is that this kind of activism has
damaged the homosexual cause politically and intellectually. During
the visit of Pope John Paul II to New York City, six men unfurled
a banner from a sixth-floor window in Saks Fifth Avenue facing
St. Patrick's Cathedral. The banner, which read &quot;Condoms
Save Lives,&quot; was removed and the men were arrested. Citing
this botched effort, lesbian writer Camille Paglia calls for homosexual
activists to turn from attacks on the church and concentrate more
on intellectual discourse. Yet the author, near the end of her
argument for a more intellectual approach, still can't resist
the urge to take pot-shots at religion:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Mottos I would have liked to see fly on violet satin over
St. Patrick's: Penis Power; Long Live Gay Love; Paradise Now; Sympathy 
for the Devil; Flesh and Fantasy; There Is No God; Eat of My Body; Sex 
Is Sacred; Art, Pleasure, Sex; Dionysus Lives; Bring Back Babylon; 
Pagans Unite; Disobey Authority; Free Your Mind.&quot;</i>[6]

</blockquote><p>

Another group has chosen to carry out its attacks by infiltrating
church hierarchy. Episcopal Bishop John Spong appeared as keynote
speaker at a November 10, 1995 symposium hosted by PFLAG and held
at Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C. (currently
attended by Bill and Hillary Clinton and, until early 1995, by
Bob and Elizabeth Dole). According to an eyewitness account by
Mark Tooley of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, Bishop
Spong's address ridiculed the Christmas story, praised homosexual
&quot;marriage,&quot; declared the Ten Commandments &quot;immoral,&quot;
and referred to the Apostle Paul as a &quot;self-hating, gay man.&quot;

<p>

Increasingly, opponents of the homosexual cause are being labeled
as &quot;bigots&quot; and &quot;haters&quot; by mainstream journalists.
For example, the <I>Washington Post</I>'s Richard Cohen recently
queried, &quot;Where is the Republican who will look certain conservative
Christians in the eye and call them the bigots they are? Where
are the Christian clergymen, like those of the civil rights era,
who will condemn ignorance and bigotry, and exalt tolerance and
understanding? Who in the GOP field will assert that homophobia
is not a family value?&quot;[7]

<p>

Even while homosexuals continue their media assault, few major
political figures dare to evince any criticism of the gay agenda.
Part of this is due to a wholesale media blitz. As syndicated
columnist Cal Thomas has remarked, &quot;Evidence of this compromise
is everywhere, from the open recruitment of 'gay journalists'
to a convention of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association
meeting in Washington last month. A copy of the program shows
that not only were representatives of major press organizations
in attendance as participants, they also contributed substantially
to the cost of the event.&quot;[8] These companies included ABC,
NBC, CBS, <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>USA Today</I> and the
Associated Press, which recruited homosexuals and openly sided
with the partisan homosexual agenda.

<p>

Homosexual activists have cultivated a relationship with the press
to such a degree that its ability to report fairly and objectively
on the issues has been seriously impaired. At one PFLAG meeting
in Maryland on Nov. 21, 1993, according to an eyewitness account
by Peter LaBarbera, homosexual researcher Dean Hamer told the
audience that he was pleased with media coverage. Hamer, a geneticist
with the National Cancer Institute who is under investigation
for fraud in connection with the first of two gay gene studies
he authored, said, &quot;If you tell the press what to write about
a scientific study, they'll write it.&quot;[9] He added that he told
reporters that his study's findings show that sexual orientation
is like being &quot;left-handed,&quot; and that they obliged him:
&quot;That's what I told them to say, and they said it.&quot;[10]

<p>

Liberal politicians are increasingly looking to groups like PFLAG
for support in their efforts to restructure and realign both government
and society. &quot;PFLAG is writing the final chapter in the
nation's 200-year-old struggle for civil rights. I don't know
if you realize how important you are,&quot; says Rep. Gerry Studds
(D-Mass.).[11]

<p>

PFLAG's campaign is by no means an arbitrary attack. It's just
one small piece of a much larger battle plan. The goal is to silence
all opponents of the homosexual agenda, and harness government
and corporate power to enforce it.

<h3>America Eyes the Virginia Elections</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>Joel Himelfarb</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>
	This November, voters in Virginia, New Jersey, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Kentucky will have the opportunity to tell their elected representatives whether they are happy with the new conservative direction in American politics. This represents the first chance since the conservative GOP landslide of 1994 for large numbers of voters to go the polls, so the state races of 1995 will provide the first electoral indication of whether America is entering a period of fundamental political realignment.<p>	One of the most significant bellwethers will be elections for the General Assembly in Virginia. All 100 seats of the House of Delegates and all 40 seats of the Senate are up for balloting, and the ideological differences between the two parties are as clearly defined as in the national congressional elections of 1994. Republican Governor George Allen, elected in 1993, has pushed a wide-ranging agenda to put a more conservative stamp on Virginia government. Splitting mostly along partisan lines, the Democratic-controlled General Assembly has rejected most of his proposals, including tax and spending cuts, school choice, and prison-construction measures. <p>	Allen (who is limited by state law to a single four-year term) says that this year's General Assembly "will go down in history as one of the least productive ever. We sadly saw the Democratic defenders of 'business-as-usual' status quo mount unprecedented party-line defenses against those of us championing positive and constructive change." <p>	Republicans haven't controlled either house of the Virginia General Assembly in modern times. But recent national and state political trends have given the Democratic leadership in the legislature ample reason to worry. When Douglas Wilder was elected governor in 1989, the Democrats enjoyed majorities of nearly 2:1 in the House, and 3:1 in the Senate. This year, they may lose control of both houses of the General Assembly. In the House, their majority has fallen to 52-47 (with one independent) and their margin in the Sen
ate is just 22-18. Republican success in November could usher in reform on some of the most important issues facing the state and the nation: crime, taxes and spending, education, welfare reform, and the relationship between Virginia and the federal government.<p><b>Crime</b><p>
	From 1988 to 1993, the state's violent-crime rate rose nearly 30 percent, even though the most crime-prone age bracket (15-24) had declined. Felons were, on average, serving just one-third of their sentences. The average individual convicted of first-degree murder, for example, received a term of 35 years but spent just 10 years in jail.<p>	Democrats in the legislature endorsed Allen initiatives to abolish parole and increase prison time by 125 percent for first-time murderers and rapists, to consider violent offenses committed as juveniles when sentencing adult offenders, and to enact truth-in-sentencing legislation. This year, however, the General Assembly voted, mostly along party lines, to provide just one-quarter of the $400 million requested by Allen for new prison construction. <p>	    By refusing to appropriate sufficient money, Allen says, his political opponents are putting public safety at risk. "Liberals in the General Assembly," he adds, "are shortchanging prison construction, making it more likely that dangerous criminals will be released early -- and back in our neighborhoods." Allen warns that "increasing prison terms, without increasing prison capacity, is precisely the mistake that too many other states have made."<p><b>Taxes and Spending</b> <p>
	In December 1994, Allen drew fire when he proposed a relatively modest package of tax and spending cuts. Democrats attacked the governor's proposal as a tax "shift" in favor of the rich. They urged taxpayers to send $33 checks to Allen (the average amount a family's taxes would be lowered in the first year, under Allen's proposal) in an attempt to illustrate that Virginians didn't really need lower taxes. What the Democrats did not say, however, was that, by the fifth year, the average family of four, with a $30,000 income, would have saved nearly $1,000 in state taxes under Allen's proposal. Accurate or not, the Democrats' public relations campaign was successful, and the tax cut was killed. <p>	Though Allen's budget proposal cut only $170 million (out of a two-year, $15-billion general-fund budget), the Democrats tried to portray Allen's proposed budget cuts as unreasonable. For example, when Allen proposed eliminating duplicative state agricultural extension programs and high-salaried staff positions, he was erroneously accused of wanting to do away with popular 4-H agricultural programs. Similarly, when Allen targeted "family planning" programs (which were included in, of all places, the agriculture budget), he was attacked for wanting to slash farm spending. The Democrats pushed their own budget through the General Assembly on a party-line vote, restoring $166 million of Allen's spending cuts. <p>		<b>Education Reform</b><p>	During the recent session of the General Assembly, Allen proposed a new program of charter schools -- public schools controlled by teachers, universities, or other groups independent of school boards. Several bills were introduced in the General Assembly, but were killed after Democrats objected. Democratic Senator R. Edward Houck said the concept was aimed at "escaping" regulations. Houck, who is the supervisor of special and vocational education in Fredericksburg schools, denounced charter schools as a "half-baked . . . quick fix" designed to avoid what he said were the real pro
blems confronting public education -- too little money and too little parental responsibility. <p>	Allen came under heavy fire from the Democrats for his opposition to accepting $1.7 million in federal funds to implement the Clinton administration's controversial Goals 2000 program. This year, the Virginia House and Senate voted, mostly along party lines, to approve nonbinding resolutions in favor of federal funding for Goals 2000. When Republican Senator Mark Earley and others raised questions about the vague language of the federal regulations that would come attached to the money, their concerns were dismissed by the Democrats and the Virginia Education Association (VEA), a teachers union that supports Goals 2000 strongly. Allen -- expressing his concern about the need to retain local control over education in Virginia -- announced that the state would not apply for the Goals 2000 money. <p>	Other Allen proposals killed in the General Assembly included mandatory criminal background checks for new school personnel and protection of teachers from frivolous lawsuits for good-faith efforts to discipline students.<p>	The state's sex-education program, known as Family Life Education (FLE), sparked a bitter political battle. The Allen administration supported a bill that would have made FLE an "opt in" program, in which parents wanting their children to participate had to sign up. At present, the burden is on parents who do not want their children in the program to withdraw them. Because of the bureaucratic nature of the "opt out" process, some parents, who thought their children were not participating in FLE, were surprised to find their youngsters were still taking the course. The bill also would also have made FLE voluntary. Democratic opposition killed the legislation in both the House and the Senate.<p>	Allen won a partial victory on another issue: The State Board of Education voted in June to approve a compromise version of more rigorous academic standards in English, math, science, and social studies. Th
e standards were developed by the Governor's Champion Schools Commission in conjunction with parents and teachers. An earlier Allen proposal was bitterly attacked by Democratic legislators, the VEA and other teachers' groups, and a number of PTAs, who claimed the standards were "too demanding." Among other things, they required fourth-graders to be able to summarize the purpose of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution, fifth-graders to trace the historical background of major world religions, eighth-graders to identify members of the Virginia and U.S. Supreme Courts, and 12th-graders to analyze issues involving state, local and federal governments.  <p><b>Welfare</b><p>	At the beginning of this year's session, both the Democrats and the Allen administration introduced their own versions of welfare reform. Led by Senator Joseph Gartlan of Fairfax (the dean of senate liberals), the Democrats sought to cast Allen and his secretary of health and human resources, Kay James, as callously targeting the poor.<p> 	Both the House and the Senate approved weaker Democratic welfare legislation earlier this year on party-line votes. Rather than sign it, however, the governor made major changes in the bill, reflecting the details of his original proposal, and returned the measure to the General Assembly. In the end, the Democrats blinked, making just a few technical amendments to Allen's bill. The final version passed the General Assembly by overwhelming margins -- 90-9 in the House and 33-6 in the Senate -- and was signed into law by Allen. <p> 	Most provisions took effect statewide in July 1995. The plan includes a "family cap" -- denying cash benefits to children born to parents already on welfare -- and contains new rules requiring unwed teenage mothers to live with a parent or adult guardian. Welfare recipients' children will be required to attend school, and mothers on AFDC must assist the state in locating absent fathers.<p>	Tough new work requirements are at the heart of the program. The legislat
ion (which is being phased in over the next four years) requires able-bodied adult recipients to take private-sector or community service jobs within 90 days. It places a two-year limit on benefits for most recipients. To ease the transition from welfare to work, the state will provide medical services, child care, and transportation for those who find jobs.<p>	The welfare reform already seems to be having one of its intended effects: Reducing the number of able-bodied people on welfare. From 1988 to 1993, Virginia's welfare rolls increased by almost a third. By contrast, from May to July of this year, Virginia's AFDC caseload fell from 74,000 to 69,000 families. <p>	"There is a general cultural shift," says Kay James. "People were beginning to understand that change was coming, and they began to change their behavior as a result." James says recipients have been coming into local welfare offices "where the work requirements have not even been phased in, and saying: 'Look, it isn't worth it. I might as well get a job I like, instead of one you say I have to go to.'" She adds that, in meetings with Allen, local welfare administrators have frequently expressed disappointment that their areas were not among the first round of localities chosen by the administration to implement the new requirements.<p>	Despite the bipartisan votes for final passage, James believes the earlier debate over welfare in the General Assembly illustrates differences between the two parties. "In Virginia, you will hear that 'the Democrats wanted AFDC recipients to work,'" she says. "But what do you mean by 'work'? For the Democrats, that meant being involved in job trainingit didn't mean real work." In the General Assembly, she says, the Democrats pushed for "hardship exceptions" to the work requirement that were so broad that the great majority of the adult AFDC population would have been exempted. <p>	In the end, James argues, the Democrats concluded that "we were likely to prevail, and they wanted to be on that train when it left 
the station."<p><b>Federal Mandates</b><p>	Another difference between the parties involves the Allen administration's repeated clashes with the Clinton administration over federal mandates. In one case, the EPA threatened to strip Virginia of its authority to grant air pollution permits to incinerators, factories, and power plants. The agency claimed the state was in violation of federal law, because it restricted the right of private environmentalist groups to file lawsuits unless they could prove a state permit would cause them a major financial loss. <p>	Virginia later sued the EPA after the agency threatened to withhold federal highway funds. This time, the EPA refused to approve Virginia's vehicle-emissions testing plan, because the state wanted to permit gas stations to inspect and repair vehicles (Washington insisted that inspections and repairs be done at separate facilities.) <p>	Virginians are no longer willing to be "jerked around like serfs," Allen said in announcing the suit, which contends that the EPA's actions violate the 10th Amendment. This year, Allen vetoed a measure, passed by the legislature, which would have implemented the federal "motor-voter" legislation. Virginia Attorney General James Gilmore filed suit, charging the bill was an unconstitutional, unfunded federal mandate. The Justice Department and the Virginia ACLU countersued, and the case is pending.<p>	The U.S. Department of Education has ruled that Virginia public schools cannot expel or suspend disabled students for any reason without guaranteeing alternative schooling. Virginia officials say that special education students who sell drugs, carry weapons, or fight on campus should be disciplined in the same way as other students -- which may include unconditional expulsion. The education department claims this violates the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and has threatened to withhold $58 million in federal funds unless Virginia agrees to change its disciplinary procedures. <p>	Secretary James fought 
a difficult battle with Donna Shalala, Clinton's health and human services secretary, before winning a federal waiver allowing Virginia's welfare reform program to take effect. Shalala had initially demanded that Virginia directly provide child care and transportation to welfare recipients making the transition to work. Virginia fought successfully to retain the option of having the services provided by churches and other private groups. <p><b>The Moderate Republican Factor</b><p>	Even if Republicans win enough seats to form a majority, it won't necessarily mean smooth sailing for Allen's legislative proposals. Just as in the U.S. Senate, GOP moderates will tend to put up obstacles to conservative proposals. <p>	Since Allen took office last year, Republican lawmakers from Northern Virginia have, on occasion, joined with the Democrats to thwart key administration initiatives. For example, Senator Jane Woods teamed with the Democrats in working to defeat Allen's proposal to reform the FLE program. When Allen's Champion Schools Committee proposed toughened academic standards for social studies, the first draft was blasted as "an unmitigated disaster" by another Republican lawmaker, Delegate James Dillard.<p>	Delegate Vincent Callahan, one of the most senior House Republicans, joined with developer John "Til" Hazel, scores of other prominent businessmen, and Gartlan in a "bipartisan" plan to increase spending on roads, technology, and public education by hundreds of millions of dollars. The group (many of its members are Republicans) wants to pay for the new spending through a combination of new tolls, bonds, and new gas or sales taxes. It has been circulating the proposal to legislative incumbents and challengers in Northern Virginia. The plan is viewed as a slap at Allen, who has refused to consider increasing taxes.<p>	In general, Virginia voters have rarely faced as clear-cut an ideological choice between parties as they do this year. Governor Allen may have lost most of his legislative battles to date. B
ut by defining boldly what he and his party stand for, he has sharpened the issues of the election and given the citizens of the Old Dominion a set of clear choices for the direction of the state.<p>	The consequences will go beyond Virginia. If the GOP does not take a majority in at least one house of the Virginia General Assembly, then it could be premature to say America is entering a period of conservative governance. And if the Democrats lose big, their party will know that the elections of 1994 were not a fluke, and that liberal dominance of American politics may be over. <p><b>JOEL HIMELFARB</B>, <i>a Washington writer, formerly covered Virginia's legislature for the</<a href="/wash_times">i> <b>Washington Times</b> <i>editorial page</i>.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>



	Although slavery ended in the United States more than a century ago, its legacy continues to be disputed among scholars and to underlie contemporary debates about public policy. The reason for this is that slavery is considered the classic expression of American racism, and its effects are still viewed as central to the problems faced by blacks in the United States. Slavery seems to be the wound that never healedthe moral core of the oppression story so fundamental to black identity today. No wonder that bitterness generated by recollections of slavery has turned a generation of black scholars and activists against the nation's Founding -- against identification with America itself.
<p>	"Jefferson didn't mean it when he wrote that all men are created equal," writes historian John Hope Franklin. "We've never meant it. The truth is that we're a bigoted people and always have been. We think every other country is trying to copy us now, and if they are, God help the world." He argues that, by betraying the ideals of freedom, "the Founding Fathers set the stage for every succeeding generation of Americans to apologize, compromise, and temporize on those principles."
<p>	In <i>Black Odyssey</i>, Nathan Huggins condemns the American Framers for establishing, not freedom, but "a model totalitarian society." Huggins condemns the Framers for refusing to mention the words "slave" or "slavery" in the Constitution in an effort to "sanitize their new creation" and avoid "the deforming mirror of truth." The Founding, he concludes, was simply "a bad way to start."
<p>	Speaking on the 200th anniversary of the Constitution, former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall refused to "find the wisdom, foresight, and sense of justice exhibited by the Framers particularly profound. The government they devised was defective from the start." Marshall urged that instead of jingoistic celebration, Americans should seek an "understanding of the Constitution's defects," its immoral project to "trade moral principles for self-interest."
<p>	Is it true that the American Founding was corrupted by a base and unwarranted compromise with slavery, and that the Framers of the Constitution, many of whom were slaveowners, revealed themselves as racist hypocrites? Must we agree with the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who charged that the American Founding was a "covenant with death," an "agreement with hell," and a "refuge of lies," an appraisal endorsed by the great black leader Frederick Douglass? If these charges are true, then America is indeed ill-founded, blacks are right to think of themselves as alienated "Africans in America," and the hope for racial amity constructed upon the liberal democratic vision of the Founding becomes a chimera.
<p>  On the other hand, if the Framers are exonerated of the charges of racist hypocrisy, then their blueprint for America might provide a viable foundation for helping blacks and whites to transcend the pathology of race. Indeed, it is the vision of Thomas Jefferson and the Framers that provides the only secure basis for a multiracial society, in which citizens are united not by blood or lineage, but by virtue of their equality.
 <p>
<b>Of Human Bondage
</b><p>	Notwithstanding the vilification of American history by many commentators, the institution of slavery was neither peculiarly American nor peculiarly white. Not only was slavery extensively practiced in the ancient world -- Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and elsewhere -- but in the modern era Africans and American Indians practiced slavery, Arabs actively promoted the slave trade, and thousands of blacks in America were slaveowners.<p>
	The practice of whites owning slaves developed in the United States in line with universal practices, including prevailing Western institutions that held millions of whites in various degrees of unfreedom. In this context, it is not hard to understand Charles Pinckney's amazement, during the debates over the American Founding, over questions about the morality of slavery. "If slavery be wrong," Pinckney erupted, "it is justified by the example of all the world."	In most parts of the world, slavery was uncontroversial for the simple reason that the concept of freedom simply did not exist. Writes African-American scholar Orlando Patterson, "There was no word for 'freedom' in most non-Western languages before contact with Western peoples."<p>
	Prior to the development of a modern Western notion of freedom, most people lived in a world shaped by what historian David Brion Davis terms "the normal network of kinship ties of dependency, protection, obligation, and privilege," a system that included various forms of patronage and servitude.
<p>	Nathan Huggins writes that slavery evolved in a social system radically different from our own, one that "regarded servants and laborers as base people," that used "hunger and the lash as a goad to productivity," that maintained discipline by means of "maiming, dismemberment . . . torture, the rack, beheading, burning at the stake, impaling." Between white laborers and black slaves, Huggins writes, "the differences were more in degree than in kind." 
<p>	Historian Oscar Handlin notes that in Europe, as in much of the world, the antithesis of the term "free" was not "slave" but "unfree," and the vast majority of people lived in servitude or partial freedom. Involuntary bondage was common. "A debtor could be sold" to pay off his debts, he writes, vagrants and vagabonds "might be bound over to the highest bidder, their labor sold for a term," and criminal offenses were routinely punished with sentences of forced public service, "sometimes for life."
<p>	Many whites became indentured servants in America; they bound themselves to a planter or company for four to seven years in return for free passage across the Atlantic and some starting-up provisions. Like English servants, bondsmen in America were frequently bought and sold, or used as gambling stakes. "Under such circumstances," writes Gordon Wood in <i>The Radicalism of the American Revolution</i>, "it was often difficult for the colonists to perceive the distinctive peculiarity of black slavery." 
<p>	Until the 18th century, few Europeans had moral qualms about slavery, which contradicted no important social value for most people around the world. In the Arab world, which was the first to import large numbers of slaves from Africa, the slave traffic was truly cosmopolitan. Slaves of every hue and origin were sold in open bazaars. The Arabs played an important role as middlemen in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and contemporary research suggests that between the 7th and the 19th centuries they transported more than l4 million black slaves across the Sahara and the Red Seaa larger number than were shipped to the Americas.
<p>	Native American Indians practiced slavery on each other, long before Europeans arrived to practice it on them. For several tribes in the American Northwest, slaves constituted between l0 and l5 percent of the population. The Cherokee employed "slave catchers" to retrieve wounded combatants from other tribes, although the Cherokee preferred to kill enemies rather than take them captive. In some Indian tribes, slaveowners routinely killed large numbers of slaves in potlatch ceremonies to prove how wealthy they were.
<p>	Among Africans, the three powerful kingdoms of Ghana, Songhay, and Mali all relied on slave labor. Nor were these slaves exclusively blacks: The emperor Mansa Musa, for example, purchased Turkish slaves for his court in Mali. White Europeans who were shipwrecked off the west coast of Africa were also enslaved. The Ashanti of West Africa customarily enslaved all foreigners. African slavery was both widespread and uncontroversial. Historian Paul Lovejoy argues that "in the American context, slavery was introduced from the outside and always relied on the importation of slaves," while "in Africa slavery evolved from indigenous institutions."
<p>	In a recent study, John Thornton shows that slavery was far more deeply embedded in Africa than in Europe because Europeans recognized land as the primary source of private wealth, whereas "slaves were the only form of private, revenue-producing property recognized in African law." Tribal chiefs in Africa, working through Arab middlemen, sold millions of blacks to Europeans and supplied the trans-Atlantic slave trade without any fundamental modification of the institutions and values of Africa. According to Basil Davidson in <i>The African Slave Trade</i>: "The notion that Europe altogether imposed the slave trade on Africa is without any foundation in history.... Those Africans who were involved in the trade were seldom the helpless victims of a commerce they did not understand: On the contrary, they responded to its challenge. They exploited its opportunities."
<p>	Contrary to the popular belief nourished by Alex Haley's novel <i>Roots</i>, Europeans did not typically invade African tribes to chase down and capture slaves. Many slaves purchased by Europeans were already slaves in Africa. Income from the slave trade made many African chiefs and tribes rich. The grim reality of the African slave trade between Africa and America was summed up by Zora Neale Hurston, the great black writer of the Harlem Renaissance in the early part of the 20th century: "The white people held my people in slavery here in America. They had bought us, it is true, and exploited us. But the inescapable fact that stuck in my craw was: My people had sold me.... My own people had exterminated whole nations and torn families apart for a profit before the strangers got their chance at a cut. It was a sobering thought. It impressed upon me the universal nature of greed."
<p>

<b>Racism and Slavery
</b><p>

	American slavery was prompted not by racism but by the pursuit of profit. There was work to be done building the New World, and slavery provided the unpaid labor to do the job. Scholars are fairly unanimous that African slaves were purchased and transported to America for reasons of convenience and economic gain. How, then, did American slavery assume a distinctively racial character?
<p>	Marxist scholars have a powerful answer. "Race relations did not determine the patterns of slavery in the new world," writes historian Eugene Genovese, "the patterns of slavery...determined race relations." The Marxist view is that racism developed and spread in America as an ideology to rationalize the enslavement and exploitation of blacks by a white master class. Fortified by racism from the beginning, American slavery itself fostered and institutionalized bigotry.
<p>	This view draws on the insight that C.R. Boxer popularized: "One race cannot systematically enslave members of another for centuries without acquiring a conscious or unconscious feeling of racial superiority." That is why, in many ancient cultures, it was customary to brand or tattoo slaves to confirm their social stigma. But in the United States no such measures were necessary. Africans were chosen for slavery in part because they were considered inferior as a race. They already wore a racial uniform, which itself became the mark of slavery, and even later a stigma of shame and inferiority. 
<p>	The Marxist view contains a good deal of truth. Even though not all blacks in America were slaves, and not all slaves in America were black, over time these nuances became blurred, and in crucial respects racism and slavery became synonymous, in perception if not in operation. The consequence was a virtually inseparable association in the American mind between the degradation of slavery and the degradation of blackness. Yet the Marxist account does not explain what economically exploitative purpose racism serves by tormenting the free black population.
<P>

	This question is illuminated by considering the differences between slavery in the United States and slavery in Latin America. Scholars who study Caribbean and South American slavery agree that the system was extremely harsh, in some respects harsher than in the United States. Reporting to absentee owners in Spain and Portugal, ruthless overseers wielded the lash over gigantic plantations of Africans, working them with little apparent concern for their health or longevity. The slave mortality rate was far higher in Latin America than in the United States.
<P>	Yet partly through the influence of the Catholic Church, Latin American slave laws were far more benign than those in the United States. Nowhere in the United States was marriage legal for slaves, whereas slaves in Latin America had a legal right to marry and receive the sacraments. Because of the church's emphasis on family unity, slave families in Latin America had specific rights, including legal protections against arbitrary dissolution.
<p>	By contrast, slaveowners in the United States had full discretion over whether to break up families and separately sell parents and children. Every American slave state except South Carolina had laws against miscegenation. In Latin America, because of the small number of white women who settled in the Spanish colonies, black concubinage was everywhere legal, public, even moderately respectable. In fact, according to Stanley Elkins, miscegenation was generally considered a good thing in Latin America because it had a whitening effect, whereas it was generally considered a bad thing in the United States because it had a darkening effect.
<p>	Manumissions were easier, both as a matter of law and practice, in Latin America. Some American states severely restricted the right of masters to free their slaves, fearing the presence of a resentful class of free blacks among the white population.
<p>	The consequence of the Latin American system was the gradual emergence of a free colored class, which was considered neither white nor black, but named for the specific proportion of white and black and Indian blood. It was common throughout Latin America for masters to free their offspring by slave women. In the United States, by contrast, the progeny of master and slave usually remained slaves. Thus the United States gradually embraced a doctrine unique in the history of slavery: All children with any recognizable black ancestry would be considered black. To be white meant, <i>de jure</i> if not <i>de facto</i>, to be a thoroughbred European, uncontaminated by a single drop of Negro blood. Even after slavery, the one-drop rule would ensure that blacks, as a group, would remain distinct and distant from whites who could think of themselves as a ruling class.
<p>	None of this means that no enduring hierarchy developed in Latin America. It did, but it was primarily a social and not a racial hierarchy. The colored class emerged as a buffer zone, an intermediary between pure whites and pure blacks; in many countries, the colored class became the national majority. Dark skin continued to carry some stigma, but it was entirely possible to erase this through wealth, political status, and intermarriage with others of lighter skin. Racial tensions persist today in Brazil, Cuba, and other Latin American countries, but the racial legacy of slavery there is unquestionably more benign than in the United States. 
<p>	Scholars have struggled to explain why the slave systems in North America and South America evolved so differently. No doubt many factors are responsible, including religious and cultural differences. But an often-overlooked cause lies in the radically different systems of government. Spain and Portugal, which maintained South American colonies, were rigid monarchies. From the seat of government to the church, presided over by the Holy Inquisition, freedom defined as the rights of self-government and individual self-determination simply did not exist. Consequently, Spanish and Portuguese plantation owners did not have to explain to anyone, even to themselves, why they were enslaving large numbers of Africans, depriving them of liberty, and stealing the fruits of their labor. Slavery was a practice that seemed entirely reasonable for social and economic life, and one that did not contradict any of the institutions in their home countries. In short, South American slaveowners were under very little obligation to justify or rationalize slavery.
<p>	By contrast, the United States in the late 18th century became a free society with a liberal democratic creed. Inspired by the words of a Southern slaveholder, Thomas Jefferson, Americans fought a revolution in order to secure the proposition that all men are "created equal" and "endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." Historian Duncan MacLeod writes that "the very term slavery was among the most frequent in the Revolutionary vocabulary. The war was seen as essentially a battle against political servitude." It is not easy for a society revolting in the name of liberty and equality to justify slavery. The British Tory Samuel Johnson summarized the dilemma: "How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?"
<p>	Many Americans found a way to resolve the contradiction. All men are created equal, blacks are being bought and sold in America, therefore blacks must not be men. After all, if blacks are men, and all men are created equal, then blacks are entitled to the same rights as whites, including the right not to be held in captivity. In order to sustain slavery, therefore, the premise of black humanity must be denied. This explains the contorted logic of the infamous <i>Dred Scott</i> decision of l857 in which the Supreme Court invoked black inferiority to exclude slaves from constitutional protection, and pronounced slave ownership as a fundamental property right.
<p>	The doctrine that slaves were legally equivalent to property generated both legal and human contradictions. In fact, slave laws implicitly recognized the humanity of slaves by holding them accountable for their actions. Nathan Huggins writes, "A pig in the corn was not a thief; a slave in the smokehouse was. A horse that trampled the life from a cruel master was no murderer; a slave who struck out against brutality was."
<p>	So the Marxist argument is essentially correct: The ideology of racial superiority, which originated to explain civilizational differences, became consolidated in America as a convenient rationalization for continuing oppression. What some Marxist scholars seem to miss is that racism in America was not an economic but a moral justification. Although they limited the franchise to propertied white males, the American Founders were not insincere in proclaiming their allegiance to principles of liberty and equality. Southerners who were in the forefront of the American Revolution, and no less committed than Northerners to the principles of the Declaration and the Constitution, found themselves in a particular quandary as they administered their forced-labor plantations. Racism in the American South served to rationalize and justify behavior that flatly contravened the nation's political ideals.
<p>	If Americans did not believe in equality, then racism would serve no ideological or material purpose. Racism, therefore, flourished in the gap between the principles of the constitution and its pragmatic concessions. Far from being proof of distinctive American evil, racism is a peculiar reflection of the moral conscience of America, and of the West. It reflects the oppressor's need to account for the betrayal of his highest ideals. Despite the ignominious pedigree of racism as a justification for exploitation, in all of human history only the white man has felt compelled to provide such a justification. Paradoxically, those who indulged in racism thereby revealed their humanity, even as they disregarded the humanity of others. The very existence of racism implies that, from the very outset, slavery existed uncomfortably and anomalously with Jeffersonian principles.
<p>
<b>Who Killed Slavery?
</b><p>	Although slavery was a universal institution, not confined to the West, what is distinctively Western is the abolition of slavery. Many people have, of course, resisted being captured and sold as slaves, but no society, including all of Africa, has ever on its own account mounted principled opposition to human servitude. In all the literature condemning Western slavery, however, few scholars have asked why a practice sanctioned by virtually all people for thousands of years should be questioned, and eventually halted, by only one.
<p>	Paradoxically, it is in America and nowhere else in the world where the legacy of slavery is a contemporary issue, the American Constitution is condemned as a document that compromised with slavery, and the Framers are routinely denounced for being racist hypocrites. The irony is compounded by the recognition that the prevailing view of the Constitution as proslavery was precisely that of Justice Taney in the <i>Dred Scott</i> decision. By contrast, Abraham Lincoln strongly denied Taney's view, and his position came to be enthusiastically embraced by Frederick Douglass, the greatest black leader of the 19th century. It is to the debates over the legitimacy of slavery in the West that we must turn to decide whether Taney and many 20th-century scholars are right, or Lincoln is.<p>
	Throughout world history, slavery had few defenders for the simple reason that it had few critics. The institution was uncontroversial, and that which is established and taken for granted does not have to be justified. The American South was unique among slave societies in history in that it produced a comprehensive proslavery ideology. In part, this was because slavery was under assault to a degree unrivaled anywhere else in the world. <p>
	The simplest defense for slavery was economic necessity: Someone has to do the dirty work, and better them than us. This position was based on an implicit premise that whites in the South were in a position to compel blacks to perform menial but necessary tasks. It is force, rather than right, that kept the system of slavery in place.
<p>	Southerners were also familiar with a European tradition, going back to the Crusades, that held it was permissible to enslave pagans but not Christians. In response to this, the leading forces in the South formulated an identical justification: Africans were heathens, so slavery would serve as a kind of moral education to introduce them to Christianity. But once slaves embraced the Christian faith of their masters, other excuses became necessary in order to justify keeping them in servitude. Here many Southern divines intervened to offer a racist rationale. They promulgated a dubious interpretation of a story in the book of Genesis in which Noah curses the descendants of his son Ham, who impudently looked upon his father's nakedness. Thus, in this account, the children of Ham were condemned to blackness and future enslavement. For a long time there was little challenge to this absurd innovation in biblical exegesis.
<p>	It was only when the institution of slavery came under moral assault for betraying the Declaration of Independence and Christian charity that many Southern apologists such as John C. Calhoun, James Henry Hammond, Edmund Ruffin, George Frederick Holmes, and George Fitzhugh responded by formulating an audacious defense of slavery as a positive good. Hammond, among others, repudiated the Jeffersonian doctrine of equality as "ridiculously absurd."
<p>	Their case for slavery depended on a paternalistic worldview in which Negroes, like women and children, occupied positions in an organic society commensurate with supposed limited moral and intellectual abilities. Eugene Genovese writes in <i>The Slaveholders' Dilemma</i>, "Southerners from social theorists to divines to politicians to ordinary slaveholders and yeomen insisted fiercely that emancipation would cast blacks into a marketplace in which they could not compete and would condemn them to the fate of the Indians or worse." Although defenders of slavery were right about the harshness of Northern capitalism, their paternalistic vision foundered in that the community of interests that could generally be presumed between husband and wife, or between parents and children, could not be presumed between master and slave.
<p>	The Southern doctrine of Negro inferiority immediately extended to whites, even those who were destitute and ignorant, membership in an exclusive racial club and a social position above that of all blacks, both slave and free. Edmund Morgan argues in <i>American Slavery, American Freedom</i> that the racial defense of Southern slavery strengthened, among whites, the conviction that, despite conspicuous differences of wealth and position, they were equal just as the Declaration of Independence posited. Racism, in other words, became a source of white social status.
<p>	The dilemma over slavery ultimately came down to one of the oldest Western arguments, which we find in Plato's <i>Republic</i>: The wise should rule over the unwise. During the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Stephen Douglas defended the right of states to decide for themselves whether they wanted slavery in precisely these terms:
<p><blockquote>	"The civilized world has always held that when any race of men have shown themselves to be so degraded by ignorance, superstition, cruelty, and barbarism, as to be utterly incapable of governing themselves, they must, in the nature of things, be governed by others, by such laws as are deemed to be applicable to their condition."
</blockquote><p> 
<b>Wisdom and Consent
</b>

<p>	We may think Stephen Douglas's view to be crude and hateful, but Abraham Lincoln did not. He agreed with Douglas: It is absurd to construct a regime in which the wise do not rule; surely no one wants the mediocre or the foolish to rule. In fact this raises a problem with democracy that the American Founders and Lincoln recognized: How can the wise, who are by definition the few, be reliably identified and chosen to rule by the many? Representative government is based on the hope that the majority will exercise their power on behalf of right, that they will choose others who are wiser than themselves to govern. Yet modern democracy introduces a crucial qualification to the claim of the wise to rule: Such rule is only legitimate when it is vindicated by popular consent. The majority is not the best judge of what is wise, but most people do recognize their own interests. Hence representative democracy is a "mixed regime," which seeks to reconcile the claims of right and expediency.
<p>	This debate is the crucial backdrop to an examination of the antislavery movement of the 18th century, because it provided the context and the moral terms for the issue. The two principles that would form the basis for the first serious challenge to the institution of slavery and the doctrine of black inferiority are both encapsulated in the Declaration of Independence: the Christian belief that all persons bear the image of God and are equal in His eyes, and the distinctly modern European political conception that all human beings enjoy a natural right to freedom and self-government that can only be abridged by their consent. 
<p>	In the second half of the 18th century, a small but militant group of religious and political activists began to apply the doctrine of equality more broadly and concretely in order to reform the injustices of this world, what David Brion Davis terms "a sacralization of social progress." Tocqueville wrote: "We have seen something absolutely without precedent in history -- servitude abolished, not by the desperate effort of the slave, but by the enlightened will of the master. . . . It is we who have given a definite and practical meaning to the Christian idea that all men are born equal, and applied it to the realities of this world."
<p>	The first group to mount an organized campaign against slavery was the Society of Friends, the Quakers, first in Europe in the second half of the 17th century, then in the United States. Ignoring passages in the Bible that had been invoked to justify slavery, leading Quakers such as George Fox in England and John Woolman and Anthony Benezet in the U.S. emphasized that spiritual freedom -- man's capacity to choose the good in his quest for moral perfectibility -- required freedom of choice in this life. Slavery, according to this view, represented the moral imprisonment of God's children and thus was wrong, even blasphemous. Drawing on the religious energies of the Great Awakening, the first of a serious of revival movements that would energize America between the mid-18th century and the end of the 19th, many evangelical Protestants began to embrace a similar interpretation. They applied Christ's injunction -- do unto others as we would have them do unto us -- directly to the relationship between slaveowners and slaves.<p>
	In l772, Lord Mansfield issued a landmark decision in Britain abolishing slavery on English soil. In l833, thanks to the abolition campaign of Granville Sharp, Thomas Clarkson, and especially William Wilberforce, slavery was outlawed throughout the British empire. Economic motives undoubtedly contributed, but scholars now generally agree that religious and political principles were indispensable in achieving the abolition of servitude. Antislavery victories soon spread to France, which forbade slavery in its territories in l848, and to other European nations as well. In a bizarre development, tribal leaders in Gambia, Congo, Dahomey, and other African nations that had prospered under the slave trade sent delegations to London and Paris to vigorously protest the abolition of slavery. "Africans felt that the rules of their traditional life had been called into question," Mohamed Mbodj writes, "by initiatives which destabilized the bases of their society." <p>
	Eventually the British example, backed by diplomatic and even military measures, eradicated slavery in all foreign areas of influence. In America, although there were many among them who shared prevailing prejudices against blacks, the abolitionist movement contained the first antiracists. Leading abolitionists agreed that blacks were civilizationally inferior and incapable of ruling themselves. But black inferiority, they said, is no justification for slavery; rather, it is the product of slavery itself. Some abolitionists endorsed the idea of helping blacks to resettle in Africa, but those who recognized the implausibility of such schemes attempted to show that blacks were capable of living as free people. In order to directly rebut the Southern argument that blacks were better off being ruled by their betters, abolitionists began a slow but relentless quest for intelligent blacks who would be standing refutations of theories of intrinsic inferiority.<p>
	Three prime exhibits for opponents of slavery to demonstrate the intellectual capacity of Negroes were Phillis Wheatley, the Negro poet; Benjamin Banneker, the black mathematician and scholar; and Frederick Douglass, the runaway slave and later statesman and orator. For many Americans, it was so unbelievable that a black person could produce a serious work of literature that 18 eminent whites (including John Hancock, who signed the Declaration of Independence, and Thomas Hutchinson, the governor of Massachusetts) offered an "attestation to the publick" that, upon examination, Wheatley's poems were verified to be her original work and that she was indeed a full-blooded black woman. Additionally, abolitionists stressed the physical and mental sufferings of slaves in order to recruit humanitarian sentiment on behalf of emancipation. No one was more successful in this than Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, published in l852. Perhaps the most influential political tract of the 19th century, Stowe's sentimental novel was credited by Lincoln for turning the North irrevocably against slavery, setting the stage for the confrontation that culminated in the Civil War.

<b>Wolf by the Ears
</b>

<p><blockquote>The only distinction between freedom and slavery is this: In the former state, a man is governed by the laws to which he has given his consent; in the latter, he is governed by the will of another.
</blockquote><p>

 -- Alexander Hamilton
<p>
	Justice Taney's argument in <i>Dred Scott</i>, shared by many contemporary scholars, that the American Founders were hypocrites who produced a proslavery regime, rests on the apparent contradiction between stated ideals and actual practice. It seems hard to explain how a slaveowner like Thomas Jefferson could declare that "all men are created equal." Nor is it obvious how 55 men in Philadelphia, some 30 of whom were slaveowners themselves, could proclaim antislavery principles while endorsing a document that would permit slavery to continue in the Southern states. This is the force behind Taney's insistence that these men could not have meant what they said. Taney's interpretation, that the Constitution secures no rights for blacks that whites must respect, leads directly to the contemporary suggestion that the Founders were motivated not by noble ideals but by crass self-interest.<p>
	That the American Founders were self-interested is impossible to deny. Thomas Jefferson owned some 200 slaves and did not free them. Yet the case of Jefferson is revealing. Far from rationalizing plantation life by adopting the usual Southern arguments about the happy slave, Jefferson the Virginian vehemently denounced slavery as flatly inconsistent with justice. Jefferson recognized that blacks were not slaves "by nature," only by convention. Although he agreed with the scientific view of his time, and suspected that blacks were inferior to whites in capacity, Jefferson expressed his wish that black accomplishment prove him wrong. (Jefferson's empirical observations about black inferiority were not shared by either Benjamin Franklin or Alexander Hamilton.) Moreover, Jefferson strongly denied that possible black intellectual or civilizational inferiority justified white enslavement: "Whatever be their talents, it is no measure of their rights." Consequently, the only rationale for Jefferson not freeing his slaves is expediency. "Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in another."<p>
	The dilemma of Jefferson and the American Founders may be summarized as follows: They fully recognized that a democratic society depends not just on wisdom, but also on consent. Consequently, there is no justification whatever for ruling another human being without his consent. Blacks are human beings, and in possession of natural rights. Slavery is therefore against natural right and should be prohibited. But how? Here Jefferson and the Founders faced two profound obstacles. The first was that virtually all of them recognized the degraded condition of blacks in America. Whatever the cause of this condition, the Framers recognized that it posed a formidable hurdle to granting to blacks the rights of citizenship. By contrast with monarchy and aristocracy, which only require subjects to obey, self-government requires citizens who have the moral and civilizational capacity to be rulers. 
<p>	Jefferson also recognized the existence of intense and widespread white prejudices against blacks that seemed to prevent the two peoples from coexisting harmoniously on the same soil. While Jefferson agonized over the problem, Madison proposed a strange but bold scheme for solving the nation's multiracial dilemma of the time. The government, he suggested, might take the land it had acquired from the Indians, sell it to the new European immigrants, and use the money to send blacks back to Africa. The concept of relocating blacks in Africa was later endorsed in principle by Lincoln and retained its appeal among many whites and some blacks until the Civil War.
<p>	The deference of Jefferson and the American Founders to popular prejudices strikes many contemporary scholars as excessive. Some suggest that popular convictions simply represented a frustrating obstacle that the Founders should have dealt with resolutely and forcefully. In a democratic society, however, the absence of the people's agreement on a fundamental moral question of governance is no mere technicality. The case for democracy, no less than the case against slavery, rests on the legitimacy of the people's consent. To outlaw slavery without the consent of the majority of whites would be to destroy democracy, and thus to destroy the very basis for outlawing slavery.
<p>	The men gathered in Philadelphia faced a genuine dilemma. For them to sanction slavery would be to proclaim the illegitimacy of the American Revolution and the new form of government based on the people's consent; yet for them to outlaw slavery without securing the people's consent would have the same effect. In practical terms as well, the choice facing the men gathered in Philadelphia was not to permit or to prohibit slavery. Rather, the choice was either to establish a union in which slavery was tolerated, or not to have a union. Any suggestion that Southern states could be persuaded to join a union and give up slavery can be dismissed as implausible in the extreme.
<p>	Thus the accusation that the Founders compromised on the Declaration's principle "all men are created equal" for the purpose of expediency reflects a grave misunderstanding. The Founders were confronted with a competing principle, also present in the Declaration, that governments derive their legitimacy "from the consent of the governed." Both principles must be satisfied, and where they cannot, compromise is not merely permissible but morally required. 
<p>	The American Founders found a middle ground not between principle and practice, but between antislavery and majority consent. Not only are these closely related principles, but in a philosophic sense, they are the same principle. How did the Framers seek to mediate between their rival claims? By producing a Constitution in which the concept of slavery is tolerated, in deference to consent, but nowhere given any moral approval, in recognition of the slave's natural rights. Indeed nowhere in the document is the term "slavery" used. Slaves are always described as "persons," implying their possession of natural rights. The Founders made concessions to slavery as a matter of fact but not as a matter of right. In addition, the Framers produced a Constitution that nowhere acknowledges the existence of racial distinctions, thus producing a document that transcended its time and provided a charter for a better future.
<p>	None of the supposed contradictions that contemporary scholars have located in the American Founders were unrecognized by them. Many of the Framers justified their toleration for slavery on prudential grounds: In the 1770s and 1780s, they had reason to believe that slavery was losing its commercial appeal. In this they were wrong. Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in l793 (which the Founders could not possibly have anticipated) revived the demand for slavery in the South. Even so, the test of the Founders' project is the practical question: Did the American Founding strengthen or weaken the institution of slavery? 
<p>	The intellectual and moral ferment that produced the American Revolution, Gordon Wood argues, should be judged by its consequences. Before l776, slavery was legal in every state in America. Yet by l804, every state north of Maryland had abolished slavery, either immediately or gradually; Southern and border states prohibited further slave importations from abroad; and Congress outlawed the slave trade as soon as it was allowed to, in l808. Slavery was no longer a national but a sectional institution, and one under moral and political siege. "Before the revolution, Americans like every other people took slavery for granted," Wood says. "But slavery came under indictment as a result of the same principles that produced the American Founding. In this sense, the prospect of the Civil War is implicitly contained in the Declaration of Independence."
<p>	Abraham Lincoln was one of the most astute students of the American Founding in his time or since. He not only perceived the Framers' dilemma, but knew that he inherited it. The principle of majority rule is based on Jefferson's doctrine that "all men are created equal," yet what Harry Jaffa terms the "crisis of the house divided" arises when the majority denies that "all men are created equal" -- that is, denies the basis of its own legitimacy. Lincoln was presented with two concrete options: working to overthrow democracy, or working to secure consent through persuasion.
<p>	Conscious that he, too, must defer, as the Founders did, to prevailing prejudices, Lincoln nevertheless sought to neutralize those prejudices so they did not become a barrier to securing black freedom. In a series of artfully conditional claims about blacks -- "If God gave him little, that little let him enjoy" -- Lincoln paid ritual obeisance to existing racism while drawing even racists into his coalition to end slavery. Lincoln made these rhetorical concessions because he knew that the possibility for securing antislavery consent had improved since the 1780s.<p>
	In one of the clearest commentaries on the Declaration, Lincoln observed: "They intended to include all men, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what respects they did consider all men created equalequal in certain inalienable rights. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet, that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. . . . They meant simply to declare the <i>right</i>, so that the <i>enforcement</i> of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit."
<p>	By working through rather than around the democratic process, Lincoln justified the nation's faith in the untried experiment of representative self-government. In vindicating the slave's right to rule himself, Lincoln also vindicated the legitimacy of democratic self-rule. And Lincoln's position came to be shared by Frederick Douglass, who once denounced the Constitution but who eventually came to the conclusion that it contained antislavery principles: "Abolish slavery tomorrow, and not a sentence or syllable of the Constitution need be altered." Slavery, he concluded, was simply a "scaffolding to the magnificent structure, to be removed as soon as the building is completed." 
<p>	It took a civil war to destroy slavery, and with it much of the infrastructure and economy of the South, between l860 and l865. More than a half million whites died in that war, "one life for every six slaves freed," C. Vann Woodward reminds us. Although the question of slavery in the United States was ultimately resolved by force, Lincoln and Douglass both believed the triumph of the union and the emancipation of the slaves represented not the victory of might over right, but the reverse: Justice had won over expediency and the principles of the American Founding had at long last prevailed.
<p>
<b>The Price of Freedom
</b>

<p>	Whatever its functional relevance in a world utterly different from our own, slavery was a moral crime. People should not own other people. Unfortunately the practice of slavery persisted into the 20th century in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East: Saudi Arabia and Yemen outlawed it only in l962. According to the British Anti-Slavery International, which monitors the institution worldwide, it is still practiced covertly in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Arab world. In Mauritania alone, nearly l00,000 people are estimated to be enslaved.
<p>	The abolition of slavery in the West did not produce the abolition of racism. As George Fredrickson puts it, "The slaveholding mentality . . . remained the wellspring of white supremacist thought and action long after the institution that originally sustained it had been relegated to the dustbin of history." At the same time, abolition constitutes one of the greatest moral achievements of Western civilization. The reason for the acceptability of slavery prior to the 18th century is that the idea of freedom simply did not exist in an applied and comprehensive sense anywhere in the world.
<P>	It is understandable that American blacks, on discovering the circumstances in which their ancestors were brought to this country, would feel at best a qualified patriotism. But upon reflection this ambivalence may be unwarranted. Africans were not uniquely unfortunate to be taken as slaves; their descendants were uniquely fortunate to be born in the only civilization in the world to abolish slavery on its own initiative. For Zora Neale Hurston, the black feminist writer of the Harlem Renaissance, the legacy of slavery is one of opportunities for the future, not unceasing submersion in the past.
<p>	"From what I can learn, it was sad," she wrote. "Certainly. But my ancestors who lived and died in it are dead. The white men who profited by their labor and lives are dead also. I have no personal memory of those times, and no responsibility for them. Neither has the grandson of the man who held my folks. . . . I have no intention of wasting my time beating on old graves. . . . I do not belong to the sobbing school of Negroes who hold that nature somehow has given them a low-down dirty deal and whose feelings are all hurt about it. . . . Slavery is the price I paid for civilization, and that is worth all that I have paid through my ancestors for it."
	<p>A similar position was elaborated by Booker T. Washington, who was born a slave but went on to become the most powerful black statesman and educator in the United States: "Think about it: We went into slavery pagans; we came out Christians. We went into slavery pieces of property; we came out American citizens. We went into slavery with chains clanking about our wrists; we came out with the American ballot in our hands. . . . Notwithstanding the cruelty and moral wrong of slavery, we are in a stronger and more hopeful condition, materially, intellectually, morally, and religiously, than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of the globe."
<p>	Washington's argument is that slavery proved to be the transmission belt that nevertheless brought Africans into the orbit of modern civilization and Western freedom, so that future generations of black Americans would be far more free and prosperous than their former kinsmen in Africa. Washington's conclusion seems hard to deny: Slavery was an institution that was terrible to endure for slaves, but it left the <i>descendants</i> of slaves better off in America. For this, the American Founders are owed a measure of respect and gratitude.

<H2>Business Relations Department</h2>

<hr>
<p>
The primary mission of the Business Relations department is to educate and mobilize the business community -- entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, trade associations, and activists -- on behalf of the  free enterprise/limited government policy agenda.  The department has coordinated briefings for industry groups on the current status of health care reform, telecommunications deregulation, trade, budget and tax reform, and deregulation.  
<p>
	In addition to meeting and briefing corporate representatives, the Business Relations department is working with industry coalitions to advance our agenda; coordinating working group meetings on the flat tax and regulatory reform; creating a "Resource Bank of Business" by identifying businessmen willing to speak, write, and testify on behalf of free enterprise/limited government policies; coordinating the activities of  our <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/physc.html"><b>Physicians Council</b></a>; and launching a new <a href="#council"><b>Business Council</b></a> of the Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	In addition to smaller, informal briefings, we host Heritage's regular <b><i>Washington Policy Roundtable</i></b> meetings which bring Heritage experts, industry representatives, and policy makers together to discuss issues that are being debated on Capitol Hill.  <b><i>Roundtable</i></b> meetings this year have included:
<p>

	Business Relations also launched two new fax publications this year to update and inform the business community.  Both are targeted to representatives in the corporate, public relations, legal, and association fields.  The <i>Business Bulletin</i> presents an occasional essay on topics of special interest to this community.  The first <i>Bulletin</i> on <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/bb596.html">"Corporate Responsibility"</a> was authored by Rebecca Lukens Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a> and timed for release just prior to the White House conference on corporate responsibility.  The second <i>Bulletin</i> highlights the Heritage publication on "<a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/bb696.html">How the Congress Won the Budget War</a>" and offers free copies of our new pocket-sized summary card on the paper.  <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/octbrcal.html"><i>This Month at Heritage</i></a> is a faxed monthly calendar previewing upcoming Heritage lectures and events for the business community.

<h3>Business Council</h3>
<p>
Heritage launched a Business Council, which will educate business executives, small business owners, and entrepreneurs about issues that directly affect them.  Our goal in establishing a Business Council of the Heritage Foundation is to identify a group of businessmen activists who, through their civic, business and community activities will help us leverage our own work on issues like tax and regulatory reform, health care, the federal budget, and education reform.
<p>
Members of the Council receive receive Heritage reports through the mail and by fax.  And serve as a source of information for Heritage experts on the impact government policies have on real people. 
 <p>
	If you are interested in joining the Business Council of The Heritage Foundation, please contact:  Bridgett Wagner, Director of Business Relations at 202/608-6050 or via email at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<a name="flattax">
<h3>Flat Tax Transition Rules Working Group</h3>
<p>

	The Heritage Foundation and the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation have conducted a series of meetings that address various aspects of making a successful transition to a fundamentally reformed tax system.  These meetings will result in "white papers" and recommendations on moving towards effective transition rules. Topics have included: Accumulated Depreciation; Interest Deductibility; Health Care and Employee Benefits; Border Adjustability and Foreign Taxation; and Charitable Contributions.  If you are interested in learning more about these meetings or being added to our mailing list, please contact Bridgett Wagner at (202) 546-4400 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<h3>Which Land trusts Can You Trust? </h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>R. Randolph Richardson</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>
	The public places great faith in national conservation groups to preserve ecologically valuable land. Uncritical news coverage and slick fundraising campaigns have something to do with this. But nature-lovers and property owners should be aware that local community-based land trusts are often better stewards of land and more interested in managing land for the enjoyment of the local populace. Unfortunately, many citizens involved in land preservation are unaware of the distinctions.<p>	I learned this lesson through bitter experience. My dad once owned 74 acres in Westport, Connecticut. In 1970, when he was 84, he asked me to help him decide how to preserve the land for the enjoyment and education of his neighbors. He wanted the Christmas trees he'd planted sold to help pay for planting native hardwood, shrubs, and grasses. He wanted trails with plant life identified and education programs for kids. Eventually he chose the Fairfield Chapter of the Connecticut Audubon Society (not affiliated with National Audubon) to carry out his vision because it agreed to do most of what he thought important.<p>	In l990, 18 years after Dad's death, I discovered Audubon had done nothing it had agreed to. The Christmas trees were 35 feet high and covered with thick bittersweet vines that threaten to kill them. The land was overgrown and untended, and locked gates barred public access. At the Audubon office, I pointed out that densely planted spruce trees provide almost no food and nest sites for birds (except for predatory owls and hawks that eat other birds). The young staffer ignored me and nattered on about a rare hawk seen on the site recently.<p>	Audubon's officials brazenly cited lack of funds for their failure to fulfill the contract. Yet one of the parcels was a Christmas tree farm whose profits were flowing mainly to a former Audubon employee. As far as I could see, not a penny of Audubon's share was being spent to maintain the balance of the 74 acres.<P>Over the years, I've learned that there are large differences between the practices of national landholding trusts like the Nature Conservancy, the Trust for Public Land, and National Audubon Society and those of the local trusts. There are exceptions to my generalizations, and some local and state chapters with famous brand names are not affiliated with their national namesakes, but may operate as most of the nationals do. The national environmental organizations and their affiliates tend to:<p>	Follow the thinking of John Muir, a talented nature writer and a founder of the Sierra Club. Muir believed wilderness is best left alone because man can only degrade it. The Muir doctrine, however, has no basis in science. The nationals' philosophy of land management amounts to nonmanagement. And this nonmanagement saves millions of dollars that they can devote to fundraising, salaries, perks, etc.; as the inspector general of the Interior Department points out, the nationals are businesses.<ul><p><li>	Limit public access by cutting few trails, allowing ground vegetation to become impenetrable, preserving parcels of land that are bounded entirely by private property, and declaring land off-limits under the Endangered Species Act and other federal legislation.<p><li>Lobby the federal government to manage land their way and to lock away ever more land under the Endangered Species Act, wetlands regulations, and similar laws. Many professional foresters think that such promotion of the Muir philosophy of land management results in more disastrous fires in national parks, like the notorious Yellowstone fire in 1989.<p><li>Engage in the highly profitable business of selling land to the federal government, particularly to various agencies  within the Department of the Interior (see <a href="#sidebar">sidebar</a>).</ul><p>
Local land trusts, with some exceptions, tend to:<p><ul>
<li>Use what science-based management they can afford.<p><li>Allow public access and seek multiple uses for preserved property, including recreation, preservation, education, and in some cases sensible, sustainable logging.<p><li>Seek members among their local communities. </ul><p>
	For those with experience of wildlife and land, the differences in management philosophy are not abstract. A few vignettes illustrate this. I have visited eight sites owned by nationals. Three were within homeowners' associations, forbidding public access. A fourth had soil beloved by dense ground cover, ensuring no sunlight for tree seedlings. The land could remain an impenetrable wilderness for centuries until wildfire cleared the ground. A fifth, 20.3 acres, is prone to saltwater intrusion in hurricanes and off-limits to the public. An expert on the rare orchid growing there suggested that since each plant produces 10,000-plus seeds, real protection of the species lies in trying to grow it elsewhere. Maybe Congress needs to ask that question next time it's lobbied to lock away land for an endangered something.<p>	In northeast Connecticut, by contrast, there's a young local trust busily acquiring land. Each new tract is surveyed by state or private forestry professionals. The resulting plans are masterpieces of knowledgeable, applied ecological sciences. Black birches, a disease-prone species there, are to be killed by girdling their trunks, making room for heartier stock. "Patch cuts" (small areas where trees are cleared for the planting of shrubs and grasses) are made to provide food for small mammals and to protect fledgling birds from hawks. This trust also organizes demonstrations for local landowners of some of the techniques they can apply on their land.<p>	An established trust in northwest Connecticut owns the most beautiful stand of ancient, giant hemlocks in New England. These great-grandfathers are being attacked by the wooly adelgid, an insect native to Asia that betrays its presence only when the needles start to fall off the trees. The president of the trust, a retired engineer who built petroleum plants throughout the world, has raised funds to send a scientist to Japan, where knowledge about the adelgid and its natural predators is well advanced. Many years ago, this trust had a healthy stand of red pine on ten acres. A disease, then untreatable, was devastating red pine throughout the area. The trustees decided to keep the organism from multiplying and attacking red pines elsewhere. So they clear-cut the stand and used the proceeds to improve their properties.<p>	Many things have changed since my father donated his land to the Connecticut Audubon Society. Owners have smartened up and few donors now enter into donation contracts without a strong recission clause. These legal arrangements generally recite the donor's expectations concerning the management of the gifted land: whether to allow the harvesting of mature timber, maintain trails, enforce limitations on public access, and so on.<p>	Landowners are increasingly adept at protecting the environmental integrity of their land, as well as their plans for it, by selling conservation easements to land trusts. Such easements, which last in perpetuity, essentially foreclose any chance that the owners' wishes will not be respected. One can sell an easement, for example, requiring that the land be managed a certain way and cannot be sold for development. There's been an explosion in the variety of easement terms; with patience, a landowner may find an organization that buys easements allowing the harvesting of mature timber or providing expert management for wildlife and plants. If the transfer is to take place after the donor's death, the authority to enforce the recission power is frequently conveyed to a third party known as the enforcer, whose rights, responsibilities, and qualifications can be written into the contract.<p><b>Looking to the Future</b><p>	The last 15 years or so have witnessed an explosion in the number of small, community-based local trusts. According to the Land Trust Alliance, based in Washington, D.C., as of 1994 there were 1,100 land trusts with approximately 900,000 active members. The number of local trusts is now growing at about one per week. They own about 540,000 acres outright, have conveyed nearly 1 million acres to state and municipal parks, and have acquired various kinds of conservation easements on about 2.5 million acres.<p>I would like to imagine a future in which the practices of national landholding organizations converge with those of local trusts for the betterment of citizens and communities. Change is already occurring among the nationals. In most Northeastern and Western states, state and county forestry officials are products of excellent forestry schools. They understand the science-based management of wild land and wildlife. They advise the local trusts and, occasionally, the local affiliates of the nationals.<p>	The 1991 Farm Bill included funding for a "Forestry Stewardship Program" that strengthens the advisory system local trusts and private owners depend on. Here and there, some local affiliates of the nationals are beginning to use science to manage their land. In most areas, relations between the locals and the nationals are cordial and the practices introduced by state and private foresters are being observed by the young idealists who work for national affiliates. In sum, science is once again beginning to overcome what has increasingly seemed a dogma.<p><b>R. RANDOLPH RICHARDSON</B>, <i>now retired, has run several small businesses in the timber, cattle-raising, farming, and fishing industries</i>.<p><a name="sidebar"></a><b>Real Estate for Sale (sidebar)</b><p>	My desire to see local land trusts receive the support they deserve is not limited to my experiences as a landowner and a conservationist. As a taxpayer, I have become concerned about the practice by national land trusts of purchasing ecologically valuable land from private owners for the purpose of reselling it to federal agencies. Taxpayers should hold government accountable for wise use of funds and tax exemptions, especially when the result is often to remove land from public access. Yet the federal government often overpays, to the enrichment of the national trusts involved. According to a 1992 report of the Interior Department's inspector general:<p><ul>
<li>Between 1987 and 1989, the Fish and Wildlife Service paid the Nature Conservancy $13.5 million for 11,502 Texas acres, including $500,000 paid in undocumented fees that boosted the price above market value. The same agency paid the same seller $4.5 million for Oklahoma land appraised at $3.5 million.<p>
<li>In 1987, Fish and Wildlife paid the National Audubon Society $1 million for 777 acres in California appraised at $700,000. The agency reasoned that it had asked Audubon to acquire the land in 1983, when Audubon had to pay $1 million for it.<p>
<li>The Nature Conservancy purchased 3,735 Arkansas acres in 1989. In 1991, Fish and Wildlife bought 1,153 acres of this appraised at $747,000 for $914,000, including interest and overhead charges of $251,000.

<h3>The Rediscovery of American Citizenship</h3>

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>Larry Arnn</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i>

</center><p>



	Citizenship has always been an important question in America, and sometimes it is urgent. This is such a time. In the nature of our society, we leave much to private action. We do this as a matter of principle, in the interest of the liberty that is our entitlement. In America, it is our nature and our law to recognize this natural liberty. That is why private action is unusually important here. But today, private action is not doing its job.

<p>
	We know the facts. A third of all children are born out of wedlock. Half of marriages break up. Thievery and pillage, rape and murder flourish at horrific levels. Our graduates know neither basic facts nor main ideas. Most Americans are economically dependent on the government in some way. Our world is richer and more sophisticated, yet there is a decline of civility, of responsibility, and of knowledge about the highest things, giving our society a low, even primitive cast. Americans have the feeling that something more than their greatness may be going. They feel the loss of goodness, and the emptiness of that feeling cannot be borne.
<p>

	The liberals have a plan to repair this loss. It is the centralized, bureaucratic, administrative state. Its language is familiar: It calls us to "attack our problems on a national scale," "with the full resources of our country," "with the best minds in the nation," all "coordinated from the top." It reminds us that "Washington has a responsibility" -- for example, to keep children nourished. Liberalism finds its energy in utopian promise. Woodrow Wilson would "marry our interests to the state," as if we could be, in the literal sense, one grand family. Franklin Roosevelt would eliminate want, not just from the United States, but from the world. And he would eliminate fear while he was at it. Lyndon Johnson would guarantee equality of result. Hillary Clinton would "change what it means to be a human being in the 21st century."

<p>
	Modern liberalism is progressive, visionary, and ever expanding, and has a conception of citizenship appropriate to its principles. The citizen under modern liberalism responds to policy. He knows that the progress to which society is destined requires progress by him, in his own person. He must be ready, when fashion shifts, to alter his pronouns, his diet, and his relations with his children. He must stay abreast of the shifting value placed on family, or patriotism, or history. He must, in short, be pliable, ready to be shaped and molded.
<p>	Liberals understand the importance of making their vision of citizenship compatible with, even necessary to, the old concept of citizenship that it replaces. When Bill Clinton was inaugurated, for example, he suddenly became "William Jefferson" Clinton. To emphasize the point that he is named after Thomas Jefferson, he spent the eve of his inauguration at Monticello, and traveled the same route that Jefferson did to arrive at the ceremony. He announced his tax increase on Lincoln's and Washington's official birthday, and spoke about their greatness and attention to duty. 
<p>	President Clinton thus continues a tradition of successful modern liberalism begun by Woodrow Wilson and perfected by Franklin Roosevelt. Modern liberals know better than to reject openly the ideas of the Declaration of Independence. But they talk plenty about "completing them," which means changing them completely. Franklin Roosevelt, for example, invented a new demon -- "the economic royalists" --- to replace King George III. He claimed to be defending liberty, in the same way the Founders had defended it against the King.
<p>	But in fighting the economic royalists, Roosevelt attacked also the right to property, a fundamental right that the Founders took pains to establish. Because of this cleverness, the liberals are good at seeming public spirited and devoted to the old ideas. People have long trusted them to serve the community, to care about citizenship and neighborliness.
<p>	We conservatives are united in our opposition to the liberal idea of citizenship. We have seen that there is no liberty under this program. It extinguishes liberty by extinguishing the creature capable of liberty. By the force of government, it replaces him with some new being. It takes a lot of government to "change what it means to be a human being." Several million administrators, deploying a quarter of the largest economy on earth, do not seem to have finished the job in a full generation of trying.
<p>	If we conservatives do not like the liberal idea of citizenship, what do we like? There, more work is needed.
<p>	Recall the standard list of the things wrong with our society, such as divorce and illegitimacy and crime. I would add one generally forgotten: a loss not only of habit, but of knowledge, a loss not only of the exercise of good citizenship, but of the ideas that underlie it. In short, we are ignorant of the basis of our government and the way that it should operate.
<p>	Working adults know that the government is too big and wastes their money and tells them lies on a regular basis. But very few people know or understand even the basic issues of contemporary politics. They do not know, for example, that the cuts proposed by the current Congress amount only to a small fraction of federal spending. They do not know that each of the Clinton budgets called for large increases in domestic spending. They do not know that the welfare system pays its typical clients more than $22,000 per year in southern California, nor that this is more than double the minimum wage.
<p>	This ignorance is neither surprising nor worrisome, except that it betokens a larger ignorance of the high purpose of and the strict limits on government in America. Because of this, we tend to work out our policies practically. We will devolve welfare to the states because "the federal system has proved that it does not work." We hardly mention that the only real entitlement is to the money we earn for ourselves, and that we have no right to anything earned by another. In this respect, we compare poorly to the generation of Americans who would not pay a tax on tea because they were not represented in the legislature that imposed it. These earlier Americans could tell you, right down to the law of nature and human equality, why that tax was wrong, and why another one might be right. They were schooled in the business of being citizens. That schooling made it possible for them to win their liberty.
<p>	Our statesmen -- even those on the Right -- do not do a sufficient job recovering this lost knowledge. None of our statesmen called the Clinton health-care plan unconstitutional. Few oppose entitlements root and branch. What are we to do?
<p>	The recent debate on Proposition 187, California's illegal-immigration initiative, suffered from this failure. Good people supported the initiative, and good people opposed it. The good people who supported the initiative, with a couple of important exceptions, did not make a case about the meaning of citizenship. They talked about denying these so-called benefits of citizenship to some who did not deserve them, without saying what most of them believe: Citizens do not deserve them, either. The good people who opposed the initiative talked a lot about equal treatment, and they said little or nothing about the beliefs and practices that constitute citizenship in America. We were left with a debate about a side issue, and the main point was lost in the whirlwind.
<p>	If statesmen cannot do the work, then we citizens -- in private life -- must do it. I would salute, for example, the conservative writings that support the regeneration of fatherhood, and the sanctity of the family, and the necessity for religion to become powerful once again in our public as well as in our private lives. It is vital to add, however, that our problems are deeply political, and their solution will require hard political action, based upon deep political reasoning and unyielding political conviction.
<p>	Although the Bureau of This or the Agency for That may not be the answer to the evils we face, we are still a profoundly political nation, and our public life is infused with political ideas. Take, for example, the recent celebration of "voluntary and local associations" as we find in the writings of Marvin Olasky or Russell Kirk or Speaker Newt Gingrich. We have turned back to Tocqueville, and we know now that American life until lately teemed with these associations and was elevated and ennobled by them. Of course we are right, in one sense, to think that these local institutions are not at all political. They have no formal constitutional place, they function apart from political action, and they exist in one form or another wherever societies are found.
<p>	Still, in America these local, prepolitical institutions had a special vitality. That vitality was nourished by the political institutions of the country. Now that those institutions have changed, the local institutions of America have diminished in strength. Major social-service charities are worried that, under block grants, they will not get as much money from the states as they have been receiving from the federal government. These same charities do not, as a rule, provide actual direct help to the poor. Rather they assist the federal government in providing those services. Here, then, are "local and voluntary institutions" that are not really local and not really voluntary. Their character has been altered by a change in national politics.
<p>	When local institutions thrived in America, they did so under the influence of a great principle at the heart of the nation's politics. According to this principle, we are equal in our rights, and not to be governed except by our consent. Our citizenship itself operates under this principle of equality, a principle announced in the first organic law of the United States. It is a principle not of local but of national scope, a principle authoritative not because it was adopted by a town or even by a country, but known to every man who is rational. In America, local and voluntary institutions operate beneath the shelter of high national principles.
<p>	Conservatives rightly think that religion should play a larger part on the public stage, for religion has been a vital component of American citizenship from the beginning. Tocqueville observed that "there is no country in the world where the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than in America." Liberty is vital to religion, he wrote, and religion in turn is vital to liberty:
<p><blockquote>	"Liberty regards religion as its companion in all its battles and its triumphs, as the cradle of its infancy and the divine source of its claims. It considers religion as the safeguard of morality, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of the duration of freedom."
</blockquote><p>

	But it is important to learn from the Founders about how to speak of religion. The Founders were absolutely at ease with a civic acknowledgment of the Deity and its implication for citizenship. But they spoke in the language of reason as well as of revelation. The preachers of the Revolution spoke often and strongly about morality, both in public places and in their churches. In so doing, they addressed their countrymen not as parishioners simply, but also as fellow citizens. Take for example the words of Samuel West, a preacher and a member of the convention that wrote the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780:<p><blockquote>
	"The most perfect freedom consists in obeying the dictates of right reason, and submitting to natural law. When a man goes beyond or contrary to the law of nature and reason, he becomes the slave of base passions and vile lusts; he introduces confusion and disorder into society, and brings misery and destruction upon himself. This, therefore, cannot be called a state of freedom, but a state of the vilest slavery and the most dreadful bondage. The servants of sin and corruption are subjected to the worst kind of tyranny in the universe. Hence we conclude that where licentiousness begins, liberty ends."
</blockquote>	

<p>If we wish to emulate our Founders in our efforts to restore religion to the public square, we must do it in this way. This way is stronger than the appeal many religious conservatives put in its place today. It is stronger because it makes its claims upon an argument and evidence that applies to all, and not only those who are blessed with faith in the person of their Maker. While it supports that faith, and lays the ground for it, this way begins with reason, the faculty that perceives the natural law -- the basis of citizenship in our Founding.
<p>	The Founders were also conscious of the limitations citizenship places on religion. Consider the words of George Washington in a letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island:<p><blockquote>
	"It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support."</blockquote><p>
	Religious liberty, Washington argued, is central to the American conception of citizenship. American citizenship is open to people of any faith or creed. Liberty -- the freedom to use one's property, to pray to one's God, to speak one's mind -- sets a limit upon politics that is inviolable.
<p>	At the same time, the basis of liberty sets a limit upon something more than politics. It sets a limit also upon what properly may be called religion. Religion is free in America from all oppression, and yet those who practice it must live under a political guideline. They must "demean themselves as good citizens." Nor is this standard simply a negative or passive requirement. Citizens must give their country "on all occasions their effectual support."
<p>	Citizenship, then, provides a standard against which religion itself must be measured. True enough, citizens may be exempted from military service if their religion requires it, yet the rules of justice that underlie citizenship can be enforced even in the face of a claim of religious protection. If, for example, the Davidians at Waco had been abusing their children, even if they were doing so in the name of God, then the use of force to extract those children would have been justified.
<p>	One "cannot say that people have a right to do wrong," said Abraham Lincoln, that great student of the Declaration and the Founders. If we know what is right, then we may with justice require right from others under the law. We may with justice expect a man who pledges his faith to a woman to keep that faith, a man who fathers a child to provide for that child, a man who is a citizen to fight for his country. The country is on the side of the citizen who does his duty. It belongs to that citizen; he and his fellows are sovereign in it. In return for their liberty, which the government does not give them but helps them to protect, they have obligations that they are bound to discharge.
<p>	I have described the attentive and pliable citizen who is the hallmark and aim of the modern, liberal regime. Another kind of citizen is implied in the heritage that comes to us from our forefathers. This is a citizenship that responds to the bidding of the natural law and human equality. Americans take up more space, speak more directly, and stand their ground more assertively than people in most other places. An American is more likely to start a business, to give to charity, and to care for his community.
<p>	 Such a citizen has been shaped by hammer blows and the sting of the sword. These were the blows of the American Revolution and the wars that have come since. They were fought in the name of a faith and a creed that applies to all and is at the same time special to us. Winston Churchill, the son of an American mother, regarded the American people as the new great people of the earth, standing beside the Greeks and the Romans and the British among the leaders of mankind. When he cited the great documents that have secured the liberties of the English-speaking peoples, he did it on the Fourth of July. He named the Declaration of Independence as the greatest of them all, knowing full well that it covered all men, whatever tongue they spoke.
<p>	If private action is to do its job again in our country, it must not be seen as a private realm alone. Uniquely in our country, the rules that guide a private citizen, as he cares for his family, and works at his job, and serves his community, are the same rules that inspire the form and purpose of government. For that reason, the restoration of the private realm to its full vitality and decency requires the recovery of the ideas that form the basis for our politics. We must once again hold certain truths to be self-evident. We must meet the challenge that those truths lay before us.

<p><li>Politicians mostly circumspect concerning <b>O. J. Simpson's</b> acquittal. Only<b> Pat Buchanan</b> condemned 
verdict. President<b> Bill Clinton</b> issued a statement: ``Our system of justice requires respect for the decision. 
At this moment, our thoughts and prayers should be with the families of the victims of this terrible crime.'' 
<b>Bob Dole's</b> statement told Americans: ``It is very important at this time that we use all our energies to find 
ways to understand each other and bring us together.''<b> Phil Gramm</b> deemed it inappropriate ``for a member 
of the Senate to be commenting on jury trials.'' <b>Colin Powell</b> said that the trial showed that the judicial 
system works and called on the country ``to move on.'' Also for moving on:<b> Lamar Alexander, Jack Kemp.</b> 
Gov. <b>Pete Wilson</b> said he ``would urge the removal of cameras from our courtrooms.''<b> Jesse Jackson</b> urged 
Simpson to lead the fight against domestic violence. . . . Even editorialists declined to judge the jury. New 
York Times faulted the police, prosecution, and Judge<b> Lance Ito</b> for ``bungling,'' and the defense for making 
``a prejudicial appeal,'' but took no position on the verdict. Not going out on a limb: the Washington Post, 
which noted that the acquittal ``stunned and disappointed'' some people but ``satisfied'' others. . . . Coverage 
of O.J. and racial division by the media fueled more talk about Powell. <b>Charles Krauthammer</b> argues that 
though a President Powell would prevent major reform of the welfare state, he would improve race 
relations. 
 
<p><li>White House is in an upbeat mood, buoyed by rising poll ratings and convinced that Republicans will field 
weak candidate next year. Clinton's strategy, which advisor<b> Dick Morris</b> calls ``triangulation,'' seeks to 
position him as a centrist, between congressional Republicans and Democrats.<b> Ann Devroy</b> (Washington 
Post) writes, ``Clinton's message that he is for the popular things Republicans favor -- like a balanced 
budget -- but against the unpopular things they propose -- like cutting Medicare -- is beginning to take.'' . . . 
Not all Democrats enthusiastic about the new strategy. Asked on Meet the Press to choose between Dole 
and Clinton, Sen.<b> Daniel Patrick Moynihan</b> (D., N.Y.) responded, ``I would rather have as President 
someone not running for the Presidency.'' Moynihan has clashed with White House recently over welfare 
and his proposal to save billions by reducing estimates of inflation. . . . Vice President<b> Al Gore</b> calls 
Republicans ``extremists,'' Clinton accuses them of raising taxes (actually Medicare deductibles, college-
loan fees, etc.) on the needy. Attacks led Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole to call off budget talks for now -- 
though Dole jokes that Gore's ``extremist'' talk ``may help me in some of the early primaries.'' . . . More 
tough budget talk from both sides: Clinton declares, ``I would gladly, gladly terminate my tenure here if the 
price of continuing it was just shelving everything I believe in about this country.'' Gramm says, ``He can 
hold us in session until the Second Coming and there is no possibility that I am ever going to spend one 
nickel above the level . . . in our budget.'' 
 
<p><li>Republican presidential candidates hold forum in New Hampshire. Comments Washington Post editorial: 
``Judging from what was said . . . the ideal President is someone who: 1) never had anything to do with the 
Federal Government in Washington, D.C.; 2) never set foot in Washington; 3) never even met someone who 
set foot in Washington; 4) never even voted to send someone else to Washington; 5) and wouldn't, if 
elected, even move to Washington.'' Alexander repeated call to ``cut their pay and send them home,'' Dole 
deflected questions about his age with good humor, </b>Bob Dornan</b> praised all the other candidates, Gramm 
softened his image by talking about his humble beginnings and his marriage. Focusing on tax reform were 
<b>Steve Forbes, Richard Lugar,</b> and<b> Arlen Specter</b>, while<b> Alan Keyes</b> continued to stress primacy of moral 
issues. . . . Pete Wilson's departure from presidential race leads to Dole endorsements by conservative Calif. 
Attorney General<b> Dan Lungren</b>, Calif. ex-Gov.<b> George Deukmejian</b>, and ex-co-chairman of RNC<b> Jeanie 
Austin</b>. 
 
<p><li>Gramm, seeking Cuban-American support, opposes Dole on English language, demands that<b> Fidel Castro</b> 
be barred from attending UN's fiftieth anniversary next month: ``The only purpose that we should allow 
Fidel Castro into America for is to put him in prison or to hang him. And frankly, I believe the people of 
Cuba should have first right to exercise either or both of those options.'' . . . Campaign memo by Gramm 
pollster<b> Linda DiVall</b>, leaked to press, summarizes focus-group results: ``Knowledge void on Gramm is still 
immense. . . Women were totally confused on his position on affirmative action and abortion.'' (He's against 
both.) . . . Buchanan warns that if Powell ``became the nominee and tried to make us a pro-abortion, pro-
gun-control, pro-affirmative-action party which celebrated New Deal and Great Society programs, then 
there will be an explosion in San Diego [convention] and I would fight him with everything I had.'' . . . It 
now looks unlikely that Perot's party will get on Calif. ballot. 
 
<p><li>Wall Street Journal quotes salon owner<b> Jordan Ferraro</b> on why more women are dyeing their hair red: ``I 
equate this with the fact that the Cold War has ended. The phrase, `Better dead than Red' has passed from 
our consciousness. . . . We're allowed now emotionally to become red.''

<hr><P>
<i>What would have happened if the Founding Fathers had tried to
draft the Declaration of Independence today with a lawyer from
the American Civil Liberties Union on the committee....</i>
<hr width="50%">
</center><P>
JOHN ADAMS: Gentlemen, let us pray that the Almighty will grant
us wisdom in the wording of this document and in setting the course
for this new nation.
<P>
ACLU: I object! God has no place in government!
<P>
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN: Sir, to forbid the rightful acknowledgment
of God in the affairs of state would be an abridgment of the religious
freedom we came to this country to enjoy.
<P>
THOMAS JEFFERSON: Religion is the foundation of all just government.
Our laws have their source and their authority in the Bible. Don't
we need wisdom and His blessing? The Bible says, &quot;The fear
of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom&quot; and &quot;Blessed
is the nation whose God is the Lord.&quot;
<P>
ACLU: Don't forget that it was abuses by a state religion that
were partly responsible for bringing us to this point of separation
from England.
<P>
JEFFERSON: We need separation of church and state to prevent the
church from controlling the state, or the state the church--not
to prevent the church from civilizing the state and holding it
morally accountable.
<P>
ACLU: You are imposing your belief in God on me! I'm an atheist!
<P>
ADAMS: Whether you are an atheist or not does not affect God's
existence. Oh, very well. Those who wish to may privately and
individually acknowledge God's ruling in our lives.
<P>
Now, Mr. Jefferson will read us the Declaration of Independence,
subject to our revisions.
<P>
JEFFERSON: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal--'
<P>
ACLU: Objection! 'Truths' is a relative term. What's true for
you may not be true for me. And creation is a religious concept.
<P>
ADAMS: Then let us amend that statement to read, 'We hold these
opinions to be self-evident, to some, that all men are equal--'
<P>
ACLU: Sexist!
<P>
ADAMS: How about 'all persons are equal'?
<P>
ACLU: Better. But I'd prefer, 'all races, genders and lifestyles
are Equal--'
<P>
FRANKLIN: 'lifestyles'? What are lifestyles'?
<P>
ACLU: Sexual preference: adultery, homosexuality, prostitution,
pedophilia--
<P>
FRANKLIN: I pray our nation never--
<P>
ACLU; If you people persist in your references to prayer, I'll
seek a court injunction.
<P>
ADAMS: Order! Order! Gentlemen! Mr. Jefferson, please continue!
<P>
JEFFERSON: '--That all lifestyles, etc., are equal and that all
persons find themselves possessing certain arguably inalienable
rights, that among these are life--'
<P>
ACLU: Objection! Infringes on a woman's right to reproductive
choice.
<P>
JEFFERSON: '. . . liberty and the pursuit of happiness'
<P>
FRANKLIN: This doesn't even make sense! How can people have 'rights'
which are not granted by anyone? How can those who do not have
a right to life profit from their rights to liberty and the pursuit
of happiness?
<P>
I move we kick this lawyer out of the meeting!
<P>
ACLU: Objection! Violation of the first amendment to the Constitution:
my right to free speech.
<P>
ADAMS: What is the Constitution?
<P>
ACLU: Freedom of speech extends not only to political dissidents,
such as ourselves, but to moral relativists, and to those who
may in the future seek to destroy what we are now building.
<P>
FRANKLIN: God forbid!
<P>
ACLU: Freedom of religion means that moral values can have no
influence on public life.
<P>
ADAMS: But that is nonsense! This would mean that our public prayers
would violate the laws of the nation we are in the process of
creating.
<P>
ACLU: That's what the Supreme Court will say!
<P>
FRANKLIN: If that's how you people are going to interpret it,
I hope to God we never do draft it.
<P>
ADAMS: Gentlemen, we seem to be deadlocked. Every attempt on the
part of men of good will to establish this nation seems to be
actively thwarted by the lawyer from the ACLU. The revolution
is hereby cancelled. <P>

<title>Norman's Conquest -- Fall 1995 Policy Review</title>

<h3>A Commentary on the Podhoretz Legacy</h3>

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>Mark Gerson</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>

<p>

	In the early 1960s, the great Columbia professor and literary critic Lionel Trilling warned of the impending "Norman Invasion." He was talking about three brash and brilliant young stars of the literary worldNorman O. Brown, Norman Mailer, and Norman Podhoretz. A generation later, no one recalls Norman O. Brown, and Norman Mailer will be remembered as an unharnessed genius. Of Trilling's invaders, one has conquered: Norman Podhoretz.
<p>	 William, the great Norman conqueror of 1066, left behind the glorious Bayeux Tapestry detailing the story of his invasion of England. Despite two world wars and countless smaller ones, the tapestry remains with us. Norman Podhoretz has left us not a tapestry, but 412 issues of <i>Commentary</i>, which <i>The Economist</i> once called "the best magazine in the world." Podhoretz served as its editor in chief from February 1960 until May of this year. These were the years and this was the magazine in which neoconservatism -- one of the most important political movements of this century -- was conceived, developed, and eventually blossomed.
<p>	What hath Norman Podhoretz wrought? Three extraordinary contributions to our intellectual culture stand out. First, Podhoretz and his <i>Commentary</i> writers were the intellectual force behind Ronald Reagan's Cold War battles. Their ideas, harnessed by a gifted statesman and backed by a strong and capable military, helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union and the intellectual delegitimation of Third World and anti-Zionist politics.<p>
	Another legacy of <i>Commentary</i> is evident in today's debate over affirmative action. Podhoretz and his writers, strong supporters of the civil-rights movement in the 1960s, have maintained a steadfast opposition to racial classifications or preferences throughout their careers. When the honorable movement of Martin Luther King Jr. veered into a realm of quotas, racial preferences, and social engineering, Podhoretz stood firm. <i>Commentary</i> authors identified the grave moral weaknesses of affirmative action before anyone else, warning that quotas betrayed the promise of civil rights and victimized their intended beneficiaries. Present-day opponents of quotas often sound like they are quoting from Commentary articles written two decades ago.
<p>	The same can be said about discussions regarding what Lionel Trilling called the "adversary culture" -- opponents of middle-class values whose influence spreads far beyond the college campuses where the critics flourish. While many Americans once tolerated these people, praising their "idealism," Podhoretz and the neoconservatives saw them as destructive, nihilistic, and ultimately dangerous. Rare for intellectuals, the neoconservatives celebrated the prosaic and unromantic culture of the ordinary American. In so doing, they provided bourgeois culture with the intellectual self-confidence to stand up against those whom most now recognize as cultural barbarians.
<p>
<b>Beginnings</b><p>
	Born in 1930, Podhoretz was raised in a lapsed Orthodox Jewish home in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at Columbia University. There he became the protg of Lionel Trilling and distinguished himself as one of the brightest literary minds of his generation. After graduate studies at Cambridge University, Podhoretz served for two years in the United States Army before returning home to assume a position as an assistant editor of <i>Commentary</i> -- a job that Trilling had arranged for him. While at <i>Commentary</i>, Podhoretz wrote prolifically, publishing in nearly every New York magazine of note. In present-day discussions of neoconservatism, it is often said that Podhoretz (and the other neoconservatives) are refugees from the Left who, in reaction to the 1960s counterculture, moved rightward. Although Podhoretz was a liberal in that he supported the New Deal and civil rights, his work in the 1950s demonstrates how that observation reveals far more about changes in liberalism than changes in Podhoretz.
<p>	While the topics of Podhoretz's essays in the 1950s ranged from William Faulkner to nuclear war, they reveal the skepticism of a serious critic inclined to doubt any simple answers to social, political, and literary questions. Rejecting the rationalist and utopian themes of liberalism, Podhoretz had a great appreciation for the commonplace and the prosaic. In a 1957 essay, Podhoretz indicted liberalism for being unable to "take a sufficiently complicated view of reality." Liberalism was "a conglomeration of attitudes suitable only to the naive, the callow, the rash: in short, the immature. Its view of the world was seen to be an undignified, indeed dangerous philosophy for the leading nation in the West to entertain."
<p>	In "The Know-Nothing Bohemians," a seminal 1958 essay in <i>Partisan Review</i>, Podhoretz focused his attack on what he regarded as an exceptionally naive, callow, and immature group of leftists -- the Beats, a group of literary intellectuals centered in Greenwich Village who were attaining increasing prominence in American letters. Podhoretz charged that the Beats' disdain for traditional, middle-class morality translated into a dangerous nihilism, "the revolution of the spiritually underprivileged and the crippled of soul -- young men who can't think straight and so hate anyone who can." For Podhoretz, the message of their animosity toward private property and the middle class was clear: "Kill the intellectuals who can talk coherently, kill the people who can sit still for five minutes at a time, kill those incomprehensible characters who are capable of getting seriously involved with a woman, a job, a cause."
<p>
<b>The Implosion of Liberalism
</b><p>

	In 1959, Podhoretz was named the editor in chief of <i>Commentary</i>, but he did not take up arms against the nihilists right away. In keeping with the zeitgeist of the times, he flirted with the Left. He opened the pages of <i>Commentary</i> to writers supporting the peace movement and radical cultural critics like Paul Goodman, who wrote of the "beautiful cultural consequences" that would follow from legalizing pornography. Podhoretz upset many people with his movement toward the Left -- namely Lionel Trilling and Irving Kristol -- but maintained his connections to the traditional liberal community as well.
<p>	The Vietnam War proved a pivotal event in the development of Podhoretz's thought, but not in the way it would for so many others of his generation. Podhoretz opposed military intervention in Vietnam, and under his stewardship, <i>Commentary</i> was the first magazine to seriously consider the war and its potential ramifications. His opposition was always on tactical grounds; he maintained simply that it was a conflict from which the United States could not emerge victorious. To Podhoretz, this one error of the United States did not change the fact that communism and the Soviet Union were evil, and did not suggest any fundamental flaws in the American way of life. The Left and the counterculture, on the other hand, used the war to impugn American institutions like the family and the university.
<p>	So while Podhoretz opposed the war, his opposition to the antiwar movement was more intense and ultimately more important. His position was barely represented in the intellectual community. He saw liberal intellectuals, colleagues whom he respected and trusted, fail to criticize increasingly militant student protesters. Whatever the students did -- even when radicals at Columbia urinated on the carpet in the office of university president Grayson Kirk -- liberal professors praised the "idealism" of the students and excused their tactics as the excesses of youthful exuberance. Podhoretz's wife, the noted writer Midge Decter, recalls the student takeover at Columbia University. She was at a party of New York intellectuals, and criticized the students who had overturned files and destroyed a professor's life's work. Dwight MacDonald, a major figure on the New York intellectual scene for 25 years, responded, "Obviously, you care more about material values than human values."<p>
	This incident was emblematic of what Podhoretz, Decter, and their allies identified as a major crisis in liberalism. Though the term "neoconservatism" was not coined until the early 1970s -- by the socialist Michael Harrington -- it is used now to describe the New York intellectuals and their compatriots who opposed the counterculture and its various permutations. What Podhoretz had called in 1957 "a conglomeration of attitudes suitable only to the naive, the callow, the rash" imploded 10 years later. Unable or unwilling to define and protect its principles against the radical onslaught, liberalism self-destructed as a coherent, governing philosophy -- with devastating effects on its key institutional expressions: the university and the government. Though he was not yet a conservative, Podhoretz became as effective a critic of the Left as anyone on the Right. Many arguments that we now regard as staples of conservatism originated in the pages of <i>Commentary</i> 20 years ago. An example is political correctness: Though the term was not coined until the 1980s, it was best described in a 1973 <i>Commentary</i> article called "The New Inquisitors," written by Podhoretz himself:
<p><blockquote>

	"The upshot is an atmosphere which is no longer conducive to fearless inquiry or even to playful speculation and which, far from encouraging, positively obstructs the development of independence of mind and of the critical spirit. Thus do our colleges and universities continue their degenerative mutation from sanctuaries for free discussion into inquisitorial agents of a dogmatic secular faith."
</blockquote><p>

	Though Podhoretz and several others -- especially James Q. Wilson, whose 1972 <i>Commentary</i> article, "Liberalism Versus Liberal Education," explains perfectly the crisis in higher education today -- tried to protect the university, they saw that their task was virtually hopeless. The university was liberalism's home turf, and was the first casualty of the liberal implosion. The issue to which Norman Podhoretz and <i>Commentary</i> dedicated most of their ideological firepower was the legacy of the civil rights movement: affirmative action and quotas.
<p>	Originally conceived by President Kennedy, affirmative action was designed to encourage institutions to make a concerted effort to be inclusive of all people. Podhoretz always supported this. In his 1979 memoirs, Breaking Ranks, Podhoretz recalled saying when the debate had begun earlier in that decade that "I supported special efforts to recruit qualified blacks and that I also supported special efforts to help unqualified blacks compete on an equal footing." But affirmative action had soon become a series of programs and benefits intended to give preference to people based upon their race, and, over time, upon their ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation as well. And, to Podhoretz, this violated a crucial tenet of his liberalism -- that an individual should not be judged on the basis of an involuntary characteristic. Consequently, Podhoretz made <i>Commentary</i> the intellectual center of opposition to affirmative action. Throughout the 1970s, <i>Commentary</i> attacked affirmative action from every angle.

<p>
	<i>Commentary</i> authors were among the first to argue that those who would suffer the most from affirmative action programs would be the intended beneficiaries; that those not slated to "benefit" from affirmative action would react bitterly when a member of a preferred group received an admissions slot or a job on the basis of race or another superfluous category; and that those "minorities" in the institutions would constantly feel the need to prove themselves worthy, to demonstrate that they were not a "quota hire." As Michael Novak noted in a 1976 <i>Commentary</i> article, "If you grant no responsibility or hope for their own advancement to blacks, but treat their needs as in every respect due to a form of victimization, then no one calls you a racist; you are regarded, instead, as a friend to blacks. 'Don't blame the victim' is the slogan of such friendship. But if, on the other hand, you assert that blacks are equal to whites in potency, moral spirit, dignity, responsibility, and power over their own future, and deny that they are mere pawns and victims, then you set off a chorus of alarums and find yourself on treacherous emotional territory."
<p>
<b>The Failure of Nerve</b>
<p>	After the American defeat in Vietnam, Podhoretz saw this same shifting of responsibility that liberalism had come to embody on the international scene. Podhoretz believed the Vietnam War was a major tactical blunder, but America's misfortune should not serve as a precedent. America was the same great, powerful, and responsible nation that she was when she embarked on this mistaken path. And when the United States had to become engaged militarily in the future, she should do so with a clear conscience and with strength of will.
<p>	This was not so easily done. The Vietnam War had taken quite a toll on the American people: As Midge Decter explained in a 1976 <i>Commentary</i> symposium, "Defeat (and it is a tribute to something that one should feel impelled to remind on this point) is not good for people. And it is no better for nations than for individuals. It humiliates, raises doubts, heightens acrimony, increases recourse to tricky euphemism, and stirs up all those lurking and treacherously seductive fantasies of escape. Most of all, it paralyzes, and once again does so no less to nations than to individuals."
<p>	In the wake of the defeat in Vietnam, Podhoretz worried about what he called "a failure of nerve" triggering "a culture of appeasement." The Soviet Union was as evil as ever, gobbling up nations and subjecting them to totalitarian terror. As he wrote in <i>Commentary</i> in 1976, the Soviet Union is "the most determined, ferocious and barbarous enemy ever to have appeared on the earth." Podhoretz resurrected the argument that Communism is morally equivalent to Nazism; in fact more dangerous in one respect -- intellectuals and their young charges had never been attracted to Nazism. 
<p>	 How to stop Soviet aggression? Only the United States would have the power to do so, and effective resistance would demand not only substantial resources but a will to win. And in the mid-1970s, following Vietnam, Podhoretz was worried that such a will did not exist. "While the Soviet Union engages in the most massive military buildup in the history of the world, we haggle over every weapon. We treat our own military leaders as though they were wearing the uniform of a foreign power. Everything they tell us about our military needs is greeted with hostility." Podhoretz savaged anyone who stood in the way of this American effort. That included not only the political and intellectual Left, but the business community as well: Corporate moguls were all too ready to sacrifice anti-communist principle for the profits in trading and dealing with America's totalitarian enemies. Self-indulgence on the Right was, according to Podhoretz, just as bad as self-indulgence on the Left. Two books he published in this period, <i>The Present Danger</i> and <i>Why We Were in Vietnam</i>, sought to establish the righteousness of the anticommunist cause, and the moral and military readiness of the United States to prosecute it.
<p>	In addition to his own writing, Podhoretz published many important articles on these subjects. Especially notable were Richard Pipes's work on the Soviet Union and Robert Tucker's essays on the danger posed by the oil-producing states. But the most significant essay he published during that period was Jeane Kirkpatrick's "Dictatorships and Double Standards," in November 1979. Kirkpatrick wrote that anticommunism should be the priority of American foreign policy, even if that meant making alliances with nondemocratic, authoritarian governments. Communist governments were worse than noncommunist authoritarian governments because the former destroy civil society and ruin the lives of all of their inhabitants.
<p>	"Dictatorships and Double Standards" was widely read: One prominent reader was Ronald Reagan, then running for president. He expressed his admiration for Kirkpatrick, and later appointed her U.S. ambassador to the United Nations when he became president. Kirkpatrick used her position as a bully pulpit from which to defend American values and interests and to excoriate its enemies in the Communist bloc and the Third World.
<p>	Kirkpatrick was not the first <i>Commentary</i> writer to defend Podhoretz's ideals from the floor of the United Nations. In the 1970s, there was no place where the ideas of communism -- or at least the idea that communism was no worse than American democracy -- were more prevalent than in the United Nations. Often combined with virulent anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, the Soviet Union and its Third World charges passed resolutions blasting the West and the Jews. And the West, by and large, had little to say in response. At least, until Norman Podhoretz gained influence in that body. In 1975, Podhoretz published a remarkable essay by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, "The United States in Opposition," calling upon the West to take up the war of ideas with the pernicious forces of the Soviet Union and the Third World. This article also was widely read -- Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called to congratulate its author -- and President Gerald Ford responded by appointing Moynihan ambassador to the United Nations. 
<p>	Moynihan took the job in 1975, at the height of the anti-Semitism and anti-Western sentiment in the U.N. The United States could not have found a better man to respond to the virulent ideological challenge being put forth by her enemies. In November 1975, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin took to the floor of the United Nations to deliver one of the most anti-Semitic speeches given since Hitler. Maintaining that "the United States of America has been colonized by the Zionists who hold all the tools of development and power," Amin called upon the United States to "rid their society of the Zionists," and for the United Nations to pursue the "extinction of Israel as a state." The United Nations delegates responded with a standing ovation, and the accompanying resolution that he sponsored -- "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination" -- passed easily. A majority of the nations of the world had, in the very institution that was once the hope of liberalism in the wake of Nazism, passed a resolution that Hitler could have offered, and did so with a fervor Hitler would have admired. A response was needed, and Ambassador Moynihan turned to his old editor for advice.
<p>	Podhoretz drafted most of the speech with which Moynihan responded. It was a moving address, one that sent shock waves through the United Nations and upset countless liberals. That speech, and the events leading up to it, are masterfully recounted in Moynihan's memoirs of his service at the United Nations, <i>A Dangerous Place</i>, which is dedicated to Norman Podhoretz and Leonard Garment. Moynihan became so popular in New York as a result of that speech that he was catapulted to the United States Senate in 1976, with Norman Podhoretz as one of his principal advisors.
<p>	By the end of the 1970s, liberalism had, in the mind of Norman Podhoretz, become so corrupted that there was no longer any place for him in it or in the Democratic Party. Although Podhoretz did not resign from the Democratic Party, he voted for Ronald Reagan -- the first time he voted Republican in a presidential election. But he had good reason to do so; Ronald Reagan and his staff took the ideas in <i>Commentary</i> very seriously, and <i>The Present Danger</i> was required reading in the Reagan campaign.
<p>	While Reagan's stance toward Communism and Israel were the main reasons for Podhoretz's support, Podhoretz had also become more conservative on domestic issues. Midge Decter calls an aversion to capitalism "the last vestige of our liberalism," and they were supporters of capitalism by 1981 when Podhoretz published "The New Defenders of Capitalism" in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. In that article he wrote:<p><blockquote>
	"[Capitalism] is a necessary, if not a sufficient, condition of freedom; it is both a necessary and a sufficient condition of wealth; it provides a better chance than any known alternative for the most widespread sharing in the wealth it produces."
</blockquote><p>

	His support for capitalism deepened throughout the decade, as he published important pieces on the subject by its great celebrators George Gilder and Michael Novak. Podhoretz also saw clearly the failures of the welfare state, and opened his pages to thinkers like Charles Murray, who diagnosed its brutal unintended consequences. He also maintained an assault on affirmative action; indeed, Thomas Sowell's December 1989 essay, "Affirmative Action: A Worldwide Disaster," may be the best critique of quotas ever penned.
<p>	But his prime area of interest remained foreign policy. Though many of his contributors, friends, and relatives (notably his son-in-law Elliott Abrams) served in high positions in the Reagan administration, Podhoretz harshly criticized the president for capitulating to the Soviets. His 1982 <i>New York Times Magazine</i> article, "The Neoconservative Anguish over Reagan's Foreign Policy," makes this case quite succinctly. Podhoretz detected Reagan's tendency, as George Will put it, to love commerce more than loathe communism -- and make deals with the Soviets when his corporate constituency thought that doing so would yield a profit. Podhoretz stated boldly that America's most important responsibility was to fight the evil of communism.
<p>
<b>Fighter for the Right </b><p>
	After those 412 issues of <i>Commentary</i>, what has Norman Podhoretz taught us? Several important lessons. He has taught us that everything we treasure is fragile, and needs constant attention and defense. The implosion of liberalism in the 1960s is destroying our university system. The ideas of Martin Luther King Jr. were bastardized into support for race-based preferences that are anathema to the central liberal principle that people should be judged on their individual merits.
<p>	Leftism took over liberalism because Leftists never forgot, as others did, that ideas -- not economic interests, not social arrangements -- rule the world. Podhoretz has constantly reminded us of this truth, when he stressed that freedom could only be preserved if America had the will to defend it herself, when he bore witness to the original tenets of the civil-rights movement, when he scored communism and supported Israel. In his valedictory statement in the June 1995 issue of <i>Commentary</i>, Podhoretz quotes Theodore Roosevelt. "Aggressive fighting for the right is the noblest sport the world affords." Podhoretz has spent a long and fruitful career fighting for the right, and we are all indebted to him for it.

<h3>How Nurses Can Help Relieve Spiraling Heath-Care Costs</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>
	Medicare isn't the only part of America's health-care system where costs are spiraling out of control. Doctors have created a cartel by confining the delivery of treatment solely to M.D.s and by regulating the number and activities of M.D.s. This suppresses the supply of health-care professionals, raising costs and reducing choice. State governments could significantly lower both public and private health-care costs by reducing physicians' stranglehold over medical care and moving towards a freer market. For its part, the federal government could, if it is willing to use its vast power under the commerce clause of the Constitution, preempt state rules that hamper the cost-effective delivery of medical services.<p>	The Clinton administration recognized the problem of supply, but sought to remedy it by manipulating federal funding to force more doctors to become general practitioners. Similarly, the Council on Graduate Medical Education has urged educational changes to change the ratio of primary-care physicians to specialists from 30:70 to 50:50 by the year 2040.<p>	The critical question, however, is not what percentage of doctors should provide primary care, but who should be allowed to provide primary care. Doctors are not the only professionals qualified to treat patients, yet most states needlessly restrict the activities of advanced-practice nurses (A.P.N.s) (who include nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse anesthetists), registered nurses (R.N.s), licensed practical nurses (L.P.N.s), physicians assistants (P.A.s), nurse's aides, and similar professionals. Even today, these providers dramatically outnumber doctorsthere are 2.2 million R.N.s, three times the number of M.D.s, and nearly 1 million L.P.N.s alone, while the number of A.P.N.s, at well over 100,000, is about half the number of physicians providing primary care. Ellen Sanders, a vice-president of the American Nurses Association, estimates that 300,000 R.N.s could become A.P.N.s with an additional year or tw
o of training.<p>	Although A.P.N.s, R.N.s, and L.P.N.s are capable of handling many simple and routine health care procedures, most states, at the behest of physicians, allow only M.D.s to perform "medical acts." According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, "You have highly trained people doing things that could be done by others." Doctors perform what A.P.N.s could do, A.P.N.s do what registered nurses could handle, and registered nurses handle what nurse's aides could perform. "I can take care of a patient who has broken an arm," complains Maddy Wiley, a nurse practitioner in Washington state, "treat them from top to bottom, but I can't give them an adequate painkiller." Instead, patients can receive such treatment only through the government-created doctors' oligopoly, into which entry is tightly restricted. Observes Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute: "In most states, nurse practitioners cannot treat a patient without direct physician supervision. Chiropractors cannot order blood tests or CAT scans. Nurses, psychologists, pharmacists, and other practitioners cannot prescribe even the most basic medications."<p>	The problem is exacerbated by the nature of the medical marketplace, where the expansion of services is expensive. Much of the necessary capital already exists -- there are, for instance, a lot of unfilled hospital beds. The practice of medicine, however, has become increasingly labor intensive. The National Center for Policy Analysis figures that, because of the high cost of training medical personnel, "moving capital and labor from other sectors requires a price increase for medical services that is six times higher than that needed to expand other goods and services." As a result, the NCPA estimates, 57 cents of every additional dollar in U.S. medical expenditures is eaten away by higher prices rather than added services.<p>	Physicians have shown unyielding resistance to alternative professionals. Medical societies have tried to prev
ent chiropractors, for instance, from gaining privileges at local hospitals. M.D.s have similarly opposed osteopaths and podiatrists. Working through state legislatures, physicians have won statutory protection from competition. Many states ban midwives from handling deliveries. Optometrists are usually barred from such simple acts as prescribing eye drops. Half of the states permit only physicians to perform acupuncture. Overregulation of pharmaceuticals, which prevents patients from self-medicating, also acts as a limit on health-care competition. Allowing over-the-counter sales of penicillin, for instance, could save patients about $1 billion annually.<p>	A recent episode in Georgia illustrates the arbitrariness of most occupational licensure regulations. According to Tanner, state legislation was introduced at the behest of dentists to prevent dental hygienists from cleaning teeth. Then an amendment was added for the ophthalmologists to bar optometrists from performing laser eye surgery. In the end, the bill prohibited anyone but physicians, veterinarians, podiatrists, and dentists from performing any procedure that pierced the skin, effectively outlawing nurses from drawing blood or giving injections. This unintended outcome would have brought most hospitals to a halt, and a court had to block its enforcement. Examples abound of legal restrictions promoted by self-serving professionals and harmful to consumers. In general, professional licensure has reduced the number of potential caregivers, cut the time spent with patients, and raised prices.<p>	The second manifestation of physicians' monopoly power is the anticompetitive restrictions that the profession places upon itself. The doctors' lobby has helped drive proprietary medical schools out of business, reduced the inflow of new M.D.s, and for years prevented advertising and discouraged members of local medical associations from joining prepaid plans. Until the early 1980s, the American Medical Association attempted to restrict walk-in clinics that adv
ertised themselves as providing "emergency" or "urgent" care. Explained John Coury, who was then chairman of the AMA, "Some of these facilities were set up by nonmedical people as money-making propositions" -- as if doctors don't seek to make money. Moreover, federal immigration law and state requirements limit the entry of foreign doctors into the country and often prevent them from finding work. None of these rules has much to do with consumer protection.<p>	Allowing nurses to provide services for which they are qualified would expand people's options, allowing patients to decide on the more cost-effective course of their treatment. Some states have begun to allow greater competition among health-care providers. Mississippi does not regulate the practice of P.A.s. Nearly half the states, including New York, already allow nurse practitioners to write at least some prescriptions, while a handful, such as Oregon and Washington, give A.P.N.s significant autonomy. The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services is encouraging the training of nurse-midwives.<p>	In this area, at least, the Clinton administration wanted to move in the right direction, pledging to "remove inappropriate barriers to practice." The Clinton proposal would have eliminated state laws that ban A.P.N.s from offering primary careprenatal services, immunizations, prescription of medication, treatment of common health problems, and management of chronic but standard conditions like asthma -- and to receive insurance reimbursement for such services. Even these modest efforts did not go unchallenged: The California Medical Association attacked the Clintons' proposal as "dangerous to the public's health," and an AMA report argued that expanding the role of nurses would hurt patients, fragment the delivery of care, and even raise costs.<p>	There is, however, no evidence that the public health would be threatened by allowing non-M.D.s to do more. Professionals should be allowed to perform work for which they are well trained -- witho
ut direct supervision by a doctor. At the very least, states should relax restrictions in regions, particularly rural areas, that have difficulty in attracting physicians. In this way, those with few health-care options could choose to seek treatment from professionals with less intensive training. A recent Gallup poll found that 86 percent of Americans would accept a nurse as their primary-care practitioner. Why not give them that option? Says Leah Binder of the National League of Nursing, "Let the 'invisible hand' determine how much it should cost to get a primary-care checkup."<p>	 Physicians assistants, for instance, receive two years of instruction to work directly for doctors and could perform an estimated 80 percent of the primary-care tasks conducted by doctors, such as taking medical histories, performing physical exams, and ordering tests. Similarly, the Office of Technology Assessment figures that nurses with advanced practices could provide 60 to 80 percent of the clinical services now reserved for doctors. Explains Arthur Caplan of the University of Minnesota, nurse practitioners are "an underutilized, untapped resource that could help reduce the cost of health care significantly." Len Nichols, a Wellesley economist, estimates that removing restrictions on A.P.N.s could save between $6.4 billion and $8.8 billion annually. Mary Mundinger, the dean of Columbia University's School of Nursing, contends that nurse practitioners have been providing primary care for decades and no research, even that conducted by doctors, has ever documented any problems.<p>	Lonnie Bristow, the chairman of the AMA, admits as much, but responds that those nurses were working under a doctor's supervision. But that supervision is often quite loose. Nurses regularly perform many simple aspects of primary care far more often than doctors and, as a result, are better qualified to handle them in the future, with or without the supervision of an M.D.<p>	None of the AMA's arguments withstands analysis. For instance, the officia
l AMA report claims that because nurses want to serve all populations and not just "underserved" groups in rural and inner-city areas, "there is virtually no evidence to support" the claim that empowering other medical professionals would improve access to care. But increasing the quantity of primary health-care providers would necessarily make additional medical professionals available to every area. Moreover, poor rural communities would likely be better able to afford the services of A.P.N.s, whose median salary nationwide is $43,600, than a general-practice M.D.s, with a median salary of $119,000. Even if allowing nurses to do more increased competition only in wealthier areas, it would thereby encourage some medical professionals, including doctors, to consider moving to underserved regions where the competition is less intense.<p>	The most compelling argument against relaxing restrictions on nurses is that Americans' health care might somehow suffer. "A nurse with four to six years of education after high school does not have the same training, experience, or knowledge base as a physician who has 11 to 16 years," complains Daniel Johnson, the Speaker of the AMA's House of Delegates. True enough, but so what? No one is suggesting that nurses do anything but the tasks nurses are trained to do. In fact, the OTA study judged A.P.N. care in a dozen medical areas to be better than that of M.D.s.<p>	The problem of occupational licensure is not confined to doctors. The nursing profession behaves the same way when it has a chance. Under severe cost pressures, hospitals have increasingly been relying on L.P.N.s, nurse's aides, and "patient-care assistants." The cost savings can be great: Nurses typically receive two to four times as much training as licensed practical nurses and command salaries 50 percent greater. Yet in many hospitals they still bathe and feed patients. Stanford University Hospital has saved $25 million over the last five years by reducing the share of R.N.s among patient-care employees from 90
 percent to 60 percent. The consulting firm of APM, Inc. claims that, since 1987, it has assisted 80 hospitals in saving some $1 billion. Alas, professional groups like the American Nurses Association have opposed these efforts.<p>	To bring competition to the medical profession, patients should also be allowed greater access to practitioners of unorthodox medicine. In 1990, a tenth of Americans -- primarily well-educated and middle- to upper-income -- went to chiropractors, herbal healers, massage therapists, and the like. Health insurance covered few such treatments. Some of these procedures may seem spurious, but then, practices like acupuncture were once regarded similarly before gaining credibility. The most important principle is to allow patients free choice to determine the medical treatments they wish to receive. This means relaxing legal restrictions on unconventional practitioners and creating a health-insurance system that would allow those inclined toward alternative treatments to acquire policies tailored to their preferences.<p>	Most important, states should address the obstacles to becoming and practicing as an M.D. This nation suffers from an artificial limit on physicians. Observes Andrew Dolan of the University of Washington, the argument that occupational licensing is necessary "to protect patients against shoddy care" is "unproven by almost any standard." Experience suggests that licensure reflects professional rather than consumer interests.<p>	At the least, states should eliminate the most anti-competitive aspects of the licensing framework, particularly barriers to qualifying as doctors and to competition. These include that power of doctors to control entry into their own profession and to restrict competitive practices. As the National Center for Policy Analysis's John Goodman and Gerald Musgrave explain, "Virtually every law designed to restrict the practice of medicine was enacted not on the crest of widespread public demand but because of intense pressure from the political repres
entatives of physicians." Although licensure is defended as necessary to protect patients, local medical societies spent years fighting practices (such as advertising, discounting, and prepaid plans) that served patients' interests, as well as imposing fixed-fee schedules on their members. No existing licensing requirement should escape critical review.<p>	More far-reaching reform proposals include substituting institutional licensure of hospitals and establishing a genuine free market in health care (backed by private certification and testing and continuing malpractice liability). Such approaches seem shocking today only in the context of the vast regulatory structure that has been erected over the years. If we are serious about increasing access to and reducing the expense of medical care, we should give careful consideration to full deregulation. Such steps would do much to achieve the Clinton administration's goal of encouraging more primary-care physicians and more physicians from racial minorities.<p>	The federal government shares some of the blame for clogging the pipeline of medical professionals, because its Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rules encourage needlessly large and over-trained medical staffs. Medicare, for instance, requires hospitals to use only licensed laboratory and radiological technicians, and engage a registered nurse to provide or supervise the nursing in every department. Only nurse practitioners operating in nursing homes or rural areas can be reimbursed under Medicare. Only 18 states allow Medicaid reimbursement for A.P.N.s. Non-hospital facilities such as community health centers, which play a particularly important role in poor and rural areas, also face tough staffing requirements. These sort of restrictions hamper the shift to less expensive outpatient services. With enough political will, the federal government could play a role in easing state licensure, just as the Federal Trade Commission fought professional strictures against advertising.<p>The collapse of the Cl
inton campaign for radical reform was welcome, but the American medical system still needs fixing. The supply side would be a good place to start. Rising costs require us to look for cost-effective alternative providers. Even more important: Patients should have the largest possible range of options when determining their health care. It's time to integrate the practice of medicine into the market economy. <p><b><a href="http://www.cato.org/main/bandow.html">DOUG BANDOW</a></B> <i>is a senior fellow at the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> and the author of</i> <b>The Politics of Envy: Statism as Theology</b>.

<h3>What Kind of Justice Should the Next President Pick?</h3>

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>John O. McGinnis</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>

<p>

	The 1994 term of the Supreme Court cast into stark relief the performances of Justices Clarence Thomas and David Souter. Justice Thomas emerged as the boldest member of the Court in half a century -- a jurist committed to seeking the original meaning of the Constitution in lengthy and learned opinions that survey the vast scope of American constitutional history. On the other hand, Justice Souter, while continuing his move to the Court's liberal wing, tended to write jejune opinions seemingly intent on avoiding the central issues of the case. It is as if Thomas and Souter keep alive in the public sphere the paradoxical qualities of the president who appointed them both. Thomas represents the bold and fearless George Bush who prosecuted the Gulf War and stood by Thomas in his contentious confirmation hearings, while Souter represents the reticent George Bush who was inattentive to conservative principles in many areas of domestic policy.
<p>	Given the excellent prospects in 1996 for a new president inclined to appoint conservative justices, it is appropriate to analyze the differences between these justices to aid the new president in choosing nominees in the mold of Thomas rather than Souter. I then propose a few criteria for choosing the next nominee that will maximize the chances of selecting an outstanding justice who will help ensure principled constitutional governance into the next century.
<p>	Liberal and conservative commentators alike agree on one proposition about the most recent Supreme Court term: Thomas became a force to be reckoned with. Tony Mauro, a liberal Court watcher, wrote of Thomas's "bold and searching" opinions. Burt Neuborne, a professor at New York University Law School and the former director of the ACLU, was struck by Justice Thomas's "vigorous tone" in his many "interesting and important opinions." James Kilpatrick wrote of his "masterly" work. George Will gave what may be a conservative's highest accolade for a judge: Thomas's opinions, he wrote, were "Borkean."
<p>	Indeed, the most striking characteristic of Thomas's opinions was one he shares with Judge Robert Bork -- a willingness to go back to first principles to uncover the meaning of the Constitution. In case after case where the original meaning of the Constitution was put in issue by the litigants or other justices, such as those involving term limits, the extent of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, and the protection afforded anonymous pamphlets under the First Amendment, Thomas wrote magisterial opinions that investigated the original understanding of the Constitution in detail. To be sure, not all of his opinions investigated all possible originalist angles of a case. But this is only to be expected, given the way issues are framed on the Court. Thomas is not a law professor, completely at liberty to approach every case without reference to the framework in which his colleagues or the litigants are operating. Nevertheless, his opinions undoubtedly represent the most impressive set of originalist opinions ever written by a Supreme Court justice within a single term. 
<p>	  Thomas's opinion in <i>U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton</i> was emblematic of his approach. The issue in the case was whether the states could preclude individuals who had served a certain number of terms as a senator or member of the House of Representatives from again appearing on the ballot for that office. The Constitution sets out certain qualifications for both representatives and senators. For instance, as to members of the House of Representatives, the Constitution provides, "No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen."
<p>	The analysis in the majority opinion in <i>Thornton</i> rested on the proposition that these qualifications were exclusive. It held that term limits were unconstitutional because state law could not add qualifications relating to the number of terms a candidate had previously served. The majority asserted that its view was supported by the precedent of <i>Powell v. McCormick</i> (1969), where the Court held that Congress could not exclude Adam Clayton Powell on the basis of criteria not mentioned in the qualifications clause. The majority also argued that the structure of the Constitution as a whole reflected the sovereignty of a national people, and additional qualifications would detract from national sovereignty.
<p>	Justice Thomas shredded these arguments. First, he showed as a matter of first principle that the Constitution was adopted by the people of each state and not by the people of the nation as a whole. Thus, the people of the states are prohibited from acting only if they impose such a prohibition on themselves in the Constitution or ceded such power exclusively to the federal government. This principle of residual state sovereignty is encapsulated in the Tenth Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
<p>	Thomas showed that the Tenth Amendment was expressly designed to rebut inferences like the one the majority attempted to draw from the qualifications clause. Because the Constitution simply provides a set of minimal qualifications for representatives and senators and nowhere prohibits the states from adding additional qualifications, the Tenth Amendment shows that the states are free to make additions. As Thomas wrote, "All powers that the Constitution neither delegates to the Federal Government nor prohibits to the States are controlled by the people of each state."
<p>	Once it is established that the federal government is a government of enumerated powers while the state governments are governments of residual powers, the term-limits case is easily decided. In particular, it is clear that the precedent in <i>Powell v. McCormick</i> is no bar to state term limits. Congress simply lacks an enumerated power to impose additional qualifications, whereas the states reserve the power to add additional qualifications because nowhere in the Constitution did they surrender that power. 
<p>	The opinion in <i>Thornton</i> was not Thomas's only originalist <i>tour de force</i> of the term. In <i>United States v. Lopez</i>, he wrote a concurrence that was the most interesting judicial explication of the Commerce Clause in more than half a century. In <i>Lopez</i>, the Court invalidated (as beyond Congress's power under the Commerce Clause) a federal statute that prohibited the possession of a gun within 500 feet of a school. Justice William Rehnquist's majority opinion essentially reasoned that education was not commerce and therefore held inapplicable the long line of cases in which the Court has interpreted the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate any activity which has "substantial effects" on interstate commerce.
<p>	Thomas's opinion was more sweeping. He called for a reconsideration of the "substantial effects on interstate commerce" test because it was inconsistent with the original meaning of the Commerce Clause. First, Thomas showed that the modern test used a meaning of "commerce" that encompassed all economic activity, whereas the meaning of "commerce" at the time of the Framing was limited to trading and exchange, as distinct from other productive activities such as manufacturing and farming. Second, Thomas observed that permitting Congress to regulate all activities "affecting" interstate commerce deprives many of the words contained in the clause of independent force. Moreover, most of the rest of the authorities granted to Congress under Article I would also be superfluous under the "affecting commerce" test. Why give Congress particular authority to regulate bankruptcy, since insolvency self-evidently affects economic activity among the states? 
<p>	Thomas did not settle on a precise test for Congress's authority over interstate commerce, explicitly recognizing the difficulty of recovering the original meaning of the Commerce Clause in light of decades of nonoriginalist precedent. Describing the exact contours of an improved jurisprudence concerning the Commerce Clause was appropriately left to a future opinion, where that test could command a majority of the Court.
<p>	Some commentators have labeled as radical Thomas's opinions in <i>Lopez</i> and other cases this term. But these opinions are radical only in the sense of going back to the original roots of the Constitution. They are, in fact, an attempt to begin to erase the decades of radicalism during the Roosevelt and Warren Courts, which transformed the Constitution into a hollow likeness of its former self. The Constitution fashioned by those courts reflected the enthusiasm of the New Deal and the Great Society for a powerful, centralized government to act as the engine of social democracy and collectivist reforms. Accordingly, the pillars of the original Constitution, such as federalism, the separation of powers, and property rights, that seemed to be roadblocks to social democracy were weakened and, in some cases, eviscerated. Now that centralized and collectivist solutions to social problems are increasingly seen as a snare and a delusion, it is not surprising that the Constitution of the Framers -- designed to sustain only the limited, centralized government necessary to maximize the protection of individual rights -- is beginning to reappear. Thomas has become one of the leading restorers of the original canvas, stripping away in opinion after opinion the obscuring varnish that has accumulated over the last 50 years. 
<p>	Thomas also wrote a profoundly originalist concurrence in <i>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission</i>. At issue was whether Ohio could restrict anonymous election pamphlets. The majority, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens (over a dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia), invalidated such restrictions because of the value of anonymous pamphleteering to political discourse and because of the long tradition of such pamphleteering. Refusing to join the majority opinion, Thomas wrote a concurrence in which he analyzed whether the freedom of speech as understood at the time of the Framing protected the right of anonymous political speech. Reviewing an enormous amount of political discourse, he demonstrated that the Framers themselves relied on anonymity to "a remarkable extent" in their advocacy of the Constitution with only one or two pieces signed in their original name. Moreover, he unearthed an important controversy about anonymous political speech between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists in Philadelphia in 1787. There the Federalists backed down from an attempt to prohibit anonymous speech in the face of claims that such a prohibition "reversed the important doctrine of freedom of the press." Given the pervasiveness of anonymous political speech and its triumph over legal restrictions in the years immediately preceding the adoption of the First Amendment, Thomas concluded that anonymous pamphleteering was protected by the concept of freedom of speech. 
<p>	Nor was <i>McIntyre</i> the only case in which Justice Thomas deployed originalism to protect civil liberties. In <i>Wilson v. Arkansas</i>, Justice Thomas held for a unanimous Court that the Fourth Amendment reflected the "knock and announce principle" at common law at the time of the Framing. The Fourth Amendment therefore permitted unannounced searches only in circumstances where that venerable principle permitted them -- instances when there were strong countervailing exigencies or considerations. 
	<p><i>McIntyre</i> and <i>Wilson</i> discredit the familiar claim of liberal commentators that Thomas is hostile to civil liberties. He is fearless in sustaining the liberties that the Constitution protects. Indeed, we can look forward to his sharp analysis as the Court revisits liberties such as those contained in the Contract Clause that were conveniently discarded by the "civil libertarians" of the post-New Deal era. 
<p>	Thomas was also a strong voice on matters of civil rights. His opinions in that area were less elaborate than his originalist analyses of the Constitution, but no less forceful. In the most important civil-rights case this term, <i>Adarand v. Pena</i>, in which the Court declared that strict scrutiny must apply to racial preferences in federal contracting programs, Thomas inveighed against the dissent's attempt to create "a paternalism exception to the equal protection clause." He also showed an exact understanding of law's essential possibilities and limitations: "Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law."
<p>In <i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i>, Thomas also filed an important concurrence supporting the Court's holding. The decision prevented a lower court from continuing to run Missouri's schools decades after segregation had ended partly on the justification that schools still were not racially mixed. "It never ceases to amaze me," wrote Justice Thomas, "that courts are so willing to assume that anything predominantly black is inferior." Consistent with the theme of his <i>Adarand</i> concurrence, Thomas observed there is nothing constitutionally wrong with a predominantly black institution, unless it is the law that forces an institution to be composed of a particular race. <p>
	Although his voting record was among the most liberal of any justice, even liberal commentators did not single out Souter's opinions for praise. Indeed, the mark of Souter's work last term was his attempt to use process to flee substance. "The Court's process of orderly adjudication has broken down in this case," began his <i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i> dissent, and his opinion soon degenerated into a set of querulous complaints about the procedural posture of the case -- complaints easily refuted by the majority. In <i>Adarand</i>, his opinion rested largely on the proposition that the Court must uphold the program of racial set-asides because of the <i>stare decisis</i> effect of <i>Fullilove v. Klutznick</i> (1980) in which a fragmented Court upheld a different set of racial set-asides more than a decade ago, and <i>Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC</i> (1990), in which the Court upheld racial preferences in the peculiar setting of broadcasting.
<p><i>Adarand</i> illustrated the failings of Souter's performance: Far from being a critical thinker, he is a prisoner of the school of legal process jurisprudence that reigned at Harvard Law School during his time as a student there. Legal process jurisprudence arose in response to legal realism, which claimed that judges made decisions on political or other personal grounds. One important strand of process jurisprudence maintained that judges could avoid unprincipled decisionmaking by focusing on the distinctive aspects of legal procedure such as <i>stare decisis</i>. This school no longer holds sway even among academics, in part  because it is widely recognized that procedural doctrines are as subject to manipulation at least as much as the substantive doctrines of law. 
<p>	In any event, Souter's performance in <i>Adarand</i> is an unquestioning pupil's parody of his master's teachings. There was no majority opinion in <i>Fullilove</i>, thus whatever the importance of honoring <i>stare decisis</i> and preserving long settled principles, it was preposterous to put <i>Fullilove</i> in this category. Moreover, <i>Metro Broadcasting</i>'s lenient standard of review for preferences in broadcasting conflicted with much of the rest of the Court's equal-protection jurisprudence. Accordingly, the issue of racial preferences in federal contracting could not fairly be understood as governed by binding precedent. It will certainly be interesting to watch whether Souter in the future gives <i>stare decisis</i> effect to the majority opinions from which he is now dissenting.
<p><i>Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia</i> is the case that perhaps best shows the chasm between Souter and Thomas. In that case, the majority opinion, which Justice Kennedy wrote and Thomas joined, held that the University of Virginia could not refuse to fund the printing costs of a student newspaper because of its Christian editorial content so long as it was funding the printing costs of other student publications.
<p>	The Court held that the university had discriminated against religiously inspired newspapers relative to those with a secular editorial policy, thereby engaging in viewpoint discrimination forbidden by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Moreover, the Court held that the university's payments to the printer who published the religious newspaper did not violate the Establishment Clause, because the payments were part of program that had a secular purpose -- fostering student learning and creativity -- and that were available to all publications, regardless of their particular religious viewpoint or lack thereof.
<p>	Souter dissented. He argued that there was no free-speech violation because there was no viewpoint discrimination: The university's decision to prohibit the reimbursement of printer expenses for magazines with a religious editorial was no different from the decision to prohibit the reimbursement of all magazines except those devoted to cooking. Souter also argued that reimbursement would violate the Establishment Clause because the state was subsidizing the propagation of a religious point of view. In support of his position, he relied on Madison's <i>Memorial and Remonstrance on Religious Observance</i> in which Madison assailed a legislative proposal that would have taxed citizens of Virginia in order to support churches. 
<p>	Like his <i>Adarand</i> opinion, Souter's <i>Rosenberger</i> opinion faithfully represents the view of the liberal establishment that educated him. Under this view, religion is something that can be practiced privately and dissected publicly at a university in history, anthropology, and psychology classes. Religion, however, must be assiduously kept from the public square, particularly when that square is an educational institution of any kind.
<p>	This principle of separation between religion and state has been sold as a way of preventing the government from favoring religion. In reality, it has a way of uniquely disfavoring religious viewpoints and maximizing the influence of the predominantly liberal secular ideas of institutions of public education. Under the conventional liberal view of the Establishment Clause, the Constitution would forbid a public university from having a program of encouraging student writing and debate that refunds the printing costs of a religious magazine even if it simultaneously funds magazines celebrating the philosophies of John Dewey, Karl Marx, and Donald Duck. 
<p>In his concurrence, Thomas first stripped this view of the patina of historical legitimacy Souter tried to give it. Thomas pointed out that the program Madison attacked in his <i>Remonstrance</i> provided special benefits to religious institutions alone: Madison complained that this forced civil society to take "cognizance" of religion. A funding program for student journalism and debate that includes religiously inspired magazines does not give special benefits to religion, but simply allows religious magazines to enjoy the same benefits as other magazines. Only a program that discriminates against religious magazines -- the very kind of program that the University of Virginia was runningtakes "cognizance" of religion. 
<p>Moreover, Thomas suggests that the conventional Establishment Clause principles are incoherent on their own terms. Tax exemptions have been provided to religious and secular institutions alike as charitable recipients for 200 years because support for charity has a secular purpose. Yet these are functionally and economically equivalent to direct aid given to religious institutions that are contributing to some secularly defined program, like encouraging intellectual debate or chastity among the young. Thomas questions how direct aid to institutions could be different from tax exemptions if both are given as part of general program that has a secular purpose and is open to secular institutions. He thereby forces us to ask: Is a deep legal principle underlying this distinction? Or is it the political calculation that, while the curtailment of direct aid might provoke grumbles from the people, the termination of tax exemptions would lead to a wholesale constitutional amendment of the Establishment Clause that the modern Court has created. 
<p>The dramatic difference in performances of Thomas and Souter suggests a few essential considerations which should guide the next conservative president in his choice of a nominee:
<p><ol>

<li>The next nominee should show an established commitment to the conservative legal movement; he should, in other words, have "reputational capital" invested in conservative legal thought. The difference between Thomas's and Souter's relation to conservative thought before they were appointed almost certainly bears on the very different paths they have followed on the Court. Thomas had not only met and conversed with the members of the conservative legal movement, but was himself one of the leaders of the movement in the area of civil rights. Thus, Thomas came to the Court inclined to articulate principles that he had been on record as supporting and, in one area, had formulated himself. 
<p>Souter, by contrast, had never made any contribution to conservative legal thought or been part of the conservative legal movement. Although he had been the attorney general under a conservative governor in New Hampshire, his legal thinking had never been systematically exposed to originalism and other conservative jurisprudential movements that gained renewed strength in the 1980s. Without any reputational capital invested in conservative legal thought, it is not surprising that Souter fell back on the jurisprudence of his legal educators and the current elite legal establishment, which is substantially to the left of the country as a whole.
<p> Another important consequence of their different associations may be a difference in psychological commitment to conservatism. In participating in the fledgling conservative movement in law, Thomas cemented many friendships through what St. Augustine called "the warmth of kindred studies." Such friendships naturally sustain the intellectual outlook previously adopted in the face of predictable pressures of the Washington establishment. Moreover, the network of friendships from the conservative movement has very practical consequences as well. Thomas has largely hired clerks who are associated with the conservative legal movement. After his first few years, Souter has hired predominantly liberal clerks, some strategically recommended by the overwhelming liberal community of law professors at leading law schools.
<p><li>Although the next nominee emphatically does not have to be a Washington insider, he should have been tested in Washington at some point in his career. Thomas's outlook was forged in the heat of one of the most contentious national issues of our time -- civil rights. He had already taken positions for which he had paid a price in public attacks on his views and his character. Souter, on the other hand, had spent the major part of his career on relatively less consequential issues far from Washington and far from the influence of the predominantly liberal national media and opinionmakers. While some of his opinions on the New Hampshire Supreme Court were vaguely conservative, they were never important enough to be challenged by the liberal legal establishment. 	
<p>	Thomas thus was tested in his beliefs in a way Souter could not have been. Once both were put in the national spotlight of the Supreme Court, it was far more certain that Thomas would be steadfast in adhering to conservative views despite an initial reception that was certain to be hostile. A justice who has not been tested, like Souter (or Justice Lewis Powell), is much more likely to be blown from side to side by the very powerful political gusts at the storm center of the Court.
<p>There are other considerations worth taking into account in choosing a justice, although they are admittedly less important than the first two:
<p><li>The justice should be persuasive with his colleagues. Although the ability of any justice, no matter how incisive and collegial, to make a difference in the way his colleague votes is limited, in a few close cases over a justice's career he or she may hope to sway others. The qualities required for persuasion are keen analytical ability (to spot possible coherent lines of analysis that a colleague might join), a persuasive pen, and a friendly, extroverted nature (to make the justice's colleagues want to be in the same corner). On the evidence of this term, Thomas has all these qualities. 
<p><li>The justice should have some understanding of economic analysis. Although this essay has addressed only constitutional law, so much of the best understanding of statutory law, both public and private, turns on economic concepts such as efficiency, consumer welfare, and cost-benefit analysis. A justice literate in economics has a substantial advantage in interpreting such statutes. Economic literacy does not necessarily entail that the nominee be a law and economics professor or have an academic degree in economics, but simply that the nominee have been exposed to systematic economic analysis during his or her career. Thomas, for instance, had taken an intensive course in economics for judges when he was appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit. 
</ol><p>	With the benefit of such considerations and the very large supply of lawyers and jurists in the conservative legal movement who would make excellent nominees, I am confident that the next president can nominate individuals who will join the pantheon of truly great Supreme Court justices: like Chief Justice John Marshall, Justice George Sutherland, Justice Scalia, and, if he continues to meet the standard he set last term, Justice Clarence Thomas himself.

<h2>GOVERNMENT SHOULD<br>
NOT ENCOURAGE<br>
NEWEST HEROIN EPIDEMIC</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

We are about to repeat an epidemic among young people, according
to Ginna Marston, research director for the Partnership for a
Drug-Free America.  &quot;It's stupid, because an earlier generation
has already been through this,&quot; Marston said.

<p>

The Partnership has launched an advertising campaign to counteract
&quot;heroin chic&quot; in the pop culture.  Meanwhile, in July,
a White House panel of scientists and activists who serve as advisors
on AIDS policy labeled the administration &quot;timid&quot; for
failing to support drug-abuser needle-exchange programs. Of the
panel members, almost half have the AIDS virus and an equal number
are homosexual.

<p>

This panel, well-intentioned but misguided, is part of an organized
effort to secure government funding for clean needle giveaways
to drug addicts in an attempt to slow the spread of the AIDS virus.
The evidence that such giveaways work, however, is far from conclusive.

<p>

A 1993 law permits the government to use federal funds to support
exchanges only if they can be scientifically shown to slow the
spread of the AIDS virus without increasing drug abuse.  To date,
studies are plagued with problems.  They rely on self-reporting
by addicts, downplay sexual transmission of the AIDS virus, generally
ignore the impact on communities near exchange sites, trivialize
the drug problem and never measure HIV seroconversion rates, the
only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on a much-cited government needle
study say that needle exchanges &quot;are not the panacea their
supporters hope for.&quot;  Now is not the time for government to 
tacitly endorse drug abuse by giving needles to addicts.

<p>

Worldwide heroin production has nearly doubled since the late
1980s. Since 1988, emergency room &quot;episodes&quot; in the
U.S. resulting from heroin overdoses have increased
68 percent.  Street heroin purity is up from a low of 4 percent
a decade ago to nearly 70 percent today.  Meanwhile, competition
between Colombian cartels and Asian syndicates has driven the
street price for a glassine envelope of smack as low as five dollars.

<p>

Heroin's growing popularity stems from its low price and high
purity and the fact that needle-shy users can now get high from
snorting or smoking the substance.  A Yale University student
explains, &quot;Most people here are snorting dope. There's a
very safe-sex-style, safe-drug-use aesthetic.&quot;

<p>

Heroin is the drug of choice among many of today's rock stars.
In spite of the well-publicized July 12, 1996 heroin death of
rocker Jonathan Melvoin, a keyboard player for the Smashing Pumpkins,
abuse grows.  &quot;Heroin is hot,&quot; says Detective Frank
Lyga, with the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood narcotics
division.  The August 9 edition of <I>Entertainment Weekly</I>
says that &quot;heroin has become the cocaine of the '90s&quot;
and a recent article in <I>Rolling Stone</I> profiled heroin's
resurgence in colleges.

<p>

&quot;Heroin's huge because it's the most extreme thing,&quot;
says Danny Boyle, director of &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; a controversial
new movie about Scottish heroin abusers.  The movie portrays heroin
abuse as exciting and may seduce some into drug experimentation.

<p>

In the face of rising heroin abuse, drug czar General Barry McCaffrey
is unwilling to support pro-needle advocates and wants to fight
illegal drug abuse.  &quot;The problem is not dirty needles,&quot;
says McCaffrey, &quot;the problem is heroin addiction.&quot;
Others agree.

<p>

&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse,&quot; says Rep.
Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), &quot;not to find a cleaner, safer way
to do it.&quot;  Dr. James Curtis, director of the Department
of Psychiatry, Harlem Hospital Center, says exchanges are &quot;poor
medicine&quot; and &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order.&quot;

<p>

Philip Lee, assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services and
a former needle exchange researcher, suggests exchanges &quot;may
send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;  Eighty-six exchanges
now operate in 55 U.S. cities without federal funds.  They provide
free drug-injecting supplies, condoms, advice on shooting drugs
properly, warnings about bad heroin, and counseling that sometimes
leads to treatment.

<p>

Although the science is inconclusive, expect AIDS activists and
pro-drug legalization forces (who never shy away from using incomplete
or erroneous data to support their agenda) to pressure the government
to approve funds for needle giveaways.  To endorse
one evil in an attempt to prevent another is at best a no-win
situation.  Clearly, this could become another example of an expensive
government program working at cross purposes to sound public policy.

<title>CYBERCHAOS: NOT FIRST AMENDMENT'S PROMISE</title>

<h2>CYBERCHAOS:<br>
NOT FIRST AMENDMENT'S<br>
PROMISE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Cathleen A. Cleaver, Esq.</i></center>

<p>

The Department of Justice has announced that it will appeal to
the Supreme Court the recent Philadelphia federal court's ruling
against the Communications Decency Act.  That appeal is the right
thing to do, and here's why.

<p>

Not long ago I debated Bob Guccioni, publisher of <I>Penthouse</I>,
on the merits of restricting computer pornography and the Philadelphia
ruling.  Not surprisingly, he was elated by the three-judge panel's
decision to strike the indecency provisions, the effect of which
was to give a computer pornographer more &quot;free speech&quot;
rights than any other speaker in any other forum.  For the first
time in the history of our country, a porn purveyor may intentionally
show sexually explicit pictures to a child without legal jeopardy
-- provided the purveyor uses the Internet.  First in line to
challenge the CDA was, of course, the ACLU and its cyberclones,
followed by CompuServe, America Online, and others with a huge
financial stake in the unenforceability of the CDA, like <I>Playboy</I> 
and <I>Penthouse</I>.  Guccioni may finally claim the consumer
market share which he has heretofore been denied.

<p>

Not only did the Philadelphia panel strike provisions prohibiting
adults from posting sexually explicit materials in public areas
of the Internet that children frequent -- like teen chat rooms
-- but it also struck the prohibition on e-mailing a <I>Penthouse</I>
centerfold (or the like) directly to a specific child who is known
by the sender to be a child.  In the words of the Department of
Justice:  &quot;Never before in the history of telecommunications
media in the United States has so much indecent (and obscene)
material been so easily accessible by so many minors in so many
American homes with so few restrictions.&quot;

<p>

To say the ruling is flawed is a double understatement.  Not only
is the decision based on legal theories directly contrary to Supreme
Court precedent and incorrect assumptions about the capabilities
of Internet technology, but it is less a ruling than a trio of
separate opinions.  Each judge took his turn chiding Congress
for daring to inhibit the liberty of cyberspace pioneers, however
ruthless, in the interest of children and the greater cybercommunity.
Highlights from the lengthy trilogy include conclusions that
it is &quot;either technologically impossible or economically
prohibitive&quot; to comply with the CDA, that the term 'indecent'
is altogether too vague, and that, &quot;just as the strength
of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of our liberty depends
upon the chaos and cacophony of unfettered speech.&quot;  These
conclusions defy fact, law, and logic, respectively.

<p>

Given that some on-line pornographers currently screen and restrict
children from their sites, it cannot be said that compliance is
impossible.  Moreover, new technology is being developed at dizzying
speed to address a variety of Internet challenges, such as consumer
transaction security and the protection of property rights of
amateur musicians who exchange their songs, making it all the
more evident that it is really lack of will and not ability which
makes Internet advocates cry &quot;foul.&quot;  As to expense,
this callous court complains about the economic burden the CDA
would impose on distributors of pornography, while finding it
good and proper for parents alone to incur the costs, however
great, of protecting their children.  Outside the sacred realm
of cyberspace, distributors of pornography routinely incur expenses
to shield children.  To cite just one example, &quot;blinder racks&quot;
must be purchased and installed at newsstands so that children
do not see offensive sex magazine covers.  This economic burden
flows directly from the legal responsibility these distributors
bear to shield this material from minors.  Software blocking programs,
on the other hand, are initially expensive for parents, need frequent
updating (at considerable expense), are easily circumvented by
computer-savvy kids, and are simply incapable of screening much
of the pornography.  Surfwatch, the leading software blocker,
admitted in the CDA hearing to missing up to 800 sexually explicit
sites each month!

<p>

Moreover, it goes without saying that a software blocking program
can only work on a family's home computer where it is installed.
What happens when the kids go next door or, for that matter,
to the public library?  The American Library Association proclaimed
in the Philadelphia court that, as a matter of solemn principle,
it will never employ software screening programs in its libraries'
computers -- not even when children use them.  This to-hell-with-children
sentiment is reflected by the judges and echoes throughout their
opinions.

<p>

Chief Judge Sloviter's opinion even concludes that for &quot;<I>content
providers</I> . . . <I>to review all of their material</I>&quot;
to determine which of it is sexually explicit is surely &quot;a
burden one should not have to bear.&quot;  <I>What</I>?  The content
provider is in the <I>best</I> position to determine whether his
material contains patently offensive depictions of sexual or excretory
activities, and that is why our laws have <I>always</I> required
him to do just that.  The allocation of this burden to the speaker,
as opposed to the consumer of the speech, not only carries the
weight of unanimous legal precedent, but also has the benefit
of being practical.  It is virtually a truism to say that, as
between speaker and consumer, the speaker is in the better position
to know the content of his speech.  Judge Sloviter would remove
a reasonable burden from content providers and replace it with
the enormous and nearly impossible burden on parents to first
locate, then evaluate, and then block pornographic material in
an effort to protect their children.

<p>

Their quarrel with the indecency standard reveals that the judges
are either ill-informed or ill-intentioned.  An indecent communication
is one &quot;that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs.&quot;  This definition
has been consistently upheld in every case in which it has been
reviewed, including at the Supreme Court, which, most recently
in the cable pornography  case of <I>Denver Area Educational Telecommunications
Consortium, Inc. v. FCC</I>, held the standard to be &quot;not
impermissibly vague.&quot;  As if to justify their awkward conclusion,
the court lists as examples of &quot;threatened&quot; speech material
which simply could not fall within the definition of indecency,
such as discussions of recent movies or ancient Indian statues
or articles about human rights violations.  To serve their end,
the judges conveniently, but not subtly, ignore the requirement
that the materials be evaluated &quot;in context.&quot;  No court
has ever construed this standard to encompass, without any consideration
of context, all material of literary or artistic value that is
somehow related to sexuality.

<p>

Not to be topped, Judge Dalzell proclaims:  &quot;<I>Any</I> content-based
regulation of the Internet, no matter how benign the purpose,
could burn the global village to roast the pig.&quot;  Really?
What about fraud -- may we not protect consumers in cyberspace?
May we not ban child pornography or enforce copyright violations
on-line?  Would these content-based regulations burn the village,
too?

<p>

If the First Amendment's promise to this new technology is indeed
chaos and anarchy, then perhaps Judge Dalzell is right.  But before
we too quickly agree with this visionary from the federal bench,
we ought to ask ourselves how we have survived and thrived as
a democracy for two centuries upon the bedrock of ordered liberty,
the enemy of chaos and anarchy.

<p>

The Supreme Court ought to roundly denounce this federal panel's
decision.  To affirm it would be to rob our children of the opportunity
to participate in this great new communications medium, or worse,
to sacrifice them to perversions and excesses for the convenience
and pleasure of the worst malefactors on-line -- in effect, to
preserve the pornographers' new found sanctuary known as cyberspace.

The producers of NBC's <i>Friends</i> deserve much credit. Since
it first aired, I have been a regular viewer and, like so many
of my peers, Thursday nights are often built around watching the
show with my own friends.
<p>
<i>Friends</i> is effectively scripted and produced.  The acting
is very good, the humor is both subtle and edgy, and they add
just the right measure of sappiness.  In short, it is very well
done, as evidenced by its number-one rating.
<p>
Another reason <i>Friends</i> is a hit is its relevance.  There
are tons of us whose lives, in so many ways, mirror those of the
characters.  We are young, single and dealing with life by facing
good days and bad, exceptional and mundane -- but all interwoven
with ribbons of humor, questions about our careers, and (of course)
romance. Sometimes we wish we could bottle these days and make
them last forever and sometimes we wish we had &quot;do-overs.&quot;
But whatever these days are like, many of us are fortunate enough
to walk through them with real-life friends, without whom life
would be much poorer.  This is the point on which <i>Friends</i>
is most compelling.  Its creators are to be commended on their
uncanny insight into our lives.
<p>
The one point at which the show diverges from reality is in its
portrayal of  moral dilemmas.  In episode after episode the producers
create life-like chances to demonstrate sexual propriety and nearly
every time, they fail.  The consistency with which they present
sexuality so tritely indicates one of two things:  they either
sell real-life people far too short, or they are working overtime
to thrust an &quot;it never costs anything and everything goes&quot;
view of sex upon us all.
<p>
This is not to say that sexual issues are not a significant part
of real life. But it is undeniable that  -- in the real world
-- sex for sport is not free, and most folks know it.  In the
deepest part of us, we know casual sex has an emotional and psychological
cost that is far greater than its momentary gratification.  Hence
the term we assign to the morning-after departure, &quot;the walk
of shame.&quot;
<p>
In the sobriety of the morning light, or when we're sitting on
our beds alone late at night, we are all too aware that there
is a hole in our hearts that sex alone can never fill. We also know 
that by acting as if sex can fill that void, we sure can enlarge the 
emptiness in our own life and in that of another.
<p>
As much as we may sometimes want it to be, we know sex is not
the way <i>Friends</i> portrays it.  We know a guy can't sleep
with a producer to get a part on a soap opera and then laugh it
off without losing his dignity and a whole lot more.  We know
a wife can't leave her husband for a lesbian lover and have the
&quot;wedding&quot; of the two women be warm and wonderful for
all concerned -- especially when their child will be raised by
her and her.  Good wit doesn't make everything okay, and one-liners
don't ameliorate the blisters random sex leaves on our hearts.
<p>
We know sex yields real freedom, safety, and lasting pleasure
only when it's enjoyed with the one friend to whom we have pledged
our life:  our husband or wife.  That friend doesn't have to go
home to shower before work, or wonder who might have shared the
same bed the week before.  That friend doesn't have to wonder
why her partner didn't call, or joke with the guys at the office
about not calling when he said he would.
<p>
So, despite the many ways the makers of <i>Friends</i> look at
our lives and seem to &quot;get it,&quot; when it comes to sex,
they obviously don't.

<title>WHY MY SON SHOULDN'T FEEL LEFT OUT</title>

<p>

<h2>WHY MY SON SHOULDN'T FEEL<br>
LEFT OUT ON &quot;TAKE OUR<br>
DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY&quot;</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>

<p>

In an ironic twist, the Ms. Foundation is being accused of gender
discrimination for excluding boys from their third annual &quot;Take
Our Daughters to Work Day.&quot;  In fact, a number of major companies
-- including Ford Motors, Polaroid, Colgate-Palmolive, and Apple
Computer -- are sufficiently concerned about appearances of sexism
that they are pointedly inviting both girls and boys to the workplace
for &quot;Take Our <I>Children</I> to Work Day.&quot;

<p>

While these companies' &quot;gender-inclusiveness&quot; and respect
for &quot;diversity&quot; is certainly commendable, I don't plan
to bring my 7-year-old son, David, with me to work on April 25.
Don't get me wrong.  I think boys have no less need than girls
to learn about the importance of work.  I'm just not convinced
that the most important work I do is done in the workplace.

<p>

That's why I devoted a day recently to staging my own little celebration.
I call it, &quot;Stay Home With Your Son Day.&quot;  And it was
quite a blast.

<p>

The day began with breakfast, followed by a trip outside to the
driveway, where I had David help me with some of the routine car
maintenance tasks (checking the oil, adding some radiator fluid,
cleaning the dashboard, etc.) that I used to help my father do.

<p>

After we finished, David and I ran some errands together.  We
stopped by the candy store to pick up some chocolates for me to
give to my wife when she and I celebrate our upcoming wedding
anniversary.  And we dropped by the post office to mail some letters
and survey the newest stamps -- just as I used to do with my grandfather,
who was an avid stamp collector.

<p>

In the afternoon, David and I enjoyed one of our all-time pastimes
-- playing wiffle ball in the front yard -- and then spent some
time before dinner working David's USA map puzzle and reviewing
some of his latest school work.

<p>

But the highlight of the day came at bedtime.  After I tucked
David in and shared in his nighttime prayers, I reviewed with
David some of the day's activities and told him something I learned
from my father (who, no doubt, learned it from his dad).  Here's
what I said:

<p>

&quot;David, there are lots of things I don't know and that I'll
never figure out.  But one thing I've learned is that some of
the most important work a man ever does is the work of being a
father. It involves things like teaching your children new skills,
showing them how a man should treat the woman he loves, building
family memories that will last long after you're dead and gone,
and telling your children about the never-ending love of the Father
above.  Now, David, this may not seem like a big deal.  But you
are growing up at a time when many men seem to think that all
of life's greatest joys are found in building and doing and working
away from home. They don't seem to understand how important the
job of a father is. They don't know how much joy marriage and
children can bring to life.  And the crazy thing is, David, a
growing number of women are acting like these men.  They seem
to think the best things in life are found in the workplace, too.&quot;

<p>

And then, after I kissed David goodnight and headed for the door,
I turned to him and said, &quot;Someday, son, you're going to
be a man.  And when you are, I hope that you will have a job that
you enjoy and that you do well.  And I hope you will marry a woman
just like your mother and have children just like ours.

<p>

&quot;When that day comes, David, I want you to remember the things
we've talked about today.  I want you to remember to honor and
cherish your wife.  And to make time with your children a top
priority.&quot;

<p>

<title>FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS CAN HELP FISCALLY-STRAPPED GOVERNMENTS</title>

<h2>FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS CAN<br>
HELP FISCALLY-STRAPPED<br>
GOVERNMENTS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Texas is blazing the trail for the nation by investigating the
strange marriage between fiscally-strapped government and faith-based
social service programs.  This relationship has the potential
to solve many social and fiscal problems.

<p>

Texas' effort recognizes that the church can succeed where government
can't. Consider the case of Edward Woods from Marshall, Texas,
who had a 12-year drug addiction, was twice imprisoned and had
tried to commit suicide.  Today, he's a totally different person,
and he gives credit to his new faith in Jesus Christ.  If Woods
has really gone straight, Texas will save the social costs normally
associated with long-term chronic crime, drug abuse and repeat
incarceration.  Changing Woods' life cost the taxpayer nothing.
A faith-based organization picked up the tab.

<p>

On May 2, 1996, Texas Governor George Bush set up a task force
to examine how to encourage faith-based programs while avoiding
groups like David Koresh's Waco-based Branch Davidians.  The state's
hidden agenda is saving taxpayer funds by encouraging the faith
community to meet more needs.  The task force reports back this
September.

<p>

Social costs are outdistancing government's reach.  Nationally,
crime costs a half-trillion dollars annually and drug abuse treatment
costs the federal government many billions while reaching only
a fraction of those in need.  Although there are growing numbers
of homeless and hungry, as misery rises government outlays fall.
The faith community, which has a God-given responsibility to
help, must step in, and government should open the door for their
participation.

<p>

America has a tradition of relying on the church.  It was the
church that built most of the nation's hospitals.  The church
was the prominent player in the civil rights movement.  The church
was the original safety net for the homeless, the hungry and the
orphaned.

<p>

On July 16, faith-based groups told the Austin-based task force
that state regulations make helping people in crisis difficult.
The Texas Commission of Alcohol and Drug Abuse tried to shut
down faith-based Victory Fellowship, which is a rehabilitation
program run by former addicts.  Fellowship founder Freddie Garcia
said, &quot;We don't use drugs or psychiatrists or any of that,
only Bible study.&quot;  While government programs have a cure
rate of 10 percent at a cost of hundreds of dollars per day per
client, Garcia's program has a 70 percent success rate.

<p>

Some faith-based groups in Texas are wary of government regulators.
Natalie Musgrave Ingram with San Antonio's Christian Assistance
Ministry said her board is worried about state control.  CAM is
a 10-church cooperative ministry that last year fed, clothed,
educated and counseled 35,000 people.  The group takes no government
money. Sylvestor Matthews, a 30-year Texas pastor, warned the
task force that government funding of faith-based programs could
lead to the licensing of churches.

<p>

Task force member Cecil Hawkins, executive director for African
American Men of Peace Development, Dallas, Texas, said that a
state license only ensures control, not quality.  He said, &quot;I've
been licensed by God.  I don't want to be held accountable to
the state for my ministry.&quot;  Another member reminded the
task force that Jim Jones who led his followers to mass suicide
in Jonestown, Guyana had five state-approved licenses.

<p>

The faith-based community wants to do something about the prison
problem.  Texas businessman Fred Billings told the Texas task
force that the only hope for the criminal is to change him from
inside, not to build more jails.  Billings said the state has
been throwing money at a problem that is getting too large and
complex.  He supports the creation of a prison program based on
a faith-based approach.

<p>

His prison idea is modeled on a successful 20-year program in
Brazil where inmate recidivism is very low.  The program is designed
to create a correctional environment within the existing criminal
justice system that restores individual inmates to responsible
and productive relationships with their communities, families,
and Creator.

<p>

There is evidence that religion makes a difference for prisoners
and recidivism.  Chuck Colson's Prison Fellowship, in cooperation
with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, found in a study that religious
former inmates had a significantly lower recidivism rate than
non-religious former inmates.  Todd Clear writes for the National
Council on Crime and Delinquency that true religion helps inmates
deal with personal problems, leads to dealing with guilt and helps
them accept personal responsibility for crimes.  Religious inmates
are also more likely to become model prisoners than non-religious
inmates.

<p>

This nation faces serious moral problems.  The faith community
is equipped to address these problems if government will tame
the bureaucrats.  The marriage of necessity between government
and the faith community, which has existed since George Washington's
time, must be rekindled.  Our founders were men of faith who knew
that the great answers of life come from the church, not from
the legislature or the White House.

<p>

The final task force speaker brought a word of encouragement.
Texan Beth Hill said, &quot;The God I serve is bigger than any
bureaucracy.  What God calls us to, he will equip us 
to do.&quot;  Let's hope that Beth's words ring loudly across
this land, that churches respond to this call to service, and
that government recognizes its place and gets out of the way.

<title>BOGUS ARMY STUDY CLAIMS WOMEN CAN BE AS TOUGH AS MEN</title>

<p>

<h2>BOGUS ARMY STUDY CLAIMS<br>
WOMEN CAN BE AS TOUGH AS MEN</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

Last spring, the Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine
in Natick, Mass., selected 40 civilian women between the ages
of 18 and 32 from the Boston area to engage in physical training
for 24 weeks.[1] Funding for the study came from a $20 million
Defense Department women's health research project, pushed by
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Co.).[2]
<p>
The study, which was released January 26, 1996, will certainly
be used by feminists to advocate removing more combat exemptions
for women.
<p>
For six months, these women trained five days per week and 90
minutes each day.   They lifted weights, hiked with backpacks
and ran twice a week.   The training was overseen by experts in
strength training and conditioning.
<p>
The $140,000 study found that after training, 78 percent of the
women could lift more than 100 pounds.[3] That qualifies them for
&quot;very heavy&quot; military occupational specialties which
are generally limited to men.  This finding would seem to cast
doubt on current female exemptions.
<p>
The volunteers increased their repetitive lifting ability,  improved
by one-third their time carrying a 75-pound backpack, increased
their aerobic ability by 14 percent and increased their hip and
thigh muscle strength and endurance dramatically.
<p>
Lori Gilstrap, a strength and conditioning coordinator with the
U.S. Olympic Committee,  said she wasn't surprised by the results.
She warned, however,  that women shouldn't be expected to match
men in strength because they have much lower levels of testosterone.[4]
<p>
Everett Harman, the Army scientist who headed the study, countered
that, &quot;You don't need testosterone to get strong.&quot; 
Consistent training and conditioning &quot;can be very effective
in improving the ability of women to perform physically demanding
military jobs.&quot;[5]
<p>
The study on its face is suspect, because it didn't include a
male control group which would have provided a comparison in change
in strength.  Had such a control group existed, it is likely that
the outcomes would have shown that a higher percentage of males
would have qualified for &quot;very heavy&quot; military specialties.
<p>
The study also failed to address the impracticality of  keeping
women at that high physical standard especially when they are
away from the &quot;artificial&quot; lab environment without barbells
and Olympic trainers.  Is it proposed that a cadre of special
staff be organized to sustain the level of strength and fitness
necessary for women to be effective in combat?
<p>
There are many reasons to exclude women from combat including
the fact that women typically lack the essential physical strength
and endurance for survival.  Numerous government studies have
advised against pushing women into physically demanding military
jobs.  A General Accounting Office report which was done in the
late 1970s found that &quot;a large number&quot; of women in the
military were assigned to specialties that were too physically
demanding.[6]
<p>
A 1982 Army study concluded that the Army's ground combat mission
would be hampered if women were continually assigned to tasks
they could not physically perform.   The study found that women
were only 58 to 78 percent as capable as men in five measures
of fitness.[7]
<p>
These studies are now being ignored.  Feminizing the Army is politically
correct.  During President Clinton's first three years the Army
has been radically changed to admit more women, even though there
is no compelling reason to do so other than to satisfy the demands
of political correctness.
<p>
Secretary of the Army Togo West cheers military feminization.
He has said, &quot;Readiness will improve [after lifting more
combat exemptions for women] because we will have a larger pool
of quality soldiers from which to draw to fill critical jobs.&quot;[8]
<p>
West's any-sex-fits-all view clashes with the advice of many experienced
leaders. As Desert Storm hero and commander General Norman Schwarzkopf
testified to Congress, &quot;Decisions on what roles women should
play in war must be based on military standards, not women's rights.&quot;[9]
Regardless of the logic expressed by senior military commanders,
feminists remain dead-set on putting more women into harm's way.
<p>
Sherri Boulay, one of the women in the new study, believes some
women can qualify for ground combat &quot;with special training
and skills.&quot;  Certainly a few can qualify, but the military
recruits by category, and women as a category lack the requisite
physical strength.  Why should the Army incur the burden of conducting
special training to qualify a small number of women when there
are fully qualified men already available?
<p>
Mixed-sex training was tried in the late 1970s and discontinued
because it hurt male performance.  Recently reintroduced mixed-sex
basic training has changed, however.   There is more emphasis
on technical than physical skills.  The physical requirements
have been relaxed.  Running is now done in lightweight shoes rather
than boots.  During the running of the mandatory obstacle course
recruits are allowed to go around the wall if they can't climb
it.  Overnight bivouacs may be canceled because of rain.  Marching
routes are changed to avoid tough hills.  Is the enemy listening?
<p>
Major General Gene Deegan, commander at the Parris Island Marine
Corps Recruit Depot, warned the 1992 Presidential Commission on
the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, &quot;If I were to
maintain the same intensity for [women in training as] the male
recruits, I would have a very difficult time recruiting any females,
and if my recruiting mission remained the same, I would fail in
my recruiting mission.&quot;[11] The question must be asked, &quot;Is
recruiting the mission or is fighting wars the mission?&quot;
<p>
Reducing the physical training demands for soldiers is ill-advised
even if it enhances cross-gender &quot;cohesion.&quot;  Cross-gender
cohesion is the goal of social experimentation.  It must not be
the goal of a lean, mean, fighting machine.  This ignores the
stark realities of the battlefield and the physical differences
between the genders.
<p>
The 1992 Presidential Commission ran a study to investigate whether
women could meet the same physical fitness standards as men. 
It found that only 3.4 percent of women achieved a score equal
to the male mean score on the Army's physical fitness test.[12]
<p>
Women experience more than twice the number of lower extremity
injuries and over four times the number of stress fractures, the
report said.[13]
<p>
Without special training, the commission found, nature gives women
only 50 to 60 percent of the upper torso muscular strength of
men.  They have 70 to 75 percent of the aerobic capacity of men.[14]
<p>
The United States Military Academy requires all cadets to complete
an indoor obstacle course test.   The test evaluates a cadet's
muscular strength/endurance, flexibility, agility, and coordination.
The average completion time for the 10 obstacles is 2:50 (min:sec)
for men and 4:05 (min:sec) for women.[15]
<p>
Even in the civilian world, rational minds recognize the fundamental
differences between the physical capacities of men and women.
Dr. Mary Lloyd Ireland, a Kentucky orthopedic surgeon, studied
why female basketball players suffer twice as many serious knee
injuries as males and six times more anterior cruciate ligament
tears.  She attributes the problem in part to the fact that women's
bodies are less-suited than men's to absorb the driving and pounding
of sports.[16]
<p>
Ann Loucks, an associate professor of physiology at Ohio University,
found that hard physical work coupled with a caloric deficit
may have long-term effects  -- damaging a woman's reproductive
ability and losing bone minerals, which could lead to osteoporosis.
Extended periods of hard labor and limited caloric intake are
common military conditions.[17]
<p>
Because of undeniable differences in speed, strength and endurance
between men and women, women will always be in greater danger
than men on the battlefield -- just as they are in some urban
&quot;combat zones.&quot;  In terms of modern-day combat, women
do not have &quot;an equal opportunity to survive.&quot;
<p>
Good physical condition is important for both sexes.  But the
most physically demanding assignments should go to men who are
genetically predisposed to handling the toughest tasks.  If special
training is offered, it should go to men to give them an edge
over our enemies.  Even the best and strongest females are unlikely
to match most male enemies.
<p>
America's military is on a slippery slope.   Feminists and their
supporters want to gender-neutralize the military by incrementally
ditching commonsense policies.  This latest study, which claims
that women can be trained to be like men, contributes to this
misguided ideology, weakens the force structure at its core, and
puts America's military personnel in peril.

<title>JUDICIAL TERRORISM: A MORAL CRISIS</title>

<p>

<h2>JUDICIAL TERRORISM:<br>
A MORAL CRISIS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis and Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

Coloradans voted 54 to 46 percent in 1992 to approve a statewide
referendum that barred the state and local governments from enacting
laws that gave &quot;special rights&quot; to homosexuals.  In
a sweeping and unprecedented move, the Supreme Court on May 20,
1996, declared Colorado's &quot;special rights&quot; prohibition
unconstitutional.

<p>

The Supreme Court's decision striking down Colorado's law may
prove to be the cultural equivalent of <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.  That
1973 decision has resulted in the deaths of 30 million unborn
Americans.  This decision may result in the death of the traditional
family and the institution of marriage -- the very core of our
society.

<p>

Writing for the minority, Justice Antonin Scalia said there is
&quot;no foundation in American constitutional law&quot; for the
court's ruling.

<p>

Using strange (but politically correct) reasoning, the high court
equates limiting special treatment for homosexuals with denying
them equal protection under the constitution.  The fact is, no
one proposes to deny homosexuals their constitutional rights.
Colorado citizens merely chose to deny the establishment of another
class of citizens with more rights than other citizens.  Such
legal status has been reserved for the truly disadvantaged.  As
a group, however, homosexuals are renowned for being politically,
financially and otherwise advantaged.

<p>

Denying preferential treatment to a group whose identifying marker
may be criminal behavior can hardly be construed as violating
an individual's civil rights.  To do so would be a serious blow
to democracy.  To say that disallowing special treatment is the
same as denying equal protection is ludicrous.  Any group that
loses a political battle at the state level could be said to have
&quot;lost&quot; equal protection.

<p>

The court's decision opens the flood gates to potential litigation.
Any law based on the majority's moral beliefs is subject to being
labeled as &quot;hate-based&quot; or &quot;bigoted,&quot; and
groups affected by such laws are likely to seek legal redress.

<p>

Five states have constitutional prohibitions against polygamy.
With the new decision, people with a polygamous &quot;orientation&quot;
may logically complain that they have been singled out for unequal
treatment.  This same line of reasoning could be used by groups
identified by criminal behavior such as pedophilia.

<p>

Scalia wrote, &quot;The Court's disposition today suggests that
these provisions [polygamy prohibitions] are unconstitutional...unless,
of course, polygamists for some reason have fewer constitutional
rights than homosexuals.&quot;

<p>

The court's majority opinion also insults Coloradans by suggesting
that they are hateful. That's absurd. The will of the people
was to defend traditional sexual mores against a politically powerful
minority.  The homosexual rights agenda seeks to force Americans
to embrace their morality by using the law to declare homosexuality
the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.

<p>

Colorado, where sodomy is no longer illegal, made no attempt to
restrict homosexual conduct which is still illegal in 20 states
and in the U.S. armed forces.  Although many states have removed
criminal statutes for sodomy (the defining homosexual behavior)
the act is still widely held as being morally wrong and socially
harmful.

<p>

The court's majority opinion ignored the 1986 <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>
decision in which Georgia's sodomy law was declared constitutional.
If laws against sodomy are constitutional, then why must preferential
treatment be accorded to those whose defining characteristic is
their self-identification with the practice of sodomy?

<p>

After all, there is no reliable evidence that homosexuality is
genetic.  It is a behavior tragically afflicting less than two
percent of the population.  It is recognized by most psychiatric
associations around the world as pathological or as a sexual deviation.
According to a 1993 <I>Psychiatric News</I> report, only three
psychiatric associations out of 125 in the world -- including
the United States -- have declared homosexuality normal.

<p>

The <I>Romer v. Evans</I> decision is a severe blow to America's
moral heritage and will be used by homosexual rights activists
to further separate the family from its traditional Judeo-Christian
roots.  They will use this ruling to force religiously motivated
people to subsidize and promote behavior that they find morally
bankrupt and against their most deeply held beliefs.

<p>

The next target of the gay rights activists is the Defense of
Marriage Act (DOMA), which is now before Congress.  Given the
<I>Romer</I> decision, the high court may label DOMA as 
&quot;hate-mongering&quot; and rule it unconstitutional as well.
Think about that -- marriage itself constituting &quot;bigotry&quot;
because it requires both sexes.

<p>

It's time for Congress to assert its rightful place in the running
of our nation.  DOMA would send a strong message that Americans
will not knuckle under to judicial terrorism.  Its swift passage
is now more imperative than ever.

<title>REVAMPING THE DRUG WAR</title>

<p>

<h2>REVAMPING THE DRUG WAR</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

A recent rise in drug use among youth has some national leaders
flirting with the idea of legalizing drugs even though recent
history has shown that anti-drug abuse campaigns -- such as Nancy
Reagan's &quot;Just Say No&quot; program -- work.  Indeed, the
absence of such high-profile, nationalized efforts has no doubt
contributed to the recent rise in drug use among youth.

<p>

James Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America,
says, &quot;In the last two years, the numbers [of drug abusers]
have gone up dramatically.  We allowed it to happen.  We were
going in the right direction.  We took our eye off the ball.
Kids [today] view illegal drugs as less dangerous and more 
acceptable.&quot;

<p>

Burke attributes the attitude shift to fewer news stories about
the risks of drugs, more pro-drug information, more legalization
discussions, and glamorization of drugs by the pop culture.

<p>

The absence of committed leadership from federal authorities has
also contributed to the problem.  Since taking office, the Clinton
administration has been  pushing treatment rather than enforcement
-- a strategy known as &quot;harm reduction.&quot;  In 1995, the
budget share for interdiction was one-third of what it was in
1985.   Investigations, too, were reduced by 28 percent over this
same period.

<p>

Even though treatment funding has expanded by 119 percent in the
past five years, the number of persons treated has actually declined
by 9 percent.  Additional concerns are raised when one looks at
the distribution of taxpayer dollars within the drug programs.
In 1995, the $13 billion allocated to the war against drugs was
spread thinly among 18 federal agencies and 12 functional areas
(such as interdiction, prevention, treatment, etc.).  All in all,
the war involves more than 140 federal programs, each with its
own bureaucracy.  This scatter shot approach tries to spread enough
money around to drown the problem with resources.  Unfortunately,
only a small percentage of the money ever gets to the &quot;street.&quot;
The majority gets absorbed by infrastructure.

<p>

The vast majority of Americans -- 94 percent according to a December
1995 Gallup poll -- consider drug abuse a serious national problem
and want something done about it.  Large majorities oppose legalization
as a solution and most fault illicit drugs as a root cause of
many of America's social pathologies.

<p>

How bad is the problem?  A 1994 survey by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse found that marijuana use among 8th graders more
than doubled from 1991 to 1994, rising from 6.2 percent to over
13 percent.  A similar trend is evident among 10th and 12th graders
while adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack, heroin, speed and LSD
is also rising dramatically.

<p>

What are the consequences of increased drug abuse?   Andrew Peyton
Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and former NAACP counsel,
writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>, &quot;There
is...an undeniable relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug
addiction can both lower inhibitions among offenders and spur
them on to other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;   A
1993 Justice Department study of urban youths over a five-year
period found a direct connection between drug use and delinquency.

<p>

Since 1985, drug-related medical emergencies have skyrocketed
500 percent.   Most of the rise is blamed on heroin and crack
cocaine which are out of control, but the rebirth of designer
drugs like methamphetamine or &quot;speed&quot; is equally startling.
Attorney General Janet Reno said, &quot;[Meth] is spreading
across this country....  There should be no question...that methamphetamine
poses a real and serious threat to the citizens of our nation.&quot;

<p>

The war against drugs doesn't necessarily need more money, but
it does need a major overhaul in emphasis and implementation.

<p><ul>

<li><b>It needs committed leadership.</b> Battles are won tactically
but wars are won strategically.  A winning strategy requires a
leader with vision.  Presidents Bush and Clinton have given responsibility
to a drug czar who has virtually no authority.  One cannot delegate
responsibility unless one delegates commensurate authority to
get the job done.  The President must give this issue a constantly
high profile.

<p>

<li><b>It needs a single responsible federal agency emphasizing
interdiction and prevention.</b> The new drug czar, General Barry
McCaffrey, promises to reorganize his office into &quot;a more
effective mechanism.&quot;  But the drug war needs more than a
reshuffling of the czar's deck chairs.  He should be subordinate
to the Attorney General like the Surgeon General falls under the
Secretary for Health and Human Services.  That would eliminate
redundancies and improve the use of taxpayer dollars. He should
coordinate America's drug interdiction effort and speak out against
abuse.  Let local communities do the rest.  They can do a far
better job than the federal government.

<p>

<li><b>It needs focus on faith-based treatment programs.</b>
Let faith-based organizations tailor prevention and treatment
to local needs.  The best drug abuse prevention and treatment
programs are faith-based, yet they are often denigrated by federal
bureaucrats.

</ul><p>

To desert the war in the face of rising drug abuse is wrong.
Instead, the drug war must refocus on committed leadership, government
interdiction and prevention, and faith-based treatment programs.

<title>ON BEING AN AMERICAN</title>

<p>

<h2>ON BEING AN AMERICAN</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>

<p>

Immigration reform is a hot topic today, and it's mostly fueled
by the real concern that illegal aliens are taking jobs and undercutting
wages for American citizens.  But, in the zeal to combat illegal
immigration, there has been an unfortunate side-effect --  too
often legal and illegal immigrants have been lumped together under
the category of &quot;foreign-born.&quot;

<p>

This use of &quot;foreign-born&quot; is troubling because it furthers
the notion that legal immigrants are &quot;one of them&quot; and
not &quot;one of us.&quot;

<p>

But legal immigrants <I>are</I> &quot;one of us.&quot;  Virtually
<I>every</I> American -- whether first-generation American or
10th-generation American -- has an immigrant heritage.  Legal
immigration (whether in the 1780s, 1880s or 1980s) has helped
America flourish.

<p>

Henry and Eunice are two such examples.  In August 1961, Henry
arrived in America at the age of 25.  Having graduated from the
most prestigious university in Taiwan, he was one of a select
few to be granted student visas to the U.S.  He did not hail from
a privileged background (he was the only one of seven siblings
to attend college), but he wanted to come to America because he
firmly believed that America was and is &quot;the land of opportunity.&quot;
He was eventually enabled to come to the U.S. because his eldest
sister, recognizing the opportunities America would afford her
brother, generously lent him all the savings that she had earned
from her job laundering other people's clothes so that he could
afford the cost of his plane ticket.

<p>

Since Henry came to America with virtually nothing, he spent his
first night at a local YMCA.  On his second day, he contacted
another immigrant friend who helped him find a place to live and
a dishwashing job paying $10 a day.  Later, Henry met and married
his wife Eunice (a Taiwanese immigrant who came to America on
a student visa to study physics), and they both worked to pay his 
way through graduate school -- he as a dishwasher and lab technician, 
and she as a clerical worker.

<p>

Neither of them has ever collected welfare or sought financial
aid from the government.  Instead, these two immigrants have worked
hard to fulfill the American dream.  Henry has an accomplished
record as a professional cheminal engineer for more than 20 years
and now manages his own real estate enterprise.  Henry and Eunice
have become homeowners, and they helped found a church in Los
Angeles that now has more than 30 branches around the world.

<p>

While America has certainly granted this couple economic opportunity,
it has more importantly given them freedom -- freedom of speech,
religion, and assembly without fear of reprisal.  For example,
for many years, Henry was very active in calling on the United
States to acknowledge Taiwan as a free and independent nation
and to support its fledgling movement towards democracy.  But
while his political activism left him blacklisted by the ruling
Taiwanese government, he could freely express his views to American
politicians as well as activate others who shared his views on
the grass-roots level.

<p>

Henry and Eunice not only exercise the freedoms given to them
by the United States, they also recognize that &quot;freedom is
not free.&quot;  Thus, they taught their children never to take
these freedoms for granted, but to appreciate, cherish, and defend
them.  Perhaps that is why one of their daughters was the first
Taiwanese-American female to graduate from West Point and is now
a captain in the U.S. Army.

<p>

America is unique among nations because its citizens, unlike those
of other countries, are bound together not by a shared ethnic
heritage or a common religion.  Rather, Americans share a set
of principles and an idealism which inspired the Declaration of
Independence and the U.S. Constitution.  So while both Henry and
Eunice have learned to speak English fluently and their children
have all settled in areas far from the ethnic familiarity of Southern
California -- South Dakota, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C.
-- they are Americans not for these external symbols of assimilation,
but because they have pledged their allegiance to the common principles
which make America &quot;one nation under God, indivisible, with
liberty and justice for all.&quot;

<p>

Admittedly, America has not always lived up to these high ideals,
as Henry and Eunice can well attest.  Indeed, they have experienced
the sting of racism firsthand -- from being denied service at
restaurants to being ridiculed for their accents to even being
implicitly denied entrance into the residential community of their
choice because the real estate agent made it clear that she did
not want &quot;people like them&quot; moving into her neighborhood.

<p>

But the fact remains that this couple chose to adopt America as
their own country.  And because they chose deliberately, with
great sacrifice, they don't take its privileges for granted.

<p>

Historians have long acknowledged and celebrated the manifold
contributions of our immigrant ancestors to this country -- economically,
intellectually, demographically, and culturally.  But to my mind,
the most significant contribution of these two immigrants I call
Mom and Dad is that they modeled for me, better than anyone else
I know, what it is to be an American.

<h2>GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT PUSH<br>
ANTI-WOMAN MATERIAL</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S. Army, Retired)</i></center>

<p>

In a recent letter, a female U.S. Army officer based in Bosnia
told the Family Research Council that pornography &quot;degrades
the command atmosphere of respecting fellow soldiers and adds
to the possibility of misconduct....It is offensive to women serving
in the armed forces to be subjected to the rampant presence of
pornography.&quot;  The feelings expressed by this soldier are
shared by many others, and the end result is a decrease in morale,
unit integrity and overall readiness.

<p>

Some men want pornography to stimulate their sexual desires, but
this does not justify the government selling it to them at a discount
and tax-free.  That's why Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-M.D.) amended
the 1997 Defense Authorization Act to include language banning
future military sales of pornographic material.  This bill will
be debated in the House on May 15.

<p>

Government vending of pornography through the military exchange
system sends the message that profiting from material that demeans
women is okay.  This message is becoming increasingly unwelcome
to a growing cohort of female soldiers.  In fact, common sense
and science tell us that readily available pornographic material
encourages, rather than discourages, episodes like Tailhook, the
rape in Okinawa, and a sailor groping a female airline passenger.

<p>

It also hurts retention.  The Pentagon makes a big deal of family
issues because half of all military members are married.  For
many military spouses, who often are limited to shopping at government
exchanges, the sale of pornography is not only offensive, but
pornography consumption can be a contributing factor to the breakdown
of a marriage.  You can bet this impacts their husbands' retention
and, in effect, ratchets down military readiness yet another notch.

<p>

An Air Force wife complained that at her local exchange &quot;pornography
is viewed and then carelessly discarded on lower shelves, on top
of children's comic books, and I've seen one on an ice cream machine
at our base convenience store that children frequent after school.&quot;

<p>

The target of the bill is pornography, not romance novels or classic
art.  Pornography is Greek for &quot;depictions of the activities
of whores.&quot;  It is, by definition, sexually explicit and
intended primarily for the purpose of sexual arousal.  The Uniform
Code of Military Justice labels many of the activities described
and shown in this material as criminal if done by a servicemember.

<p>

There is a growing body of science which points to a direct association
between the consumption of pornography and sexual misconduct.
This should be a red flag for the military, which is experiencing
increased levels of sexual misbehavior.

<p>

The 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography cites studies
which show that over half of rapists say they were &quot;incited
to commit an offense&quot; by pornography and that 42 percent
of child molesters &quot;implicated pornography&quot; in their
crimes.

<p>

A book by Don Gibbons, <I>Society, Crime, and Criminal Behavior</I>,
a copy of which is in the Pentagon library, cites a national study
that found that readership of sexually explicit magazines like
<I>Hustler</I> and <I>Playboy</I> (both of which are sold in military
stores) were highly correlated with rape rates.

<p>

Dr. Victor Cline, a clinical psychologist at the University of
Utah, chronicled the stages of addiction to pornography based
on his work with over 200 sex offenders.  He found that pornography
is a powerful stimulant that requires ever more explicit images
in order to reach the previous level of sexual arousal.  At some
point the addict may act out sexual fantasies inspired by the
material.

<p>

Pornographic material may also be a form of sexual harassment.
Sociologist Diana Russell states in her paper &quot;Pornography,
A Feminist Perspective&quot; that &quot;pornography is vicious,
anti-woman propaganda.  It tells lies about us.  It degrades women.
Pornography is not made to educate but to sell and, for the most
part, what sells it is a bunch of lies about sex and women.&quot;

<p>

Why does the Pentagon refuse to dump this material?  The contention
is that &quot;any attempt to prohibit the sale of magazines currently
available through the exchange services would raise serious constitutional
and administrative problems.&quot;  But the issue is not really
about constitutional rights, it is a matter of money.  Selling
smut in government stores is a big business decision.

<p>

The Pentagon sells 12.6 million copies of 219 different pornographic
magazines every year.  Its earnings are $4.3 million.  Customers
pay less than the market price and pay no tax.

<p>

Pornography is also the third highest profit industry in organized
crime -- after narcotics and gambling.  The FBI estimates the
pornography industry to be an $8-10 billion-a-year enterprise.

<p>

This is not a freedom of speech issue, because no one is advocating
denying soldiers the opportunity to buy legal pornography off
base and keep it in their barracks.

<p>

The Pentagon should not have constitutional concerns but moral
ones. Few federal judges would force the military to sell pornography,
those who would ought to become candidates for impeachment.

<p>

The constitutional obligation in this area belongs to Congress.
That obligation is to protect the military's combat fitness.
Under Article 1, Section 8, the Congress is duty bound to set
the rules and regulations for the military.  If Congress declares
that selling pornography is bad for readiness, then it has both
the right and obligation to rid exchange shelves of the smut.
The Supreme Court generally gives Congress special deference
in matters affecting the military.

<p>

Unfortunately, some base commanders, wishing to remove this material
from exchanges, have been told &quot;no&quot; by bureaucrats.
The threat of lawsuits has intimidated them.  There are some
exceptions, however.

<p>

The captain of the carrier <I>America</I> received a complaint
about a magazine sold in his ship's store.  The April 1984 issue
of <I>Hustler</I> magazine included graphic pictures of a woman
engaged in a sex act with a crucifix.  The ship's supply officer
was ordered to deep-six the magazine, and the order went unchallenged.

<p>

Marine commanders at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, ignored bureaucrats
when it came to a local purveyor of pornography.  Eugene's Arcade
was placed &quot;off limits&quot; to military personnel.  When
the shop owner filed a suit alleging violation of his rights of
free speech, federal judge W. Earl Britt dismissed it, concluding,
&quot;A military commander has an overriding duty to safeguard
the morals, welfare and discipline of his men.&quot;

<p>

President Clinton has unilateral authority to remove pornographic
material from military stores.  His executive order could prohibit
such sales all over the world, but there is no evidence the White
House is about to sign such an order.

<p>

That leaves the Congress with the responsibility to pass the Military
Honor and Decency Act.  It is the right thing to do.  It will
enhance readiness and reduce the cancer-like spread of pornography
that contributes to sexual misconduct.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: WHAT THE EXPERTS HAVE TO SAY</title>

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF<br>
MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
WHAT THE EXPERTS<br>
HAVE TO SAY</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>

<p>

Amid the clamor over action in the House and Senate on the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), the Family Research Council held a briefing
recently for Capitol Hill staff.

<p>

A national C-SPAN audience heard from a psychiatrist, a legal
scholar, a social worker, a former school principal, an adoption
specialist and a former homosexual, among others.  Their highlighted
statements shed light on homosexuality and the need for DOMA.

<p>

<I>Jeffrey Satinover, M.D., former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child
Psychiatry at Yale</I>: &quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have
sunk deeply into public sentiment where they exert a powerful
influence in the shaping of public policy as it relates to family,
sexuality and marriage.  1) Homosexuality is genetic, and that
consequently, 2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.

<p>

&quot;Neither idea is true, and in fact there is a mountain of
scientific evidence to the contrary.  The Americans most severely
harmed by the propagation of these untruths are the very large
number of homosexuals who wish nothing more than to rid themselves
of these unwanted impulses and establish quiet marriages and families.
The gay and lesbian activism that claims to speak for these many
struggling fellow citizens speaks for their interests in no way
whatsoever.  Completely ignored are the very large number of people
who have already succeeded in leaving homosexuality behind.&quot;

<p>

<I>Hadley Arkes, Professor of Jurisprudence and American Institutions
at Amherst</I>:  &quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument
that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the
remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but ... they have the
most profound interest...in discrediting the notion that marriage
finds its defining ground in 'nature.'
We can count on the fact that there will be someone, somewhere,
ready to press this issue by raising a challenge in the court....This
[Defense of Marriage] Act is the most delicate and limited measure
that the Congress could produce [and] it makes the least intrusion
into the domain of State law.&quot;

<p>

<I>Anthony Falzarano, executive director of Transformation Ministries</I>:
&quot;I speak to you today not just as an observer of this movement,
but as one of them.  I am a former homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle
from the time I was 17 until I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't
realize is that although I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did
not have to be gay.  I had a choice.  I could change my orientation....four
national ex-gay networks are currently ministering to more than
10,000 former homosexuals.  Many of us are sick and tired of a
lifestyle that initially seems very freeing but eventually puts
us in all kinds of bondage and eventually will kill us.  I have
lost over 35 of my friends and acquaintances to the disease of
AIDS and don't want to see one more person become infected....&quot;

<p>

<I>Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies at Family Research
Council</I>: &quot;Most Americans believe in 'live and let live.'
But tolerance is not what homosexual activists  seek.  They are
demanding that society elevate homosexuality to the moral level
of marriage.  When they bring the law into it, they are imposing
it on every citizen.  If you are a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim,
or just believe that homosexuality is wrong, and the law gives
homosexuality protected status, then your personal beliefs are
now outside civil law.  The entire civil rights apparatus can
be brought against you.  Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality
or face legal sanction; schoolchildren will have to be taught
that homosexuality is equivalent to marital love.&quot;

<p>

<I>Linda Page, former school principal and education consultant</I>:
&quot;Our kids will be bombarded with the propaganda from books
such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>....Same-sex
'marriage' is a result of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking
and of 'value-neutral' curriculums....We have communicated to
students that all values are equal.  How ludicrous....&quot;

<p>

<I>Peter LaBarbera, publisher of</I> The Lambda Report 
on Homosexuality: &quot;Activists have shamelessly
exploited the issue of 'gay youth' suicide to promote pro-homosexuality
programs in schools....they routinely claim that homosexual youth
make up one third of all youth suicides.  This wildly exaggerated
figure has its origins in a paper by a San Francisco gay activist
which was repudiated by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan.&quot;

<p>

<I>Brenda Destro, Adjunct Professor on
Marriage and Family at the John Paul II Institute and former consultant
for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Adolescent Pregnancy</I>: &quot;Many...(junior
and high school) teens and preteens...have one close girlfriend
and boys have one close boyfriend.  This is an important phase
in learning emotional intimacy that is crucial to forming healthy
relationships....So what happens to the preteens and teens who
receive information about homosexuality and same-sex 'marriages'
at the same time that they are bonding with their friends (around
the ages of 11-14)...?  Confusion can turn to a fear that they
may be homosexual, when they are not.&quot;

<p>

<I>Mary Beth Style, M.S.W., adoption expert</I>: 
&quot;Obviously, if the states begin to recognize marriage between
homosexuals, it will likely become easier for two homosexuals
to adopt a child because they will be meeting the marriage requirement....
There is no 'right' to adopt, and to create one would be contrary
to the best interests of children, because instead of finding
the most appropriate family for a child, the state and its agents
would have to ensure that adults are allowed to adopt a child.
Since a 'right' is a guarantee, the state would be required to
'guarantee' a child for adoption.&quot;

<p>

The above testimonies show the logical
fallacies of misnaming same-sex unions as &quot;marriage&quot;
and the devastating implications for society.  Our concern for
families, children, and the natural and sacred ties that secure
our culture underscore the need for the Defense of Marriage Act.

<title>A HIGHER PRO-LIFE TEST</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">

<p>

<h2>A HIGHER PRO-LIFE TEST</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>

<p>

Marvin Olasky's &quot;stricter&quot; pro-life litmus test (<I>World</I>, 
November 11, 1995) moved me to respond.  Few Christians have
done more to advance the pro-life cause than Dr. Olasky.  I honor
his spiritual commitment, his deep scholarship and his passion
for unborn children.  I am grateful, especially, for Marvin and
Susan's cross-racial adoption of a young son.  As the son of an
adopted father, I thank the Lord for their good hearts.

<p>

Still, I must dissent, because I do not believe that my friend's
formulation advances the effort to protect innocent, unborn children.
While I fully agree that we should ask those who would govern
us to go <I>beyond</I> mere formal and legalistic support for
a Human Life Amendment, we must insist that they go <I>at least
that far.</I> We have heard similar arguments by pro-life leaders
that we might be better off with a &quot;culturally conservative&quot;
president, one who speaks out for abstinence and for personal
responsibility than with a leader who gives mere &quot;lip service&quot;
to the <I>chimera</I> of a Human Life Amendment.

<p>

This, regrettably, is the logical fallacy of the false dilemma.
We have never sought insincere pro-life leadership.  We fully
understand that only those who are themselves convinced are likely
to be convincing to others.  But if we abandon a <I>higher test</I>
for pro-life support, we risk losing everything we have sought
in public policy.

<p>

What is that higher test?  It can be stated simply.  Lincoln said
that God gave man a hand and a mouth.  &quot;And his hand has
a right to bring bread to his mouth without controversy.&quot;
This simple and eloquent statement provided the philosophical
foundation for the Emancipator's opposition to slavery.  Examined
closely, it also provides the platform for Christian opposition
to abortion.

<p>

God forms the child in the womb.  He forms her lungs and her lips.
Her lungs have a right to draw past her lips the air He has so
graciously provided <I>without controversy.</I> Lincoln knew
that &quot;if slavery was not wrong, then nothing is wrong.&quot;
We know that if abortion is not wrong, then nothing is wrong.

<p>

This nation cannot survive as a political community if we turn
our back on this fundamental principle of right and wrong.  Some
<I>in society</I> will carry the burden of all private means to
provide alternatives to abortion.  They deserve the honor and
gratitude of the Ages. They tend the moral lights around us.
They shield the flame of conscience.

<p>

But what we need from those <I>in public office</I> is an understanding
of why government exists. Jefferson said that &quot;the care
of  human life and happiness <I>and not their destruction</I>
is the first and only legitimate object of good government [emphasis
added].&quot;  It was this understanding that infused our Declaration
of Independence. It was this understanding that Lincoln expressed
so convincingly in his Gettysburg Address. Lose that understanding
and we lose America.

<p>

What is at stake is not just the millions of human lives that
will be sacrificed if we abandon our commitment to the constitutional
protection of innocent human life. These lives are precious and
irreplaceable.  We pro-lifers must stand as well for the continued
life of this land we love.  Pope John Paul II put Lincoln's immortal
words at Gettysburg in the form of a question: &quot;Can any
nation so conceived and so dedicated long endure?&quot;  America
cannot survive the death of her spirit.

<p>

Surely, we need to create a pro-life culture.  Just as surely,
it is cruel and unjust <I>court rulings</I> which prevent Americans
from expressing those pro-life convictions they already hold.
How else can we explain the deplorable action of the Supreme
Court in striking down the abortion laws of 50 states?  How else
can we explain inferior courts' contemptuous sweeping away of
a host of protective laws passed since the <I>Webster</I> decision
of 1989?  It is these <I>political bodies</I> which are strangling
pro-life culture in a back alley.

<p>

Dr. King certainly shared the goal of a just society in which
no one would be judged by the color or his skin, but by &quot;the
content of his character.&quot;  Yet, that cultural goal never
diverted him from supporting timely political action against lynching.
&quot;I know a law cannot make a white racist love me,&quot;
he said, &quot;but the chances are much better that he will <I>learn</I> 
to love me if he hasn't lynched me first!&quot;

<p>

Imagine you are seated next to the president of the United States
and that the two of you are forced to witness a partial-birth
abortion.  Imagine further that he is the only one in the world
with power to stop the abortionist from jamming his scissors into
the base of the little girl's skull.  Do you want a &quot;culturally
conservative&quot; but &quot;pro-choice&quot; president to be
in that room with you?  Or do you want a president who believes
that it is morally and constitutionally wrong to take that little
girl's life?

<p>

So let's petition all those who would have power over us.  Let's
remind them of their duty to defend innocent human life.  We must
call them to a higher test -- support for a Human Life Amendment. Let's 
honor all those who are giving practical and loving support to women 
who choose life.  But let's give power only to those who understand that 
they have no authority unless it comes from above.

<title>A BURNING NEED FOR RECONCILIATION</title>

<p>

<h2>A BURNING NEED FOR<br>
RECONCILIATION</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

In the last 14 months, 19 black churches in the South have been
torched, and federal authorities have ample evidence that racism
is the motivation.

<p>

Americans of all races must reject such bigotry.  Reconciliation
must begin with the same institution that brought about racial
healing in the 1960s, the church.  A hint of how this might happen
occurred during a mass rally recently in the Georgia Dome.

<p>

On February 13-15, approximately 43,000 pastors met in the Georgia
Dome to remove the barriers of racism and denominationalism. 
Pastors of all races gathered to worship and be encouraged.  Bishop
Wellington Boone, a black pastor, told how the black community
often finds fault with itself, so much so that there hasn't been
spiritual renewal in the black community for more than 100 years.

<p>

Dr. Raleigh Washington said that the black community is wrapped
up in past problems that affect the present and future life. 
Following Washington's presentation, Dr. Jack Hayford, a white
pastor, spoke and asked all African-American, Indian, Hispanic
and Asian pastors to forgive the white man for how he has hurt
and offended them in the past.  It was a dramatic time as he asked
for forgiveness on behalf of all whites.

<p>

Later, Promise Keeper founder and former University of Colorado
football coach Bill McCartney urged church leaders to commit themselves
to racial reconciliation.

<p>

Although there has been some progress in racial reconciliation
since the 1960s, there are still serious, lingering examples of
racial division.  Two months ago, arson destroyed a black church
in Knoxville, Tennessee.  This was the fifth black church in Tennessee
to burn in 13 months. The church's charred remains revealed 
spray-painted, racist graffiti. After the church burning, a racist 
letter was circulated promising that if interracial relationships 
continued, white supremacists would embark on a reign of terror.

<p>

Dewey Roberts, the president of the Knoxville chapter of the NAACP
blames &quot;a strong racist element within the community,&quot;
the <I>Boston Globe</I> reported.  One of the pastors of the burned
Knoxville church, Rev. Jerry Upton observed, &quot;None of us
want to believe that this can happen in America in 1996.&quot;

<p>

That church burning wasn't Knoxville's only racially-motivated
incident.  There was an unsolved cross-burning last year.  Additionally,
in another part of Tennessee this month, three white men will
be sentenced under federal civil rights law for burning two black
churches a year ago.

<p>

Meanwhile, two black churches were destroyed in west Alabama.
The publisher of a west Alabama weekly newspaper,  John Zippert,
told the <I>New York Times</I>, &quot;I don't think any of this
was accidental.  I think these particular churches were targeted.
You have white churches in between all of them that were not
touched.&quot;

<p>

Morris Dees, the head of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,
a nonprofit agency that tracks hate groups and tries to promote
racial harmony, dismissed Zippert's explanation.  This area in
Alabama is not where white supremacist groups thrive.  He suggested,
&quot;This is deer hunting season and you have a lot of hunting
clubs up there, and a lot of drunk white boys who might be angry
at not getting a deer,&quot; the <I>Times</I> reported.

<p>

According to the <I>USA Today</I> report, of the 19 church burning
incidents since January 1995, seven occurred in the last two months
in seven different states: North and South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

<p>

These church burnings have drawn national attention.  NAACP Washington
Bureau director Wade Henderson urged Attorney General Janet Reno
to initiate an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the
burned churches.  In a letter to Reno at the end of January 1996,
Henderson wrote, &quot;There appears to be a discernible pattern
which links the fires including the surprisingly large number,
and the fact that they have occurred at small, predominately black
churches in small communities.&quot;

<p>

Reno says she is investigating the fires to determine whether
they were racially motivated.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms is studying the incidents to determine whether there
is any organized and conspiratorial ring traveling from state
to state.

<p>

Meanwhile, seven Christian-based groups wrote Senator Orrin Hatch
and Congressman Henry Hyde, chairmen of the Congressional Judiciary
Committees, urging them to hold &quot;prompt hearings on the wave
of arson and other attacks on churches and church properties across
the United States.&quot;

<p>

Whether there is an organized conspiracy or these events are just
copycat incidents, they evince an unhealthy racial division. 
There must be healing and the church is central to the issue.

<p>

Just as the black church led the way in the 1960s, today's church
leaders of every color must answer the call and commit to healing
the wounds of racism that divide us.

<title>LEAVING THE VULNERABLE OPEN TO ABUSE</title>

<p>

<h2>LEAVING THE VULNERABLE<br>
OPEN TO ABUSE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>

<p>

It used to be that the man in every girl's life was her father.
He was her protector and provider, shielding her honor and ensuring
her safety.

<p>

But today, with the rise in illegitimacy and divorce, fewer fathers
are around to protect and defend their daughters' safety and honor.
With more girls lacking the love and attention that only a father
can give, more of them are willing to settle for perverse alternatives,
namely, seeking intimacy with predatory adult men.

<p>

Numerous studies, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services' <I>National Health Interview Survey</I> (1988), have
found that children from disrupted families are at a much higher
risk for physical or sexual abuse than children from intact, two-parent
families.  Furthermore, children whose parents separate are significantly
more likely to engage in early sexual activity than their peers
from intact, two-parent families, according to a 1994 study in
<I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</I>.
But the latest statistics are even more shocking.

<p>

For example, a recent study by the Population Reference Bureau
found that about two-thirds of births to teenage girls nationwide
are fathered by adult men age 20 or older.

<p>

State health figures in Massachusetts confirm this finding.  In
1993 (the latest data available), more than half of the state's
teen pregnancies were sired by adult men.  Almost 60 percent of
the fathers in 3,663 births to teen moms were men aged 20-29,
and another 139 births resulted from teen girls having sex with
men aged 30 and older.

<p>

Likewise, a review of California's 1990 vital statistics found
that men older than high school age accounted for 77 percent of
all births among high school-aged girls (ages 16-18) and for 51 percent 
of births among junior high school-aged girls (15 and younger).  Men over
age 25 fathered twice as many teenage births as did boys under
age 18, while senior high school boys fathered only 24 percent
of births among all teenage girls.

<p>

Additionally, the Alan Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex
and America's Teenagers,&quot; found that six of 10 girls who
had sex before age 15 were coerced by males an average of six
years their senior.

<p>

Fatherlessness, however, not only creates the environment for
more vulnerable girls, it also helps create more predatory males.
Research clearly shows that boys who grow up without fathers
are far more likely to engage in violent behavior and promiscuity
than those who grow up in two-parent homes.  Indeed, according
to a 1990 article by Nicholas Davidson in <I>Policy Review</I>,
60 percent of America's rapists grew up in homes without fathers.

<p>

While absent fathers figure prominently in this new phenomenon
of child abuse, they are not solely to blame for the devastation.
The &quot;village&quot; has also failed in its responsibility
to protect children.  For example, television and movies regularly
expose children to sexually explicit images, glamorizing sex and
violence.

<p>

Lax enforcement of statutory rape laws has also added fuel to
the fire.  Although renewed efforts to prosecute and punish statutory
rapists, such as those undertaken by California governor Pete
Wilson, are needed and ought to be encouraged, a law enforcement
strategy alone cannot stem the tide.  Prevention must be emphasized.

<p>

Some have proposed that the way to &quot;prevent&quot; this problem
is to expose children at progressively younger and younger ages
to more explicit sex education in the school, so that children
can learn how to protect themselves with condoms, etc.  But this
scenario is a textbook case in which the &quot;cure&quot; is far
worse than the disease.  Clearly, such an approach will only exacerbate
the problem.

<p>

For example, the results of the National Survey of Adolescent
Males published in the November 1993 issue of <I>Public Health
Reports</I> show that young males who were taught about birth
control were more likely to experiment with sex at an earlier
age than if they had been taught nothing at all.

<p>

Furthermore, and more significantly, explicit sex education tears
down the natural inhibitions and defenses of both young boys and
girls, leaving them vulnerable to sexual predators.  Indeed, it
is a well-documented fact that pedophiles often use pornography
to lure their young victims.

<p>

That pedophiles attempt to wear down the defenses of the young
through pornography is bad enough, but this type of desensitizing
is now systematically taking place within schools through sex
education programs.  Unlike the sex education classes which parents
may remember, sex education today is explicit, graphic, and is
being taught in coed settings.  In fact, the Sex Information and
Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), a federally-funded,
nationally-recognized organization, has issued national sex education
guidelines which promote teaching kindergartners about masturbation
and junior and senior high school students about the &quot;benefits&quot;
of pornography, among other topics.

<p>

This current trend of adult men impregnating teenage girls is
a natural consequence of family breakdown and the sexualization
of children.  But what children need now -- and have always needed
-- is for adults to protect their innocence.  They need fathers
and mothers who will love and supervise them, laws that punish
statutory rapists, and school programs which do nothing to harm
the value, sanctity, and sacred mystery of sex.  Only then can
this tide be turned.  And if we are to survive as a society, it
must.

<title>THE LEAST OF THESE</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>THE LEAST OF THESE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson</i></center>

<p>

Does increased social spending equate with better childhoods?
For lack of a better answer, both Republicans and Democrats have
been inclined to say &quot;yes.&quot;  Spending by the federal
government on social programs for children and families has increased
dramatically since 1960, far exceeding the rate of inflation.
Yet, almost all indicators suggest that more children today are
living just this side of despair than was true three decades ago.

<p>

Social spending advocates made their mistake in expecting government
to substitute for mothers and fathers.  Noted child psychologist
Urie Bronfenbrenner has written that what children need more than
government programs is the &quot;irrational emotional attachment&quot;
of parents who love them fiercely.  Even Bill Clinton stated in
his acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention
that &quot;governments do not raise children -- parents do.&quot;

<p>

It's time to take the rhetoric seriously and to acknowledge that
government can't buy love for children any more than money can
buy happiness for adults.  What children really need is a mom
and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3><i>Parents, Not Programs</i></h3></center>

<p>

Rather than winking at government's creeping encroachment on families,
Congress should move quickly to pass pending parental rights legislation
(S. 984; H.R. 1946).  The legislation would neither create new
rights for parents nor repeal child abuse laws that protect children
when families break down.  The new law would simply protect parents'
rights to decide what is best for their children without excessive
interference from Washington.

<p>

Having affirmed the central importance of parents, government
does sometimes have a role to play in helping parents care for
the young ones in their charge.  One good example is &quot;Megan's
Law,&quot; which Congress has just passed and the President signed.
The new law requires states to notify local law officials when
convicted sex offenders are released from prison and requires
local police to notify the public when a sex offender who is deemed
dangerous moves into the local neighborhood.

<p>

<center><h3><i>Yes to Adoption</i></h3></center>

<p>

The community, of course, must step in to provide for children
who have no parents to call their own.  But the importance of
parents remains the same  -- and probably greater -- for children
who are alone.  The best government can do is to speed a child
on his way into a loving home where adoptive parents are prepared
to love him fiercely and forever.

<p>

&quot;The Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996&quot;
(H.R. 3286), passed by the House but not yet the Senate, could
open windows of hope for vulnerable children currently free to
be adopted.  In the United States alone, there are more than 50,000
foster children hoping to be adopted.  More than 20,000 children
have been waiting for a family for a matter of years.  The new
legislation includes a $5,000 non-refundable tax credit for qualified
adoption expenses (for both domestic and international adoptions).
In order to eliminate unnecessary waiting periods for minority
children in foster care, the legislation also prohibits the use
of racial considerations if they cause a delay or denial of an
adoption placement.

<p>

<center><h3><i>No to Foster Care</i></h3></center>

<p>

New adoption incentives will help some children, but Conna Craig,
President of the Institute for Children, argues that nothing less
than an overhaul of the foster care system will save children
like John.  A skinny kid who loves baseball, John has been waiting
for a home for nearly all of his 10 years.  Legally free to be
adopted since he was 3 years old, John is a prisoner of the system
whose childhood is fast slipping away.  He needs policymakers
to understand that standing for children means giving every child
a chance to have a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3><i>It Takes a &quot;Village&quot;</i></h3></center>

<p>

Even strong two-parent families require strong communities to
help pattern for children right habits of the heart.  When so
many children are languishing without families of their own, community
becomes all the more important.

<p>

&quot;The American Community Renewal Act of 1996,&quot; spearheaded
by Congressmen James Talent (R-Mo.) and J.C. Watts (R-Okla.),
will strengthen communities more than any government handout could
by offering tax incentives for charitable giving, public housing
reform, and an end to government regulations that stifle economic
development in depressed neighborhoods.  By rebuilding communities,
we stand to strengthen the hands of parents -- and to restore
some of childhood's lost innocence.

<p>

It's right and fair to admit that it takes a village, as long
as we really mean a local &quot;village&quot; that preserves parent
autonomy, instead of a federal plantation that chains both children
and families to an all-powerful state.

<h2>JUVENILE VIOLENCE<br>
INCREASING</h2>

<p>

Murder rates may be down, but not among adolescents, according
to a recent Justice Department report.  Since 1965, there has
been a 467 percent increase in the murder arrest rate for 18-year-olds.
The future murder trends suggest ever-younger offenders.  Something
must be done.
<p>
On a typical day in 1994, nine teenagers in the U.S. were murdered
and 13 teenagers committed a murder, the report said.  According
to Attorney General Janet Reno, the problem of children killing
is likely to worsen because demographics show that the key at-risk
population -- 14- to 17-year-olds -- will increase significantly
in years to come.
<p>
In 10 years there will be 23 percent more teenagers and, given
current trends, murder could increase to 40,000 killings per year
 -- that's a 67 percent rise!   James Q. Wilson, co-editor of
the book <I>Crime</I>, said, &quot;So we should expect, unless
something changes dramatically, that the [now lower] crime rate
will go back up.&quot;
<p>
While social scientists cannot show definite cause-and-effect
relationships for murder,  they can demonstrate that certain conditions
highly correlate with the increase in juvenile violence.  For
example, parental absence increases a child's likelihood of future
criminal behavior.
<p>
A 1990 study by June O'Neill, a professor with Baruch College
of the City University of New York, shows that men from single-parent
families are twice as likely to commit crimes as men from two-parent
families. Robert Sampson, professor of sociology at the University of 
Chicago, notes that it is harder for single-parent families to achieve
the &quot;informal social controls&quot; that limit both crime
and victimization.  &quot;There are higher crime rates in places
where communities are not characterized by strong families,&quot;
he said.
<p>
Even children from two-parent homes suffer when both parents are
absent most of the day due to outside jobs.  A Justice Department
study concluded that parental supervision, attachment to family,
and consistency of discipline were the most important barriers
to delinquency and drug abuse.
<p>
Likewise, drug abuse which directly correlates with delinquent
behavior, is on the rise among adolescents.  Andrew Peyton Thomas,
Arizona assistant attorney general and former NAACP counsel, writes
in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>, &quot;There is...an
undeniable relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug addiction
can both lower inhibitions among offenders and spur them on to
other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;
<p>
A 1993 Justice Department study of 4,000 urban youths over a five-year
period identified a pattern leading to delinquency.  The study
found a direct connection between drug use and delinquent behavior.
<p>
Finally, most Americans blame pop culture as a third reason for
increases in youth violence.  According to the Family Research
Council's 1995 nationwide poll (conducted by Voter/Consumer Research),
more than nine of every 10 Americans believe the media affects
violent crime to some extent.
<p>
Robert McAffee, president of the American Medical Association,
agrees.  He said, &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures,
rap music and video games, there's a continuing influence of 
violence....[and] violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;
<p>
By age 18, the average child watches 100,000 acts of television
violence, according to Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based
child psychologist.  Before the end of elementary school, the
average child witnesses 8,000 television murders, Butterworth
adds.  This much violence has an undeniable affect.
<p>
According to an analysis of 275 studies, George Comstock, a professor
at Syracuse University, says that perhaps 10 percent of antisocial
and illegal acts can be linked to television.
<p>
Epidemiologist Brandon S. Centerwall told <I>Newsweek</I> last
December that without television there would be 10,000 fewer murders
per year, 70,000 fewer rapes and 700,000 fewer assaults.
<p>
The music industry also shares some of the responsibility.  Dr.
Joseph Stuessey, professor of music history at the University
of Texas, told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music
affects behavior.  This simple fact has been known intuitively
for centuries.&quot;
<p>
Pop culture's music is laden with violence.  It has themes of
murder, maiming, raping, abusing and destroying.  Rap and heavy
metal are the worst, but others contribute to the promotion of
violence.
<p>
Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyrics at New York University,
says songs &quot;are a potent force in the shaping of&quot; society.
&quot;Popular songs,&quot; she says, &quot;provide the primary
'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot; No wonder
youth violence is rising.
<p>
Americans perceive that crime is getting worse.  Although overall
crime rates may be down, the face of crime is changing.  Citizens
feel less safe.  There's no quick fix, but strengthening the family,
boosting juvenile courts, stopping gratuitous media violence and
fighting drugs will help.

<title>NEW COMMANDER FOR THREE-FRONT DRUG WAR</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">

<p>

<h2>NEW COMMANDER FOR<br>
THREE-FRONT DRUG WAR</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

The new drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey, is the antithesis
of his boss.  McCaffrey, whose nomination was announced during
President Clinton's State of the Union message on January 23,
1996, is a decorated war hero, a West Pointer who epitomizes 
&quot;Duty-Honor-Country,&quot; and a true anti-drug warrior.
<p>
While McCaffrey's task should be to mount an all-out attack against
well-entrenched drug traffickers, his efforts are likely to be
diluted because two other fronts need attention.   One involves
repairing congressional relationships, and the other concerns
the difficulty of manuevering inside an administration that lacks
enthusiasm for combatting illicit drug use.
<p>
On the second front,  McCaffrey will fight against this administration's
natural inclination.  Many Clintonites feel more comfortable on
the wrong side of drugs and may resist anti-drug changes with
bureaucratic boobytraps.
<p>
On the first front, Congress is skeptical about Clinton's rebirth
as a crusader against the drug trade.   Senator Richard Shelby
(R-Ala.) tried to abolish the drug czar's office, blaming the
administration for sending &quot;a mixed message to America's
youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.&quot;  Shelby
added, &quot;I object to the administration's handling of this
issue -- its lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;
<p>
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) said, &quot;I've been in Congress
for over two decades, and I have never, never, never seen a president
who cares less about this issue.&quot;
<p>
Most importantly, on the front of ending drug trafficking, McCaffrey
must repair past damage.  In 1992, Clinton promised to renew the
anti-drug campaign, but quickly surrounded himself with pro-drug
advisors and bad policy.  He has cut Pentagon, Customs Service and DEA 
interdiction efforts.  The White House has radically downsized the drug 
czar's office and dropped the drug war to last on the National Security
Council's priority list.
<p>
Now, Clinton has shown a sudden interest in the drug issue.  He
wants drug testing for all arrested felons.  He has rejected changes
to a tough crack cocaine law and recently criticized his liberal
media friends for glamorizing drugs.
<p>
Why McCaffrey? In 1993, during a White House visit, McCaffrey
was rebuffed by a female White House staffer who said she didn't
speak to military people.  Clinton attempted damage control by
taking McCaffrey jogging with him.
<p>
To his credit, McCaffrey is an expert on narcotics trafficking.
He returned to Washington from the military's Southern Command
in Panama, where he presided over U.S. cooperation with Latin
American and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction
since February 1994.
<p>
McCaffrey has also said the right things.  He told Congress that
the President's drug strategy &quot;correctly addresses both the
domestic problems of demand and the international problems of
drug manufacturing and smuggling.&quot;
<p>
McCaffrey has clear marching orders.  As the President directed
him in his State of the Union address:  &quot;Lead our nation's
battle against drugs.&quot;  It's going to be tough for this soldier
who is accustomed to giving orders and expecting things done,
however.
<p>
President Harry Truman said of President-elect and General Dwight
Eisenhower, &quot;He'll say, `Do this! Do that! and nothing will
happen.  Poor Ike -- it won't be a bit like the army.  He'll find
it very frustrating.&quot;
<p>
As a fellow West Pointer and former subordinate, I offer this
advice.  Sir, begin your command by performing a thorough mission
analysis, prepare the troops, and then mount a Desert Storm-like
Hail-Mary maneuver to regain lost ground.  Then, exploit your
success.
<p>
Apply the principles of war.  Begin with the principle of security.
Reduce the probability that the enemy might interfere.  Sweep
your perimeter for guerrillas and then identify others who will
impede your plan.  Fair warning, pro-drug partisans are inside
the Clinton camp.
<p>
Define your &quot;purpose,&quot; which means develop a plan that
gains some degree of control over your opposition.  Begin by dumping
the &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategy, which substitutes treatment
for enforcement.  Return the war to the front lines reducing both
supply and demand.
<p>
Maneuver is another principle.  Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese military
thinker, said there are only two methods of maneuver (attack):
direct and indirect.  Avoid direct attacks on unsympathetic forces
within the administration.  Attack indirectly by going around
them.  Get the support of the American people.  Maneuver to repair
the administration's credibility with Congress and then seek funding
to rearm interdiction forces.
<p>
Use the principle of initiative to take drug abuse awareness center
stage.  Use your allies.  Foster dissent within hostile federal
agencies using natural allies like Reagan-era bureaucrats who
believe in Nancy's &quot;Just Say No&quot; strategy.  They'll
keep pro-drug Clintonites busy while you focus on drug suppliers.
<p>
Declare war on traffickers.  Work with foreign governments to
destroy drug crops, processing plants and their transportation
networks.  Empower the DEA, FBI and local law enforcement to step
up pressure on drug kingpins and street dealers.
<p>
The principle of economy of force requires that you use the minimum
essential resources for those endeavors that require the least
emphasis.  Ask Congress to fund specific drug projects that don't
need your personal attention, thus freeing you for higher priorities.
Canvas the country to reawaken the 1980-era anti-drug activists.
<p>
Use the principle of surprise to attack those who encourage drug
use.  Adhere to the principle of simplicity.  Simple concepts
and clear, concise orders reduce confusion.  This government has
too many anti-drug plans gathering dust and too many chiefs. 
Put your drug fighters in a formation, and insist they stay in
step.  The President will, no doubt, continue to wage a war of
words against promotion of drug abuse in the culture.  This will
make some of them uncomfortable, but it will be your deeds that
turn their discomfort into alarm.
<p>
Finally, the principle of morale is a state of mind.   You must
be confident and determined.   You must demonstrate staying power
and the spirit to win.  Stay visible.   Be a rabble-rouser  --
be a leader.
<p>
America needs a coordinated anti-drug war, and your leadership
can make the difference.  The question is whether Mr. Clinton's
conversion is real and whether, for our children's sake, he will
permit you to lead.

<title>THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK</title>

<h2>THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>

<i>Melissa Wells-Petry</i></center>

<p>

So much for democracy.  In its most recent foray into the culture
war, the Supreme Court held that it really could not think of
any good reason why the people of Colorado (or any other state,
for that matter) might think it wise to put the brakes on the
radical homosexual agenda by adopting Amendment 2, a law that
precludes special legal status for homosexuality.

<p>

Since the Supremes personally could not think of any good reason
for the law, they held there could be no good reason.  In fact,
they went further and charged that anyone who disagrees with them
is a bigot, a kook, and certainly a person who ought to be ashamed
of himself for even thinking of using the lowly democratic process
to express a view unacceptable to the ruling elite.  How dare
we, the people.

<p>

Not to put too fine a point on it, but are we sick of this already?
By that I mean that sick, helpless feeling in your stomach when
you know something right has been deemed, by the self-anointed,
&quot;wrong.&quot;  That ominous sickness that grips the heart
when it seems no matter how hard we try to take steps to address
the glaring problems in our society --whether it is to oppose
homosexuality, the transmogrification of marriage, the right to
infanticide (which surely the partial-birth abortion is) -- there,
like the Angel of Death, await the Elite who, with the stroke
of a pen, not only veto the result of our reasoning together through
the legislative process, but who also dash our aspirations for
building up, not tearing down, mores that are the essential supports
for civilization.  <I>We must fight back</I>.

<p>

As Americans, we have a deep respect for the rule of law.  But
for too long in this country, long after there ceased to exist
any evidence for doing so, we have equated the rule of law with
the rulings of the Supreme Court.  That equation is both incorrect
and dangerous.

<p>

If the Supreme Court succeeds in taking away our democracy, it
will be only because we let it.  The Court's recent opinion in
<I>Romer v. Evans</I>, which struck down Colorado's constitutional 
amendment on homosexuality, like <I>Roe v. Wade</I>, like countless 
other decisions that were nothing less than a raw power grab dressed 
up in fancy legal mumbo-jumbo, should be a call to arms in the culture 
war.

<p>

Instead of wailing about the excesses of these mere mortals in
robes, instead of being cowed by potential litigation, instead
of being silenced by the possibility that the justices might think
they know better than the people, for example, on what constitutes
a rationale response to the homosexual agenda, instead of saying
&quot;well, the Supreme Court says abortion is 'A-OK' and we can't
do anything about it,&quot; it's time to remind ourselves the
Constitution gives the people the real power, too, and the people
need to use it.

<p>

So the Supreme Court has called the 813,966 citizens who supported
Amendment 2 bigots.  So the Supreme Court has struck down the
law because it sees no danger in the State giving its imprimatur
to homosexuality and it won't credit those who do.  For those
who believe this nation must take steps to shore up its moral
foundation if it is to survive, and who conclude that special
legal status for homosexuality is inconsistent with that moral
foundation, the response must be to pass another law.  And another
law and another.  Pass one every week.  Change the language, take
a new approach, come at the problem from a different angle, don't
give up.  If the Supreme Court strikes it down, say &quot;Fine.
It is on your head.&quot;  Then dust yourself off and pass another
law.

<p>

Those who understand, in the words of Justice Scalia, that it
is &quot;eminently reasonable to use the legislative process to
address the various battles in the culture war may never get the
Court to admit the arrogance of its ways. (If <I>Roe</I> is any
object lesson, once the Court digs a whole, that hole only gets
deeper and more labyrinthine each time the justices heft the shovel.)

<p>

Nevertheless, if those who appreciate the legislative power the
Constitution gives to ordinary folks keep at it, one way or another,
eventually they will make their point.  At the end of the day,
they will be standing.  They will have exercised their prerogatives,
the prerogatives of democracy.  Never mind the elites.  The process
itself is a valuable vehicle through which to engage the soul
of the nation and through which to reason together (no matter
how contentiously) on the direction we, as a people, should go.

<p>

It's not pleasant to be labeled a bigot by the court -- especially
this nation's highest court -- simply because it is looking for a 
legal justification in all the wrong places. Be that as it may, the 
plain truth remains. The justices can rule all day that the people don't 
have the power to express their moral consensus at the ballot box on any
number of issues, but they can't diminish democracy unless we
let them.  Dish it up and send it back.  That's the response befitting
a government of, by, and for the people.

<h2>JANE AUSTEN COMES TO AMERICA</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Brent Vukmer</i></center>

<p>

I fall in that demographic group, &quot;Guys who prefer <I>Home
Improvement</I> to <I>Masterpiece Theater</I>,&quot; but I recently
went to see <I>Sense and Sensibility</I> anyway -- and liked it.
I'm not the only one.  Emma Thompson's film adaptation of Jane
Austen's book has grossed more than $21 million in its first few
weeks -- not bad for a limited-release, highbrow movie.
<p>
Hollywood is in a Jane Austen frenzy.  Starting last year with
<I>Clueless</i> (an updated <I>Emma</I>) and continuing in a big
way with <I>Sense and Sensibility</I>, this unassuming Dead White
Female has taken center stage in Hollywood.  <I>Persuasion</I>
is now on movie screens nationwide.  Another version of <I>Emma</I>
will appear in 1997.
<p>
Suddenly, Jane Austen is all over American pop culture. <I>People</I>
magazine included Jane Austen in their list of &quot;The 25 Most
Fascinating People in the World.&quot;  Press coverage in <I>Time</I>
magazine, <I>The Washington Post</I>, <I>The New York Times</I>, and 
other major media outlets has all been glowing.
<p>
What's going on?  How is it that Jane Austen, one of the most
tradition-minded women ever, shares press space with the cast
of <I>Friends?</I>
<p>
Pondering the question in the January 29th issue of <I>Newsweek</i>, 
Evan Thomas' article, &quot;Hooray for Hypocrisy&quot; concludes
that America misses having a society &quot;in which people ...
minded their manners.&quot;
<p>
Is that it?  Are we nostalgic for &quot;a more decorous and polite
age&quot;?  The 3.7 million households that tuned into A&amp;E's
six-hour version of <I>Pride and Prejudice</I> after the Super
Bowl <b>could</b> be explained away as a mutiny on the part of
Austen lovers and Miss Manners fans, recapturing the TV remote
after suffering through the pro football season.  Jane Austen
has always been popular with that segment of the population that
likes &quot;romance...cleverness...and some nice scenery.&quot;
<p>
But Thomas misses the point, I think.  Emma Thompson's <I>Sense
and Sensibility</I> <b>does</b> have romance, clever one-liners,
nice scenery, and exquisite manners, but Jane Austen has something 
important to offer besides her <I>Masterpiece Theater</I> qualities.
Colonel Brandon and Elinor are the heroes of <I>Sense and Sensibility</I>
because they are <b>good</b>:  kind, brave, strong, and trustworthy.
They keep their promises and steer by fixed moral principles,
not feelings.
<p>
That sounds more like it.  Americans are hungry for virtue.  In
a 1995 survey, the Family Research Council found that 66 percent
of Americans believe our society is &quot;on the wrong track.&quot;
Sixty-one percent of those surveyed attribute this to &quot;the
breakdown in the family and a decline in values.&quot;
<p>
Our nation's leaders seem to agree with most Americans.  Newt
Gingrich is talking about renewing America.  Not too long ago,
President Clinton admitted to Ben Wattenberg that, as Wattenberg's
recent book proclaims, <I>Values Matter Most</I>.
<p>
Former Secretary of Education Bill Bennett's various books about
old-fashioned values have been on national best-seller lists for
more than a year.   More than two million copies of <I>The Book
of Virtues</I> are in print, along with one million copies of
<I>The Children's Book of Virtues</I>, and 600,000 copies of
<I>The Moral Compass</I> in its first three months.
<p>
The bottom line?  It's not manners, but morality, that's in demand.
Parents are concerned more that their children might turn out
cruel than coarse.  This makes sense, because when two preteens
recently threw a grade-schooler to his death from an eighth-story
window because he would not steal for them, something more than
bad manners was at work.
<p>
Some modern experts on love, sex, and decision-making -- people
like former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders -- assert that old-fashioned
morality is an out-of-date, ineffective prescription for society's
ills.  Out-of-date?  Even in Austen's tightly-edited version of
18th century life, single-mother households, premarital sex, and
illegitimacy were facts of life.
<p>
Is &quot;just say no,&quot; her prescription for the problems
of premarital sex, ineffective? William Bennett's wife Elayne,
a sort of 20th century &quot;daughter&quot; of Jane Austen, runs
a program called <I>Best Friends.</I>  It works with fifth- to
ninth-grade girls, promoting abstinence.  Out of the 400 D.C.
girls who have gone through the program so far, only one has become
pregnant.
<p>
Jane Austen was an entertainer, not a social scientist, but she
seems to have known something about home improvement that has
escaped Joycelyn Elders and other experts.  Maybe we <i>could</i> 
take a clue about love, sex, and the rest from her work.
<p>
Americans are flocking to Jane Austen movies because there aren't
many happy endings in our society.  For us, as Evan Thomas notes,
love, sex, money, and marriage aren't the ingredients for comedy.
&quot;Somehow,&quot; he says, &quot;letting it all hang out did
not bring freedom, just child-support payments, and the sexual
revolution bequeathed us AIDS and date rape.&quot;  Maybe the
experts should go to the movies.  Jane Austen's ideas make sense.
<p>
She knew that absolute truths make comedy possible.  The time-honored
traditions and codes that have always protected marriage and the
family provide a safe environment to pursue true love, to laugh
at life's follies, and to cry at weddings.  (Not that a die-hard
Tim Allen fan would ever go so far as to do <b>that</b>, of course.)

"We derive out order in society and our order in personality in sources more than human and the sanction 
for order is primarily religious."

<img src="sound.gif" hspace="5" vspace="4" align="top">
"The urgent need of the United States of America near the end of the 20th century is a virtue arising from 
habit and affection rather than from ideological preaching.  Without such a renewed true virtue, our 
commonwealth may not endure."

<p><hr>
<img src="sound.gif" hspace="5" vspace="4" align="top">
"The school cannot very well form good moral habits, having its pupils within walls only a few hours in 
the week, and then under artificial restraint.  Yet schools may do much to wake the moral imagination 
which is another path to the apprehension of meaning."

"Modern schooling at any level, offers little toward the ordering of the soul and the ordering of the 
commonwealth.  Yet neither the person nor the republic can long endure unharmed if education continues 
to ignore reason, imagination and conscience."

<p><hr>
<img src="sound.gif" hspace="5" vspace="4" align="top">
"It appears to me ladies and gentlemen that our culture labors in an advanced state of decadence.  What 
many people mistake for the triumph of our culture actually consists of forces that are disintegrating our 
culture.  The vaulted democratic freedom of liberal society in reality is servitude to appetites and illusions 
that attack religious belief, that destroy community through excessive centralization and urbanization and 
efface life-giving tradition."

<blockquote><blockquote>
<img alt="The Classic Kirk " src="kirkclas.gif" align="right">For more than forty years, Russell Kirk was in the thick of the intellectual controversies of our time. Both 
<i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> have described him as one of America's leading thinkers. He is the author of some 
twenty-nine books and of hundreds of periodical essays; also of many short stories.
<p>
Dr. Kirk wrote and spoke on modern culture, political thought and practice, educational theory, literary 
criticism, ethical questions, and social themes. He addressed audiences on nearly five hundred American 
campuses and also appeared often on television and radio.
<p>
He was editor of the educational quarterly journal <i>The University Bookman</i> and was founder and first 
editor of the quarterly <i>Modern Age.</i> He contributed to numerous serious periodicals on either side of the 
Atlantic. For a quarter of a century he wrote a page on education for <i>National Review,</i> and for thirteen 
years published, through the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, a nationally-syndicated newspaper column. 
Over the years he contributed to more than a hundred serious periodicals in the United States, Britain, 
Canada, Australia, Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, and Poland, among them <i>Sewanee Review, 
Yale Review, Fortune, Humanitas, The Contemporary Review, The Journal of the History of Ideas, World 
Review, Crisis, History Today, Policy Review, Commonweal, Kenyon Review, The Review of Politics, </i>
and <i>The World and I.</i>
<p>
Dr. Kirk was president of the Wilbur Foundation; president of The Educational Reviewer, Inc.; 
editor of <i>The Library of Conservative Thought</i> for Transaction Books; and from time to time distinguished 
visiting professor at various universities and liberal-arts colleges in the disciplines of history, political 
thought, humane letters, and journalism.
<p>
He is the only American to hold the highest arts degree (earned) of the senior Scottish university - doctor of 
letters of St. Andrews. He received his bachelor's degree from Michigan State University and his master's 
degree from Duke University. Honorary doctorates were conferred upon him by twelve American 
universities and colleges.
<p>
<img alt="Gothic Kirk" src="kirkgoth.gif" align="left">He was a Guggenheim Fellow, a senior fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies, a 
Constitutional Fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a Fulbright Lecturer in Scotland. 
The Christopher Award was conferred upon him for his book <i>Eliot and His Age, </i>and he received the Ann 
Radcliffe Award of the Count Dracula Society for his Gothic Fiction; the Third World Fantasy Convention 
gave him its award for the best short fiction. In 1984 he received the Weaver Award of the Ingersoll Prizes 
for his scholarly writing. For several years he has been a Distinguished Scholar of the Heritage Foundation. 
In 1989, President Reagan conferred on him the Presidential Citizens Medal. In 1991, he was awarded the 
Salvatori Prize for historical writing.
<p>
More than a million copies of his books have been sold, and several have been translated into German, 
Spanish, Dutch, Korean, and other languages. His second book, <i>The Conservative Mind </i>(1953), was one of 
the most widely reviewed and discussed studies of political ideas in this century and has gone through 
seven editions. Seventeen of his books are in print at present, and he has written prefaces to many other 
books, contributed essays to them, or edited them.
<p>


Dr. Kirk debated with such well-known speakers as Norman Thomas, Frank Mankiewicz, Carey 
McWilliams, John Roche, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Michael Harrington, Max Lerner, Michael Novak, 
Sidney Lens, William Kunstler, Hubert Humphrey, F. A. Hayek, Karl Hess, Clifford Case, Ayn Rand, 
Eugene McCarthy, Leonard Weinglass, Louis Lomax, Harold Taylor, Clark Kerr, Saul Alinsky, Staughton 
Lynd, Malcolm X, Dick Gregory, and Tom Hayden. Several of his public lectures have been broadcast 
nationally on C-Span.
<p>
<img alt="Kirk and Buckley" src="kirkbuck.gif" align="right">Among Kirk's literary and scholarly friends have been T. S. Eliot, Roy Campbell, Wyndham Lewis, 
Donald Davidson, George Scott Moncrieff, Richard Weaver, Max Picard, Ray Bradbury, Bernard Iddings 
Bell, Paul Roche, James McAuley, Thomas Howard, Wilhelm Roepke, Robert Speaight, Anthony 
Kerrigan, Robert Nisbet, Malcolm Muggeridge, Flannery O'Connor, William F. Buckley, Jr., Andrew 
Lytle, Henry Regnery, Robert Graves, and Cleanth Brooks.
<p>
<img alt="Young Kirk" src="kirkyng.gif" align="right">Born near the railroad yards at Plymouth, Michigan, in 1918, Kirk lived at his ancestral place, named Piety 
Hill, in Mecosta, Michigan - a little village in the stump-country. There he converted a toy factory into his 
library and office. His Italianate house is adorned with sculpture and architectural antiques snatched from 
the maws of the urban renewers of western Michigan. At home he was a famous narrator of ghostly tales, 
many of them picked up during his travels (often afoot) in Scotland and Ireland, Mediterranean and Alpine 
lands, and Africa.<p>

<img alt="Kirk and Annette" src="kirkfam.gif" align = "left">
For nearly thirty years he was married to Annette Yvonne Cecile Courtemanche; they have four daughters. 
Their tall house often was crowded with Asiatic, African, and European refugees and exiles; also with 
university students, travellers from antique lands, and a congeries of fugitives from Progress. In 
conjunction with the Intercollegiate Studies Institute and the Wilbur Foundation, Russell and Annette Kirk 
held frequent seminars at their residence and received several literary interns every year. Annette Kirk was 
an active member of the National Commission on Excellence in Education; she organizes the Piety Hill 
Seminars, and is managing editor of <i>The University Bookman.</i>

 
<p>
Additional information about him may be found in <i>Contemporary Authors, Who's Who in the World, 
Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the Midwest, International Scholars Directory, The Directory of 
American Scholars,</i> and other biographical directories. Chapters about his writings and his life may be 
found in Henry Regnery's <i>Memoirs of a Dissident Publisher,</i> John East's <i>The American Conservative 
Movement,</i> and M. E. Bradford's <i>A Better Guide Than Reason.</i>
<p>
The definitive work on Russell Kirk's life can be found in his own autobiography, <i>The Sword of 
Imagination,</i> available now through Eerdsmans Publishing.
<p>
<i>Russell Kirk: a Bibliography,</i> 1981; illustrations. Compiled by Charles Brown, with an essay by Henry 
Regnery. Mount Pleasant, Michigan: Clarke Historical Library, Central Michigan University. Distributed 
by Intercollegiate Studies Institute. $5.00 hardcover.

<P>
Our friend Russell Kirk, &quot;The Wizard of Mecosta,&quot; seemed
an ill-suited visitor to Washington back in 1978. He was accompanied
by his loving wife Annette, and he shared with a packed auditorium
some of the truths that made his published works so powerful and
so influential.
<P>
Then sixty years old, Russell Kirk was not a newcomer to Washington,
and yet he was certainly not a part of this unreal, political
place.
<P>
Despite his visits here in subsequent years, Russell Kirk was
always more comfortable surrounded by his family and his books
in Mecosta. He was at home among inquisitive students on one of
the college campuses where he held visiting appointments or where
he lectured.
<P>
Despite his discomfort, however, he made a real impact on Washington.
In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists,
legislators and staffers of prudence and of taking the long view.
<P>
It was at an I.S.I.-sponsored seminar, more than thirty years
ago over the Christmas holidays, that I first met Dr. Kirk. He
was already a fixed star in the conservative firmament. Although
he has described himself in those days as &quot;roly-poly and
benign,&quot; all of us students were in awe of him.
<P>
Had we known that he was an occasional eater of beaver and an
habitual smoker of &quot;dark, thick,&quot; Burmese cigars, &quot;looking
and tasting . . . Like torpedoes,&quot; we probably would have
addressed him with even greater trepidation. Yet, as he talked
with a small group of us on that frosty night in Detroit I could
not project that twenty years later Russell Kirk would be a Heritage
Distinguished Fellow and that three of his books would be based
on lectures that he first delivered here.
<P>
Over the years, Russell's Washington lecture themes would include
natural law, the prospects for conservatives, and individual rights.
They are masterpieces of clear thought and eternal truth.
<P>
These volumes and his other works mean that Russell Kirk's influence
in Washington will continue to be far greater than many
of the transient politicians who descend upon this city, cycle
after cycle.
<P>
As a back row observer at his soirees for the last sixteen years,
I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable overflow crowd of
young people who couldn't get enough of him.
<P>
I asked one of them what his hold was on them. Her reply: &quot;I
had only admired him from afar and, of course, reading his books
at my university was not politically correct.&quot; Or, as a young
Reagan appointee said, &quot;He taught us all why our role was
important beyond ourselves and beyond politics.&quot;
<P>
Russell Kirk's operating guide was prudence and what Patrick Henry
called &quot;the lamp of experience,&quot; which abhorred all
forms of ideology claiming some instant substitute for genuine
tradition, custom, and experience.
<P>
He often described himself as a &quot;Bohemian Tory.&quot; A Bohemian
Tory who adapted to his environment, whether this meant a humble
cellar, a rustic cabin, a city mansion, or one of the great country
houses of Europe.
<P>
From time to time here in Washington, Russell was entertained,
feted, or downright idolized. While he seemed to enjoy this, his
heart belonged to Mecosta.
<P>
Russell Kirk has left an indelible mark on us, on Washington,
and on our nation. Perhaps his words have more meaning for us
today because, as one of his friends, T.S. Eliot puts it:
<P>
&quot;The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living.&quot;

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Gleaves Whitney<BR>
on behalf of <BR>
The Honorable John Engler, Governor of Michigan</CENTER></b>
<p>
 Russell
Kirk once wrote: &quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle,
to suffer, to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors
and in themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love. They
are put into this world to live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
By his own measure, Russell Kirk lived a robust and manly life,
and he died a noble and manly death.
<P>
Let it be said at the outset--without hesitation and without qualification--Russell
Kirk was a great man. His work will stand as one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of our time. That is because he understood
our time. Before his most famous book, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,
was accepted for publication, Russell Kirk wrote a letter to Henry
Regnery, saying: This work is &quot;my contribution to our endeavor
to conserve the spiritual and intellectual and political tradition
of our civilization; and if we a e to rescue the modem mind we
must do it very soon . . .The struggle will be decided in the
minds of the rising generation.&quot;
<P>
There can be no doubt that Russell Kirk reached many minds-- and
touched many hearts--over the last four decades. His words coursed
over the continents and across the generations. He touched us
not just because of what he said, but how he said it. This &quot;Bohemian
Tory,&quot; this &quot;Canny Scot,&quot; possessed an excellent
ear for the language, and his readers felt all the force of his
personality in his prose.
<P>
And then there were the many personal qualities that endeared
Russell Kirk to us. He was a loyal friend and a faithful correspondent.
Who could forget his keen wit, those fantastic ghost stories,
and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes? He was devoted to his
family--a wonderful family so many of us have come to know: his
lovely wife Annette, their four beautiful daughters, his sons-in-law,
and the larger family. For years they have opened their arms to
us, as today we open our arms to them.
<P>
Russell Kirk had an uncommonly generous spirit--a spirit that
never flagged, but gave tirelessly. It is evident in his letters
and lectures, his books and conversation. Weakened though he was
toward the end of his life, Dr. Kirk's last public gesture was
to sign books from his bed, because he knew how much that would
mean to his readers
and friends. The last book he signed, just a week before his passing,
vas to Governor Engler.
<P>
Russell Kirk was very much a Michigan man--one of us. We can imagine
him as a young boy, reading historical adventures by the train
yards in Plymouth where his father worked. We can think of him
as a gifted teacher at his alma mater, Michigan State. We can
see him walking out of that drafty old library at Piety Hill and
turning down the road which leads to the woods.
<P>
Russell loved Michigan. Recently his heart made its final journey
back to the &quot;stump country&quot; that he called his ancestral
home, to return to the land that shaped him. But his spirit now
knows its true and eternal home. And the wisdom in his writings
will remain to help those of us still on this earthly pilgrimage.
Indeed, for generations to come, his words will find a resting
place wherever there is right reason, and wherever there is a
heart in search of the Permanent Things.
<P>
Today we mourn. We have lost a friend. Michigan has lost its preeminent
man of letter. America has lost one of the men who understood
her best. We mourn, but Russell would not want us to become too
melancholy this day. In the epilogue of his memoirs, which he
recently composed and which will be published next year, Russell
Kirk tells us that he lived a good life. At the age of seventy-five,
he says that what he sought in life had come down to three things.
<P>
First, he had sought to defend the Permanent Things -- truth, justice,
freedom, a tolerable moral order and in so doing he was more successful
than he thought would be possible at the outset of his career.
<P>
Second, he had sought to lead a life of decent independence, living
much as his ancestors had lived, on their land, in circumstances
that would enable him to utter the truth and make his voice heard:
a life uncluttered and unpolluted, not devoted to getting and
spending. This, he tells us, he had achieved as a man of letters
at Piety Hill.
<P>
Third, he had sought to marry for love and to rear children who
would come to know that the service of God is perfect freedom.
Words cannot express how filled with gratitude he was for Annette
and his children, who are endowed with the unbought grace of life.
In this, too, he had been wonderfully blessed.
<P>
To Russell Kirk, the three goals of his life had been reached,
and he was grateful. And we who are here today can be grateful
that we knew him, and that he walked a little distance with us
in our journey to our eternal home.

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Pat Buchanan<BR>
Founder and Chairman <BR>
The American Cause</CENTER></b><p> We are here today to mourn the passing
of a wonderful friend, and to celebrate a great life, that of
Dr. Russell Kirk, Patriarch of Piety Hill, Sage of Mecosta, gentle
giant of American conservatism. And, I am proud and honored to
add, leader of the Buchanan Brigades in the Michigan primary of
'92.
<P>
In 1953, when Dr. Kirk's seminal work, The Conservative Mind,
appeared In a desert of liberal orthodoxy, it was celebrated,
not only here but across the West. For the wise men of the age
were aware something new had been born, a genuine conservative
movement, and Russell Kirk was its father. His was the spark that
set fire to the minds of so many of my generation.
<P>
For forty years, Dr. Kirk wrote his columns and commentaries,
essays, and stories, books and reviews- a treasure house of work
that now becomes part of the deposit of faith--of the cause in
which we believe. And his books will be read and reread and cherished,
when most of what his contemporaries published is long since forgotten.
Why?
<P>
Because Russell Kirk wrote not only for his time, but for all
time. He was the custodian, the caretaker of &quot;The Permanent
Things&quot;, the eternal truths that do not change. All his life
he wielded his pen to expose the false gods of modernity, and
in particular, the false god of ideology.
<P>
To Dr. Kirk, ideology, whether of Left or Right, was something
that took possession of a soul that was empty. &quot;Ideology,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;provides sham religion . . . comforting in its
way to those who have lost or never have known genuine religious
faith.&quot;
<P>
When Dr. Kirk discovered this heresy in the camp of the saints,
he used a needle to winkle it out. A few years back when the ideology
of democracy was being exalted to the status of high dogma, he
wrote, &quot;A trouble with this civil-religion notion is that
the large majority of Americans think they already have a religion
of their own, not one cobbled up by some department in Washington.&quot;
<P>
When some great minds arose in our midst to declare The End of
History, Dr. Kirk merrily laughed. Because he knew more history
than all of them put together; and because he knew that the seedbed
of conflicts and war lay in the human heart, which is unchanged
and unchanging, save through grace.
<P>
As the presence here today of Russell Kirk's wife and four daughters
so beautifully testifies, Russell Kirk did not simply preach the
values of family and faith, he lived them. He not only wrote of
the search for truth, he persevered all his life; and when he
came upon the truth in the Roman Catholic Church, Russell Kirk
embraced it. This was a man, whole and entire, whose hierarchy
of values were in perfect order and synchronization, as are the
planets in God's heaven that circle the sun. And because his values
were in harmony, Dr. Kirk was one off the most genuinely, visibly
happy men I have ever met.
<P>
I recall the last time we met, in Philadelphia near midnight for
a drink after a speech; Annette and Dr. Kirk invited me out to
Piety Hill, to see the library in which he took such joy.
<P>
And, upon occasion, Dr. Kirk would undertake my instruction.
<P>
After listening to me propound the latest economic nostrum for
America's ills, this gentle teacher sent me a slim book that contained
his own introduction: &quot;I have regarded with some suspicion
many practitioners of the Dismal Science,&quot; Dr. Kirk had written.
&quot;I have found economists a blindered breed, worshipping the
false god, Efficiency.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Kirk believed in a market economy, but all his life he fought
this Cult of Efficiency--because it dehumanized man; and because
he knew there is a higher order of things in God's universe, ruled
by a law higher even than the law of supply and demand.
<P>
If today a man should ask me what is conservatism, I would tell
him: Read Russell Kirk. He endures; he speaks to the ages of what
it means to be one of us.
<P>
If there is an image I will carry with me all my days of Dr. Kirk,
it is the image of the loving father of the Prodigal Son, the
father who; nightly, walks to the edge of his estate to look to
the horizon to see if his wandering boy is ever coming home again.
And when the son appears, disheveled, having squandered his patrimony
chasing after the fads and follies of the age, the gentle father,
never reproachful, rejoices to take his son back home.
<P>
He was that--to us.
<P>
&quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle, to suffer,
to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors, and in
themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love,&quot; Russell
Kirk wrote forty years ago. &quot;They are put in this world to
live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
A brave man all his life, Russell Kirk died like a man, passing
away in the arms of the wife and daughters he loved. <i>Ave atque vale</i>,
my friend.

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Russell Hittinger<BR>
Professor, Department of Philosophy <BR>
The Catholic University of America</b></CENTER><p> In <i>The Roots of American
Order</i>, Russell wrote: &quot;Whatever America's incertitudes today,
it is difficult to find American citizens who can sketch any convincing
ideal new order as an alternative to the one long rooted here.&quot;
This sentence was aimed particularly at the malcontents of the
1960s. But it might just as well have been aimed at all of us;
especially those of us who work in universities, think tanks,
and newspapers. Who among us knows so much as to offer the prospect
of any &quot;convincing&quot; alternative to an order long rooted
in the experience of a people? Our answer to this question will
determine how we understand the word &quot;conservative.&quot;</B>
<P>
We know how Russell Kirk answered the question. To his eternal
credit, he did not impart to this movement the name &quot;Kirkianism.&quot;
When he wrote <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, he certainly did not suggest
that the &quot;mind&quot; was his own. The whole point of the
book was to have the reader draw quite the opposite conclusion.
The permanent things are not known by merely one mind or party;
thanks to the gift of culture, they are known by many minds. Whether
we speak of culture in its moral and religious sense, or culture
in terms of liberty and economic markets, the conservative believes
that the kind of social order worth living in most certainly is
not something vouchsafed exclusively to a privileged class of
theorists.
<P>
Russell Kirk kept a distance, both spiritual and geographical,
from the institutions of the elite. He did most of his thinking
and writing outside of the academy. While it seems at least paradoxical
to say this about a conservative, he needed no institutional credentials
to certify his ideas. It was enough for him to call upon the authority
Cicero, Burke, and John Randolph of Roanoke. He certainly kept
a distance from the imperial institutions of this city. Except
for two terms as Justice of the Peace in Morton Township, Mecosta
County, Michigan, Russell never held public office.
<P>
Nonetheless, he had the chief virtue of a public man: he regarded
cultural order as a gift, even if it had been neglected and despoiled
by the age. One might think that it was a great misfortune for
him to have lived in our time, with its rejection of authority
and its rejection of the vicarious communion of the living with
the dead. Russell was, of course, duly critical of the age.
<P>
But criticism was rarely his first word, and never his last. 1
recall the first time I met him, during one of his annual seminars
at Piety Hill. I never, by the way, met a man of his prominence
who spent such time with young people, especially college undergraduates.
That year he was considering the subject, &quot;Is Virtue Teachable?&quot;
After citing all of the classical authorities, and making every
argument (pro and con) of which we were capable, we retired to
the living room on the final evening, whereupon Russell told ghost
stories. I returned more than once to these annual affairs in
Mecosta, and I can assure you that the ghosts always had the final
word.
<P>
When we consider the life of Russell Kirk, we may ask ourselves:
Can a virtuous man be happy in a decadent time? Aristotle said
of Priam's misfortunes: &quot;A truly good and intelligent person
will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from his resources
at any time will do the finest actions, just as a . . . good shoemaker
will produce the finest shoe from the leather given him . . .
If this is so, then the happy person could never become miserable.&quot;
<P>
And so it was with Russell Kirk. &quot;Happiness,&quot; he concluded
in <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, is first expressed in &quot;gratitude.&quot;
Gratitude is found neither in sadness nor in protest, but in &quot;restoring
and improving the order of the soul and the order of the republic.&quot;
<P>
For his piety, for his example, for his paternal solicitude for
his students, and above all for his sanity, we will miss him.
But we. are grateful for his extraordinary defense of the ordinary,
civilizing virtues.<p><br><p><center><img alt="_______________________" align="middle"src="divide.gif"></center><p><br><p>

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Irving Louis Horowitz<BR>
Professor of Sociology and Political Science<BR>
Rutgers University</b></CENTER><p> It would be futile, not to say frustrating,
to try summarizing Russell Kirk's life and work in a few well
chosen words. Russell him self was wise enough to leave for paradise
ultimate summaries and judgments. He understood that our world
was comprised, if not shrouded, in mystery and paradox; and hence
in need of dispositions not dogmas. He lived his extraordinary
life accordingly.
<P>
He was a huge public presence with a private life that remained
ever intact. He was a man who wrote fiercely, but who yet managed
to speak softly. Russell gave substance to a movement floundering
in search of theory, and yet only episodically participated in
partisan politics. He was as dedicated to what Veblen called the
higher learning with an unmatched ferocity, and yet chose the
life of what Mannheim called the <i>freischwebende Inelligenz</i> -- 
or loosely translated, the free-wheeling intellect. He was a political
philosopher in the strictest, Burkean, sense of the word, and
yet could produce ghost I stories and aphoristic works with equal
aplomb and ease. And yes, he was Catholic in the exacting sense
of that word, and yet fully able to register a catholicity that
knew no boundaries of religion or culture.
<P>
In short, he was one of us: a human being with aspirations no
less than accomplishments. His conservatism was ample enough to
take the measure of man as a complex bundle of twine; touched
by original sin but in search of ultimate redemption, and filled
with such tumult as to make possible an appreciation of order.
But having said this, one must add a qualifier: Russell did not
use paradox as a mechanism for avoiding decisions or skirting
issues. Better than nearly any I person I have ever known, he
took forthright positions on basic ques tions. For Russell, what
ought to be is at least as important as what is in the conduct
of human affairs.
<P>
I take this passion for the political as his secret war against
empiricism and for moralism. He was at heart, an essayist. He
loved preparing introductions to his favorite contemporary authors:
Irving Babbitt, Christopher Dawson, William H. Mallock, John Randolph,
Forrest McDonald, Donald Davidson, Wilhelm Roepke, Victor Kravchenko, Louis deBonald, George Scott-Moncrieff -- to name some of
them. They spoke at levels that provided meaning without fueling
animus.
<P>
I suspect that this opportunity to dialogue with his friends and
mentors of ages past no less than times present was a large part
of Russell's reason for sponsoring the Library of Conservative
Thought a series wthich has brought such distinction to Transaction,
 no less than pleasure to its readers. He shared with Montaigne
the deep belief that the essay form was that most amenable to
give I expression to ethical considerations. If this made him
at times appear I avuncular, it was a small price to pay for giving
intellectual shape to the struggles of our century and our nation.
<P>
Russell's life spanned much of the century: he knew many victories,
and suffered defeats as well. He handled both ends of the public
spectrum with equal equanimity. I suspect that the warmth of his
private life above all, his unabashed love and beaming pride of
his wife and four daughters allowed him to put into perspective
any indignities, and put into practice his belief in the values
of family, tradition, and faith. There was a seamless movement
from the private to the public that gave an informed unity of
purpose to his life.
<P>
In the short few weeks since his death, I have received many encomiums
about the Library of Conservative Thought. Several of them have
spoken of the series as somehow complete, or near completion,
with his passing. While well-intentioned, this is simply not the
case. That rich body of analysis to which Russell both contributed
so mightily and recovered so consistently, is no more near completion
than the planet earth itself. It would be high irony that a person
dedicated to the search for eternal values in a changing polity
would advocate or announce the competition of such a stupendous
task.
<P>
I suspect that these letters are giving expression to a feeling
of deep sorrow at the loss of a spiritual leader in a spiritless
environment. But the need for the comfort of belief, the instinct
for tradition, the impulse to maintain, if not create order, must
ultimately overcome our sorrow at the loss of a human being, however
talented and whatever achievements he may have registered. The
fact is that Russell is now one with the great tradition he helped
to articulate and recover. He is one with Plato, Augustine, Burke,
Brownson, Calhoun, Eliot and countless other names who helped
Russell give definition to western civilization. May his soul
rest in peace. May our souls remain restless in the pursuit of
peace.

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Honorable T. Kenneth Cribb,
Jr.<BR>
President<BR>
Intercollegiate Studies Institute</b></CENTER><p> The priceless regalia
of the Scottish kings--the crown, the scepter, the sword of state--are
known as the Honors of Scotland. They are more ancient by far
than the British Crown Jewels, and it is said that the gold circlet
of the richly reworked crown was worn by Robert the Bruce. Despite
their incalculable worth, the Honors of Scotland were put away
following the union of the English and Scottish nations, and then
were lost to memory for 150 years.</B>
<P>
It was none other than Sir Walter Scott who, understanding their
significance, used all the powers of his scholarship and imagination
to deduce their forgotten resting place. After infinite pains,
he himself lifted the Honors of Scotland from the dusty recess
where they had been consigned by an earlier generation careless
of its patrimony.
<P>
In our age, it was Russell Kirk who, with ground-breaking scholarship
and moral imagination, rediscovered what we may call the Honors
of the West. At a time when the American heirs to conservatism
had fallen into forgetfulness of the great tradition, and liberal
intellectuals had proclaimed its demise, Dr. Kirk, like the Walter
Scott he so admired, lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony
from dusty oblivion.
<P>
In his early work Dr. Kirk treated modern exemplars of the conservative
tradition from Burke to Eliot, but always with respect to their
insights into timeless truths. Later, he more explicitly traced
these eternal verities to their ancient historical roots, and
to their Source beyond history. All along the way he erected guideposts
for those who would follow--all of us here and so many others--that
we too could travel the path he had marked toward order in the
soul and order in the commonwealth; that we too could discover
the Honors of the West.
<P>
Friend or foe would occasionally address him as Professor Kirk--not
realizing that he had held professorships no longer than he had
to--such was his contempt for Behemoth University. But teacher
he was, all his life. More than a few volumes on his long shelf
of books were written explicitly to instruct the young, not to
F mention hundreds of college lectures from coast to coast, scores
of Wilbur Fellows who served as his research assistants, or the
Piety Hill seminars begun more than twenty years ago. As with
Chaucer's Clerk, gladly would he teach and gladly learn.
<P>
Russell Kirk also taught by the example of his towering integrity.
Here was the man of letters who, without the usual sinecures,
actually lived by his pen. Here was the scourge of the Welfare
State who quietly practiced the arts of private charity. He and
Annette made their house a home to the troubled, to the dispossessed,
to great eccentrics seeking refuge from the commonplace world.
Who has not visited Piety Hill only to find himself dining with
the deposed imperial family of Ethiopia, or a young person with
grave family problems, or an intellectual expatriated from the
totalitarian East. There was even the Burglar Butler who before
finding shelter with the Kirks, made his way by robbing church
poor boxes, taking--as he said--only what was absolutely necessary.
<P>
Yes, Dr. Kirk taught us by the very nature of the household that
he established, graced by Monica, Cecilia, Felicia, and Andrea,
and presided over by Annette with an encompassing love.
<P>
In January of 1993 Russell Kirk learned that he suffered from
congestive heart failure, and realist that he was, understood
that his remaining time was short. He took the news as no more
and no less than an artifact of the human condition, and in his
last year and-a-half neither despaired in his spirit nor flagged
in his Herculean literary feats. After all, this was a man who
measured his intellectual pursuits in millennia and who planted
trees throughout his life as a symbol of our duty to strive for
good that we may not live to see.
<P>
Well into his seventies, Dr. Kirk could canoe on the rivers of
Mecosta County or walk the hills of the Scottish Borders, only
to sit down later at his typewriter and engage in learned disputation.
This past December nineteenth, Dr. Kirk wrote me, &quot;I fear
that my days of canoeing and hill-walking are over,&quot; and
then proceeded to outline a series of literary projects that daunted
even in the reading. Since the onset of his illness in 1993, he
had produced two of his most important works: <i>America's British
Culture</i>, a consummate defense of our common patrimony against
the destructive sallies of the multiculturalists; and <i>The Politics
of Prudence</i>, a series of essays instructing the rising generation
in the essence of conservative thought and exhorting them to nurture
and transmit their precious cultural heritage.
<P>
But perhaps the most significant work of his last days was the
completion of his final literary gift to us, <i>The Sword
of Imagination: Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict</i>.
This 874-page treasure of a manuscript is currently being prepared
for publication by Eerdmans Publishing Company and, according
to Dr. Kirk, is a memoir humbly penned in the tradition of Julius
Caesar and Henry T Adams.
<P>
During his final illness, Dr. Kirk would gather his daughters
around him to tell stories of his youth and of their family history--as
well as an occasional gothic tale. He mustered the energy to read
aloud to his family Walter Scott's <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>,
and, on Easter Sunday, Chesterton's <i>Ballad of the White
Horse</i>;.
<P>
On his last morning, he heard on the radio that the Pope had slipped
and fallen. He asked his family to pin him in prayer for the Holy
Father's recovery. At the end, he sat up in his bed at his beloved
Piety Hill, and sank back with eyes closed. As Annette went for
the nurse, two of his young daughters took his hands and began
to sing the songs he had sung to awaken them from their a slumbers.
He opened his eyes once more to the angelic voices that sang him
to his rest. His life was gentle in the old sense; his death,
in all senses.
<P>
The final works and days of Russell Kirk were at one with his
long life. From across the ages the best minds of the West spoke
to Dr. Kirk of permanent things which eclipsed the paltry preoccupations
of our time, and he made those thinkers our contemporaries. It
is across the ages that Russell Kirk's own voice will be heard
by future voyagers embarked on the reflective journey toward order
in the soul and order in the commonwealth. May they redeem for
their time, as Russell Kirk has done for ours, the Honors of the
West.

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Homily for the Memorial
Mass of Dr. Russell Kirk<BR>
Reverend Winthrop Brainerd<BR>
St. Matthew's Cathedral, Washington, D.C. </CENTER></B>
<P>
On Sunday we celebrated Pentecost, and on Monday, I was at Yale
graduation. The contrast between them was extreme. Certainly at
Yale I discovered much knowledge. Certainly at Yale, I discovered
much learning. Yet, with all of this knowledge and learning, was
the lack of moral imagination; and in the midst of &quot;political
correctness,&quot; the refusal of the truth; and therefore the
absence of all wisdom.
<P>
Certainly, there was much talk of &quot;freedom from,&quot; and
lamentably little understanding of &quot;freedom to:&quot; a multiplication
of rights; and a convenient amnesia of duty.
<P>
Yet as Pentecost reminds us, the vocation of a Catholic is to
witness to the truth. To this end, God reveals Himself in covenant;
in sacrifice; in flesh and blood; and through the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Poured out upon the Church at Pentecost, and upon us at our baptism,
that Spirit leads us into the truth, and as we discover the truth,
if we are to live our lives with integrity, we must proclaim it.
<P>
For it is in this fearless proclamation of truth, that we ourselves
learn: from each other; from tradition; from grace; and from that
radical transformation of the heart. Truth comes from the entirety
of the human condition and has been refined and forged in the
inner conflicts between truth and lies; between good and evil;
between the world and the kingdom. And from the proclamation of
the truth, we discover wisdom.
<P>
Given the corruption of human nature, it is, perhaps, too much
to expect gratitude from those challenged and exposed by the proclamation
of the truth, but in the midst of persecution, explicit or implicit,
we see &quot;<i>Cor ad Cor loquitur</i>,&quot; heart speaks to heart.
Like the rim of a bell, it does not matter where it is touched,
for it rings clear, out across the earth. Wisdom speaks heart
to heart, because it perceives not only truth, but the purpose
of truth, which is God.
<P>
Wisdom speaks to the human: body, soul, mind, for wisdom both
understands the truth of the human condition, and is the ground
of its healing. It mines the individual he art for the good for
which humanity was made; for the good of which it is capable;
and for that fragile good confronted by the dark destructive selfishness
of which each one of us is daily tempted to succumb.
<P>
Such wisdom comes from God who is wisdom Himself; Himself the
author, the purpose and the end and it is the birthright of every
Catholic.
<P>
Here in the presence of the author of truth and seat of wisdom
we are given a sign: we see the bread and wine; we perceive the
flesh and blood. We see in what we have made, in bread, in wine,
the seeds of our mortality: the bread must rot and the wine spoil.
Yet we see God take what we have made, and by them, give to us
immortality.
<P>
This sign shows us what God will do, not with what we have made,
but with what he has made: ourselves. &quot;Now we see a dim reflection
in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge
that I now have is imperfect; but I shall understand as I am understood.&quot;
(1 Cor. 13:12)
<P>
&quot;To understand as I am understood&quot; is the ultimate wisdom.
It is still the vocation of our brother Russell Kirk; it is the
lesson of his life; and it is the legacy, like Elijah's mantle,
that falls upon us here.<p><br><p><center><img alt="_______________________" align="middle"src="divide.gif"></center>

Sobering voices tell us nowadays that the civilization in which we participate is not long for this world. Many countries have fallen under the domination of squalid oligarchs; other lands are reduced to anarchy. "Cultural revolution," rejecting our patrimony of learning and manners, has done nearly as much mischief in the West as in the East, if less violently. Religious belief is attenuated at best, for many or else converted, after being secularized, into an instrument for social transformation. Books give way to television and videos; universities, intellectually democratized, are sunk to the condition of centers for job certification. An increasing proportion of the population, in America especially, is dehumanized by addiction to narcotics and insane sexuality.
<p>
These afflictions are only some of the symptoms of social and personal disintegration. One has but to look at our half-ruined American cities, with their ghastly rates of murder and rape, to perceive that we moderns lack the moral imagination and the right reason required to maintain tolerable community. Writers in learned quarterlies or in daily syndicated columns use the terms "post-Christian era" or "post-modern epoch" to imply that we are breaking altogether with our cultural past, and are entering upon some new age of a bewildering character.
<p>
Some people, the militant secular humanists in particular, seem pleased by this prospect; but yesteryear's meliorism is greatly weakened in most quarters. Even Marxist ideologues virtually have ceased to predict the approach of a Golden Age. To most observers, T. S. Eliot among them, it has seemed far more probable that we are stumbling into a new Dark Age, inhumane, merciless, a totalist political domination in which the life of spirit and the inquiring intellect will be denounced, harassed, and propagandized against: Orwell's <I>Nineteen Eight-Four,</I> rather than Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i> of cloying sensuality. Or perhaps Tolkien's blasted and servile land of Mordor may serve as symbol of the human condition in the twenty-first century (which, however, may not be called the twenty-first century, the tag Anno Domini having been abolished as joined to one of the superstitions of the childhood of the race).
<p>
<b>At the End of an Era.</b> Some years ago I was sitting in the parlor of an ancient house in the close of York Minster. My host, Basil Smith, the Minster's Treasurer then, a man of learning and of faith, said to me that we linger at the end of an era; soon the culture we have known will be swept into the dustbin of history. About us, as we talked in that medieval mansion, loomed Canon Smith's tall bookcases lined with handsome volumes; his doxological clock chimed the half-hour musically; flames flared up in his fireplace. Was all this setting of culture, and much more besides, to vanish away as if the Evil Spirit had condemned it? Basil Smith is buried now, and so is much of the society he ornamented and tried to redeem. At the time I thought him too gloomy; but already a great deal that he foresaw has come to pass.
<p>
The final paragraph of Malcolm Muggeridge's essay 'The Great Liberal Death Wish" must suffice, the limits of my time with you considered, as a summing-up of the human predicament at the end of the twentieth century.
<p>
"As the astronauts soar into the vast eternities of space," Muggeridge writes, "on earth the garbage piles higher, as the groves of academe extend their domain, their alumni's arms reach lower, as the phallic cult spreads, so does impotence. In great wealth, great poverty; in health, sickness, in numbers, deception. Gorging, left hungry; sedated, left restless; telling all, hiding all; in flesh united, forever separate. So we press on through the valley of abundance that leads to the wasteland of satiety, passing through the gardens of fantasy; seeking happiness ever more ardently, and finding despair ever more surely."
<p>
Just so. Such recent American ethical writers as Stanley Hauwerwas and Alasdair MacIntyre concur in Muggeridge's verdict on the society of our time, concluding that nothing can be done, except for a remnant to gather in little "communities of character" while society slides toward its ruin. Over the past half-century, many other voices of reflective men and women have been heard to the same effect. Yet let us explore the question of whether a reinvigoration of our culture is conceivable.
<p>
<b>Surprise Turning Points.</b> Is the course of nations inevitable? Is there some fixed destiny for great states? In 1796, a dread year for Britain, old Edmund Burke declared that we cannot foresee the future; often the historical determinists are undone by the coming of events that nobody has predicted. At the very moment when some states "seemed plunged in unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster ' Burke wrote in his <i>First Letter on a Regicide Peace,</I> "they have suddenly emerged. They have begun a new course, and opened a new reckoning; and even in the depths of their calamity, and on the very ruins of their country, have laid the foundations of a towering and durable greatness. All this has happened without any apparent previous change in the general circumstances which had brought on their distress. The death of a man at a critical juncture, his disgust, his retreat, his disgrace, have brought innumerable calamities on a whole nation. A common soldier, a child, a girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of fortune, and almost of Nature."
<p>
The "common soldier" to whom Burke refers is Arnold of Winkelreid, who flung himself upon the Austrian spears to save his country; the child is the young Hannibal, told by his father to wage ruthless war upon Rome; the girl at the door of an inn is Joan of Arc. We do not know why such abrupt reversals or advances occur, Burke remarks; perhaps they are indeed the work of Providence.
<p>
"Nothing is, but thinking makes it so," the old adage runs. If most folk come to believe that our culture must collapse-why, then collapse it will. Yet Burke, after all, was right in that dreadful year of 1796. For despite the overwhelming power of the French revolutionary movement in that year, in the long run Britain defeated her adversaries, and after the year 1812 Britain emerged from her years of adversity to the height of her power. Is it conceivable that American civilization, and in general what we call "Western Civilization," may recover from the Time of Troubles that commenced in 1914 (so Arnold Toynbee instructs us) and in the twenty-first century enter upon an Augustan age of peace and restored order?
<p>
To understand these words "civilization" and "culture," the best book to read is T. S. Eliot's slim volume <i>Notes Towards the Definition of Culture,</I> published forty-four years ago.
<p>
Once upon a time I commended that book to President Nixon, in a private discussion of modern disorders, as the one book which he ought to read for guidance in his high office. Man is the only creature possessing culture, as distinguished from instinct; and if culture is effaced, so is the distinction between man and the brutes that perish. "Art is man's nature," in Edmund Burke's phrase; and if the human arts, or culture, cease to be, then human nature ceases to be.
<p>
From what source did humankind's many cultures arise? Why, from cults. A cult is a joining together for worship-that is, the attempt of people to commune with a transcendent power. It is from association in the cult, the body of worshippers, that human community grows. This basic truth has been expounded in recent decades by such eminent historians as Christopher Dawson, Eric Voegelin, and Arnold Toynbee.
<p>
Once people are joined in a-cult, cooperation in many other things becomes possible. Common defense, irrigation, systematic agriculture, architecture, the visual arts, music, the more intricate crafts, economlc production and distribution, courts and government-all these aspects of a culture arise gradually from the cult, the religious de.
<p>
Out of little knots of worshippers, in Egypt, the Fertile Crescent, India, or China, there grew up simple cultures; for those joined by religion can dwell together and work together in relative peace. Presently such simple cultures may develop into intricate cultures, and those intricate cultures into great civilizations. American civilization of our era is rooted, strange though the fact may seem to us, in tiny knots of worshippers in Palestine, Greece, and Italy, thousands of years ago. The enormous material achievements of our civilization have resulted, if remotely, from the spiritual insights of prophets and seers.
<p>
But suppose that the cult withers, with the elapse of centuries. What then of the culture that is rooted in the cult? What then of the civilization which is the culture's grand manifestation? For an answer to such uneasy questions, we can turn to a twentieth century parable. Here I think of G. K Chesterton's observation that all life being an allegory, we can understand it only in parable.
<p>
<b>Parable of the Future.</b> The author of my parable, however, is not Chesterton, but a quite different writer, the late Robert Graves, whom I once visited in Mallorca I have in mind Graves's romance <i>Seven Days in New Crete</I>-published in America under the title <I>Watch the North Wind Rise.</i>
<p>
In that highly readable romance of a possible future, we are told that by the close of the "Late Christian epoch" the world will have fallen altogether, after a catastrophic war and devastation, under a collectivistic domination, a variant of Communism. Religion, the moral imagination, and nearly everything that makes life worth living have been virtually extirpated by ideology and nuclear war. k system of thought and government called Logicalism, "pantisocratic economics divorced from any religious or national theory," rules the world-for a brief time.
<p>
In Graves's words:
<p><blockquote>
Logicalism, hinged on international science, ushered in a gloomy and anti-poetic age. It lasted only a generation or two and ended with a grand defeatism, a sense of perfect futility, that slowly crept over the directors and managers of the regime. The common man had triumphed over his spiritual betters at last, but what was to follow? To what could he look forward with either hope or fear? By the abolition of sovereign states and the disarming of even the police forces, war had become impossible. No one who cherished any religious beliefs whatever, or was interested in sport, poetry, or the arts, was allowed to hold a position of public responsibility. "Ice-cold logic" was the most valued civic quality, and those who could not pretend to it were held of no account. Science continued laboriously to expand its over-large corpus of information, and the subjects of research grew more and more beautifully remote and abstract; yet the scientific obsession, so strong at the beginning of the third millennium A. D., was on the wane. Logicalist officials who were neither defeatist nor secretly religious and who kept their noses to the grindstone from a sense of duty, fell prey to colobromania, a mental disturbance....
</blockquote><p>
<p>
Rates of abortion and infanticide, of suicide, and other indices of social boredom rise with terrifying speed under this Logicalist regime. Gangs of young people go about robbing, beating, and murdering, for the sake of excitement. It appears that the human race will become extinct if such tendencies continue; for men and women find life not worth living under such a domination. The deeper longings of humanity have been outraged, so that the soul and the state stagger on the verge of final darkness. But in this crisis an Israeli Sophocrat writes a book called <i>A Critique of Utopias,</I> in which he examines seventy Utopian writings, from Plato to Aldous Huxley. "We must retrace our steps," he concludes, "or perish." Only by the resurrection of religious faith, the Sophocrats discover, can mankind be kept from total destruction; and that religion, as Graves describes it in his romance, springs from the primitive soil of myth and symbol.
<p>
Graves really is writing about our own age, not of some remote future: of life in today's United States and today's Soviet Union. He is saying that culture arises from the cult; and that when belief in the cult has been wretchedly enfeebled, the culture will decay swiftly. The material order rests upon the spiritual order.
<p>
So it has come to pass, here in the closing years of the twentieth century. With the weakening of the moral order, "Things fall apart; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world ... " The Hellenic and the Roman cultures went down to dusty death after this fashion. What may be done to achieve reinvigoration?
<p>
<b>No Substitute.</b> Some well-meaning folk talk of a "civil religion," a kind of cult of patriotism, founded upon a myth of national virtue and upon veneration of certain historic documents, together with a utilitarian morality. But such experiments of a secular character never have functioned satisfactorily; and it scarcely is necessary for me to point out the perils of such an artificial creed, bound up with nationalism: the example of the ideology of the National Socialist Party in Germany, half a century ago, may suffice. Worship of the state, or of the national commonwealth, is no healthy substitute for communion with transcendent love and wisdom.
<p>
Nor can attempts at persuading people that religion is "useful" meet with much genuine success. No man sincerely goes down on his knees to the divine because he has been told that such rituals lead to the beneficial consequences of tolerably honest behavior in commerce. People will conform their actions to the precepts of religion only when they earnestly believe the doctrines of that religion to be true.
<p>
Still less can it suffice to assert that the Bible is an infallible authority on everything, literally interpreted, in defiance of the natural sciences and of other learned disciplines; to claim to have received private revelations from Jehovah; or to embrace some self-proclaimed mystic from the gorgeous East, whose teachings are patently absurd.
<p>
In short, the culture can be renewed only if the cult is renewed; and faith in divine power cannot be summoned up merely when that is found expedient. Faith no longer works wonders among us: one has but to glance at the typical church built nowadays, ugly and shoddy, to discern how architecture no longer is nurtured by the religious imagination. It is so in nearly all d e works of twentieth century civilization: the modern mind has been secularized so thoroughly that "culture" is assumed by most people to have no connection with the love of God.
<p>
How are we to account for this widespread decay of the religious impulse? It appears that the principal cause of the loss of the idea of the holy is the attitude called "scientism"-that is, the popular notion that the revelations of natural science, over the past century and a half or two centuries, somehow have proved that men and women are naked apes merely, that the ends of existence are production and consumption merely; that happiness is the gratification of sensual impulses; and that concepts of the resurrection of the flesh and the life everlasting are mere exploded superstitions. Upon these scientistic assumptions, public schooling in America is founded nowadays, implicitly.
<p>
This view of the human condition has been called-by C S. Lewis, in particular-reductionism: it reduces human beings almost to mindlessness; it denies the existence of the soul. Reductionism has become almost an ideology. It is scientistic, but not scientific: for it is a far cry from the understanding of matter and energy that one finds in the addresses of Nobel prize winners in physics, say.
<p>
Popular notions of "what science says" are archaic :, reflecting the assertions of the scientists of the middle of the nineteenth century; such views are a world away from the writings of Stanley Jaki, the cosmologist and historian of science, who was awarded the Templeton Prize for progress in religion last year.
<p>
As Arthur Koestler remarks in his little book <i>The Roots of Coincidence,</I> yesterday's scientific doctrines of materialism and mechanism ought to be buried now with a requiem of electronic music. Once more, in biology as in physics, the scientific disciplines enter upon the realm of mystery.
<p>
Yet the great public always suffers from the affliction called cultural lag. If most people continue to fancy that scientific theory of a century ago is the verdict of serious scientists today, will not the religious understanding of life continue to wither, and civilization continue to crumble?
<p>
<b>Hard Truth.</b> Perhaps; but the future, I venture to remind you, is unknowable. Conceivably we may be given a Sign. Yet such an event being in I he hand of God, if it is to occur at all, meanwhile some reflective people declare that our culture must be reanimated, by a great effort of will.
<p>
More than forty years ago, that remarkable historian Christopher Dawson, in his book <i>Religion and Culture,</I> expressed this hard truth strongly. "The events of the last few years," Dawson wrote, "portend either the end of human history or a turning point in it. They have warned us in letters of fire that our civilization has been tried in the balance and found wanting-that there is an absolute limit to the progress than can be achieved by the perfectionment of scientific techniques detached from spiritual aims and moral values.... The recovery of moral control and the return to spiritual order have become the indispensable conditions of human survival. But they can be achieved only by a profound change in the spirit of modern civilization. This does not mean a new religion or a new culture but a movement of spiritual reintegration which would restore that vital relation between religion and culture which has existed at every age and on every level of human development."
<p>
Amen to that. The alternative to such a successful endeavor, a conservative endeavor, to reinvigorate our culture would be a series of catastrophic events, the sort predicted by Pitirim Sorokin and other sociologists, which eventually might efface our present sensate culture and bring about a new ideational culture, the character of which we cannot even imagine. Such an ideational culture doubtless would have its religion: but it might be the worship of what has been called the Savage God
<p>
Such ruin has occurred repeatedly in history. When the classical religion ceased to move hearts and minds, two millennia ago, thus the Graeco Roman civilization went down to Avernus. As my little daughter Cecilia put it unprompted, some years ago looking at a picture book of Roman history, "And then, at the end of a long summer's day, there came Death, Mud, Crud."
<p>
Great civilizations have ended in slime. Outside the ancient city of York, where York Minster stands upon the site of the Roman praetorium, there lies a racecourse known as the Knavesmire. Here in medieval time were buried the knaves-the felons and paupers. When, a few years ago, the racecourse was being enlarged, the diggers came upon a Roman graveyard beneath, or in part abutting upon, the medieval burial ground. This appeared to have been a cemetery of the poor of Romano-British times. Few valuable artifacts were uncovered, but the bones were of interest. Many of the people there interred, in the closing years of Roman power in Britain, had been severely deformed, apparently suffering from rickets and other afflictions-deformed spines and limbs and skulls. Presumably they had suffered lifelong, and died, from extreme malnutrition. At the end, decadence comes down to that, for nearly everybody.
<p>
It was at York that the dying Septimius Severus, after his last campaign (against the Scots), was asked by his brutal sons, Geta and Caracalla, "Father, when you are gone, how shall we govern the empire?" The hard old emperor had his laconic reply ready: "Pay the soldiers. The rest do not matter." There would come a time when the soldiers could not be paid, and then civilization would fall to pieces. The last Roman army in Italy-it is said to have been composed entirely of cavalry- fought in league with the barbarian general Odoacer against Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, in the year 491; on Odoacer's defeat, the Roman soldiers drifted home, nevermore to take arms: the end of an old song Only the earlier stages of social decadence-seem liberating to some people; the last act, as Cecilia Kirk perceived, consists of Death, Mud, Crud.
<p>
In short, it appears to me that our culture labors in an advanced state of decadence; that what many people mistake for the triumph of our civilization actually consists of powers that are disintegrating our culture; that the vaunted "democratic freedom" of liberal society in reality is servitude to appetites and illusions which attack religious belief; which destroy community through excessive centralization and urbanization; which efface life-giving tradition and custom.
<p>
<blockquote>
History has many cunning passages, contrieved corridors <BR>And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions, <BR>Guides us by vanities.
</blockquote>
<p>
So Gerontion instructs us, in T. S. Eliot's famous grim poem. By those and some succeeding lines, Eliot means that human experience lived without the Logos, the Word; lived merely by the asserted knowledge of empirical science-why, history in that sense is a treacherous gypsy witch. Civilizations that reject or abandon the religious imagination must end, as did Gerontion, in fractured atoms.
<p>
<b>Restoring Religious Insights.</b> In conclusion, it is my argument that the elaborate civilization we have known stands in peril; that it may expire of lethargy, or be destroyed by violence, or perish, from a combination of both evils. We who think that life remains worth living ought to address ourselves to means by which a restoration of our culture may be achieved. A prime necessity for us is to restore an apprehension of religious insights in our clumsy apparatus of public instruction, which -bullied by militant secular humanists and presumptuous federal courts-has been left with only ruinous answers to the ultimate questions.
<p>
What ails modern civilization? Fundamentally, our society's affliction is the decay of religious belief If a culture is to survive and flourish, it must not be severed from the religious vision out of which it arose. The high necessity of reflective men and women, then, is to labor for the restoration of religious teachings as a credible body of doctrine.
<p>
"Redeem the time; redeem the dream," T. S. Eliot wrote. It remains possible, given right reason and moral imagination, to confront boldly the age's disorders. The restoration of true learning, humane and scientific; the reform of many public policies; the renewal of our awareness of a transcendent order, and of the presence of an Other, the brightening of the comers where we find ourselves such approaches are open to those among the rising generation who look for a purpose in life. It is just conceivable that we may be given a Sign before the end of the twentieth century; yet Sign or no Sign, Remnant must strive against the follies of the time.

<P>
The literature of natural law is complex, copious, and monthly growing vaster. All I aspire to accomplish in this second lecture on "The Future of Justice" is to offer some general introduction to the subject, together with reflections on the protections and dangers of natural-law doctrines, and observations concerning natural law and constitutional government.
<p>
A great deal of loose talk about natural law has occurred in very recent years. It was objected to Judge Bork' s nomination to the Supreme Court that Bork did not believe in natural law; and when Judge Thomas was interrogated for that bench, the objection was raised that he <i>did</i> believe in natural law. These protestations came mostly from the same group of senators. Clearly a good many public men and women nowadays have only vague notions of what is signified by this term <i>natural law.</i>
<p>
Objectively speaking, <i>natural law,</i> as a term of politics and jurisprudence, may be defined as a loosely knit body of rules of action prescribed by an authority superior to the state. These rules variously (according to the several differing schools of natural-law and natural-rights speculation) are derived from divine commandment; from the nature of humankind; from abstract Reason; or from long experience of mankind in community.
<p>
But natural law does not appertain to states and courts merely. For primarily it is a body of ethical perceptions or rules governing the life of the individual person, quite aside from politics and jurisprudence. When many persons ignore or flout the natural law for human beings, the consequences presently are ruinous-as with the unnatural vices that result in the disease of AIDS, or with the ideological passions, defying the norm of justice, that have ravaged most nations since the First World War.
<p>
The natural law should not be taken for graven Tables of Governance, to be followed to jot and tittle; appealed to in varying circumstances, the law of nature must be applied with high prudence. As Alessandro d'Entreves writes, "The lesson of natural law is in fact nothing but an assertion that law is a part of ethics." And, he concludes "The lesson of natural law [is] simply to remind the jurist of his own limitations.... This point where values and norms coincide, which is the ultimate origin of law and at the same time the beginning of moral life proper, is, I believe, what men for over two thousand years have indicated by the name of natural law."
<p>
On the one hand, natural law must be distinguished from positive or statutory law, decreed by the state; on the other, from the "laws of nature" in a scientific sense-that is, from propositions expressing the regular order of certain natural phenomena Also natural law sometimes is confounded with assertions of "natural rights," which may or may not be founded upon classical and medieval concepts of natural law.
<p>
The most important early treatise on natural law is Cicero's <i>De Re Publica.</i> The Ciceronian understanding of natural law, which still exercises strong influence, was well expressed in the nineteenth century by Froude: "Our human laws are but the copies, more or less imperfect, of the eternal laws so far as we can read them, and either succeed and promote our welfare, or fail and bring confusion and disaster, according as the legislator's insight has detected the true principle, or has been distorted by ignorance or selfishness."
<p>
As interpreted by the Roman jurisconsult, and later by the medieval Schoolmen and Canonists- Thomas Aquinas especially-the legacy of the classical <i>jus naturale</i> endured with little challenge until the seventeenth century. In England during the sixteenth century it was powerfully upheld by Richard Hooker in his <i>Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity.</i> In the Christian world the natural law was received as a body of unwritten rules depending upon universal conscience and common sense, ascertainable by right reason. But with the stirrings of secularism and rationalism during the seventeenth century, a new interpretation of "natural law" began to develop, conspicuous (near the end of the century) in the works of Hugo Grotius and Baron Samuel von Pufendorf. This latter secularized concept of natural law was held by many of the <i>philosophes</i> of the eighteenth century, and took on flesh during the French Revolution, when it was vulgarized by Thomas Paine.
<p>
Nevertheless, the older understanding of natural law was not extinguished. It was ringingly reasserted by Edmund Burke, in his distinction between the "real" and the "pretended" rights of men. Through the disciples of Burke, and through the influence of the Catholic Church, the classical and Christian natural law has experienced a revival in the latter half of the twentieth century.
<p>
During the nineteenth century, natural-law concepts were overshadowed by the powerful Utilitarian system of Jeremy Bentham; by the theories of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists; by legal positivism; and later-particularly in the United States-by legal pragmatism. In the United States, the older and newer schools of natural law have contended against each other since the latter half of the eighteenth century, and both have been hotly assailed by positivistic, utilitarian, and pragmatic interpretations of law. Yet appeals to the "natural law" or "a higher law" have recurred often in American politics and jurisprudence; both conservatives and radicals, from time to time, have invoked this law of nature
<p>
The Catholic Church continues to adhere to the classical and Thomistic understanding of the natural law-to an apprehension of Justice that is rooted in the wisdom of the species. Sir Ernest Barker put thus the idea of natural law: "This justice is conceived as being the higher or ultimate law, proceeding from the nature of the universe from the Being of God and the reason of man. It follows that law-in the sense of the law of the last resort-is somehow above lawmaking."
<p>
The most lucid and popular exposition of natural law it to be found in the Appendix, "Illustrations of the Tao," to C. S. Lewis's little book <i>The Abolition of Man.</i> Therein Lewis distinguishes eight major natural laws of universal recognition and application, together with several illustrations of each, drawn from a wide diversity of cultures, religions, philosophical discourses, and countries. He expounds the Law of General Beneficence; the Law of Special Beneficence; Duties to Parents, Elders, Ancestors; Duties to Children and Posterity; the Law of Justice; the Law of Good Faith and Veracity; the Law of Mercy; the Law of Magnanimity. No code of the laws of nature ever having existed, it is ineffectual to try to enforce that body of ethical principles through courts of law; no judge hands down decisions founded directly upon the admonition, "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land"-or the Commandment's equivalents in the Babylonian List of Sins, the Egyptian Confession of the Righteous Soul, the Manual of Epictetus, Leviticus, the Analects, or Hindu books of wisdom. Nevertheless, such perpetual precepts lie behind the customs and the statutes that shelter father and mother.
<p>
So much, succinctly, by way of definition. Turn we now to the difficulty of explaining natural law to the average sensual man. Permit me to discourse with you for a little while about natural law and the moral imagination. Incidentally, I am helped here by an unpublished essay by the late Raymond English, who understood and praised the natural law, and understood and despised the claims for "natural right." Let me quote English directly:
<p><blockquote>
The natural law cannot be understood except through the elements of poetry and imagination in the soul. The poetic and the moral imagination are parts of human reason. For the man who does not feel himself in some sense a child of God, who is not possessed by the "desire and pursuit of the whole," and for whom words like honor are meaningless, the notion of natural law must be a Mumbojumbo, a bogle to make children behave tolerably well, a fantasy from the adolescence or the childhood of the race. Poets, James Elroy Flecker says, are those who swear that Beauty lives although lilies die; and the natural law is the poetry of political science, the assurance that Justice lives though states are imperfect and ephemeral. Justice is to politics what beauty is to art; indeed, beauty and justice become almost identical at the highest levels of human aspiration.
</blockquote><p>
Permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to repeat here that the natural law is more than a guide for statesmen and jurists. It is meant primarily for the governance of persons-for you and me, that we may restrain will and appetite in our ordinary walks of life. Natural law is not a harsh code that we thrust upon other people: rather, it is an ethical knowledge, innate perhaps, but made more clearly known to us through -the operation of right reason. And the more imagination with which a person is endowed, the more will he apprehend the essence of the natural law, and understand its necessity. If such a one, despite his power of imagination, offends against the natural law, the greater must be his suffering. So I have discovered in the course of a peregrine life. And over a good many decades I have found that most contemners of the natural law are dull dogs, afflicted by a paucity of imagination. As Adam Mickiewicz instructs us:
<p><blockquote>
Your soul deserves the place to which it came,<br>If having entered Hell, you feel no flame.
</blockquote><p>
Such is the case for the importance of natural law. Permit me to turn now to the case against natural law, as expressed by the legal positivists-most strongly, perhaps, by the German scholar Hans Kelsen. They regard natural law as a body of sentimental fictions; they hold that the state is the only true source of law. The views of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists are similar: all law is decreed by the political sovereign, they hold. Rather than moving abstractly among the several schools of jurisprudence in the twentieth century, I offer you now the contents of a letter I received recently from a German inventor and industrialist who had read in the Bavarian magazine <i>Epoche</i> some remarks of mine on natural law. My correspondent is a very intelligent and indeed talented man, considerable of a naturalist in that he studies flora and fauna. In politics, I suppose he may be classified as a German liberal of the old school. His communication, refreshingly innocent of the jargon of jurisprudence and ethics, suggests the mentality that lies behind the denigration of natural law by positivists and secular humanists, who recognize and deride the Christian and the classical origins of the idea of natural law.
<p>
"Whether the term 'law of nature' is more frequently used nowadays, or whether the <i>jus naturale</i> is an old invention," my German correspondent begins, "I think this term is wrong and misleading. There is no law or legislative system which can be derived from nature. Nature has rules developed during evolution, but there is only a <i>jus hominis</i> and no <i>jus naturale."</I>
<p>
"In other words," my friend goes on, 
<p><blockquote>
all ethical norms are developed and worked out by human beings, in this case mostly by the homo stultus, subspecies sapiens.... The order of nature follows in many respects the right of the stronger, which, in fact, keeps nature with all its plants and animals in excellent shape. But mankind has set up ethical rules, good ones and bad ones, very different from natural rules. Many of these man-made rules are quite bad, sinning against nature....
<P>
The very deplorable situation of the species homo stultus comes from wrong ethical rules, which are against nature. I am not pleading for the right of the stronger between human beings, but for more influence of the rare subspecies sapiens, especially of those individuals who understand nature-which means also the nature of human character. Unfortunately Jesus did not understand the real nature of men; nor do the socialists understand it when they expect that people will work for the state rather than for themselves....
<P>
I offer another example, in which American legislators have chosen the wrong solution. There is a law in the United States, if I am correct, which forbids the killing of foreign heads of state. If I am correct this is concerned with clandestine actions, e.g. by the CIA. This law is unethical. Assuming that no American president or the American government plans to eliminate a foreign dictator just for fun, but rather because he is a danger to the United States or to his own people or both, then removing a dictator as soon as possible would save the lives of many; and is, in consequence, completely justified.
<P>
We should agree that right is an exclusively human creation. What is regarded as rightful by one group of people within a community, can be regarded as wrongful by another group. I seek a terminology where there is a clean and clear distinction between what comes from nature and what comes from human efforts. Human efforts are aimed very often, with the best intentions, in the wrong direction. I mean "wrong" in this sense: against nature, for nature cannot be neglected without harming the human race....
<P>
Failing to realize that often human character is bad must lead to destroying a society through leniency. We have to determine when our ethical laws accord with nature and when they counteract nature. We must not ignore "the rule of the fittest," when we decide to kill a dictator, for instance. We acknowledge the right of every nation to use as much force as possible when fighting another nation to death. The fight between nations follows what could be called natural right, but is better called the rule of nature.
</blockquote><p>
For this German correspondent of mine, you will have noted, "nature" signifies animal nature, Darwinian nature, red in tooth and claw. Therefore he despises appeals to natural law, and believes that not only all positive or traditional law, but all ethical principles, are human creations merely. And these human contrivances, he implies, sometimes may be mistaken; we might be wiser to found our human institutions on the principle of competition, favoring the fitter.
<p>
Here, I suggest, we perceive the mentality that lies back of the jurisprudence of Hans Kelsen and certain other positivists: critics of the whole concept of natural law.
<p>
Yet in one matter my correspondent does turn to the extreme medicine of natural law: his commendation of tyrannicide. This is interesting, as it is related to Germany in this century.
<p>
German jurisprudence demands that the citizen be strictly obedient to the state, for the state is the source of all law? the omniscient keeper of the peace. No law but positive law has been recognized in Germany since the fall of the German monarchy; natural law has no place at all.
<p>
Adolph Hitler, chosen Reichschancellor by lawful means, and confirmed in power by the Reichstag in 1933, was sustained later by national plebiscites. He was the head of the German state, the source of all law, to which all Germans had been taught obedience. Yet certain Germans-army officers, scholars, professional people, chiefly-found his actions evil. By quasi-constitutional means he had subverted the constitution. His popularity had become tremendous, and his military power. Only by death might he be removed.
<p>
Therefore a little knot of brave and conscientious men determined to save Germany and Europe by killing Hitler. They had been reared in the doctrine that all citizens must obey the inerrant state. In this exigency, however, they turned to doctrines of natural law for justification. Was there no remedy against an unnatural master of the state? In the teachings of natural law they discerned a fatal remedy. Fatal to them, at least; for nearly all of the heroic men involved in the several conspiracies against Hitler died frightful deaths. I knew well Dr. Ludwig Freund, a kindly professor of political science, one of the two survivors of the first plot to kill Hitler. By nature Professor Freund was a law-abiding gentleman. And being law-abiding, in defense of true law he was prepared to slay the chief of state, perverter of Germany's laws and the laws of man's nature.
<p>
I repeat that we have recourse to natural law, as opposed to positive law, only as a last resort, ordinarily. My only service as a jurist occurred in Morton Township, Mecosta County, some decades ago, when for two consecutive terms I was elected-unanimously-justice of the peace. When determining a disputed boundary between two farms, a justice of the peace does not repair to theories of natural law and meditate upon which of two claimants is the more worthy of judicial compassion; rather, the justice of the peace turns to statute, common law, possibly to local custom- and to the files of the recorder of deeds at the county seat. And so it is with the ordinary administration of law at every level. Statute, charter, and prescription ordinarily are sufficient to maintain the rule of law-the end of which, we ought not to forget, is to keep the peace.
<p>
Yet to guide the sovereign; the chief of state; the legislator; the public prosecutor; the judge when, in effect, he sits in equity-to guide you and me, indeed-there endures the natural law, which in essence is man's endeavor to maintain a moral order through the operation of a mundane system of justice. Unlike my German correspondent, the sustainer of natural law knows that there is law for man, and law for thing; and that our moral order is not the creation of coffee-house philosophers. Human nature ; not vulpine nature, leonine nature, or serpentine nature. Natural law is bound up with the concept of the dignity of man, and with the experience of humankind ever since the beginnings of social community.
<p>
It will not do to substitute private interpretations of natural law for common law or civil law, any more than it would have been well for England, during the Reformation, to have obeyed the "Geneva Men" by sweeping away common law and the whole inherited apparatus of parliamentary statutes, to substitute the laws of the ancient Jews. Positive law and customary law, in any country, grow out of a people's experience in community; natural law should have its high part in shaping and restraining positive and customary laws, but natural law could not conceivably supplant judicial institutions. Yet were natural-law concepts to be abandoned altogether-why, then, indeed, the world would find itself governed by 
<P><blockquote>
The good old rule, the good old plan, <BR>That they shall take who have the power, <BR>And they shall keep who can.
</blockquote><P>
Turn we now to relationships between the natural law and the American judiciary. Not since Associate Justice Joseph Story adorned the Supreme Court of the United States, early in the nineteenth century, has any member of the Supreme Court had much to say about natural law. Nevertheless, in recent decades a number of Supreme Court decisions seem to have been founded upon natural-law notions of a sort. I think, for instance, of the Warren Court's decision (the opinion written by Chief Justice Warren himself) that congressional districts within the several states must be so drawn in their boundaries as to contain so nearly as possible the same number of persons within the several districts-a matter previously left to the discretion of state legislatures. In part, this intervention was founded upon Jeremy Bentham's principle of one man, one vote; but also there seems to have lurked at the back of the minds of justices the notion that exact political equality, as told by numbers, somehow is "natural," whatever state and federal constitutions might prescribe and whatever the opinions of the Framers may have been. One might cite, too, the Court's decisions in the school desegregation cases. This question having been raised, let us examine how far we should appeal to natural law against statute and Constitution. Here we turn to an historical example and to the judgment of a leading American political and religious writer who endeavored to reconcile the claims of authority and the claims of freedom.
<p>
I refer to the "higher law" controversy of 1850 and to Orestes Brownson, the Catholic scholar and polemicist. In March 1850, on the floor of the United States Senate, William Henry Seward made his famous declaration that there exists "a higher law than the Constitution." He was referring to the Fugitive Slave Law and the Supreme Court. At once a hot controversy arose. In January 1851, Brownson published his review-essay entitled "The Higher Law," in which he refuted the claim of Seward, the Abolitionists, and the Free-Soilers to transcend the Constitution by appealing to a moral "higher law" during debate on the Fugitive Slave Bill.
<p>
Brownson agreed with Seward that 
<p><blockquote>
there is a higher law than the Constitution. The law of God is supreme, and overrides all human enactments, and every human enactment incompatible with it is null and void from the beginning, and cannot be obeyed with a good conscience, for "we must obey God rather than men." This is the great truth statesmen and lawyers are extremely prone to overlook, which the temporal authority not seldom practically denies, and on which the Church never fails to insist....
<P>
But the concession of the fact of a higher law than the Constitution does not of itself justify the appeal to it against the Constitution, either by Mr. Seward or the opponents of the Fugitive Slave Law. Mr. Seward had no right, while holding his seat in the Senate under the Constitution, to appeal to the higher law against the Constitution, because that was to deny the very authority by which he held his seat.... After having taken his oath to support the Constitution, the Senator had, so far as he was concerned, settled the question, and it was no longer for him an open question. In calling God to witness his determination to support the Constitution, he had called God to witness his conviction of the compatibility. If the Constitution with the law of God, and therefore left himself no plea for appealing from it to a higher law.
</blockquote><p>
We cannot be bound, Brownson continued, to obey a law that is in contravention of the law of God.
<p><blockquote>
This is the grand principle held by the old martyrs, and therefore they chose martyrdom rather than obedience to the state commanding them to act contrary to the Divine law. But who is to decide whether a special civil enactment be or be not repugnant to the law of God? Here is a grave and perplexing question for those who have no divinely authorized interpreter of the divine law.
</blockquote><p>
The Abolitionists and Free-Soilers, Brownson remarked, had adopted the Protestant principle of private judgment.
<p><blockquote>
But this places the individual above the state, and is wholly incompatible with the simplest conception of civil government. No civil government can exist, none is conceivable even, when every individual is free to disobey its orders whenever they do not happen to square with his private convictions of what is the law of God.
</blockquote><p>
The Church, Brownson writes, is the authoritative interpreter of the divine law. He reminds his readers that the state is ordained of God; but the state is not the supreme and infallible organ of God's will on earth.
<p><blockquote>
Now it is clear that Mr. Seward and his friends, the Abolitionists and the Free Soilers, have nothing to which they can appeal from the action of government but their private interpretation of the law of God, that is to say, their own private judgment or opinion as individuals; for it is notorious that they are good Protestants, holding the pretended right of private judgment, and rejecting all authoritative interpretation of the Divine law. To appeal from government to private judgment is to place private judgment above public authority, the individual above the state, which, as we have seen, is incompatible with the very existence of government, and therefore, since government is a divine ordinance, absolutely forbidden by the law of God-that very higher law invoked to justify resistance to civil enactments.... No man can ever be justifiable in resisting the civil law under the pretense that it is repugnant to the Divine law, when he has only his private judgment, or, what is the same thing, his private interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, to tell him what the Divine law is on the point in question, because the principle on which he would act in doing so would be repugnant to the very existence of government, and therefore in contravention of the ordinance, therefore of the law, of God.
</blockquote><p>
Brownson's argument-which we have not time enough to analyze in full today-in substance is this, in his own words: "Mr. Seward and his friends asserted a great and glorious principle, but misapplied it." It was not for them to utter commands in the name of God. Their claims, if carried far enough, would lead to anarchy. The arguments of some of their adversaries would lead to Statolatry, the worship of the state.
<p><blockquote>
The cry for liberty abolishes all loyalty, and destroys the principle and the spirit of obedience, while the usurpations of the state leave to conscience no freedom, to religion no independence. The state tramples on the spiritual prerogatives of the Church, assumes to itself the functions of schoolmaster and director of consciences, and the multitude clap their hands, and call it liberty and progress!
</blockquote><p>
Brownson advocated compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law, which clearly was constitutional; indeed, obligatory under Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution It was his hope to avert the Civil War which burst out ten years later. "Now there is a right and a wrong way of defending the truth, and it is always easier to defend the truth on sound than on unsound principles," he wrote. "If men were less blind and headstrong, they would see that the higher law can be asserted without any attack upon legitimate civil authority, and legitimate civil authority and the majesty of the law can be vindicated without asserting the absolute supremacy of the civil power, and falling into statolatry- as absurd a species of idolatry as the worship of sticks and stones."
<p>
Very possibly, ladies and gentlemen, you have found in these passages from "The Higher Law" and in Brownson's general argument various considerations highly relevant to our own era.
<p>
As Brownson remarks, the natural law (or law of God) and the American civil law are not ordinarily at swords' points. Large elements of natural law entered into the common law of England- and therefore into the common law of the United States-over the centuries; and the Roman law, so eminent in the science of jurisprudence, expresses the natural law enunciated by the Roman jurisconsults. No civilization ever has attempted to maintain the bed of justice by direct application of natural-law doctrines by magistrates; necessarily, it is by edict, rescript, and statute that any state keeps the peace through a system of courts. It simply will not do to maintain that private interpretation of natural law should be the means by which conflicting claims are settled.
<p>
Rather, natural law ought to help form the judgments of the persons who are lawmakers- whether emperors, kings, ecclesiastics, aristocratic republicans, or representatives of a democracy. The civil law should be shaped in conformity to the natural law-which originated, in Cicero's words, "before any written law existed or any state had been established."
<p>
It does not follow that judges should be permitted to push aside the Constitution, or statutory laws, in order to substitute their private interpretations of what the law of nature declares. To give the judiciary such power would be to establish what might be called an archonocracy, a domination of judges, supplanting the constitutional republic; also it surely would produce some curious and unsettling decisions, sweeping away precedent, which would be found highly distressing by friends to classical and Christian natural law. Only the Catholic Church, Brownson reasoned, has authority to interpret the laws of nature; but the Supreme Court of the United States, and the inferior federal courts, and our state courts, take no cognizance of papal encyclicals. Left to their several private judgments of what is "natural," some judges indubitably would do mischief to the person and the republic. The Supreme Court's majority decision in the case of Roe v. Wade-in which a pretended "right of privacy," previously unknown, was discovered-in actuality amounted to a declaration of the "natural right" of a mother to destroy her offspring.
<p>
Now it seems to me curiously naive to fancy that American courts always would subscribe to Thomistic concepts of the laws of nature, and abjure Jacobin doctrines of natural right. Courts of law must ordinarily accord with the general legislative authority; otherwise the Book of Judges is followed by the Book of Kings.
<p>
In the seventh edition of <i>The Conservative Mind,</i> I have written that the first canon of conservative thought is "Belief in a transcendent order, or body of natural law. Political problems, at bottom, are religious and moral problems. A narrow rationality, which Coleridge called the Understanding, cannot of itself satisfy human needs.... True politics is the art of apprehending and applying the Justice which ought to prevail in a community of souls."
<p>
Now Mr. Robert Bork, whose opinion as to the application of natural-law doctrines by members of the Supreme Court I have just now endorsed with some vigor, has taken notice of this. In an essay entitled "Natural Law and the Constitution," Mr. Bork advises my friend Mr. William Bentley Ball to abjure my exhortation of this sort. "The dictum also is inaccurate," Bork adds, "for it arbitrarily disqualifies as conservatives people who accept and struggle to preserve every conservative value but who do not believe that such values derive from a transcendent order." One might as well say, I suggest, that the Church ought not to emphasize the dogma of the Resurrection because that might alienate some people who are not Christians, but are possible well-wishers.
<p>
I have thought highly of Mr. Bork-although he seems to have no clear understanding of natural law and its function-but he appears to have thought lowly of me. Perhaps we both have been mistaken.
<p>
That federal judges, Mr. Bork included, have not been learned in the natural law is one of the educational misfortunes of our age. When the time is out of joint, we can repair to the teachings of Cicero and Aquinas and Hooker about the law of nature, in the hope that we may diminish man's inhumanity unto man. The natural law lacking, we may become so many Cains, and every man' s hand may be raised against every other man's.

All present in this room today are aware that the word "federal" does not mean "central." But the Congress of the United States, in recent decades, and frequently the Executive force, too, have been behaving as if unable to discern any distinction between the two terms. That way lies the collapse of the Constitution.
<p>
A simple instance of this occurred on Capitol Hill only nine days ago. We now have a new statute that prohibits servants of the federal government-and they are legion-from lodging in hotels (lodging at public expense, anyway) that do not have sprinklers in the ceilings of bedrooms. A few exemptions are granted, chiefly to hotels that stand less than four stories high. The act's premise is that by excluding non-complying hotels from federal patronage, virtually all innkeepers will find it necessary to install sprinklers (cost about $1,500 per room).The justification for this thoughtful legislation is that over the past six years, more than 400 persons have died in hotel fires in the United States. (Even I can master short division: this statistic, in effect, tells us that the hotel-fire death rate per annum per state has been 1.34 persons. I do not have to add statistics as to age and gender; at any rate, about one and one-third people, averaging the country over, have died in the average state in the average year, 1983-1989.) It is welt of course, to save lives; but a great many more lives might be saved by prohibiting the sale of skis through an act of Congress, or by a federal statute requiring all holders of real property to sprinkle salt on their sidewalks, whether part of the public way or private, after every snowfall.
<p>
My present point, however, is not the prudence or the expense of the act now on the statute books, but rather the political consequences of decreeing that the federal government shall prescribe and regulate all sorts of concerns previously left to the police powers of the several states and local agencies of government, or left to the sensible management of individuals, households, and firms. The Sprinkler Act is a sufficient instance of the continuing conversion of this country from a federal union for specified purposes to a centralized plebiscitary democracy, in which little discretion of choice is left to states and local communities, let alone private citizens.
<p>
<b>"Democratic Despotism."</b> Behold, Behemoth! While Americans are congratulating themselves and Europeans upon the collapse of socialist states beyond the demolished Iron Curtain, there continues to expand here in North America the empire of what Alexis deTocqueville called "democratic despotism." This is a grim tendency toward total centralization of which conservatives have long complained, in somewhat vague terms, but to which they have offered, so far, little effective resistance. Permit me to quote to you a very percipient passage in de Tocqueville's <I>Democracy in America:</I>
<p><blockquote>
I think then, that the species of oppression by which democratic nations are menaced is unlike anything that ever before existed in the world; our contemporaries will find no prototype of it in their memories. I seek in vain for an expression that will accurately convey the whole of the idea I have formed of it; the old words despotism and tyranny are inappropriate; the thing itself is new, and since I cannot name it, I must attempt to define it.
<P>
I seek to trace the novel features under which despotism may appear in the world. The first thing that strikes the observation is an innumerable multitude of men, all equal and all alike incessantly endeavoring to procure the petty and paltry pleasures with which they glut their lives. Each of them, living apart, is as a stranger to the fate of all the rest; his children and his private friends constitute to him the whole of mankind. As for the rest of his fellow citizens, he is close to them, but he does not see them; he touches them, but he does not feel them; he exists only in himself and for himself alone; and if his kindred still remain to him, he may be said at any rate to have lost his country.
<P>
Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power, which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratification and watch over their fate. That power is absolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild. It would be like the authority of a parent if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood; it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided that they think of nothing but rejoicing. For their happiness such a government willingly labors, but it chooses to be the sole agent and only arbiter of their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and subdivides their inheritances; what remains, but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living?
<P>
Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range and gradually robs the man of all the uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for these things; it has predisposed them to endure them and often to look on them as benefits.
</blockquote><p>
De Tocqueville has in mind here, obviously, a central government the intentions of which are beneficent. But suppose that some intentions are not beneficent? Or that legislation might be intended to harass or to punish a class, a faction, or some minority? Where, under centralized democratic despotism, would the dissidents hide? At the moment, however, let us confine ourselves to acts and decisions of centralized power which, on their face, seem in tended-if perhaps in error-to confer benefits upon the public. Many such examples might be cited; I confine myself to two, both of which occurred during the presidential administration of Lyndon Johnson.
<p>
<b>Accusing Arizona.</b> The first of these had to do with governmental inspection of meat. Some inspectors from the federal Department of Agriculture happened to visit Arizona, and there came into conflict with Arizona's state meat inspectors. The two sets of officials parted in wrath; the gentlemen from Washington menacing the Arizonans that they would be taught their place. Back in the seats of the mighty, these bureaucrats sent word to their departmental superiors, and thence to the President of the United States, that ill-inspected and potentially poisonous meat was being approved for public sale by Arizona's negligent meat inspectors. On learning this dread secret, President Johnson saw opportunity for making the American nation aware of his solicitude for their well being: the Great White Father. On television, he revealed the iniquities of Arizona to a frightened people, crying out emphatically, "Get rid of rotten meat! Get rid of rotten meat!"
<p>
A complaisant Congress very, very promptly passed a new act regarding the inspection of all meat, much extending the jurisdiction and the activities of that branch of the Department of Agriculture, and subjecting all state meat-inspecting bureaus to federal jurisdiction. --How thoughtful for the welfare of the American people, from sea to shining sea!
<p>
But others, not federal employees, looked into this affair, and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> published in some detail an account of what had occurred. It was discovered, tardily, that in truth standards of meat inspection had been high, not low; that in fact Arizona did not approve rotten meat of any sort; and that all this fuss had arisen out of minor disputations between federal and state officials. This revelation embarrassed and angered President Johnson, who had assumed that the Washington inspectors were honest and not spiteful; but he could scarcely go back on television, this time to cry, "Bring back rotten meat! Bring back rotten meat!" Nor did Congress trouble itself to repeal the statute, so recently enacted, that made state meat inspection standards wholly subordinate to federal regulations. Since then, federal courts have ruled that if a state has higher standards than the federal ones, nevertheless the state must admit within its jurisdiction meats that meet merely the lower federal standard. A mad world, my masters!
<p>
<b>Efficient Lobbyists.</b> Indulge me, ladies and gentlemen, in one more instance of this arrogating of power not merely over state jurisdictions, but over the American bedroom- -nay, the very bed and bedding. A federal agency abruptly ruled that all mattresses manufactured must be of the inner spring type-whether or not customers might prefer a plain cotton mattress or separate springs and mattress. This ukase, promptly enforced, put out of business many small makers of mattresses; it profited, however, big standard manufacturers who charged high prices; it appeared that lobbyists for the big mattress-making corporations had been at work efficiently in Washington. As for the American citizen who might prefer a simpler mattress and a cheaper, or for persons like your servant this lecturer, who possesses several ancestral antique beds that no inner spring mattress will fit-why, says Uncle Sam to such reactionaries, "Be comfortable, damn you, and expect to pay for it!"
<p>
I have not been able to ascertain under what fantastic interpretation of existing statutes the federal agency in question was able to prescribe the sort of mattress Americans must sleep upon. How could this possibly lie within the prescriptive jurisdiction of the general government-or, for that matter, within the police powers of the several states? Yet done the thing was. A related arbitrary regulation employed the pretext of securing the health of children-though of course that protection, too, ordinarily has been exercised by state and local authorities, or by voluntary organizations.
<p>
This latter instance of federal <i>pleonexia</i> had to do with children's nightwear. From on high in Washington it was decreed that all pajamas, nightgowns, and the like must be manufactured of fire-retardant fabrics, if children were to wear them and shops were so to display them. This measure was supposed to prevent infants from being burned alive in bed; much mention was made of the number of persons annually slain or scarred as a result of smoking in bed, though L at least, had been unaware that small children were given to smoking in bed. Enforced for a time, this paternal legislation caused severe loss to makers and retailers of children's standard nightwear who had large stocks in hand; also it conferred large commercial advantages upon those progressive manufacturers who already, doubtless through foresight and humane concern, were producing large qualities of fire retardant nightwear for tots.
<p>
But alas and lackaday! Scientific studies, within a few months, coincidentally revealed that fire-retardant nightwear indubitably has caused skin cancer, respiratory troubles, and other physical afflictions. The federal regulations in question were quietly rescinded, I believe; and I fancy that it is now permitted for us to clothe our infants with mere unadulterated cotton or wool.
<p>
<b>Grave Ills.</b> I have chosen these relatively harmless and mildly amusing instances of the excessive zeal of the Washington bureaucracy to centralize practically everything, ladies and gentlemen, lest I be taken for a dreadful scaremonger. Now and again some well-intentioned elderly lady assures me, benignly, "Uncle Sam knows what's best for us." I decidedly am not of that opinion Thorough political and economical centralization works ills much graver than the quality of meats, the distribution of bedsprings, and the fabric of nighties. For my part, I am of the opinion that deTocqueville, rather than Uncle Sam, knows what's best for us. Let me add that both John Adams, Federalist, and Thomas Jefferson, Democratic Republican, would have been astounded and indignant at the degree of centralization already well established among us, two centuries after the Constitution of the United States commenced to function. I fancy that neither one would have insisted upon a sprinkler being installed in his bedchamber, at the expense of a perversion of the Constitution.
<p>
The pretexts for giving a veneer of seeming Constitutionality to the concentration of power at Washington have been various. Our recent act to install sprinklers in hotel bedrooms is one of the less extravagant apologies-that is, it amounts merely to a refusal to pay the bills of federal employees who lodge at inns that have no sprinklers in bedrooms. (Of course every hotel in this country must be thoroughly inspected to ascertain the number of sprinklers.) Another and somewhat more severe form of compulsion is the refusal to pay any monies from the federal treasury to non-complying persons and institutions, as in the case of colleges and universities coerced into Affirmative Action programs and the like. Yet another method is the withdrawal of tax exemptions from institutions otherwise entitled to such exemptions, as in the case of Bob Jones University. The oldest method is the appeal of some federal department or federal agency to the commerce clause of the Constitution as the ground for justifying some surprising enlargement of the federal government's power; and of course that is the road taken by the Congress ever since the 182Os. The most common method employed to induce states and cities, and various voluntary associations, to submit to federal regulation is the matching grant-in-aid, often on a very large scale. And in a number of instances the Congress and Executive Branch have not troubled themselves to look for excuses in the Constitution: they simply have pushed through a piece of legislation, of national scope, without bothering to enquire whether by any stretch of the imagination such an act could be regarded as authorized by some provision of the Constitution.
<p>
<b>Consolidation By Degrees.</b> In consequence of all of this, the federal character of the United States, this country's chief contribution to the art of governance, has been fading to a shadow of a shade. And where Congress hesitated, the Supreme Court rushed in to nationalize the whole political structure. More mischief of this sort was accomplished during the reign of King Lyndon than during any other period of American history-considerably more, incidentally, than was accomplished during the reign of King Franklin-but in general the leaders of either major political party have made no strong effort to resist consolidation of power; and, after all, it has come about by degrees, not as a result of any announced design. No doubt a well-publicized plan for systematic centralization would have been hotly rejected by the American electorate; and among those opponents of deliberate centralization would have been a good many liberals.
<p>
A decay of historical consciousness among Americans has had its part in reducing resistance to the concentration of decision-making powers in the general government. Here I offer you two paragraphs written by C. Northcote Parkinson, the deviser of Parkinson's Law. Professor Parkinson declares that political centralization is the initial cause of the nation's decadence. She first stage on the downward path is one of over-centralization," Parkinson wrote in 1978.
<p><blockquote>
Everything is done to eliminate or neutralize all but the main and central seat of administration The lesser centers of power are either provincial governments or organizations which can be classified as religious, financial, military, or economic: an arch-bishopric, a national bank, a military command or a major industrial or trading group. The attempt to centralize all power in the one capital city and, indeed, in its administrative quarter, means the assimilation of all possible rival institutions from monasteries to television stations, from harbour authorities to charitable foundations. All these can be eliminated in the name of democracy or efficiency, and the result is the creation of the one government machine into which all problems are fed and from which all wisdom is to emerge. All that is initially lost is the likelihood of the government's having to listen to informed criticism from outside its inner circle of officials. Thereafter the problems centre upon the growing size and complexity of the central administration. As the civil servants multiply there is an ever-increasing distance between the citizen and the nameless people who will ultimately decide upon his application, protest, or appeal. Proceedings are cumbrous and attitudes are hierarchical, all decisions being referred from the periphery to the centre and then from the bottom to the top.
<P>
"If death come from Madrid," said sixteenth-century Spaniards, "we should all live to a very great age."
<P>
Much the same comment must have been made about Babylon, Peking, Persepolis, Delhi, and London. Less frequently noticed are two other results of over-centralisation. The first is that the normal processes of retirement and promotion will bring to the centre the people who have been robbed of all initiative while posted at the circumference. The second is that the capital city is now appallingly vulnerable to internal sedition or external assault. When all roads lead to Rome, all cables to London, the usual channels to Paris, the whole administrative machinery can be knocked out by a single rocket attack there are no centres of authority outside the target area, no alternative capital city to which a government might move. With the capital city gone, there is nothing left.
</blockquote><p>
Parkinson goes on to describe the second stage in the decline and fall of great states: the growth of taxation. But that is just another vast subject on which, conceivably, I may address you another time, ladies and gentlemen. Let me proceed, just now to my peroration. The worst thing about excessive concentration of power, I believe, is that in the long run such Behemoth centralization fails; and then the whole social structure falls apart, as is occurring in the Soviet empire at this moment.
<p>
Reasons exist why a supplanting of the old constitutional order, if completed, would present most serious dangers to American order and justice and freedom. I will mention only four of these perils.
<p>
<b>Too Much Work.</b> The first is the problem of efficiency. The general government is designed to carry out certain responsibilities, fairly well defined: most notably, the conduct of foreign relations, the defense of the country, and the management of undertakings too widespread for any one state in the Union to manage. But already the government here in Washington is dismayingly oppressed by too much work and too many servants. By endeavoring to do everything, the Washington government might end in doing nothing successfully.
<p>
The second problem is of scale. Measures which the provincial governors at Graz or Innsbruck would refuse to entrust to Vienna are proposed in America as if the governing of two hundred and fifty million people were little more difficult than the conduct of a town meeting-and quite as democratic-as long as President and Congress are still elected. I have heard American advocates of social-welfare measures, for instance, seriously advance the example of social-democratic legislation in Denmark as a precedent for American policy -though some American counties, not to mention states, are larger than Denmark, and other counties have more people than there are Danes.
<p>
Appeals against imprudent or unjust administration become immensely difficult when they are only the faint voices of individuals or local groups opposed to the prestige and influence of administrators at the capital; indeed, the chief administrators themselves cannot possibly look deeply into such complaints. Detailed administration on such a scale would require from civil servants a wisdom and a goodness never experienced in human history. "Well, appeal to your Congressman," centralizers say, perhaps ingenuously. But Congressmen already do not have time enough to answer the mail from their more important constituents, let alone act as so many Don Quixotes of the mass state.
<p>
<b>Habit of Command.</b> The third difficulty I raise here is the problem of leadership. Centralized political power functions smoothly only in nations accustomed to defer to the measures and opinions of a governing class-that is, in aristocratic or autocratic lands. Soviet centralization would have failed altogether, and almost at once, had it not been for the long-established powers of the Old Regime at Moscow and St. Petersburg. And such a body of decision makers, of governors, of aristocrats, must possess a high degree of self-confidence and the habit of command. They must be accustomed to dealing with deferential populations.
<p>
But these United States, accustomed to territorial democracy, have no class of leaders and administrators competent to undertake the consolidated direction which the centralizers propose. I do not discern a class of men here competent to rule wisely this immense nation, once territorial democracy and the federal framework-both principal schools of national leadership-should be undone.
<p>
Fourth, even had we a class of Winchester old-school-tie administrators, I do not know how we could expect the most expert of statists to direct paternally and justly the concerns of this nation, once local volition and private self-reliance had been seriously weakened. A man has but twenty-four hours in his day, and can read only a limited number of papers. Such centralization defeats its own object, in persons as in departments. The man-killing job of the presidency-to which centralizers will add numerous fresh responsibilities-may be sufficient illustration of my meaning.
<p>
<b>Unmanageable People.</b> To destroy, or let atrophy, territorial democracy and the federal system in America is quite possible; but it is less easy to provide some alternative satisfactory scheme of politics. Once the principle of volition, with the sense of participation and local decision, vanishes from American life, Americans are liable to become an unmanageable people. On a grander and more catastrophic scale, we might see again the resistance to authority and resort to violence which were provoked by the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act. Both the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act were "democratically" adopted; but somehow national positive democracy is not the same thing as territorial prescriptive democracy. Indeed, already we see great American cities in anarchy from time to time-the anarchists those people, black or white, who feel they have been excluded from full participation in society. What would occur when the majority should fell excluded from decision making?
<p>
Within a few years, if not immediately, any "guided democracy" or "plebiscitary democracy" would meet with evasion and hostility everywhere, and among the results of this could come a diminishing of the really effectual and popular authority of the general government. The energies and loyalties of volition would have been supplanted by the compulsions of a latter-day Jacobism, or of the Directory. And a great big Federal Bureau of Investigation would not be able to enforce the decrees of such a regime; for though a new broom sweeps clean, and an elite federal detective force aiding the local police is one thing, a permanent national secret police would be quite another-and possibly disagreeable to some of the "liberal" advocates of centralization. For that matter, a garrison of federal troops in every city might not suffice to keep order.
<p>
Yet life still rises in the tree of American federalism, and territorial democracy's powers of resistance and reaction ought not to be disregarded. It is true, as deTocqueville remarked, that men in power generally feel impelled to augment central power, while the opponents of centralization are either stupid or powerless. Notwithstanding this, attachment to the doctrines of division of authority and of state and local powers remains so popular in the United States that an intelligent plan for preserving the old system would obtain a hearing, and stand some chance of enactment.
<p>
<b>Buttressing the Structure.</b> An enormous, unitary omnicompetent nation-state cannot abide the American political tradition of cake and custom. If the federal system is obsolete, then we ought to prepare to train the leaders of a new order, and to define the character of that domination, novel to us. If territorial democracy deserves to live, if the federal system has virtue still, then the constitutional structure ought to be buttressed and helped to function. At present, most of the Americans qualified to think about such matters decline to take either of these courses. They are willing to let the norms of politics shift for themselves -which is not according to nature.
<p>
Such is another huge prospect for conservatives. Let us hope that the rising generation of conservatives may have the courage and the imagination required to avert the triumph of the centralizers; for that triumph would be followed swiftly enough by the decay of the American Republic.

<P>
Let me commence with two aphorisms, widely separated in time and substance.
<P>
The first is the observation of Aristotle that it is unjust to treat unequal things equally.
<P>
The second is the declaration of Marx that to establish equality, first we must establish inequality.
<P>
These two assumptions have been at war one with the other during the twentieth century.
<P>
What did Aristotle mean by writing that to treat unequal things equally is unjust? He meant that not all human beings are worthy of the same deserts, that not all actions are equally honorable and commendable, that not all works are of equally enduring value; so to confer equal rewards upon excellence and mediocrity would be profoundly unjust to the more deserving of praise. "To each his own."
<p>
What did Marx mean by asserting that inequality must be established before equality might be attained? He meant that the mighty must be pulled down from their seats, the alleged exploiters expropriated, whole classes destroyed-presumably by a general blood-letting-before the earthly paradise of communism might be realized. The bourgeois and all other opponents of socialist progress must be thoroughly discriminated against by the revolutionary proletariat. The bourgeois should be indulged no equality with the son of toil.
<p>
The Marxist regime in the Soviet Union fell at last after seven decades of terror and suffering; but the notion that "social justice" means equality of condition still works among us. In the connection, I commend you to three books: F. A. Hayek's <i>The Mirage of Social Justice;</i> Helmut Schoeck's <i>Envy: A Theory of Social Behavior;</i> and Gonzalo Fernandex de la Mora's <i>Egalitarian Envy: The Political Foundations of Social Justice.</i> The second book is by a German, the third by a Spaniard; it is a sign of the surviving domination of socialist assumptions about justice in America that these latter books scarcely were reviewed at all in the United States, though editions of both were published here. They deny the notion that there can exist a perfect social justice, attainable by positive law and social engineering; and their authors are agreed that the perfectly egalitarian society would be an unjust society. Let me suggest, also, that those present today would find a keen analysis of socialist errors about justice in a book of yesteryear of which I brought out a new edition some three years ago: W. H. Mallock's <i>A Critical Examination of Socialism.</i>
<p>
"All the four authors I mentioned a moment ago touch upon the vice of envy and its ruinous personal and social consequences. To that vice the Marxists appealed successfully in much of the world. "Why shouldst thou sit, and I stand?" cries incarnate Envy, in Marlowe' s play <i>Dr. Faustus.</i> "Come away!" Social justice will be attained, the poor are told, when they have unseated the affluent and supplanted them in their possessions. Such doctrines have devastated most of Asia and Africa ever since the Second World War, causing the massacre of the old leading classes, most hideously in the Congo-now Zaire-Portugese Timor, Portuguese Guinea, Chad, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and China. Yet the earthly paradise of social justice did not result from this slaughter: instead, squalid oligarchs and men of blood succeeded to power, and general impoverishment has been experienced. Perhaps we see today the beginning of such a progress toward social justice in the Republic of South Africa. Such is the justice of "the good old rule, the good old plan, that they shall take who have the power, and they shall keep who can."
<p>
Until recent decades, nevertheless, socially ruinous envy of this sort was not really powerful in the United States, and did not provoke a powerful political movement for such a restructuring of the economy as would even the scores. During several years of the Great Depression, my parents and my little sister and I lived in an old dwelling near the railway yards at Plymouth, Michigan, my father being a railroad engineman. Our house had no bathroom; its <i>necessarium</i> was an outdoor privy, inconvenient under snow. (We had thought we were buying the house on land contract, but it turned out that the man who pretended to sell the dwelling to us had no proper title to it himself, and so my parents lost their investment and went back to renting; they never did succeed in owning any house, lifelong.) Weekly there arrived in our house the newspaper of the Railway Brotherhoods, entitled <i>Labor.</i> In almost every issue there appeared a cartoon of a literally bloated Capitalist, in evening dress, smoking a bloated cigar; and such exploiters of the working poor were denounced in editorials.
<p>
But these circumstances and publications did not wake envy in my parents. They took it for granted that some people, whether by talent or by inheritance or by mere chance, prosper materially in life, while other people do not; this, they knew, was in the nature of things. They had a subsistence, and kinfolk, and love. The caricatures of the Bloated Capitalist did not rouse my father's wrath; my father did indeed think that the railroads were ill-managed, and that increasing centralization of the economy was to be regretted, and that pride would have a fall on Wall Street, as indeed came to pass; but I never heard my parents utter a word of envy. Things will be as they will be, they took it.
<p>
Blessed are those children reared in a household innocent of the deadly sin of envy. Their lives will not be tormented by a grinding resentment that they are not beautiful, or famous, or favored with the gifts of fortune. They will not demand as a natural right or an entitlement a presumptuous personal equality with everybody under the sun; nor maintain that their opinions are as good as anybody else' s. They will not covet a neighbor's goods. And thus they may come to know peace of soul. They will perceive the wisdom in these lines of a very early poem in Scots vernacular:
<p><i><blockquote>
I saw this written on a wall: <br>In what estate, man, that thou fall <br>Accept thy lot, and thank thy God of all.
</blockquote></i><p>
But I do not mean to imply that every form of equality is the work of envy. The Christian doctrine of equality has worked much moral good. This is the teaching that all souls are equal in the ultimate judgment of God; that God is no respecter of persons. Yet God separates the goats from the sheep; in my Father's house are many mansions, but they are not all on the same floor. God's ultimate judgment is not affected by rank and station, wealth or power, here below. All that matters, in the end, is goodness of heart; so sometimes the last, at the judgment seat, shall be first.
<p>
And the jurisprudential principle of equal justice under law, too, has worked much social good. The law also is no respecter of persons: the king himself is under the law, as Bracton put it in medieval times. Neither in civil nor in criminal cases, declares the system of law which Americans have inherited from Britain, does any class of persons enjoy privileges or immunities. This doctrine keeps the peace; and to keep the peace is the object of all law.
<p>
Whether political equality has worked much good is another matter. In most of the world, attempts at enduring and peaceful democracy have failed. Constitutional democracy of the successful sort has been confined chiefly to English-speaking countries, which have inherited the British historical experience. And even in such countries, who can doubt that democracy, political equality, is in grave trouble nowadays? Is not the United States being converted into a "plebiscitary democracy," with an election of the temporary dictator every four years, actually governed by a centralized bureaucracy nominally under the supervision of a body of squabbling politicians. How much genuine democracy of the sort discerned in America by Tocqueville, what Brownson called "territorial democracy," will remain by the middle of the twenty-first century?-Even today, indeed, how much political equality remains in elections determined chiefly by what candidates have the most money to spend on television broadcasts?
<p>
But political equality is too large and complex a subject for me to discuss today. I turn, therefore to the subject of equality of condition-that is, equality of incomes and other material rewards, equality in education, equality of mores, manners, lodgings, and tastes. It is this envious passion for equality of condition against which Tocqueville warned his time and ours. The total triumph of the doctrine of equality of condition would be a triumph of injustice. Unthinking demands for an equality allegedly just notwithstanding, a society in which everybody should be precisely in the condition of everybody else would be a thoroughly unjust society.
<p>
Zealots throughout the centuries have endeavored to establish communities totally egalitarian; all those endeavors have failed after much suffering. Utopians in the Greek and Roman eras, the Levellers and Diggers of England in the seventeenth century, Babeuf and his fellow conspirators of 1791, and the communist ideologues who held power in the Russian system for seven decades-these are only some of the enthusiasts for equality who for a time established a domination of equality in misery, collapsing soon or late because contrary to human nature. Yet, as Hegel wrote, we learn from history that we learn nothing from history. What failed disastrously in the late Soviet Union, a good many Americans now seek to enact in these United States.
<p>
The instrument of the doctrinaire egalitarian in America is not violent revolution, but employment of taxation-which, as John Marshall declared in the Dartmouth College case, is the power to destroy. A leveller pulls down the more prosperous classes in society through crushing taxation, levied to pay for "entitlements" for an abstraction called The Poor-in effect, to maintain a growing proletariat that contribute nothing much to society except their offspring. Rostovtzeff and other writers on Roman times have drawn the analogy between bread and circuses and the modern dole or "welfare" measures: in the Empire, the emperor with his soldiery united with the Roman mob to extort revenue from the propertied classes-until at last the ancient economy collapsed, and the frontiers could not be defended. Clinton Caesar, eager to placate the Welfare Lobby, proposes to establish new overwhelming "entitlements," particularly medical ones, to be paid for by employers-for of course the wealth of employers is assumed to be inexhaustible. As in the age of Diocletian men fled from public offices, lest they be taxed and regulated to extinction, so by the approaching end of this century employers may be inclined to flee to some other condition of life-but to what?
<p>
The mentality of the American leveller nowadays may be sufficiently suggested by a proposal advanced by some of Clinton's inner circle but not presented to the Congress. This was a new tax: a levy upon persons dwelling in large houses. If the residence should contain rooms which might have been rented, had the owner desired, to paying lodgers (or perhaps non-paying homeless persons)-why, the owner of the dwelling would be taxed for the rooms that might have been occupied by other people. This tax would have been a federal levy, not a local real-property assessment. It is just the sort of tax to have been devised by some former hippie, now a bureaucrat, spiritually akin to President Clinton, former hippie himself. The real purpose of this strange proposal clearly was punitive, meant to punish those wicked rich who possessed spare bedrooms. Make them pay through the nose for such undemocratic private possession of domestic amenities! An Englishman's home once upon a time may have been his castle; but now an American' s home should be his own only upon the sufferance of the Washington bureaucracy. If such a one should lodge homeless persons in his dining room, say, he might be indulged in a partial remission of taxes. One is reminded of housing in Moscow about the year 1919, when the communist regime requisitioned even the lavatories of private residences as night lodging for the underprivileged. Envious egalitarianism as implemented by Clintonian zealots might not be satisfied until the whole population of this land should be lodged in immobilized "mobile homes"-a universal rookery of trailer camps. Why should anybody be indulged in domestic comforts not readily available to all citizens?
<p>
Have I carried to absurdity my argument against equality of condition? Nay, not so; for the enthusiasts for total equality are not to be satisfied with small concessions. I commend to you a dystopia, -a longish short story, by Jacquetta Hawkes, that brilliant Englishwoman of diverse talents, published in her collection <i>Fables</i>-which volume appeared in 1952, during Britain's disagreeable experience with a socialist regime.
<p>
This fable is entitled "The Unites." God, having sensed no impulses from the planet Earth for a long while, dispatches a humble angel to investigate and report to Him. This emissary, who had visited Earth once long, long before, discovers on this later expedition that humankind has suffered a startling change for the worse. No longer, indeed, do men and women call themselves humans: they style themselves "Unites," for all are united in a kind of sub-human state, everybody precisely like everybody else. These degenerate beings live in some 500,000 Life Units dispersed about the globe, and subsist by primitive agriculture. Private property has been abolished altogether. Every Life Unit consists of four standard tenements: the Pink Block for the young, the Green Block for the cultivators, the Red Block for the industrial workers, the Black Block for the administrators and the governments. Kinship and family life have been swept away, as disruptive of social unity. If equality is the whole aim of existence, why should one person outlive another? There must be equality in death as in life. So on attaining the age of sixty-six, the older Unites are herded into the Finis Chamber of the Black Block, suffocated there, and their bodies incinerated. The only amusement in these Life Unit communes is a colossal sort of motor-drome in which some of the performers bloodily perish, to the crowd's satisfaction.
<p>
In short, through the doctrine of equality of condition what once was the human race has transformed itself into a moral condition scarcely distinguishable from that of the beasts which perish. And yet a few true human beings, eager to subvert this life-in-death, have survived somehow in Life Unit 1457. The visiting angel learns that this handful of young people are contriving to bring down the dreary system of equality. Indeed their slogan "Equality must be destroyed" prevails; the stupidity of the egalitarian administrators cannot resist the innovators; and in one Life Unit, at least, inequality is happily triumphant. But even so, the angel detects some ideologue of equality plotting already to bring back equal misery; thus the struggle between the forces of individual achievement and the forces of equality runs on in human societies. There are no lost causes because there are no gained causes.
<p>
Jacquetta Hawkes's fable or parable is set in a distant future; but in the closing decade of this century we move in that egalitarian direction. Equality is demanded in politics and in monetary incomes; more, it is demanded in formal education. My wife, Annette, ten years ago was a member of the Commission on Excellence in Education appointed by President Reagan. She promptly found that many folks in the federal Department of Education, and many educationists in teachers' colleges and teachers' unions, were concerned chiefly for what they called "equity"-that is, equality, sameness, at every level of schooling. Some insisted that American education must have both excellence and equity, a manifest absurdity: for the word "excellence" means to exceed, of course, to do better than others; while "equity," or uniformity, necessarily implies mediocrity. The more equality in schooling, the lower the achievement; and the greater the injustice toward students possessed of some talents. Forty years ago, I resigned a university post in disgust at a deliberate policy of lowering standards in the interest of "equity"-that is accommodating more students who, from stupidity or indolence, ought not to have been admitted to a university at all. In general, American standards for an education allegedly "higher" have declined still more since I departed from the Ivory Tower.
<p>
Egalitarian pressures are exerted in virtually every country to push into the universities most of the rising generation, however dull, bored, or feckless a young person may be. The consequence of this movement is to make the higher learning lower. Avoiding the dullness of most graduate studies in the United States, in 1948 I went abroad for my higher learning-to St. Andrews University, still -somewhat medieval in appearance, the oldest of Scottish universities, situated in a charming medieval town. Nowadays St. Andrews is under political pressure to change its character by admitting many more students, which would destroy the tradition of learning there by the North Sea. For what reason? Why, to "give everybody his chance." Perhaps we ought to confer the doctorate upon every infant at birth, and reserve the universities for people really interested in right reason and imagination, so eliminating degree-snobbery and degree-envy. The present disorders of the intellect on most campuses result from the combination of ideologue egalitarians among the professors with ignorant -and bored students.
<p>
Permit me to suggest some probable long-run consequences of national infatuation with equality of condition.
<p>
First, great injury to the leading class that every society requires for its success. This leading class is not identical with sociological "elites"; to ascertain the distinction, read T. S. Eliot's slim book <i>Notes Towards the Definition of Culture.</i> This leading class, even in the American democracy, is made up of public-spirited men and women of property; well-educated professional folk, lawyers among them; honest politicians who take long views; publishers and writers who help to shape public opinion on a diversity of matters; the clergy; persons experienced in military affairs, foreign affairs, and the arts of political administration; local leaders in charitable and civic concerns; those people of industry and commerce who know that there is more to life than getting and spending. I am even willing to acknowledge among this leading class some of the better professors of arts and sciences-although Nietzsche reminds us that in politics the professor always plays the comic role.
<p>
The authority of this class of persons in America has been declining in recent decades, from a variety of causes; and the decay in public and private morality, the decadence of education, the shallow populist tone of our politics, and a number of other afflictions result in considerable part from that decline of authority. Now a renewed demand for levelling assails this leading class. For one thing, it was possible for members of this leading class to take part in public and charitable concerns, and to set the whole tone of life in their communities, because most of them possessed some private means; they were not daily money-grubbing. Increasingly this class is being pushed to the wall by heavy-nay, savage-taxation. Most people here will have noticed how in the past few years various deductions and exemptions have been eliminated from income-tax returns, particularly for persons with incomes exceeding $100,000; for such folk, medical deductions from income are a thing of the past. Now the Clinton Administration imposes new burdens, falling principally upon the class I have just been describing. Many will pay more than half their incomes in taxes- federal and state income taxes, real-property taxes, sales taxes, and the rest. What margin will remain for such people to exercise the functions of voluntary leadership?
<p>
The late Michael Harrington, a few years past, was addressing a crowd of poor people. He said that too many affluent people were paying less than half their incomes in income tax. He was surprised by the reaction of his audience. They were indignant at Harrington's proposal that the state should take more than half a man's income, however large that income. "That's just not fair." some of them cried. His audience was right and Harrington wrong. And perhaps some in his audience perceived, better than did Harrington, what would happen to a society-including persons of very modest incomes-in which the Leviathan state should kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
<p>
Already many of you here today, and for that matter your servant, are paying more than half their incomes in taxation. Our time occupied in trying to make ends meet, how much leadership shall we be able to offer? More and more, in such circumstances, the remnant of authority and the power of decision-making are usurped by a centralized bureaucracy-and in the name of "democracy."
<p>
Second, an obsession with equality commonly results in general impoverishment, by diminishing saving and capital accumulation, and by "humanitarian" welfare measures that diminish the incentive to work for one's own subsistence. Egalitarian "entitlements" already have so increased the national debt that, as matters are drifting, the amount of interest on the national debt, annually, will come to exceed the total federal revenues collected by the present tax structure!
<p>
Decreased economic productivity, caused by a virtual oppression of industry and commerce, will afflict the poor worst of all-even though the mistaken policies of government were undertaken in the name of equality of condition for the alleged poor.
<p>
A third consequence of deliberate levelling in society would be grave intellectual damage, already in progress. Over the centuries there was developed in all civilized countries an elaborate edifice of schooling, originally religious in character, meant to impart some measure of wisdom and virtue to the rising generation. Aristotle instructs us that the process of learning cannot be made easy. The higher learning is concerned necessarily with abstractions, in large part; but the common man tends to dislike abstractions. As T. S. Eliot said once, there ought to be many different kinds of education for many different kinds of people; but the egalitarian zealot would enforce uniformity of schooling, perhaps of the "outcomes education" sort to produce conditioned responses, now being pushed in Virginia, Michigan, and other states.
<p>
The black-militant outcry against the study of the works of "dead white males" suggests what a thoroughly egalitarian system of schooling would discard. Thought always is painful; so let us get on with the rap sessions.
<p>
Those intellectual disciplines that nurture right reason and moral imagination, requiring real thought, are unpopular with the egalitarian, who regards them as archaic and snobbish. The egalitarian much prefers utilitarian schooling and vague "social studies." But both private wisdom and public order require that a substantial number of people be well acquainted with genuine works of the mind. The natural sciences, humane studies, and the philosophical habit of mind neglected, the person and the republic sink into ignorance and apathy; but the egalitarian zealot does not perceive these ruinous consequences until the decline no longer can be arrested. The condition of most of our public schools today, and the inferior performance of most colleges and universities by contrast with their work half a century ago, ought to suggest to us how far, as a people, we already have slipped down the slope toward intellectual failure. What I say of American education is quite as true of British education nowadays, and, with few exceptions of Europe generally. But the educational egalitarian is not deterred-not quite yet: so long as "everybody has equal opportunity" to spend four or five years in an educational establishment professedly higher, social justice has been achieved, he fancies.
<p>
In short, ladies and gentlemen, I have been arguing that it is profoundly unjust to endeavor to transform society into a tableland of equality. It would be unjust to the energetic, reduced to equality with the slack and indolent; it would be unjust to the imaginative, compelled to share the schooling and the tastes of the dull; it would be unjust to the thrifty, compelled to make up for the losses of the profligate; it would be unjust to those who take long views, forced to submit to the domination of a majority interested chiefly in short-run results.
<p>
But I shall not labor this point, already made forcefully by Alexis de Tocqueville and other writers whose talents exceed my. own. The egalitarian society, far from satisfying desires for "social justice," would be unjust to the very people who made possible a tolerably orderly and prosperous society. Eric Voegelin remarks that the tolerably just society is one in which the more aspiring natures are free to exercise their talents, but the large majority of people, who desire merely a quiet life,-are secured against oppression by the aspiring natures. Mediocre necessarily, the egalitarian society would discourage or suppress enterprising talents-which would result in social stagnation. Life in a social tableland of equality would be infinitely boring.
<p>
Yet don't I believe in equality of <i>opportunity?</i> No, friends, I do not. The thing is not possible. First of all, genetic differences cannot be surmounted between individual and individual; Thomas Jefferson and the whole school of "created free and equal" knew nothing whatsoever of human genetics, a science of the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Second, opportunity depends greatly upon family background and nurturing; and unless it is proposed to sweep away the family altogether, as in Jacquetta Hawkes's fable, the rising generation of one stock will differ greatly in opportunity from the rising generation of a different family. For instance, I read every evening to my four little daughters, or told them stories; while my neighbors did not so instruct and converse with their children; accordingly, my children have enjoyed superior opportunities in life. It would be outrageously unjust to try somehow to wipe out these advantages of genetic inheritance or familial instruction.
<p>
Inequality is the natural condition of human beings; charity may assist those not favored by nature; but attempts to impose an artificial equality of condition and intellect, although in the long run they fail, meanwhile can work great mischief in any society, and-still worse-damage human nature itself.

Leviathan is a Hebrew word signifying "that which gathers itself in folds." In the Old Testament, Leviathan is the great sea-beast: "Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?" In the 17th century, Thomas Hobbes-whom T.S. Eliot calls "that presumptuous little upstart"- made Leviathan the symbol of the state, or rather of mass-society, composed of innumerable little atomic individual human beings.
<p>
Today I am concerned not with Hobbes, but with Donald Davidson and his book <i>The Attack on Leviathan</i>. In 1938, long before the administration of Lyndon Johnson popularized the slogan "The Great Society," Davidson wrote that his Leviathan is "the idea of the Great Society, organized under a single, complex, but strong and highly centralized national government, motivated ultimately by men's desire for economic welfare of a specific kind rather than their desire for personal liberty." Four decades later, Leviathan looms larger than ever.
<p>
The southern states that once formed the Confederacy have been the most conservative region of America, it is generally agreed. Once upon a time, Richard Weaver told me that Middle Tennessee is the most southern part of the South. There in Middle Tennessee, near the town of Pulaski, in 1893, Donald Davidson was born. Surely Davidson was the most redoubtably conservative of those able American men of letters who have been called the Southern Agrarians. As poet, as critic, as historian, and as political thinker, Davidson was a stalwart defender of America's permanent things during an era of radical change.
<p>
<b>Scourging the Centralizers.</b> I propose to discuss with you Donald Davidson as the latter-day champion of the South's political and social inheritance. Ever since the forming of the Union in 1787, the dominant political tendency in the southern states has been resistance to the centralizing of power. Far more than any other region, the South has set its face against Leviathan-that is, against the swelling omnipotent nation-state, what Tocqueville called "democratic despotism," the political collectivity that reduces men and women to social atoms. In his strong book <i>The Attack on Leviathan</i>, published in 1938, Davidson scourged the centralizers- and that at a time when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was doing much as he liked with the United States of America.
<p>
Permit me first to say something about Davidson and his writings; and then to discuss the social principles for which the Southern Agrarians and their allies stood.
<p>
Browsing in the library at Michigan State College, in 1938, an earnest sophomore, I happened upon a new book, published by the University of North Carolina Press, entitled <i>The Attack on Leviathan,</I> subtitled <i>Regionalism and Nationalism in the United States.</i> It was written eloquently, and for me it made coherent the misgivings I had felt concerning the political notions popular in the 1930s. The book was so good that I assumed all intelligent
<p>
Americans, or almost all, were reading it. Actually, as I learned years later, the University of North Carolina Press pulped the book's sheets after only a few hundred copies had been sold: clearly an act of discrimination against conservative views. I had a hand in the reprinting of the book by another firm in 1963; and now I aspire to bring out a third printing in the Library of Conservative Thought, which I edit for Transaction Books.
<p>
Opinion Shapers. Professor Davidson rowed against the tide of opinion among America's intellectuals in 1938. Centralizing nationalism, he argued, is of necessity tyrannical and enslaving. For a specimen of his method and style, take this passage from his chapter on American literature. He has been criticizing Emerson, and he finds that the opinion shapers of New York and Boston during the 1930s are Emerson's heirs:
<p><blockquote>
In our own time, the metropolitan critics are making national prescriptions that are equally partial, though somewhat more confused. In one sentence they assure us that the industrial unification of America is desirable and inevitable; but in the next sentence they declare that the civilization thus produced puts upon us an intolerable spiritual bondage from which the artist cannot escape save through the shibboleths of Marxism and Freudianism. Wearily, they proclaim that America is standardized; but angrily they scorn the rural backwardness of regions that prove to be, after all, less urban than New York. Confidently they announce that America must be industrialized; but they sneer at Mr. Babbitt of the Middle West, the creature of industrialism. They urge the provinces to adopt the intellectual sophistication of the Eastern metropolis; but among themselves they bewail the poverty of the modern temper, which in its sophistication has left them nothing to enjoy.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Now could one write, in this year of 1989, a better description of the mentality of such American intellectuals? One might substitute, of course, the phrase "the industrial unification of the world" for that of America; for nowadays the whole of the world must be subjected to those environmental mischiefs and social discontents that already have worked immense harm in the "developed countries."
<p>
<b>Sword of Imagination.</b> Davidson was bold enough to defend the agricultural economy against industrial aggrandizement. (Parenthetically, it seems worth remarking that in recent years the dollar volume of agricultural produce in the industrial state of Michigan has exceeded the dollar volume of manufactured products.) Bolder still, he took up the cause of his own region, the South, against the nationalizers of New York and Washington. He appreciated, too, other American regions: New England, the Great Plains, the Lake States, the Pacific coast. But it was the South which required the service of Davidson's sword of imagination.
<p>
"Can principles enunciated as Southern principles, of whatever cast, get a hearing?" he inquired in <i>The Attack on Leviathan.</I>
<p><blockquote>
...It seems to be a rule that the more special the program and the more remote it is from Southern principles, the greater the likelihood of its being discussed and promulgated. Southerners who wish to engage in public discussion in terms that do not happen to be of common report in the New York newspapers are likely to be met, at the levels where one would least expect it, with the tactics of distortion, abuse, polite tut-tutting, angry discrimination and so on down to the baser devices of journalistic lynching which compose the modern propagandist's stock in trade. This is an easy and comparatively certain means of discrediting an opponent and of thus denying him a hearing. It is also a fatal means. For if such approaches to public questions are encouraged and condoned, then confusion has done its work well, the days of free and open discussion of ideas is over in the South, only matters of crass expediency can come into the public forum at all, and we face the miserable prospect of becoming the most inert and passive section of the United States, or else of falling into blind and violent divisions whose pent-up forces will hurl us at each other's throats. Then will Jefferson's prophetic vision come true. We shall take to eating one another, as they do in Europe.
</blockquote>
<p>
Such matters have not much improved since Davidson wrote those sentences, half a century past: the South continues to be treated by Congress as if it were a subject province (in voter registration especially), and the New York newspapers remain ungenerous.
<p>
<b>Urban Symbol.</b> New York City was to Donald Davidson the abomination of desolation. He and his wife spent their summers at Middlebury College in Vermont; and Davidson took extraordinary pains to avoid passing through New York City en route. For that matter, he detested sprawling modern cities generally, Nashville included, though he found it necessary to reside most of his life in the neighborhood of Vanderbilt University. To his volume of poems <i>The Tall Men</i> (published in 1927) Davidson had a prologue, She Long Street," the antithesis of the rural Tennessee of yesteryear, that land of heroes. That Long Street-I think of devastated Woodward Avenue in Detroit- is the symbol of a dehumanized urban industrial culture:
<p><blockquote>

The grass cannot remember; trees cannot <br>
Remember what once was here. But even so, <br>
They too are here no longer. Where is the grass? <br>
Only the blind stone roots of the dull street <br>
And the steel thews of houses flourish here <br>
And the baked curve of asphalt, smooth, trodden <br>
Covers dead earth that once was quick with grass, <br>
Snuffing the ground with acrid breath the motors <br>
Fret the long street. Steel answers steel. Dust whirls. <br>
Skulls hurry past with the pale flesh yet clinging <br>
And a little hair. <br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Thirty-five years later, Davidson published another volume of verse, to which he transferred the title <i>The Long Street.</i> In his poem "Old Sailor's Choice" he describes Ulysses's voyage to hell and beyond. Contrary to the counsels of a modern Circe, Ulysses chooses Charybdis over Scylla, though modern men lust for Scylla's deadly embrace, "the monstrous lips, the darting neck of their love-death." Davidson describes the ensnaring monster Scylla, a very modern horror:
<p><blockquote>
Within her cliffs of sheer synthetic rock<br>
She glides on steely pathways. Plastic walls<br>
Checkered in pseudo-marble cavern her lair.<br>
These throw you off guard. "How," you ask,<br>
 Can anything go wrong where all is right- <br>
Rectangular, side-ruled, and functional? <br>
Mercy, pity, peace can be manufactured. <br>
Scylla can end your pain <br>
Now that the State decrees a tax increase <br>
And no one can complain. <br>
The neat-cut stencil echoes the brisk type. <br>
Machines do the rest. The postage is metered. <br>
And there is your release: <br>
Well-packaged, mercy, pity, peace. <br>
And I saw the stretching neck and the grinning teeth <br>
In the soundproof room where artificial daylight <br>
Blacks out the scudding clouds and the churning storm-wrack <br>
And the secretary with half-naked breasts <br>
Extends the telephone on a crimson claw <br>
And murmurs Washington is calling! <br>
</blockquote>
<p>
Washington did not call Donald Davidson, who was a guardian of the permanent things, which perish on the pavements of the Long Street. The Scylla of "Old Sailor's Choice" is the enormous welfare state, which devours the spirit.
<p>
Poetic Works of Politics. We return to Davidson's prose. Politics, I never tire of repeating, is the art of the possible-and the preoccupation of the quarter-educated. That is, politics ranks low in order of precedence of the works of the mind, if one refers simply to defecated political theory and practice, cut off from revelation and right reason and imagination. But Professor Davidson never divorced politics from religion or imaginative literature or tradition. He knew that the greatest works of politics are poetic. In his later collection of essays entitled <i>Still Rebels, Still Yankees</i> (1957), he writes about the dissociation of the poet from society, now
<p><blockquote>

...painfully apparent as society has accepted the dominance of science and consequently has become indisposed to accept poetry as truth.... In this phase of operations the poet may well become an outright traditionalist in religion, politics, and economics. He examines the defects of modern civilization. He develops a sense of catastrophe. With an insight far more accurate than the forecasts of professional social philosophers, he begins to plot the lines of stress and strain along which disaster will erupt. He predicts the ruin of modern secularized society and makes offers of salvation. These are unheard of or unheeded. Then upon the deaf ears and faceless bodies of modern society he invokes the poet's curse.
</blockquote>
<p>
Eliot's poetic curse was that famous fatal dismissal, "This is the way the world ends/ Not with a bang but a whimper." Davidson, fiercely though he reproached a sensate age, was not quite ready to pronounce a curse upon his time . Tradition still might reassert its old power. Take this passage from his essay "Futurism and Archaism in Toynbee and Hardy" contained in <i>Still Rebels, Still Yankees:</i>
<p><blockquote>

'You cannot turn the clock back!' is the commonest taunt of our day. It always emerges as the clinching argument that any modernist offers any traditionalist when the question is: 'What shall we do now?' But it
 is not really an argument. It is a taunt intended to discredit the traditionalist by stigmatizing him a traitor to an idea of progress that is assumed as utterly valid and generally accepted. The aim is, furthermore, to poison the traditionalist's own mind and disturb his self-confidence by the insinuation that he is a laggard in the world's great procession. His faith in an established good is made to seem nostalgic devotion to a mere phantom of the buried past. His opposition to the new-no matter how ill-advised, inartistic, destructive, or immoral that new may be-is defined as a quixotic defiance of the Inevitable. To use a term invented by Arnold J. Toynbee, he is an Archaist. By definition, he is therefore doomed.
</blockquote>
<p>
To abide by Tradition is not to fall into Archaism, Davidson told the rising generation. As for turning back the clock-why, as Davidson puts it, "Neither can you turn the clock forward, for Time is beyond human control." When a Futurist uses this clock metaphor, we perceive an unconscious revelation of his weakness. He wishes to imply that his design, and his only, is perfectly in step with some scientific master cloak of cause and effect that deter nines the progress of human events. This implication has no basis in reality, since the Futurist actually means to break off all connection with the historical process of cause and effect and to substitute for it an imagined, ideal process of quasi-scientific future development which is nothing more than a sociological version of Darwinism.
<p>
<b>Gifted and Versatile.</b> Such was the conservative mind of Donald Davidson. If I have made him seem somewhat abstract-why, that has been my blunder. He was remarkably versatile: a collector of folk ballads, a gifted lecturer, a writer of librettos, an historian, even from time to time active in the troubled politics of Tennessee. He was all too well aware of the huge blunders in public policy during the 20th century. If one turns to the second volume of his history of the Tennessee River, one finds three chapters accurately exposing the failures of that enormous undertaking, so ardently commended by the liberal press and most Tennessee politicians-yet so founded upon economic and social fallacies.
<p>
In person, Davidson was a lean and austere gentleman who smiled rarely; his conversation, nevertheless, was lively, and he was a kindly host. He had been a courageous soldier. To the end he lived with dignity, lamenting the destruction of dignity within universities. Once I walked with him on the campus at Vanderbilt; he told me of how most of the trees there had been felled not long before to make space for more automobiles. This was bad enough; but to make his indignation perfect, grim rows of parking meters had been installed. A militant survivor from what he called "the old regime," Davidson spoke contemptuously of his university's administrators. Students venerated him. He wrote to me on August 31,1954: "Living in Nashville and teaching at Vanderbilt University is very hard on a Southern Agrarian, I can assure you. It is, in fact, nothing but warfare, and we can't survive very long without some place to lick our wounds for a while." (He wrote this from Ripton, Vermont, where the Davidsons spent their summers at the Breadloaf School.)
<p>
<b>Neglected Agrarians. </b>Vanderbilt's administration disparaged the Agrarians and, in effect, would not accept Davidson's or AllenTate's papers as gifts. For that matter, the literate South generally neglected those Agrarians, the most illustrious of southern sons, in their own time. Only when New York paid attention to Tate, Warren, Ransom, Lytle, and others did the South prick up its ears. As that 17th-century "Person of No Quality" put it,
<p><blockquote>

Seven cities now contend for Homer dead,<br>
Through which the living Homer begged his bread.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
I fear I have given you, ladies and gentlemen, only a fragmentary summary of Donald Davidson's social thought. But now I pass to some remarks on the Southern Agrarians generally-one of them, Mr. Andrew Lytle, will spend some days at a seminar in my house, next month, so the breed is still quick-and to the pressing question of what to do about Leviathan.
<p>
Nearly sixty years ago, when I was a fourth-grader in the very northern town of Plymouth, Michigan, twelve southerners published a book entitled <i>I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition. </I> That slim volume, a heartfelt defense of the permanent things in the South's culture, has been discussed ever since; a literature of assent or of disapproval has developed about it. Young men and women who come to study with me in my northern fastness discover this literature-even without my having commented on any of it-and read-the books, night upon night, even to the witching hour of three.
<p>
Christian humanism, stern criticism of the industrial mass society, detestation of communism and other forms of collectivism, attachment to the ways of the Old South, in valor and in manners- these were the principles joining the twelve Southern Agrarians who took their stand in Dixieland in 1930. Their twelve essays were approved by T.S. Eliot and some other reflective people at the time the book was published; yet for the most part the Agrarians met with hostility and ridicule. Today their book sometimes meets with understanding, for we are farther down the track to Avernus.
<p>
<b>Reminder and Challenge.</b> As Louis Rubin says of the Twelve Southerners, <i>In Take My Stand</i> "is the rebuke to materialism, a corrective to the worship of Progress, and a reaffirmation of man's aesthetic and spiritual needs. And because the South has come so late into the industrial world, it appeals to the hungering memory within the Southerner's mind of the tranquil and leisurely Southern life that existed before the machines and superhighways came. As such the book constitutes both a reminder and a challenge. What are you losing that you once possessed? Are you sure that you want to discard it entirely?"
<p>
Despite the considerable attention paid nationally to these Agrarian writers, it was not easy for them to find publishers; or, if their writings should be published, to keep them in print. Yet they persisted; and in the long run their high talents as men of letters gave them for some years, about the period of my college days, ascendancy over the realm of letters, even in Manhattan-a mild domination that endured until recent years, when it was overthrown by the squalid oligarchs of the <i>New York Review of Books.</i> (Even here the South has made a successful counterattack, most conspicuously in the homage paid to Flannery O'Connor and Walker Percy.) As a group, the Agrarians illustrated well the remark made by Lionel Trilling in 1950 that the 20th century writers possessing imagination were not liberals-distinctly not.
<p>
<b>Demolished and Uglifiled.</b> The Twelve Southerners, Donald Davidson among them, knew that the South would change. As Stark Young put it in his essay "Not in Memoriam, But in Defense," which concluded their book "That a change is now in course all over the South is plain; and it is as plain that the South changing must be the South still, remembering that for no thing can there be any completeness that is outside its own nature, and no thing for which there is any advance save in its own kind. If this were not so, all nature by now would have dissolved in chaos and folly, nothing in it...."
<p>
Yet the South's pace of change has been more rapid, these six decades past, and more overwhelming, than even the gloomiest of the Twelve Southerners expected. Old Nashville, the domicile of the Fugitives and the Agrarians, has been thoroughly demolished and uglified, Strickland's capitol on its hill besieged by the haughty office towers of state and federal bureaucracies and of teachers' unions. Much else, in Nashville and nearly all the South, has gone by the board-among those losses, the disappearance of Southern architectural styles.
<p>
Along with the dwindling of a distinctive Dixie has come relative economic prosperity. It is factory-town prosperity. The rural pattern of existence, which the Agrarians praised, still endures here and there south of Mason's and Dixon's Line, but it has been brutally buffeted during the past sixty years.
<p>
Of the Twelve Southerners, two-Andrew Lytle and Robert Penn Warren-still are here in the land of the living. Modernity has been doing its worst to wipe out Southerners of their sort, in part by sweeping away-in the South and elsewhere-the sort of schooling that men like Davidson and Lytle and Warren profited by. And the welfare state has striven to efface, as impoverished and culturally deprived, the old rural pattern of the South-or, for that matter, of Northern rural counties like that I inhabit-which endured little altered until the building of the "good roads."
<p>
Tide what may betide, the Southern Agrarians will loom large in histories of American thought and -letters. With liberalism in America now nearly mindless, some of the rising generation in this land are finding in Donald Davidson's prose and verse, and in the writings of other Agrarians, an understanding of personal and social order far removed from desiccated liberal attitudes.
<p>
Six decades after Donald Davidson, Andrew Lytle, Lyle Lanier, Allen Tate, John Crowe Ransom, Frank Owsley, John Gould Fletcher, H.C. Nixon, Robert Penn Warren, John Donald Wade, Henry Blue Kline, and Stark Young took up arms against Leviathan, how goes the fight?
<p>
Like the Celts of the Twilight, it seems, the Agrarians have gone forth often to battle, but never to victory. America's farmers now total perhaps 5 percent of the national population. The South has been subjugated a second time by the federal government, and endures a second political Reconstruction-although this time the southern economy is far from ruined. Centralization of power in Washington was carried much farther by Lyndon Johnson than ever it had been by Franklin Roosevelt; states still nominally sovereign are reduced to a condition little better than that of provinces. The nationwide television broadcasters are rapidly effacing any remnants of regional cultures. The public educational establishment exhorts its teachers and its charges to sing "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" rather than "Dixie." In many other ways, Leviathan looms far vaster than the monster was in 1930.
<p>
<b>Swallowed by Leviathan.</b> And yet the predictions of the Twelve Southerners like those of Cassandra, are being fulfilled. Our great cities, a hundred Long Streets, are nearly ruined, ravaged by crime, their population corrupted or endangered by deadly narcotics, all community destroyed. Our boasted affluence is given the lie by the swift and sinister growth of a genuine proletariat, voracious and unruly, subsisting at public expense. Our layers of governmental bureaucracy are increasingly inefficient and vexatious. Our legislatures, national and state, seem willing to yield to every demand of a pressure group, regardless of the true public interest. Our judges, or many of them, have turned demagogues. Our air is polluted badly, our countryside uglified, public taste corrupted. Our children are brought up indulgently on images of terrible violence and gross sexuality. Schooling at every level is reduced to child care, adolescent sitting, and collegiate mating: humane letters and history are contemned. While we talk windily still of free enterprise, the industrial and commercial conglomerates move toward oligopoly on a tremendous scale. Religious belief and observance have been first reduced to the ethos of sociability, and then to ignorant discourses on revolution. Leviathan, the monstrous society, has swallowed his myriads. What hope for the person and the republic?
<p>
Certain sanguine neoconservatives inform us that America in this year of our Lord 1989 is virtually an earthly paradise of democratic capitalism. This sensate, materialistic, bored, trivial, and often perverse culture of ours today, the summit of human striving? What an absurd contention! But then, most neoconservatives are liberals thinly veiled. Leviathan does not need to pursue such people: they swim eagerly into his maw. The patronage empire of the great "charitable" foundations, by the way, is yet another manifestation of Leviathan.
<p>
<b>Salute to the Southerners.</b> So I do commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, the genuine conservatism of the Twelve Southerners. It is not the only mode of conservative thought, but it is an important mode. The authors of I'll Take My Stand did not propound a rigorous ideology or display a model of Utopia: their principal purpose it was to open our eyes to the illusions of Modernism. The Southern Agrarians proclaimed when I was a child that the southern culture is worth defending; that society is something more than the gross national product; that the country lane is healthier than the Long Street; that more wisdom lies in Tradition than in Scientism; that Leviathan is a devourer, not a savior. Your servant, a northerner of northerners, salutes those Twelve Southerners, some quick, some dead. Study what they have written, and you will discover that they are no mere Archaists.
<p>
"Worn out with abstraction and novelty, plagued with divided counsels, some Americans have said: I will believe the old folks at home, who have kept alive through many treacherous outmodings some good secret of life." So Donald Davidson writes in his chapter "The Diversity of America." He continues, "Such moderns prefer to grasp the particular. They want something to engage both their reason and their love. They distrust the advice of John Dewey to 'use the foresight of the future to refine and expand present activities.' The future is not yet; it is unknowable, intangible. But the past was, the present is; of that much they can be sure. So they attach themselves-or re-attach themselves-to a home-section, one of the sections, great or small, defined in the long conquest of our continental area. They seek spiritual and cultural autonomy....They are learning how to meet the subtlest and most dangerous foe of humanity-the tyranny that wears the mask of humanitarianism and benevolence. They are attacking Leviathan."
<p>
Amen to that, Donald Davidson, my old friend, now passed into eternity. Ladies and gentlemen, go forth and do likewise: strike a blow against Leviathan, the monster of the mass-age.

<P>
With some trepidation I commence my remarks on this large subject, the lot of educational reformers being hard. In 1953, Professor Arthur Bestor published a book entitled <i>Educational Wastelands: The Retreat from Learning in Our Public Schools.</i> There survives a Jewish tradition that all the Prophets were stoned to death or otherwise slain by the People. From 1953 onward, the Educationists belabored Dr. Bestor with epithets, until he departed from this world. And the Educationists' retreat from learning has continued with few impediments.
<p>
In my preceding lecture of this series about Prospects for Conservatives, entitled "Prospects Abroad," I ventured to suggest the possibility of an Augustan Age for the United States and for the twenty-first-century world-supposing we Americans do not endeavor to impose our ways upon all the peoples of the earth. But in discussing American education, I cannot be so sanguine.
<p>
Marxist educational notions and methods have been exposed as grim fallacies-except in these United States, perhaps. Yet what are we to say of present American educational notions and methods? Ever since the publishing of the report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education, "A Nation at Risk," seven years ago, a great deal of talk about education, and scribbling about it, have occurred. As for any evidences of general improvement, however-why, one does not discover them easily.
<p>
The United States now is the great power in the world. Nevertheless, who can praise an educational system that turns out young people marvelously ignorant-except for a very small minority-of history, geography, and foreign languages, and so, unfitted to have much of anything to do with concerns larger than those of their own neighborhood? Worse still, what future have a people whose schooling has enabled them, at best, to ascertain the price of everything-but the value of nothing? We Americans stand today politically dominant, intellectually enfeebled. Conservatives have before them a complex work of intellectual restoration.
<p>
<b>Plight and Possibilities.</b> Nowadays nearly everybody-except for the National Education Association's bosses and affiliates, and the professors at most schools of education- confesses that something is badly wrong with learning in America. While we linger in a mood of remorse and recrimination, opportunity exists for genuine reform. Permit me to address you first, and basically, on the plight and possibilities of the higher learning.
<p>
For half a century, our higher education has been sinking lower. Nobody is more painfully aware of this decay than is the conscientious professor of some experience, and nobody suffers more from it than does the perceptive undergraduate. America's higher learning lies in a state of decadence. But eras of decadence sometimes are succeeded by eras of renewal. It is all a matter of will, reason, and imagination. As Samuel Johnson put it, "Why, sir, we <i>know</i> the will is free; and there's an end to it."
<p>
<b>Higher Education's Mission.</b> Conceivably we Americans, after decades of blundering and incertitude, may be entering upon an American Augustan Age. For successful healing, candid diagnosis is required. The people of the United States now spend annually upon higher education more money, probably, than did all the nations of the world combined, probably, from the foundation of the ancient universities down to the beginning of World War II. Yet there prevails a widespread discontent at the results produced by this costly endeavor. Surely it is time for us conservatives to examine afresh the mission of the higher education.
<p>
The primary end of the higher learning, in all lands and all times, has been what John Henry Newman called the training of the intellect to form a philosophical habit of mind. College and university were founded to develop right reason and imagination, for the sake of the person and of the republic. By its nature, the higher education is concerned with abstractions-rather difficult abstractions, both in the sciences and in humane studies. In any age, most people are not fond of abstractions. In this democratic milieu, therefore, higher education stands in danger everywhere from leveling pressures.
<p>
In Britain, a very few years ago, the member of the opposition party who had been designated minister of education in a prospective Labour government denounced Oxford and Cambridge universities as "cancers." Presumably he would have converted those ancient institutions, if given his way, into something like the Swedish "people's universities" -that is, lax institutions at which every lad and lass can succeed, because all standards for entrance or graduation have been swept away. Every man and woman an intellectual king or queen, with an Oxbridge degree. The trouble with this aspiration is that those kings and queens would be intellectually impoverished-and presumably Britain generally would be impoverished in more ways than one.
<p>
Recently we have heard similar voices in the graduate schools of Harvard. Why discriminate against indolence and stupidity? Why not let everybody graduate, regardless of performance in studies? Would not that be the democratic way? If young people do not care for abstractions, and manifest a positive aversion to developing a philosophical habit of mind, why not give them what they think they would like: that is, the superficial counter-culture?
<p>
<b>Lowering of Standards.</b> The educational degradation of the democratic dogma already has prevailed, with few exceptions, throughout the western world: it has gone far in France and Italy. In the United States, ever since World War II, the lowering of standards for admission and for graduation, the notorious disgrace of "grade inflation," and the loss of order and integration in curricula, are too widely known and regretted for me to need to labor these afflictions here. Some cold comfort may be found in the fact that we have not sinned more greatly than have other nations of the West-somewhat less, indeed.
<p>
Here and there, some signs of renewal in higher education may be discerned; certainly we hear much pother about it. But it remains to be determined whether it is possible to restore or improve the true higher learning, what with powerful political and economic pressures against improvement. Being somewhat gloomy by conviction, yet sanguine by temperament, I may mutter to myself, "Say not the struggle naught availeth!"
<p>
Why are this lowering of standards and this loss of intellectual coherence ruinous to higher education? Because the higher learning is intended to develop, primarily, a philosophical habit of mind. The genuine higher education is not meant, really, to "create jobs" or to train technicians. Incidentally, the higher education does tend to have such results, too; but only as by-products. We stand in danger of forgetting, during our pursuit of the incidentals, the fundamental aims of learning.
<p>
Why were colleges and universities established, and what remains their most valuable function? To discipline the mind; to give men and women long views and to instill in them the virtue of prudence; to present a coherent body of ordered knowledge, in several great fields; to pursue that knowledge for its own sake; to help the rising generation to make its way toward wisdom and virtue. The college is an instrument to teach that truth is better than falsehood, and wisdom better than ignorance. Of course the college has done other things as well, some of them mildly baneful-such as serving as an instrument of social snobbery. But I am speaking still of the college's fundamental mission.
<p>
The college is intended to confer two sorts of  benefits. The first sort of benefit is the improvement of the human person, for the individual's own sake: opening the way to some wisdom to young men and women, that there may be something in their lives besides getting and spending.
<p>
<b>Essential to Society.</b> The second kind of benefit is the preservation and advancement of society, by developing a body or class of young people who will be leaders in many walks of life: scientists, clergymen, political officials or representative officers, physicians, lawyers, teachers, industrialists, managers, and all the re! t. The college is a means to help to form intellects, assure their competence, and (a point often forgotten today) to help to form their characters. Here I am not speaking of an elite, for I share T.S. Eliot's conviction that a deliberately-cultivated series of elites would tend toward narrowness and arrogance. Rather, I refer to a fairly broad and numerous class of tolerably educated men and women who would leaven the lump of society in a wide variety of ways. Most of them never would be famous, or powerful on a large scale; but they form that body of well-schooled people essential to any modern society, and especially important to a democratic society.
<p>
Now a higher schooling merely technological and skill-oriented-what once would have been called a mechanical education, as opposed to a liberal education-can neither impart wisdom to the person nor supply intellectual and moral leadership to the republic. I do not object to learning a trade-far from it. But a trade is best learnt through apprenticeship, internship, on-the-job training, or technical schools. Except for the learned professions, learning a trade is ill suited to a college campus. If we convert higher education into technical training merely, we may find ourselves living in what Irving Babbitt called "a devil's sabbath of whirling machinery." For if the philosophical habit of mind is developed nowhere, "the center cannot hold; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."
<p>
Let me descend to particulars. The biggest fad in education today is the movement styled the Information Revolution. An extensive jargon is developing to serve this revolution's uses. The revolution is supposed to usher in an Informational Society; we even are told that this Informational Society will supplant the Knowledge Society. One of the grave faults of American schooling at every level is the eagerness to embrace the newest gadget- mechanical or intellectual-at the expense of the tested tools of learning. The apologists for television used to tell us that their darling has molded the minds of "the best informed generation in the history of America." Also, if we are to believe the report "A Nation at Risk," it has molded the minds of the most ignorant generation in America. For information is not knowledge; and knowledge is not wisdom. This is movingly expressed by T.S. Eliot in some lines of his choruses for <i>The Rock:</i>
<p><blockquote>
The endless cycle of idea and action,<br> Endless invention, endless experiment,<br> Brings knowledge of motion, but not of stillness; <br>Knowledge of speech, but not of silence; <br>Knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word. <br>All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance, <br>All our ignorance brings us nearer to death, <br>But nearness to death no nearer to God. <br>Where is the Life we have lost in living? <br>Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? <br>Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? <br>The cycles of Heaven in twenty centuries <br>Bring us farther from God and nearer to the Dust.<br>
</blockquote><p>
Aye, where is the knowledge we have lost in information, not to mention the wisdom? What college and university used to endeavor to impart was not miscellaneous information, a random accumulation of facts, but instead an integrated and ordered body of knowledge that would develop the philosophical habit of mind-from which cast of mind one might find the way to wisdom of many sorts.
<p>
Doubtless the prevalence of computers may confer upon us various material benefits. But so far as genuine education goes, the computer and its Informational Society may amount to a blight. They seem calculated to enfeeble the individual reason and to make most of us dependent upon an elite of computer programmers-at the higher lever of the Informational Society, I mean; they may develop into vigorous enemies of the philosophical habit of mind.
<p>
<b>Technological Flotsam.</b> One thing to remember, then, in discussing what higher education should do for people in the dawning years, is that waves of technological! innovation commonly carry on their crests a mass of flotsam. Such a disagreeable mass was flung upon the beaches of academe by the ideological tempests of the 1960s and 1970s. At university and college we are only beginning to recover from the damage done to the philosophical habit of mind by that storm. The gentlefolk and scholars of the Academy would be highly imprudent if they should assist in fresh devastation by setting gadgetry above intellectual discipline.
<p>
I am arguing that educational neoterism does mischief often. Nor do I believe it to be the primary function of university and college to create a kind of tapioca-pudding society in which everybody would be just like everybody else-every young man and woman, ideally, possessed of a doctoral degree, if innocent of philosophy.
<p>
Instead, the primary mission of university and college is to point the way toward some measure of wisdom and virtue, through developing the philosophical habit of mind. I am saying that universities and colleges were founded in the hope that those institutions might help the rising generation toward two forms of order: one, order in the soul of the person, the direction of will and appetite by reason; the other, order in the commonwealth, through the understanding of justice and freedom and the public good. I am arguing that our basic reform of the higher learning must be the restoration of these venerable aims-a task for conservatives.
<p>
Is it absurd to imagine that our vast factory-like campuses might be humanized? Is it ridiculous to argue that the American obsession with getting and spending could be chastened sufficiently to permit American higher learning to be sought for its own sake? Perhaps; but perhaps not, too.
<p>
I lack time to offer you a detailed program of educational reformation. But I venture now to suggest the essential measure that must be undertaken if we are to move from intellectual decadence toward intellectual renewal.
<p>
First, the quality of American primary and secondary schooling must be mightily improved before there can be any very marked increase of intelligence and imagination among college and university students. This improvement must have two aspects: the teaching of true intellectual disciplines, and the rousing of the moral imagination. Despite endeavors of the federal Department of Education to entice schools into improving themselves, little has occurred as yet in the way of practical reform.
<p>
I find it highly doubtful that any marked reformation of the public schools can occur until the several states, and perhaps the federal government too, adopt some form of the "voucher plan," which would provide for much greater diversity and choice in schooling. Here I commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, the new book by John E. Chubb and Terry M. Moe, <i>Politics, Markets, and America's Schools</I> (Brookings Institution). As Mr. Chubb puts it, "The public education system functions naturally and routinely, despite everybody's best intentions, to burden schools with excessive bureaucracy, to discourage effective school organization, and to stifle student achievement."
<p>
Second, the American appetite for requiring vocational certification must be curbed. A very great part of the student body on nearly all campuses is enrolled mostly because "you have to get a degree to get a job." Thus universities and colleges are crowded with young people who would prefer to be somewhere else, earning money or at least active and emancipated from abstractions. It needs to be remembered that universities and colleges are centers for the study of abstractions; and most people's interest in abstractions is distinctly limited. Many of the skills in business, industry, technology, and governmental service are best acquired by internship or apprenticeship; being compelled to linger in college is little better than marking time for many undergraduates. Were universities and colleges relieved of the responsibility for turning out half-finished candidates for routine employment, they could undertake their primary duties so much the better; and the whole atmosphere of the typical campus would grow far more cheerful.
<p>
Third, the humane scale in learning should be regained by creating no more mass campuses with many thousands of undergraduates in a lonely crowd, and decentralizing so far as possible the existing Behemoth campuses. The old collegiate structure of the academic community should become the model once more. Institutes for technical training, as distinct from the abstractions with which higher education is supposed to be concerned, should be situated elsewhere than on the same campus with college or university.
<p>
Fourth, curricula at nearly all universities and colleges should be greatly revised, rigorously, so as to provide students with a genuine intellectual discipline, purged of the intellectual boondoggles that have disgraced college programs to some extent ever since the beginning of this century, but especially since the late Sixties. At the majority of American establishments of a learning allegedly higher, theoretical sciences and imaginative humane studies have been pushed into a dusty corner of the curriculum; that folly must be undone. Reading through directories of colleges recently, with a view to finding a good college for our third daughter, I discovered that at the typical college nowadays only some five percent of the undergraduates are enrolled in "letters," which once upon a time was the American college's principal discipline. If the rising generation's more intelligent members have acquired little knowledge of great literature, history, languages, and the natural sciences- why, the person and the republic will fall into disorder, soon or late.
<p>
Fifth, we must emphasize through the whole of higher education the ancient principle that the ends of all education are wisdom and virtue. I do <i>not</i> mean that the purpose of the higher learning is to "impart values." The whole notion of teaching "values" is mistaken, although held often by sincere people who mean well.
<p>
For what true education attempts to impart is <i>meaning,</i> not value. This sly employment of the word <i>value</i> as a substitute for such words as "norm," "standard," "principle," and "truth" is the deliberate work of the doctrinaire positivists, who deny that there exists any moral significance of a transcendent or an abiding character. In America, the notion of educational "values" has been advanced by sociologists and educationists of the Instrumentalist school: it is intended as a substitute for the religious assumptions about human existence that formerly were taken for granted in schools. A "value," as educationists employ the word, is a personal preference, gratifying perhaps to the person who holds it, but of no binding moral effect upon others. "Other things being equal, pushpin is as good as poetry," in Bentham's famous phrase. Choose what values you will, or ignore them all: it's a matter of what gives you, the individual, the most pleasure and the least pain.
<p>
Etienne Gilson points out that positivists deliberately advance the concept of "values" because they deny that words, or the concepts represented by words, have real meaning. Thus the word "honor" may hold value for some, but may be repellent to other people: in the view of the positivist, the word "honor" is meaningless, for there is no honor, nor yet dishonor: all really is physical sensation, pleasurable or painful. But if "honor" has an illusory value for you, employ it; if you dislike "honor," discard it.
<p>
<b>Imparting A Moral Heritage. </b>Time was when every school child used to be familiar with the catalogue of the seven cardinal virtues and the seven deadly sins. The positivists and a good many other folk today deny the existence of those seven deadly sins, or of any other sin. As for the virtues-why, they would like to convert those back into "value preferences," with no moral imperative to back them. But justice, fortitude, prudence, and temperance are not "values" merely; nor are faith, hope, and charity. It is not for the individual, bound up in self-conceit, to determine whether he prefers justice or injustice; it is not for him to decide whether prudence or imprudence suits him better. True, the individual may so decide and act, to others' harm or his own. But it is the function of education to impart a moral heritage: to teach that the virtues and the vices are real, and that the individual is not free to toy with the sins as he may choose.
<p>
What true education transmits is not values, but instead a body of truth: that is, a pattern of meanings, perceived through certain disciplines of the intellect. The sort of education that prevailed in Europe and America until about 1930, say, was an endeavor to instruct the rising generation in the nature of reality. It traced a pattern of order: order in the soul, order in the commonwealth. That old system of education began with information; it passed from information to knowledge; it moved from knowledge to wisdom. Its aim, I repeat, was not value, but truth.
<p>
The Benthamite and Deweyite educational structure of our day, little concerned with meaning, aims confusedly at personal advancement, technical training, sociability, socialization, custodial functions, and certification-not to mention fun and games. The very possibility of ascertaining the meaning of anything is denied by many a department of philosophy. What does this twentieth-century educational system transmit to the rising generation? Chiefly certain technical and commercial skills, together with that training in the learned professions that is indispensable to our civilization. Modern schooling, at any level, offers little toward the ordering of the soul and the ordering of the commonwealth.
<p>
We Americans possess the riches and the power that could give us an American Augustan Age. Do we possess mind and heart requisite for an Augustan era? It has been said that the Americans of our time know the price of everything and the value of nothing; it might better be said that they know the price of everything, the value of some things-and the meaning of next to nothing. We have not schooled ourselves, this past half-century and more, for Augustan responsibilities.
<p>
<b>Fading Heritage.</b> So far as we remembered our heritage of culture at all, most of us Americans assumed that somehow it would endure automatically, unregarded and unrenewed-a form of perpetual motion. But that heritage has been fading among us for several decades. In educational fad and foible, in arid specialization, in mere processes of certification for potential employment, we have laid waste our inheritance of reason and imagination.
<p>
Having failed to apprehend meanings, we are forced back upon a rude pragmatism in private life and in public a groping for "what works"-or seems to work. In private existence, such servility to the evanescent moment leads to the alienist's couch and the divorce court; in the affairs of nations, such naive improvisations may end in ruinous blunders, not to be undone.
<p>
The education of yesteryear was founded upon certain postulates. One of these was that much truth is ascertainable; another, that religious truth is the source of all good; a third, that we may profit by the wisdom of our ancestors; a fourth, that the individual is foolish, but the species is wise; a fifth, that wisdom is sought for its own sake; a sixth, that for the sake of the commonwealth, schooling should quicken the moral imagination.
<p>
These postulates have not ceased to be true; it is only that they have been forgotten in our century's obsession with power and money, and our century's illusion that ideology is a ready and satisfactory substitute for thought. Some eyes have been opened to the mischief done by that obsession and that illusion. Here and there, some attempts at recovery of the true ends of education are being made.
<p>
<b>Winning Back the Inheritance. </b>Many in America and throughout the world have been disinherited of their cultural patrimony. Yet they may win back that inheritance, if they have fortitude and tenacity sufficient. "The dead alone give us energy," we are told by Gustave Le Bon. In the long run, the man and the state that have rejected the legacy from many centuries will be found nerveless. And the man or woman who has sought out that intellectual legacy will be emboldened to defend the Permanent Things Against Chaos and Old Night. 
<p>
My old comrade in arms Arthur Bestor found the schools of America in 1953 educational wastelands; they are no less arid today. Yet say not, ladies and gentlemen, that the struggle naught availeth. Some conservative irrigation conceivably may cause the desert to bloom. If nothing is done-why, hand in hand with the Hollow Men, we go round and round the prickly pear at five o'clock in the morning.
<p><blockquote>
This is the dead land <BR>This is cactus land <BR>Here the stone images <BR>Are raised, here they receive <BR>The supplication of a dead man's hand <BR>Under the twinkle of a fading star.
</blockquote><p>
Unless conservatives act intellectually and vigorously to renew right reason and imagination among us, by the conclusion of the twentieth century America may be an egalitarian wasteland of mind and spirit, with everybody compulsorily schooled, and everybody equal in ignorance.

This year's series of Heritage Lectures is concerned with the somewhat pressing question of whether our American culture will survive the tribulations of our age. In the two previous lectures, I have discussed the ideology called "multiculturalism" as a menace; and whether a civilization that lacks belief in a religion can endure. In my final lecture, in December, I mean to talk about means for combating cultural decay. Today I have chosen for my subject the degradation of the democratic dogma.
<p>
I take my title from the writings of Henry and Brooks Adams. They found American democracy in process of degradation more than a century ago. The decay of the American Presidency from George Washington to Ulysses S. Grant, Henry Adams remarked, refuted altogether Darwin's theory of evolution. To a similar thesis I shall return presently.
<p>
But first, indulge me in some observations concerning the present condition of what is called "democracy" near the close of the 20th century. We are informed by certain voices that soon all the world will be democratic. But whether or not, the American mode of democratic government prevails, the abstract ideology called <i>democratism</i> that any government which has obtained a majority of votes be received as "democratic." Enthusiasts for unrestricted democracy presumably forget that Adolph Hitler, too, was democratically elected and sustained by popular plebiscites. Alexis de Tocqueville warned his contemporaries against "democratic despotism," 20th century writers discuss "totalist democracy."
<p>
I am suggesting, ladies and gentlemen, that <i>democracy</i>-literally, "the rule of the crowd"-is a term so broad and vague as to signify everything or nothing. The American democracy, a unique growth although an offshoot from British culture, innocent of ideology's fury-functioned fairly well in the past because of peculiar beliefs and conditions: a patrimony of ordered freedom, and especially, as Tocqueville pointed out, Americans' <i>mores,</i> or moral habits. What is called "democracy" today in most of the world-and nearly every regime represents itself as democratic-bears much resemblance to America's political and social pattern as the oar of the boat does to the ore of the mine. All that these regimes maintain in common is a claim that they rule with the assent of the majority of the people. The tyranny of the majority can be more oppressive, and more effectual, than the tyranny of a single person.
<p>
<b>Not Readily Transplanted.</b> Neoconservatives' demands nowadays that all the world be thoroughly democratized overnight remind me strongly of a similar enthusiasm not long after the end of the Second World War. Gentlemen such as Chester Bowles then proclaimed that Africa, liberated from European domination, promptly would rejoice in an array of democracies on the American model. The United States took measures, then and later, to accelerate this happy progress economic restraints upon trade of one sort or another with Portugal, Rhodesia, and latterly the Republic of South Africa. We all know, of course, how blissfully democratic Angola, Mozambique, Guinea, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) are today; while South Africa's peoples, thanks to the beneficence of American and European liberals, enjoy the prospect of civil war in emulation of what occurred in the Congo three decades ago. America's democracy is not readily transplanted overseas. If anybody emerges alive from the present agony in Somalia, will a peaceful democracy, told by the nose, soon come to pass there? Was the ejection, after the Second World War, of the Italian government from part of Somaliland, and the withdrawal of the British administrators from another portion of that territory, a victory for democracy in Africa? Ask the Somali dead.
<p>
My point is this: Merely to shout the word <i>democracy</i> is not to bring into being a society endowed with order, justice, and freedom. Those blessings grow but slowly, and by good nurture. The roots of the American democratic republic run back through hundreds of years of American, British, and European experience. While we prate about exporting American democracy to Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia-although, as Daniel Boorstin has written, "the American Constitution is not for export"-our own political institutions seem to be crumbling. We may sink into the Latin American brand of democracy, class against class, the economy periodically ruined by inflation, with a semblance of order restored from time to time by the military.
<p>
<b>Recalling 1929. </b>Sinclair Lewis, late in life, wrote an implausible novel <i>It Can' t Happen Here</i>-a fictional affirmation that a fascist regime might be established in the United States; the book was published in 1935. The novel was more comical than convincing; but it does not follow that the American democratic republic will endure for eternity, as Rome was supposed to last. I may be one of the very few persons present today who remembers clearly the events of the American experience between, and including, the years 1929 and 1933. I find America's social and economic and political circumstances today markedly similar to those of that tumultuous era. Changes still larger than those worked by Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal may come to pass during the next four years, say. Economically, the position of the United States is more precarious than it was in 1929: our national debt is astronomical in quantity; personal (family) debt, on the average, is more than four-fifths of a family's annual income; the apparatus of credit is vastly overexpanded; and taxes begin to be crushing. In certain of our cities, ferocious riots far exceed in magnitude the disorders of 1929- 1933, and after: those riots really are proletarian risings. This is a time in which, in Yeats's lines, "The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity."
<p>
In 1957, at Bruges, during a conference on Atlandc community, I met Amaury de Riencourt, the author of a book entitled <i>The Coming Caesars,</i> published that year, the book was very widely discussed then, but now is forgotten. Unless measures of restraint should be taken, Riencourt wrote-and taken promptly-the United States would fall under the domination of 20th century Caesars. Riencourt argued:
<p><blockquote>
Caesarism is not dictatorship, not the result of one man's overriding ambition; not a brutal seizure of power through revolution. It is not based on a specific doctrine or philosophy. It is essentially pragmatic and untheoretical. It is a slow, often century-old, unconscious development that ends in a voluntary surrender of a free people escaping from freedom to one autocratic master....
<P>
Political power in the Western world has become increasingly concentrated in the United States, and in the office of the President within America. The power and prestige of the President have grown with the growth of America and of democracy within America, with the multiplication of economic, political, and military emergencies, with the necessity of ruling what is virtually becoming an American empire-the universal state of a Western civilization at bay....
<P>
Caesarism can come to America constitutionally, without having to alter or break down any existing institution. The White House is already the seat of the most powerful tribunician authority ever known to history. All it needs is amplification and extension. Caesarism in America does not have to challenge the Constitution as in Rome or engage in civil warfare and cross any fateful Rubicon. It can slip in quite naturally, discreetly, through constitutional channels.
</blockquote><p>
Just so. Caesarism slipped into the White House constitutionally, if not naturally, with the murder of President Kennedy in 1963. The plebiscitary democracy would elect Lyndon Johnson President in 1964; but Johnson's military failure would undo him, despite his panem et circenses; and a rebellious senator would strip him of the purple. If Caesars do not win their battles, they fall. In this, although not in much else, perhaps it was as well that the war in Vietnam was lost.
<p>
On a wall of my library hangs a photograph of myself with President Johnson; both of us are smiling; it is well to be civil to Caesar. It might be thought that Russell Kirk would not have been eager to visit Caesar in the Oval office of the Imperial Mansion; indeed I was not. But, in collaboration with James McClellan, I had written not long before a biography of Robert Taft; Johnson, as a senatorial colleague, had delivered a funeral eulogy of the famous Republican; and so I was induced by the patroness of the Robert A. Taft Institute of Government to present the President with a copy of the book, at a little White House ceremony.
<p>
<b>A Visit to Caesar.</b> Present for that occasion in the Oval Office were two Democratic Senators who had been on good terms with Senator Taft-Byrd of Virginia and Tydings of Maryland. Lyndon Johnson towered tall and masterful, clearly a bad man to have for an adversary. The Taft book was presented, and the President exchanged some brief remarks with me; photographs were taken while my irrepressible wife strolled behind the presidential desk, examining photographs of Lady Bird, Lynda Bird, and other folk at the ranch.
<p>
True to his reputation if to naught else, President Johnson wheeled and dealt with Senator Byrd and Senator Tydings the while. He knew me for a syndicated columnist, but surely never had opened any of my books. "Stay in school! Stay in school!" Johnson had shouted, over television, to the rising generation. Yet this Caesar had no need of books; he had been the vainglorious disciple of Experience, that famous master of fools.
<p>
No, Johnson did not open books: with Septimius Severus, he might have said, "Pay the soldiers; the rest do not matter." Had he not Robert McNamara, creator of the Edsel, to counsel him? Power was all, and surely the power of the United States, under Johnson's hand, was infinite. All the way with LBJ! There came into my head, in the Oval Office, a passage from Amaury de Riencourt:
<p><blockquote>
With Caesarism and Civilization, the great struggles between political parties are no longer concerned with principles, programs and ideologies, but with men. Marius, Sulla, Cato, Brutus still fought for principles. But now, everything became personalized. Under Augustus, parties still existed, but there were no more Optimates or Populares. No more conservatives or democrats. Men campaigned for or against Tiberius or Drusus or Caius Caesar. No one believed any more in the efficacy of ideas, political panaceas, doctrines, or systems, just as the Greeks had given up building great philosophic systems generations before. Abstractions, ideas, and philosophies were rejected to the periphery of their lives and of the empire, to the East where Jews, agnostics, Christians, and Mithraists attempted to conquer the world of souls and minds while the Caesars ruled their material existence.
</blockquote><p>

All the way with LBJ! <i>Ave atque vale!</i>
<p>
<b>Consequences of Hubris.</b> Every inch a Caesar LBJ looked; he might have sat for Michelangelo for the carving of a statue of a barracks emperor. Experience, nevertheless, had not taught this imperator how to fight a war. To fancy that hundreds of thousands of fanatic guerrillas and North Vietnamese regulars, supplied by Russia and China, might be defeated by military operations merely defensive-plus a great deal of bombing from the air, destroying civilians chiefly, that bombing pinpointed by Johnson himself in the White House! The American troops in Vietnam fought admirably well-how well, my old friend General S. L. A. Marshall described unforgettably in his books-but their situation was untenable. "Imagination rules mankind," Bonaparte had said-Napoleon, master of the big battalions. Had Johnson possessed any imagination, he would have sealed Haiphong, as Nixon did later. Only so might the war have been won.
<p>
Afflicted by <i>hubris,</i> Johnson Caesar piled the tremendous cost of the war-a small item was the immense quantity of milk flown daily from San Francisco to Vietnam, American troops not campaigning on handfuls of rice-upon the staggering cost of his enlargement of the welfare state at home. One might have thought he could not do sums. He ruined the dollar and bequeathed to the nation an incomprehensible national debt. Both guns and butter! It had been swords and liturgies with earlier emperors.
<p>
It is with variations that history repeats itself. Ignoring history, LBJ was condemned to repeat it.
<p>
Morally, he was the worst man ever to make himself master of the White House. The corrupt antics of Bobby Baker and Billie Sol Estes did not bring him down, although he had been intimately connected with both.
<p>
In June 1961, an agent of the Department of Agriculture, Henry Marshall, had been found shot to death in Texas. Marshall had been about to expose the criminal wheeling and dealing of Billie Sol Estes, and in that wheeling and dealing Lyndon Johnson, then Vice-President, had participated. A justice of the peace declared the murder of Marshall to have been suicide.
<p>
But in March 1984, a grand jury in Robertson County would look into the mystery. A federal marshal and Billie Sol Estes would certify before that jury. Estes, under immunity, swore that the killing had been decided upon at a meeting at Vice-President Johnson's Washington residence; Johnson had given the order and directed a hanger-on of his, Malcolm Wallace, to execute it. The grand jury believed Estes, it appears, and concluded that Marshall's death had been a homicide. No one was indicted, for the grand jury presumed that the murderers already were dead.
<p>
Such frequently is the way of Caesars. Like some other Caesars, Johnson, from small beginnings, accumulated while in public office a large fortune. No one ever accused him of the vice of scrupulosity. An ill man to deal with, Lyndon Baines Johnson.
<p>
Yet Eugene the Poet, Eugene the Giant-Killer, would fetch Caesar down. I do not think that Eugene McCarthy would have converted himself into a Caesar; nay, American conservatives might have been better content with President McCarthy than they would become with President Bush or will be with President Clinton.
<p>
<b>Politics of the Absurd.</b> For the past several months, the American people endured the least edifying of presidential campaigns. No one of the three gentlemen who aspired to the presidential office commanded much respect, and their debates were more concerned with trivia and intemperate accusations than with the great and most difficult public decisions that must be made very soon. The feeblest of the three candidates proposed to refer all of those decisions to the electorate at large, by electronic means of polling-as if every American voter were able and eager to express a considered judgment on what courses should be undertaken in the conduct of foreign policy, on how the national debt should be reduced, on how civil disorders should be averted, on what to do about the American proletariat, on the improvement of public schooling, on the allocation of priorities in public expenditure, on the afflictions of centralization and bureaucracy, on the question of immigration, on the modes of averting an economic collapse on the scale of what occurred in 1929-on these and innumerable other public issues, it is proposed that we take a hasty popular poll! That way lies democratic madness. Why bother with statesmen? Surely the typical American voter is omniscient. We have entered upon the politics of the absurd.
<p>
This year's three presidential aspirants seemed absurd to a great multitude of citizens. How had they been selected for candidacy? Mr. Perot selected himself, soon withdrew (but not from modesty), and then selected himself afresh. Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton were selected chiefly by primary campaigns, the results of which were determined chiefly by the amount of money they were able to spend, respectively, on television advertising. In the case of President Bush, his being an incumbent of the office, with large benefactions to bestow, saved the day for him. I was general chairman of the Buchanan campaign in Michigan. We Buchanan backers had only ten thousand dollars to spend; while the Bush people spent half a million dollars in Michigan. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi;</i> to them that hath shall be given. Certain Roman Caesars bought the imperial purple. Increasingly, our presidential candidates win by purchasing time on the boob-tube.
<p>
<b>Not As Framers Intended.</b> The Framers of the Constitution gravely distrusted democratic appetites, as such had been demonstrated by Shays' Rebellion. Also they distrusted arbitrary power in a chief executive. So they endeavored-unsuccessfully, as matters have turned out-to devise a prudent method of selecting presidents, far removed from popular vote. This was the Electoral College. It was assumed by the Framers that within each of the several states there would be chosen (through divers modes) able and conscientious presidential electors, free agents, "men of superior discernment, virtue, and information" (in Senator Thomas Hart Benton's phrases), who would select a strong and good President "according to their own will," regardless of popular sentiment of the hour. This upright intended Electoral College never has functioned as the Framers intended, nevertheless, because with the rise of great coherent political parties came the pledging in advance of electors to the candidacy of some particular individual- Adams, or Jefferson, or Burr, say-and therefore the reduction of the Electoral College to insignificance, except so far as the College preserved the idea of a nation of sovereign states, the presidential electoral vote being cast by the several states according to their representation in the Congress-and not according to the popular vote, nationally regarded.
<p>
The Framers of the Constitution conceivably might have revised a different move for the Electoral College that could have survived the rise of great political parties. One such arrangement might have been to make the sitting governors of the several states, if chosen long before the presidential election, the independent choosers of the President, so removing the selection from the ephemeral preferences of the great mass of ill-informed voters nationally. But "the saddest words of tongue or pen are simply these: 'It might have been."' Now we expect presidential candidates to exhaust themselves, and their supporters' fund, by <i>two</i> overwhelming national campaigns-one the primaries and conventions held in every state, the other the frantic struggle on the eve of the November election, every four years. This method is supposed to ascertain the popular will; but in effect it blurs distinctions between parties, the candidates promising to be all things, to all men-and women; and commonly this method gives us demagogues or else bladders of vanity as party candidates. All too possibly it may give us more Caesar-presidents; President Bush endeavored to be one such, causing the deaths of a quarter of a million people in Iraq; but the popularity of that exploit rapidly evaporated. The more we behave as if the President were the embodiment of the American democracy, and do little about the Congress except to revile senators and representatives, the less genuinely democratic this nation must become.
<p>
Electronic technology becomes a tool of plebiscitary democracy. As Mr. James M. Perry put it in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> on November 4, hereafter, having upheld the presidential contest of 1992, "Candidates will build on what they saw this year-800-telephone number satellite hookups, soft Larry King-style interviews, televised town meetings." It's a brave new world, with words like "teledemocracy" and "interactive communications" being used by the scholars to describe it. Notions like Mr. Perot's "electronic town hall," should they come to pass, would concentrate the national public' s attention upon the presidential candidates merely, sweeping aside the mechanism of parties and in effect reducing the Congress (or, on the level of the several states, the state legislatures) to little more than ratifying bodies, pledged to whatever programs the victorious presidential candidate might advocate and decree. The peril to true representative government, and to America's old territorial democracy, is too obvious for me to labor this point. The presidential candidates, in such a novel system, necessarily would have to raise enormous quantities of money from such special interests, pressure groups, and ethnic blocs as might expect to profit from the ascendancy of some vigorous demagogue or some persuasive instrument of oligarchy.
<p>
Yet a good many Americans fancy that these developments founded upon television and telephone will bring about "government of the people, by the people, and for the people." At our county Republican convention in my state of Michigan, an amiable young candidate for the office of representative in the Michigan legislature-a person who thought himself conservative- declared himself delighted at the prospect of serving the people "in the new direct democracy." Now direct democracy did not function well in ancient Athens, when the whole electorate-a few thousand men-could assemble in the agora; it would function disastrously, if at all, in the United States of the 20th century, with a population of some two hundred and fifty million people. In any event, the People possessing no unanimous collective will on any question, this virtual abolition of representative government would come down to skillful manipulation of the moment's public opinion by a circle of electronic-media specialists in the service of the President: an extreme form of plebiscitary democracy. In effect, the Presidency would become a dictatorship achieved without violence and checked only by the necessity of an election every four years. How very democratic!
<p>
<b>Plurality President.</b> I speak thus alarmingly only of future possibilities, not of the swiftly approaching reign of Clinton Caesar. For Mr. Clinton achieved a majority of the popular vote merely in his own state of Arkansas; he is a plurality President merely, no popular hero empowered by the Demos to shape the world nearer to his heart's desire. Moreover, he has promised all things to all men-free medical care; free college education, or virtually free, for all comers; emancipation from the tiresome restraints of bourgeois morality; more lavish entitlements for such minorities as can turn out the vote; Lord knows what all benefits. These promises cannot be fulfilled; therefore the reproaches which were heaped upon President Bush these past four years will descend upon President Clinton twofold, not long after his inauguration; and he lacks the rhetorical skill and cunning with which Franklin Roosevelt, in highly similar circumstances, deflected or repelled such criticisms. So feebleness, rather than militancy, is liable to predominate during the Clinton years. And if President Clinton presumes to increase income taxes, as he has said he will do-why, the new Congress, mindful of the fate of the late Bush Administration, may turn rebellious. <i>In fine,</i> Mr. Clinton will not be crowned with laurel.
<p>
Clinton's successors, nevertheless, may have more happy opportunities for the concentration of power in their hands. Increasing military involvement in the European continent, or the collapse of the world economy in a fashion more ruinous than what occurred from 1929 to 1992, might whet presidential candidates' eagerness for power, and public willingness to entrust all to the Great White Father.
<p>
Circumstances from Siberia to San Francisco strongly resemble political and social and economic circumstances in most of the world between the two World Wars. The coming of immense inflation of currencies-now quite conceivable-might cause such immense public resentment and distress that executive forces and legislative bodies might be swept out of power, in country after country, and by plebiscites might usher in persons not at all scrupulous in their attainment -of power. Such radical changes would be accomplished in the name of Democracy, of course, but what would result would be plebiscitary democracy, ruthless enough.
<p>
In the name of Democracy, America' s representative government, under the Constitution, might be swept aside, and politics might be debased to contests between hypocritical ideologues, every one of them claiming to be more democratic than the others. What's in a name? In Haiti, "democracy" signifies the arbitrary power of deposed President Aristide to have rubber tires slung round the necks of his opponents, and they set afire. In South Africa, the apotheosis of democracy, one man one vote on Benthamite principles would end in civil war and general impoverishment. In the United States, the demand for more democracy might lead to the legalized plundering of the hardworking by those who prefer not to work at all. And a line of American Caesars might be required to preserve any sort of order.
<p>
<b>Recovering True Representative Government.</b> I am arguing, ladies and gentlemen, that these United States would be only degraded by a submission to an ideological democracy, in either domestic or foreign policy, a Rousseauistic democracy restyled "teledemocracy." What we require is a vigorous recovery of true representative government, one of the principal achievements of our culture, a legacy from centuries of British and colonial experience and from the practical wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution of the United States. Say not the struggle naught availeth, friends. In my concluding lecture of this series, I will endeavor to let some cheerfulness break in, suggesting means for cultural restoration in a diversity of aspects.

"Senator Cochrans Exemplary Actions"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
On occasion, there is honor among politicians and it is worth our taking notice. Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi is Chairman of the Senate GOP Conference. It is one of the top leadership positions in the Senate. He is sort of the Chairman of the Board of all Republican Senators. He has a significant staff. He has occupied the position for six years and no one has even hinted about running against him for that leadership position in the next Congress. Cochran is a shoo-in for a fourth term in the Senate this November.<P> 
But Thad Cochran helped freshmen Senators engineer term limits for the Senate Leadership and Committee Chairmen. As part of a reform package, it was adopted by the majority at the beginning of the 104th Congress last year. Cochran was one of the very few senior Senators to have assisted the freshmen in getting the reforms they sought.<P>
The term limits for Leadership provision grandfathered Cochran and others so the six year time clock would not apply to them for another couple of Congresses. But Thad Cochran is an honorable man. Having been a chief proponent of six year term limits for the Leadership, and his six years as Leader being up at the end of this Congress, Cochran announced that he will not seek re-election as Chairman of the Conference.<P> 
Thus Cochran sets the sort of example inside the Senate which Senator Malcolm Wallop set in 1994 in Wyoming. Wallop was an ardent opponent of term limits. However, the people of Wyoming voted for term limits by more than 70% of the vote. Their vote also grandfathered Wallop, who didn't agree with the outcome, but he felt the people had spoken so he announced that he would abide by their will and retire. That forced the hand of his colleague Alan Simpson who also announced his retirement from the Senate, after three terms, at the end of this Congress. <P>
Cochran's announcement was a thunderbolt in the Senate. Here is a Senator who is actually putting into practice what he says he believes. Cochran's actions will likely effect what other Senators, who have been in the Leadership for many years, will do as well. <P>
One can only speculate what it will mean for Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. If Dole loses the Presidency, the question of his continued leadership in the Senate will be front and center. Dole was first elected Leader following the 1984 election. He has been either Majority Leader or Minority Leader ever since. 
<P>Cochran's principled actions will put Dole in a box. Even though the reforms passed by Senate Republicans specifically exempt the Majority Leader, will Bob Dole, should he lose the Presidency, dare to come back to his colleagues and say, "Others are leaving after six years, but I want my job back for the 13th and 14th year?" I frankly doubt, now that Cochran has done what he has done, Dole would get by with it. For Dateline Washington, I'm Paul Weyrich.

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Friday, January 17, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Lecture that Can't be Missed</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> I was so happy to
learn that Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA), who may be prosecuted for his handling of the illegal
recording of the Gingrich tape, is giving a speech in Seattle on February 16th, entitled,
"Privacy in the age of new technology." The speech will be presented at a meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science. Mary Matalin said she had managed to
get a number of people to sign up for the $150 event. It would be worth it at any price.<p>

Well, that got me to thinking about what other lectures I might be missing. Then, I did an
Internet search, and what do you know, there are just lots of them. So I'll be very busy for
the next couple of weeks. For example, there is the $500 tax deductible lecture given by
Speaker Gingrich on "How to use a 501c3 Foundation to help Republicans make further gains in
Congress." It takes place in Atlanta next week. However, the ticket says "ethics committee
public hearings could produce the need for a rain date."<p>

Then there is the London lecture by Fergie for only $120 American dollars entitled, "How I
learned to live with fat." It seems it was booked before her latest deal with Weight
Watchers.<p>

Oh, and here is one I am really excited about: $100 per hour. Hmmm. That seems like an odd
price for a lecture. Well, anyway, it is by Dick Morris and is entitled, "How to have it
both ways: Enjoy a stable marriage and a swinging lifestyle at the same time." It takes
place at the Jefferson Hotel near the White House on Monday night, during Inauguration
festivities.<p>

Here's one that will take a bit of time, but I can't wait to hear it. The lecture will be in
the ancient city of Hebron and is being given next week by Benjamin Netanyahu. Its title is,
"When you elect a hard-liner to office, you can expect him to keep his campaign promises." 
Cost is 30 pieces of silver.<p>

Here's one I probably will miss: It is Mayor Marion Barry's lecture on "How I saved home
rule by standing up to a Republican Congress and a Democratic president." The cost is an
ounce of cocaine.<p>

But the $75 lecture by O.J. Simpson on "How I landed the Bruno Magli shoe contract after
everyone said I was through in advertising" is definitely worth flying to L.A. for.<p>

While I am there I will be taking in the $1,000 lecture by Barbara Streisand entitled, "How
my pal Bill Clinton let me sleep in the Lincoln bedroom with my boyfriend while he and his
girl were right next door." Speaking of pricey lectures, this one goes for $250,000 -- Wow.
But I guess it's worth it. The money goes to Al Gore who speaks on "How I continued the
traditional practice of separation of church and state while learning the value of the
Buddhist religion."<p>

But then, I have to hurry back to pay $350,000 for Bill Clinton's lecture. This is really
titillating. The President's topic will be "How to proposition a government employee while
avoiding sexual harassment charges." It would be worth it at twice the price. Proceeds, by
the way, go to the Bill Clinton Legal Defense fund.<p>

Of course that means I will have to miss the Tanya Harding lecture entitled "How graceful
moves and good PR made me a star."<p>

And all of that is this month, too. Wait till February when Boris Yeltsin gives his lecture,
from his hospital bed, on "My opponents only thought I was dead." The lecture is $450.00.
Cash only. No rubles.<p>

We'll I've got to run. There is still time to catch the lecture by David Bonior entitled
"How I brought down Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House." I especially don't want to miss
this one: Bonior pays people to listen. <P>

<h2>Republicans Can Count on Whitewater</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>
Some Republicans have been smug all along  since the l994 elections, believing that they were destined to win the Presidency and keep the Congress. Even as even their own polls show Bill Clinton way out front, the smugness in these same Republican circles had continued. The reason? The belief that that somehow Whitewater or some related Clinton scandal was going to bail them out. <p>

Well, look again, Republicans. A jury in Arkansas has acquitted two Arkansas bankers on four charges of fraud in connection with the l990 Clinton gubernatorial campaign and it has deadlocked on seven others.<p>

 That trial had the most promise of directly linking Bill Clinton to wrong doing. It failed. Moreover, Whitewater Special Counsel Ken Starr has indicated that he does not believe that his investigation should interfere in the political process. What that means is if Starr did have plans to indict Hillary Clinton, and there are solid reasons to believe he did, such an indictment will wait until after the l996 elections. Starr well remembers Lawrence Walch's political inspired indictment of former defense Secretary Cap Weinberger on the eve of the l992 election and he was bitterly critical of it. He does not intend to follow that model.  <p>

So now here are the Republicans. 90 days away from the general elections and their silver bullet theory has gone out the window. Moreover Bill Clinton has done an excellent job of running to the center politically. It is hard for the electorate to distinguish Clinton's positions from Bob Dole's positions.<p>
 
What that means is that if they have any chance to win, the Republicans are going to have to come up with some real barn burner issues. These must be issues that excite the electorate. These must be issues which indicate that there is a clear cut difference between the candidates. These have to be issues which would force Bill Clinton to abandon his own base and risk losing the Presidency if he chose to echo the Republican position as he has thus far done with most of the issues Dole has weakly raised .<p>

That is a tall order for any Presidential candidate. It is an especially tall order for candidate Dole, who has made a point of running as fast to the center from the right as Clinton has run to the center from the left. It is little wonder that a poll issued late last week indicated that there is almost no interest in this year's Presidential contest, with only 20% of the electorate feeling strongly about re-electing Bill Clinton and a mere 11% of the electorate feeling strongly about electing Dole President.<p>

Miracles do happen. The Olympics demonstrated that very well. But usually they happen to people who have been working hard to prepare to take advantage of the moment. Unfortunately for Dole and the Republicans, that doesn't seem to fit the description of their candidate. With Whitewater all but gone from the political scene, Dole and the Republicans will need a sharply defined message to take to the electorate and that is something which is strangely missing from this year's political process. 

<P>

"God Is the Answer for the 21st Century"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>

<P>On this Memorial Day we remember those who have given their lives so that America may remain a free and independent nation. That question  whether we will remain a free and independent nation  as relevant at the close of what has been called the American Century as it was at the beginning of this Century. Only now the threat to Americas future is not coming from an ancient European order, nor Hitlers National Socialists, nor the evil empire of Communism. The external threat comes from Moslem fundamentalists who wish to destroy the concept of the nation state, the Chinese and Japanese military/commercial complex which seeks to overrun the rest of the world by economic invasion, as well as from the United Nations which seeks to destroy the concept of sovereignty.
<P>As we pray for those who have served their country well this past Century and before, let us call to mind those who assisted their country in unpopular causes. As painful as it was for the families whose loved ones were killed in the Great World Wars, they nevertheless had the esteem of the community because a member of their family was killed in pursuit of what was believed to be a great cause by the populace. 
<P>Pity those families who had loved ones killed in Vietnam, or who served America silently in the Cold War. There was little community comfort for those killed in the unpopular Vietnam war and as to the cold war, its many victims remain largely unknown because they served as silent agents of America in this undeclared conflict.
<P>And while we are at it, let us call to mind those who now serve their nation in unpopular locations from Bosnia to Macedonia to Haiti. Some will not return and because these conflicts lack popular support back home, the families involved will not enjoy the sort of support from mediating institutions which was forthcoming during the World Wars or even the Korean conflict. 
<P>This dark Century is ending with many of the names and locations with which the 20th Century began. We have by no means fought the wars which ended all wars. Indeed there are a record number of conflicts worldwide, many of them brutal civil wars where there seem to be no good guys or bad guys or even any rational cause at stake. 
<P>For the deaths of those Americans we commemorate on this day not to have been in vain, this nation must get back to the understanding that there will be no peace without a change in mens hearts, and there will be no change in mens hearts without God. As we head toward the 21st Century, mans synergistic co-operation with God will alone bring the tranquillity and order we all seek. If only God will grant our leaders the wisdom to understand that reality.<P>

"New Spin on Natural Laws"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<center>
by Mark Weaver
</center>

<P>
The past hours discussion of the issue of gay marriage may make you wonder where our culture is heading.  What wont people do for a thrill?  What natural laws wont they flout?  Well, wait till you hear this!
<P>Frightful new attractions are popping up across the country this summer, luring children and flouting the law of ...GRAVITY.  
<P>A new roller coaster opening June 1st at Six Flags Magic Mountain is designed to break the 100 mile-an-hour barrier for the first time. The ride, called Superman the Escape, propels you from a standstill to 100 mile-an-hour in seven seconds up a four-hundred-foot tower, where you float in zero gravity until you drop backward.    Thats also at one-hundred miles an hour.  You are weightless for about 6 seconds, another record.
<P>But thats not all.  Competition is pushing designers to make rides faster and higher.
<P>Paul Ruben of the trade magazine Park World says "Were in the roller coaster arms race."   He should know.  His job has involved riding 400 roller coasters.  He says "Ive seen this occurring for 20 years or more. Every park likes to have bragging rights to the fastest, wildest ride for at least one year."
<P>Las Vegas makes its bid with two rides called The Big Shot and The High Roller, both on top of a new one-thousand foot tower. The High Roller tools around a track near the top. The Big Shot shoots you up toward the top then drops you back.  Said one man,    "This is the most exciting thing Ive ever done next to jumping out of an airplane," (which I wouldnt do either.)
<P>Superman and Big Shot use "Star Wars" technology - electromagnetic motors developed for the military.  The motorswhite boxes along the trackspull magnets on the cars, shooting you faster as you cross each one.    Scientists experimented with them to shoot satellites into orbit on tracks. On Superman, YOU are the payload.
<P>Electromagnetic propulsion has already replaced chains and motors on rides in Mexico City, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Other such rides are opening at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Mo.; Universal Studios Florida; and Dreamland, near Sydney, Australia.  
<P>Promoters in the amusement business have been bragging about hundred mile-an-hour roller coasters since the 1920s. But that was before radar guns and truth-in-advertising laws.    Actually, 82 mph is the record right now, claimed jointly by Desperado at Buffalo Bills Casino in Stateline, Nev., and the Steel Phantom in Kennywood, outside Pittsburgh.    
<P>Whats it going to be like to ride Superman the Escape?  Rumor has it that Paul Weyrich is going to be the FIRST rider, and hell give you a full report.<P>

<h2>When Whitewater Wasn't Cool
</h2>
<P>

There is an old country song which goes, "I was country, when country wasn't cool."  Like the song, there was a time when Whitewater, as a news story, wasn't cool.  Now that Special Counsel Ken Starr has secured actual jury convictions, and now that Attorney General Janet Reno has added "Filegate" to Starr's portfolio, Starr and Whitewater enjoy generally-accepted credibility.<P>
Today Whitewater is cool.  But I remember the days when Whitewater wasn't cool.  I recall 1994, when Washington Times investigative reporter Jerry Seper uncovered factual Whitewater information on an almost daily basis. On Whitewater, Seper spent weeks meticulously fitting together the factual pieces of a puzzle scattered over a ten year period, strewn across Arkansas and Washington, DC, and overlooked by establishment reporters who sat on the facts because Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
At the same time, NET-television network began a weekly "Whitewater Update" on "Capitol Watch."  NET tried to get the painfully uncompromising Mr. Seper on our program, but found him routinely unavailable for the limelight. Fortunately, we managed convince several of his colleagues to help us present to our live call-in audience the factual details known at the time.  Editorial Page Editor Tod Lindberg, editorial writer Eric Felton, and even Wesley Pruden helped NET interpret the latest facts in a case which was, for other networks, too difficult for the nightly news.  Indeed, Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
Talk radio played a hand back then. The Seper and Times reports were reliable talking points for an audience trapped between a media establishment trying to avoid Whitewater as a story and hucksters trying to exploit Whitewater for profit.  Even then much of the public new there was a story amidst the confusion.  Whitewater was a story which simply wouldn't go away.<P>
Whitewater wasn't cool then, but it became fashionable later.  As the 104th Congress began its hearings and Special Counsel Starr took over the investigation, gradually the story began to achieve its acceptance.  Seper continued his work. The editorial page added its perspective for readers of the new National Weekly edition and for Insight magazine.  Talk radio and NET continued to take calls.<P>
Finally Starr's work produced its first indictments  former business partners of the First Lady, Susan and James McDougal, and the Governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker. Conventional wisdom said the Governor and Susan McDougal would win acquittals partly because the Little Rock jury had not been sequestered and names of the jurists were published in the local papers.  Yet, Starr's efforts prevailed and the jury convicted each of the defendants.  Thus, Whitewater became "cool."<P>
Today Whitewater and its cousins, "Filegate" and "Travelgate," have become the story of the year.  Today a pool of reporters have jumped into the cool current of Whitewater.  They go to bed with visions of Pulitzer dancing in their heads. Few may realize they have a story built on the foundation of work quietly produced by the likes of Jerry Seper. To the readers of the Washington Times, the listeners of talk radio, and the viewers of NET, Whitewater was always a story.  We were Whitewater when Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>

<h2>Conventions Losing Their Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>

<P>A few parting thoughts about the Republican convention in San Diego.<P>
First, we will never know if my VP prediction would have come true. I had Bob Dole picking Gov. George Voinovich of Ohio as his running mate, but Voinovich took himself out of the running before the convention ever started. He told me privately that "no one with a last name like mine would ever get selected as a nominee of this party," a reference to his Eastern European roots. Be that as it may, Voinovich was a Catholic from a large Midwestern industrial state and might have helped Dole there. But I admit that Dole got a great deal more from his actual choice. Jack Kemp has fused the Dole campaign and Dole himself with energy and that is something that Voinovich would not have done as well. Moreover, Kemp is able to communicate with lots of voters Dole had virtually no chance of getting. To the extent that Vice Presidential picks ever help their Presidential nominees, this one certainly did and Dole has to be given an A for imagination and surprise on his choice.<P>
The convention itself was another matter. Having participated in one way or another in eight other Republican conventions since 1960, this was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a real convention. It was a four-day glorified infomercial. To be fair, the Democrats started that trend with the convention they produced in 1992 which bore little relationship to the delegates in attendance but was calculated to recast Bill Clinton as a New Democrat. They succeeded and Republicans got the picture.<P>
The delegates themselves had nothing to say about this convention. Every word, every image, even the demonstrations were scripted. To be sure there was a certain amount of scripting which occurred at every convention in the modern era. But the control of this convention was breathtaking. Members of the Politburo would have been proud. Next week we will have the Democratic version of the same scripted orchestration.<P>
The institution of the political convention cannot endure this level of contrivance for very long. Delegates who go to the trouble of getting themselves elected, based on representing grassroots networks of followers, are simply not going to tolerate paying all of that money to become a delegate only to be told they count for nothing and can't even cast the vote for which they were elected in the first place.
No, what we witnessed in San Diego and what we will witness in Chicago is not a political convention. I've been to enough of them to know the difference. What we witnessed was a grand scale TV production, in the case of San Diego, run by Mike Deaver, the Ronald Reagan image maker who later went to federal prison for improper lobbying. The irony is that most people did not watch this television spectacular. The Democrats are now worried that even fewer people will watch theirs. Except for the question of how Hillary's speech will match Elizabeth Dole's, there is really nothing interesting likely to take place there. So for all of their efforts to put on a good TV show, and it was that, the convention handlers did not achieve what a real convention, with some drama, conflict and good old fashioned political battles would have done. It did not produce an audience.<P>
With major media outlets already saying enough is enough, the era of this sort of political convention is about over. For my money good riddance. If the price of a party getting its message out is to deprive the delegates of their freedom to act as delegates, then this kind of convention is not worth having. Haley Barbour, Republican National Chairman, is busy congratulating himself on a flawless convention. I hope he has fond memories. It will probably be the last of its kind.<P>
Thanks to the many of you who called us, wrote us, E-mailed us or faxed us on our convention coverage. Our crew in San Diego, led by Peter Estrada and Greg Jenkins, worked incredibly hard. They drove themselves to the point of exhaustion. While others were out partying, the NET crew was still working. We had to. We did with less than 20 people what the major networks did with 500. We appreciate many of you saying that our coverage was better than theirs.<P>
As to Bill Lind's commentaries which some of you disliked, I asked Bill to write about this convention the way that the late H.L. Menken wrote about politics in the earlier part of this Century from his headquarters at the Baltimore Sun. Lind did just that, and he made some people angry in the process. Well stay tuned. He is going to write about the Democratic convention as well.<P>

<h2>Disney's Moral Whitewash</h2>
<P>

Awhile back the Southern Baptist convention passed a resolution at their annual convention of Messengers calling on their members to boycott Walt Disney theme parks, movies and merchandise.<P>
Granted the Southern Baptists cant control what their members do and many of them are not likely to go along with the boycott; still it is an uncomfortable position for Disney to be in with the largest Protestant denomination in the United States telling its membership to stay away from Disney properties.<P>
The Southern Baptists were protesting not only the Disney decision, as a corporation, to grant benefits to homosexual partnerships but also recent Disney distributed films.  For example, last year Disney released "the Priest," a movie which portrayed a homosexual clergyman sympathetically. Indeed, even what are supposed to be classic style Disney movies such as "the Lion King" and the "Hunchback of Notre Dame" are now filled with sexual references. Reviewers are even suggesting that "Hunchback" is not an appropriate movie for children. Michael Eisner and company have taken the Disney company a long way from its pro family roots. No wonder the Disney theme parks now sport a Gay and Lesbian pride day with special discounts for public displays of such behavior.<P>
So to the rescue comes Father Leo ODonovan, the President of Georgetown University, one of the most venerable Catholic institutions in the nation. He has just been elected to a two year term on the Disney board. Father ODonovan can be expected to uphold traditional Judeo Christian moral values, right? ODonovan is Eisners market response to the move by the Southern Baptists, right?<P>
Well, think again. ODonovan is to traditional Catholics what John Chaffee is to traditional Republicans. ODonovan is a liberal Catholic. He has been elected to the board not to make the Disney company sensitive to traditional morality but to give Eisner cover. Already he has defended the Disney decision to grant benefits to homosexual couples as standard industry practice and he has defended the Disney distribution of the movie "the Priest." ODonovan says that a company or an individual cant be judged by "a single act or production, or wed never lead lives or have businesses."<P>
Are you surprised? Im not. Georgetown has its own Gay pride activities with the full blessing of ODonovan. Indeed ODonovan has done his best to remove what little vestiges of the Catholic faith remained at Georgetown.<P>
Soon after he became President six years ago, ODonovan showed up here at a dinner party I had to discuss our pioneer television efforts. I say showed up because I hadnt invited him. He came as the uninvited guest of someone we did ask to come. It was clear ten minutes into our conversation that he was a liberal who will defend just about anything on the liberal agenda.<P>
Eisner was not bowing to market pressure from the Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights which has similarly blasted Disney. Eisner was looking for someone with credentials who could defend the company and give a thumbs up for its immoral practices. Well since Notre Dames former President Theodore Hesburgh is too busy serving on Bill Clintons legal defense fund board, I guess ODonovan was the next best thing. Besides, Hesburgh is well known as a liberal. ODonovan isnt, so he will be more useful to Eisner.<P>
No, if Disney is serious about wanting some moral input, I am sure Dr. James Dobson, or the Presbyterian intellectual D. James Kennedy or one of the many former Presidents of the Southern Baptists would be available. Or if Disney really does want the genuine Catholic point of view, I suggest Cardinal OConnor of New York or Cardinal Law of Boston.<P>
What Disney needs is someone on its board who will represent the point of view of parents to the company and not the other way around. Eisner is clever.  Appointing ODonovan is a good public relations move. But the Southern Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights are still correct. What Disney is producing these days is a disgrace. The company should be boycotted. Real economic pressure will force real change. The ODonovan appointment, far from a bow to the traditional values community, represents business as usual.<P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 7, 1997
</h3> <h2>Rethinking Diplomatic Immunity</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> A sort of
international drama has been playing out in both Washington and New York over the
long-debated question of diplomatic immunity.<dd>

In Washington, a 16-year-old girl, Joviane Waltrick, was killed in a tragic traffic accident
caused by an apparently intoxicated diplomat from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. The
United States has formally asked the nation of Georgia to lift diplomatic immunity and
permit the young Georgian diplomat to be tried on a change of negligent homicide here in the
United States.<dd>

Meanwhile in New York City, two diplomats from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus got
involved in a brawl with New York City police after the police tried to arrest them for a
traffic violation. Officials from Belarus charge that the police engaged in brutality and
broke the arm of one of the diplomats in the process. New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said
the diplomats were drunk and disorderly and moreover didn't pay their parking ticket. He has
now suggested that such members of the diplomatic community ought to go back to where they
came from and has ordered his police to begin towing their cars the same way cars of
ordinary citizens get towed if they violate parking regulations. The Russians, for example,
have 14,437 summonses for 222 cars stationed in New York, primarily at the United Nations,
which they have yet to pay.<dd>

Back in Washington, the U.S. State Department was on the defensive arguing that diplomatic
immunity needs to continue. In answer to the questions of angry reporters, the State
Department could not point to a single instance where diplomatic immunity has been waived by
a nation after a serious crime was committed. In most instances, such diplomats are simply
sent back to their native land.<dd>

It should be understood that the idea of diplomatic immunity was pushed by the United States
in the first place. It was this nation which insisted on most of the treaties or
understandings in this regard which are currently in effect. This is because the United
States was afraid, and rightly so, that its citizens could  break some unknown law in a
foreign country and thus be subject to punishment for such infractions according to local
practices. In the former Soviet Union, it was easy to break their laws. Many were made up
along the way, according to circumstance. Infractions there could well have caused Americans
to have been put to death or to have suffered long incarcerations in Soviet prisons. Right
now, in this age, it is unlawful in Saudi Arabia to attend a Roman Catholic Mass, for
example. A diplomat who simply wanted to exercise freedom of religion as he knows it in this
country could actually be put to death for doing so.<dd>

So there are valid reasons that the practice of diplomatic immunity was pushed by this
nation. And our diplomats will continue to need this sort of protection since rights which
we take for granted here are not guaranteed in most of the other nations of this world.<dd>

On the other hand, it seems to me that the negotiation of new agreements is in order. The
idea of diplomatic immunity was meant to protect citizens from arbitrary punishment for
violating unknown or obscure laws or laws which contradict practices which are commonly
accepted in the United States. Driving while drunk and thus endangering the lives of others,
it seems to me, is not acceptable in any nation. Without endangering the concept of immunity
which still has its utility, we need to see if we can't come up with agreements on such
issues which have the same meaning in all nations.<dd>

Georgian President Edward Shevrednadze has hinted that his government might consider waiving
diplomatic immunity in the case of his diplomat. If he does, that would set an excellent
example. But such a precedent is not good enough.<dd>

If we as a nation are capable of negotiating the fine points of peace between the Israelis
and the Palestinians, if we are capable of coming up with agreements for Northern Ireland or
Bosnia, surely we can do better than the present situation.<dd>

The Congress should mandate that the State Department form an immediate task force charged
with the responsibility of making recommendations on new agreements covering situations such
as the death of Joviane Waltrick or even Mayor Giuliani's complaints.<dd>

If our diplomats abroad drive while intoxicated and kill local residents of some nation,
they ought to suffer the appropriate local consequences. Issues like this have little to do
with the notion of protecting diplomats from arbitrary and capricious rules and laws which
are meant to entrap foreigners. I know I am talking about the State Department here, but
let's get down to some common sense. <P>

<h2>The Communists are Going to Lose
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>



It appears to me that the Communists are about to lose the elections in   

Russia.  I say this because I have watched elections in which they have   

participated in for over 35 years.  Absolutely every time they think they   

are going to lose they begin to complain that the election process is   

rigged with fraud ahead of time.  Well that is happening now with a   

vengeance as the Communists hope to discredit any victory by Russian   

President Boris Yeltsin.<P>

Yeltsin, for his part, has been running very tough television commercials   

narrated by famous Russian actors calling to mind the days of terror   

inflicted on the Russian people by Stalin, the times of famine due to the   

Communist system, the lack of freedom to travel and worship and so on.<P>   

The pro Yeltsin narrators say of Gennady Zuganov, the Communist candidate   

for President, that the Communists now claim that they are different than   

those of old but, in fact, they are not. These American style television   

commercials have a point. While Zuganov tones down his views when he is   

speaking to Western reporters, out on the hustings when speaking to the   

party faithful he doesn't hesitate to invoke the name of Stalin and he   

makes no apologies for the Communist era which he said brought Russians   

stability.<P>

One aspect of the Russian campaign which has interesting implications is   

the effort by Boris Yeltsin's newfound electoral partner Alexander Lebed   

to denounce aspects of Western culture.  Since the fall of the Soviet   

Union in l99l, Russia has been invaded by American soap operas, American   

pornographic magazines, American R and X rated movies, American punk   

fashions and contemporary American morals.  Lebed, while somewhat friendly   

to the West politically, has denounced this trashy Western influence on   

the Russian culture and has promised that , if continued in power, he   

will do his best to rid the nation of such corrupting elements.  Lebed   

placed a strong third in the first round of the Russian elections and   

Yeltsin hired him as his security chief the next day.  Lebed has been more   

visible than Yeltsin this past week as the campaign heads to July 3rd for   

the final round.<P>

It will be interesting to see if the Russian voters respond to Lebed's   

promise to rid Russia of the degrading aspects of Western culture.  If   

they do, American politicians might take note.  While this country would   

not respond well to the authoritarian suggestions of Lebed, I think the   

climate is right for a political figure to finally have the courage to   

say "enough is enough" when it comes to the ever degrading television   

shows, movies and printed material that constantly flows forth these   

days.  There are still enough people who adhere to the Judeo Christian   

moral structure in this country to make a mighty difference if any   

credible political figure would tell them what they are anxiously waiting   

to hear. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Friday, January 10, 1997
</h3> <h2>Excluded from the White House List</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> I'm really
bummed! I mean here I and my co-conspirators -- I mean colleagues -- here at NET have spent
more than three long years trying to make the White House' top-ten "right-wing nut-cases"
chart and we didn't cut it! What's a CEO to do?  All of those millions of Dollars wasted.<p>

And to think that all of the scandals the Clinton Administration has been involved in are
the result of one meddling millionaire named Dick Scaife.  Now, I've received money from
Scaife to be sure, but apparently I'm not high enough in the conspiracy structure to have
received his orders.  I feel offended.  Scaife and I have been friends for some 25 years
now, and after all these years, he didn't even let me in on the conspiracy.  It just shows
you can't trust even friends anymore.  I mean, don't I deserve just one little directive
from him demanding that we cover some totally concocted story against Bill Clinton and the
Democrats?  What's the matter with us?<p>

I mean, I realize I was born on the wrong side of the tracks, so maybe it's a class thing. 
You see, I thought I had a real in with Scaife.  You see, just between us, the truth is that
the two of us belong to an elite group of unique people who love electric streetcars.  Now,
on that basis alone you would think he would have at least given me a plain brown envelope
with a hint of what new charge I should make up against Clinton. But no, apparently, at
least according to the White House, Dick Scaife prefers to send all of his orders to the
American Spectator.  Well, I don't mind admitting it.  I'm jealous.<p>

Not only does Bob Tyrrell apparently have an in with my trolley jolly friend Scaife, but
apparently he spends all of his time feeding his totally made up stories about Clinton's
scandals to the Internet.  Boy, that's a surprise.  You see I sort of thought of Tyrrell as
a classy playboy.  I mean I always see him at parties with some good looking chick on his
arm.  Now I learn this is all a facade.  Secretly, in the middle of the night, Tyrrell was
really not having a fun time.  He was obviously creating new web sites so the likes of the
Wall Street Journal and the Washington Times could get their biased and slanted information
on Clinton without so much of a trace of a phone call between them.<p>

But then, the plot really gets clever. It is really amazing that London tabloids pick up all
of this stuff and give it legitimacy over here by printing it in their papers over in the UK
so that Congressional Republicans will immediately call hearings on these totally made up
scandals  scandals like Whitewater and Travelgate and Troopergate and the Democratic party
money laundering scam and who knows what else.<p>

Come to think of it, now I understand why Al D'Amato, Jim Leach and Bill Clinger kept
yelling at their staffs "where is my latest London tabloid?"  You, see it is finally making
sense.  And this guy Scaife is really good.  I mean to have all that control over the
Congress, just to get them to investigate phony, made up stories on Clinton so that the
Washington Post and the New York Times would be forced to cover the stories. And these are
the same papers Scaife and his friends have always criticized as biased and slanted! Imagine
the cleverness of making establishment newspapers the unwitting fellow-travelers of this
incredible conspiracy.  Wow!  That's impressive.<p>

I'm still ticked at Scaife, though, for keeping me in the dark.  Twenty-five years and not a
hint of any of this.  I mean a quarter of a century and not one demand that I do anything
for his money.  Maybe he doesn't like Greek Catholics.  Well, now that I know how this one
guy in Pittsburgh controls the media worldwide.  I know one thing: forget Rupert Murdoch. 
Nix on Katherine Graham and her ilk.  Heck, don't even mention Disney.  When it comes to
media empires that really matter, I know all of my spare money is going to buy stock in the
Pittsburgh Tribune Review.<p>

Still and all, I can't help but think that I've heard this whole plot before, some time ago.
 Come to think of it, it was another President who had this theory about a big media
conspiracy.  What was his name again?  Surely you remember.  A medium-sized fellow with his
hands always flung in the air giving the victory sign.  Come on, help me out.  His last name
began with an "N."  Let's see Richard Milhous Nut-case?  No, that wasn't it.  Well, anyway,
you know who I mean. <P>

<h2>
"FDA Commissioners Arrogance"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
I have spoken before of the arrogance of the federal Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, in its constant effort to seize more power for itself. Further evidence of that arrogance just keeps on building. <P>
The Washington Legal Foundation has filed a First Amendment lawsuit against the FDA, challenging the agencys crackdown on the dissemination of information regarding the "off label" uses of FDA approved drugs and medical devices. The Washington Legal Foundation lawsuit contends that the FDAs restrictions violate the First Amendment rights of both the providers and the recipients of such information. <P>
Federal law currently prohibits the manufacturer of an FDA approved drug or device from specifying on the product label any uses of the product other than the precise use approved by the FDA. However, doctors are free to prescribe FDA approved products for uses other than those specified by the product label. In fact, in many areas of medicine, most of the treatment recognized by the medical community consists of off label uses of FDA approved products. <P>
Recently the FDA has begun a crackdown on manufacturers who become involved, in any way, in the dissemination of information about the off label uses of their own products, such as distributing to doctors medical text books which contain information about the off label drug uses. The Washington Legal Foundation suit contends that this is a violation of the First Amendment which effects not only the producer of the product but also the recipients, first the doctor and ultimately the patient. <P>
Commissioner David Kessler of the FDA refused to appear at a scheduled deposition on April 24th. The legal foundation is trying to depose Kessler in order to, in its words, "establish that he was personally responsible for the FDA crackdown and that in directing the FDA to implement its no policy, he gave no thought to whether the crackdown might violate free speech rights." Washington Legal Foundations lawyers claim that senior FDA officials deposed to date in the lawsuit have admitted that First Amendment concerns played no role in their policy deliberations. The foundation contends that it needs to depose Kessler as well to establish that he too was oblivious to First Amendment rights in formulating agency policy.<P>
Well, Kessler was a no-show. Instead he filed a motion to quash the deposition which Federal Judge Royce Lamberth will rule on shortly. Such a move on Kesslers part is unprecedented. "It is outrageous that Commissioner Kessler thinks he is above the law and not subject to the same litigation rules as anyone else who gets involved in a lawsuit," said the Foundations Chief Legal Counsel Richard Samp. Samp pointed out that even Bill Clinton has had to give a deposition in connection with Whitewater and the First Lady has had to appear before a grand jury in connection with the White House travel office. <P>
Samp contends that Kessler said one of his top priorities as Commissioner would be to crackdown on the off label uses of FDA approved products. Never mind that people are being cured by these products. Never mind that such products are recognized as the only possible remedy in some medical cases. What the FDA seeks is total control. <P>
That attitude was reflected in a very personal letter former Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd  sent to some Members of the House. The Congresswoman from Tennessee served in the House for 20 years before retiring after the 1994 elections. Marilyn Lloyd told her former colleagues that she had undergone a mastectomy in 1991 and had chosen silicone breast implant surgery. But just before her surgery was to take place the FDA ruled that such operations could not go forward. <P>
Mrs. Lloyd contends that the FDA made this ruling with no scientific evidence that such implants were harmful. She quotes Dr. John E. Woods, vice chairman of the Department of Surgery at the Mayo Clinic as saying, "Instead of protecting the health and concerns of women, this moratorium caused undue stress and anxiety for women with implants and women who wanted them around the world." Mrs. Lloyd told the Members of Congress to whom she wrote, "I want you to understand that the irresponsible nature of the FDAs decision has led to real women  mothers, wives and daughters  dying needlessly." <P>
Again the issue here is one of control. That is what David Kessler and his agents are all about. Control over other peoples lives. <P>
There is more and more evidence that the FDA is a government agency totally out of control. This Congress owes it to the long-suffering American public to take the steps necessary to tie Commissioner Kesslers hands.  Congress must do this before more innocent people die needlessly because they are unsuspectingly caught up in one of Kesslers little power games. <P>

<h2>Justice Thomas Bests His Detractors
</h2>
<P>

<P>
<P>Three cheers to Justice Clarence Thomas for ignoring my advice. I talked to the Justice last Thursday (he is one of the three I dont want impeached) and suggested that he not appear at an awards ceremony in suburban Washington because it would give too much of a platform to his opponents. Instead, I suggested, he ought to have a special picnic for the eighth grade students at the Supreme Court where he would be  in control of the situation.
<P>You will recall that Justice Thomas was invited by students at the Pullen School to speak at an awards ceremony held at Central High School in Prince Georges County, Maryland. The students had invited him after meeting with him while on a tour of the Supreme Court where he was the only Justice to take the time to visit with them in his chambers.
<P>When school board member Kenneth Johnson heard about the invitation, he went ballistic. Johnson said he would disrupt the appearance if Thomas came to the ceremony. That led the school Superintendent to un-invite Thomas. The school board, however, overruled the Superintendent and re-invited Thomas. Thomas was silent about his intentions right up until the time of the event last night.
<P>Armstrong Williams, the host of "The Right Side" on radio and on NET, and I both talked with Thomas late last week and got the impression that he was seriously considering not making the event. I suggested that if he went, the lead story would be the protest against him and his message to the students would be lost. Thats why I recommended the alternative, which would be a special event just for the students and no one else. Thomas could have legally kept the protesters out of the court.
<P>In retrospect I am glad Thomas ignored my advice. The likes of Kenneth Johnson should not have been able to silence the Justice by promising disruption. In fact, Johnson was able to muster only 80 protesters who were confined to another part of the building. Johnson complained bitterly that because Thomas had hinted, through Armstrong Williams, that he might not come, Johnson couldnt get people to turn out. Maybe Thomas should be in charge of our military strategy as well!
<P>Thomas told the parents and children who, by the way, gave him standing ovations, "I deeply regret having brought some unwanted attention to this wonderful ceremony." In fairness, Thomas didnt cause the attention. His detractors did.
<P>Late last night, following the appearance of Thomas at the ceremony, I did a half hour segment of Armstrong Williams syndicated radio show. Just about every caller was against Thomas. Williams and I did battle with them. The party line against Thomas is that he is a hypocrite because he is the beneficiary of affirmative action programs and now he wants them eliminated. I dispute that theory. Read Justice Thomas opinions. They are among the most profound ever rendered by any Justice.
<P>I do not think Justice Thomas needed affirmative action to get where he is. I think he succeeded on his own merits. One caller insisted, "I dont want Justice Thomas as a role-model for my daughter." I asked him if he wanted Louis Farrakhan as a role model, since the same Kenneth Johnson who promised to disrupt a Thomas appearance sponsored a resolution before the Prince Georges County School Board which would have given teachers and students a day off to participate in the Million Man March. The caller said my point was irrelevant.
<P>There is something to the intensity of some of these callers and protesters which is beyond all reason. Maybe the Rev. Imogene Stewart, a  Black Washington civic activist who appeared on "The Right Side" last Friday, is on to something. She contends that while some in the black community cloak their opposition to Thomas in the rhetoric of affirmative action, what they are really angry about is that he married a white woman.
<P>Well, whatever it is, Thomas showed up his detractors. He proved to be a man of his word. He was gracious and self effacing. He gave the students good advice  such as "remember that good manners will open doors that the best education will not and cannot. Even though you may have strong feelings about matters, that does not give you license to have bad manners." Great advice. Kenneth Johnson can you hear what Justice Thomas said over the clatter of your own rhetoric?<P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Monday, January 20, 1997
</h3> <h2>Clinton's Second Term</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> William Jefferson Clinton has
now begun the term which will render a judgment of his Administration for history.  He is
the first Democrat to have begun a second elected term since FDR.  Ironically, he may be the
Democrat who presides over the beginning of the end of the welfare state which FDR left us. 
And it is even more ironic that Clinton's unending capacity to say one thing while doing the
opposite may just permit him to do so.  No Republican President would have been able to pull
it off.<p>

I have no idea what the next four years have in store for President Clinton.  He presided
over a first term during which inflation remained low, the stock market set new records, the
deficit shrunk, employment was high, and while our troops were spread far too thin, few have
come in harm's way, so far.  We all know that Presidents get and take far too much credit
for such developments, but it is fair, because had inflation tripled, the stock market
crashed, the deficit ballooned, unemployment set records, and our troops come home in body
bags, President Clinton certainly would have been blamed for all of this, whether he was
completely responsible or not.<p>

Clinton, given his record of a lifetime of close calls, may well escape Whitewater, Paula
Jones, the Lippo scandals, a recession, international disasters and anything else which can
befall a President.  Or all of his chickens could come home to roost during his second term,
much the same way Richard Nixon, after a successful first term, ended up in disgrace in his
second. Only God knows the answer, and speculation at this time is pointless.<p>

The fact is, whether we like it or not, the American people gave Bill Clinton this second
chance and he is entitled to his day of glory.  As for me, I am grateful that we live in a
nation where Clinton's opponent is given the medal of freedom instead of being put in jail. 
I thank God that opposition voices can be heard, even though those in power would have them
silenced.  That is nothing new. Just about every monarch and Prime Minister in history has
wanted to stifle opponents who had a following because of their opposition.  What is new is
that we live in a nation which, for the moment at least, has a Constitution which protects
those voices.  I appreciate the fact that we manage to carry on, often despite those who
lead us.<p>

Let us therefore rejoice in this day which the Lord has made  you who think Bill Clinton is
a great and worthy President and you who do not; you who find shame in the events of this
day and you whose heads are high  let us celebrate together.  Some will celebrate the man. 
We celebrate the idea  a fragile idea which, in many ways, defies history  that this
Republic shall continue to be a place for the brave and the free.<p>

Let us be mindful of what Pontius Pilot forgot.  All power in Heaven and on Earth comes from
above.  Neither Bill Clinton nor anyone else would have any power were it not for Almighty
God.<p>

The idea that God is still in charge, despite the frailties and foibles of our leaders, is
indeed something to celebrate this Inauguration Day, 1997. <P>

<h2>A Preview of a Union-Controlled Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<DD>The U.S. Senate should have adjourned last night, but instead it is still in session because Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Tom Harkin, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of organized labor, invoked arcane Senate rules to try to "exact one more pound of flesh for labor as we head out of here," as Majority Leader Trent Lott put it.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin wanted a certain provision dropped from the bill which funds the FAA and other agencies. This provision would have corrected what is viewed as a mistake in legislation which passed the last Congress. That mistake had the effect of making it easier for unions to organize Federal Express. Senator Fritz Hollings, one of only few Democrats not owned by the labor unions, sponsored the rider which would correct the mistake and put Federal Express back on a level playing field with everyone else.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin even caused the bill in question to be read to the Senate for hours on end. This hasn't happened in anyone's memory, but anything to please organized labor. Senator Harkin is up for re-election in Iowa and so confident of victory that he can afford to engage in such blatantly special-interest politics. By the way, 80% of Harkin's big war chest for his re-election comes from out of state, and most of that from the unions. No wonder he is doing their bidding. 
<DD>I mention this obscure moment in history because it is an illustration of things to come if the unions are successful in their quest for a change in who controls Congress. Already union bosses have a disproportionate influence over public policy way out of line for the number of people they now represent. There was a time, in the private sector, where unions had organized a third of the work force. In some states the unions were so strong that employers had to ask their permission before hiring anyone. Today union strength is at around 10% of the private sector work force and it is continuing to decline. Public sector unions are much stronger but even there big labor's grip has been loosened in some states with Republican Governors and legislatures.
<DD>The fact is that old fashioned unionism is out of step in our highly competitive society. The unions believe otherwise. Ask ValuJet. They began flying again yesterday after a three-month shutdown following the fatal crash in the Florida Everglades. While no one wants to cut corners on safety, the shutdown ordered by the FAA is unprecedented considering the type of crash. But ValuJet is non-union and the unions wanted the airline grounded. So, the FAA obliged, shutting down ValuJet even before investigators had determined the cause. Union lawyers are still in court trying to get an injunction to once again ground ValuJet. This argument is not about safety. ValuJet, with months of non-stop inspections and a good portion of its fleet not yet up and running, is probably the safest airline in the skies right now. This argument is about unions. If ValuJet can make a go of it with its highly attractive prices, the contracts the unions have negotiated with the other airlines come under great pressure. So it appears that the unions used their friends in the Clinton Administration to ground the airline. Unfair you say? Again, just a preview of coming attractions if the unions prevail.
<DD>And it does look promising for them. They are spending huge sums of money to defeat Republican freshmen and to win open seats. Republicans, who hoarded their money until these last weeks before the elections, are still not competitive. Meanwhile, the unions have pulled out all the stops, even to the point of deliberately violating federal election law, just so they can spend more money to buy the Congress. They don't care at this point. They are confident of winning.
<DD>Unions should have been out of business in the 104th Congress, yet they forced the issue of a minimum wage increase and the Republican Congress gave in. In fact anything objectionable to the labor unions was either killed in Congress, which didn't want the fight or was vetoed by President Clinton.
<DD>If the union bosses can get that much accomplished in the Republican 104th Congress, imagine what they can do with a Congress whose majority they have bought and paid for. This should be a hot issue in this election. But, alas, the union bosses have succeeded in intimidating the Republican majority who are now afraid to take the union bosses head on.
<DD>Go ahead. Tune into C-Span 2 and watch the union bosses at work through their surrogates Kennedy and Harkin and others. Then close your eyes and imagine the next session of Congress when these people could well be in the driver's seat. If that isn't enough to motivate you to get active in the electoral process, I don't know what will.

<h2>
Phony Jurist Takes Reporters for a Ride
</h2>
<P>
<P>On Friday morning I was driving to the NET offices when ABC radio news, at 9 a.m. Eastern, broadcast that one of the jurors in the Whitewater case in Little Rock had said she had read about the defendants before the trial and had a negative impression of them. What happened at the trial confirmed that view.<P>
I was stunned. If that statement were true, it meant big time trouble for prosecutor Ken Starr. Subsequently I heard the same story on another radio network and on CNN. I asked a couple of attorneys for their opinion and they told me that if such a juror had indeed come forward, it meant that the defense had solid grounds to get the convictions overturned.<P>
As viewers of "Paul Talk" know, we discussed this story on the show. Others had heard the same story and called in to ask questions. One viewer raised the possibility that perhaps this had been a planted juror  not an unreasonable suggestion under the circumstances. As I answered the questions I was thinking that the Clintons must be the luckiest people on the face of the earth and such a development, if true, could effect the plans of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to move forward on other cases.<P>
Friday night I was preoccupied with the wedding rehearsal dinner of my son, Steve, so I really didnt  pay close attention to newscasts, although I did hear one or two. On early Saturday morning when our two Washington papers arrived, I expected to see this story on the front page. Perhaps it would be a banner headline in the Washington Post. I was puzzled when I saw nothing about it but the wedding was a few hours away and our household was preoccupied with other thoughts. Again, with the reception going on into late evening, I didnt pay much attention to newscasts.<P>
When the Sunday papers arrived and I saw nothing of this story I knew there was something wrong. The Post, as a matter of fact, ran a four page spread, not including the beginning of the story on page one, to the effect that Hillary Clinton may now be in real trouble because her public statements do not match the facts in the Whitewater case. I dont remember pages of coverage like this in the Post since Watergate.<P>
In any case, I began to search for the story of what happened to the juror. I listened to radio newscasts. I heard nothing. Finally, after church and before leaving home for a graduation party, there was the story on CNNs Headline News, almost all the way through the news segment.<P>
It seems that the prejudicial statement which had been printed in the newspapers about the Whitewater trial was made not by an actual juror but by a woman of the same name as one of the jurors. The media kept hounding this woman, insisting that she was the real juror, despite her protestations that she was not. Finally, she became annoyed that they didnt believe her and she decided to go along with their demands for a statement. That was when she said what was quoted on the various newscasts which I had heard. <P>
In short, the so called mainstream media had been had. I picked up my information from them which resulted in my comments on Fridays show. I did add the caveat that my predictions would be true IF the woman had been quoted accurately. Nevertheless, I accepted as true what they had broadcast. So my apologies to all the viewers of "Direct Line" who went about their week-end thinking that the Whitewater convictions would be overturned and that even Governor Tucker might not resign the governorship of Arkansas after all.<P>
What of the responsibility of the networks, who promoted this story, to broadcast the fact that they had been had on their same newscasts? Although I was preoccupied, I did hear several newscasts on Saturday as we were going to and from the church and the reception and back home. But I heard not a word about this from the same news organizations which had made the story a big deal the day before.<P>
What of the newspapers which were giving extensive coverage to Whitewater? Why was there not a word that the electronic media had been taken? An attorney I discussed this case with at last nights graduation party told me that the real juror would probably have a good slander case against the media which broadcast information, damaging to her reputation, when they were quoting someone else. The real juror, so far as I know, has made no comment. Maybe she is busy talking to her lawyers.<P>
Someone ought to hold the broadcast news organizations accountable for what they did. That includes NET. None of us checked ourselves to determine if, in fact, a juror had made this statement before we broadcast it. It was the height of irresponsibility for them to have broadcast what they did and it was, frankly, irresponsible of me to have just repeated it without a call to Ken Starrs office to verify the story. The only thing I can say in our defense is that we dont have the huge news departments that the other networks have, and I, unfortunately, have almost no time to prepare for my show since I do this as a sideline, second to my duties as the CEO of NET as well as the CEO of the Free Congress Foundation.<P>
I hope all of us involved have learned a lesson about old fashioned journalism. Verify your story before airing it. I should not have assumed that because I had heard the story on three networks it was gospel. For that I profoundly apologize to my viewers. You deserved better. And all I can promise is that I will do my best to see that we dont repeat the same mistake again. Thats all for Direct Line for tonight.<P>

<h2>Absent Shame, Morris Profits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>




<P>In the latest chapter involving former Presidential advisor Dick Morris, it now seems that he is about to become a TV talk show host and will be paid a huge talent fee for doing so.
This comes after his $2 million deal with a publisher in which Morris has agreed to write a book about his exciting year and a half with Bill Clinton.<P>
The more sordid the details which emerge about this whole affair, the greater the profit for Dick Morris. And that says all you need to know about the wretched state of things in contemporary America.
When the story first broke about Morris during the Democratic convention and he was forced to resign, who was it that called him from their campaign bus to offer sympathy? Why President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. As one observer noted, it was as if Morris had been injured in a car accident. Not since that day has Bill Clinton or the prematurely canonized Al Gore ever said a single word to the effect that they disapprove of what Dick Morris did. We know Clinton and Gore think it is terrible that the prostitute was disloyal. We know they think it is terrible that the rest of the media published her tabloid account. What the American people have not heard from the President and Vice President are words to the effect that "we are sickened by what has been done here and we think Dick Morris should be ashamed of himself."<P>
No, indeed. In the past, political figures who had done far less were sent into exile for years. But Morris didn't have to endure even a day of shame for what happened. Not even from his wife. I am all for forgiveness and I don't like to see any marriage break up for any reason. My initial reaction when I heard the Morris story was to extend sympathy to Mrs. Morris whom I regarded as the real victim. But I should not have bothered. She didn't need my sympathy. She was too busy posing for the front cover of Time Magazine. By that gesture not only did she tell her husband that such behavior was acceptable, but by implication she was critical of any other wife who would have suffered extreme humiliation over what happened. She said she didn't want the details because she is an adult. How positively noble. She even quoted scripture saying that "let he who is without sin cast the first stone". It is comforting to know, I suppose, that anything from the scriptures has penetrated the consciousness of those two. <P>
Far from suffering, Dick Morris is actually better off financially from what happened than if he had simply stayed in the background and had continued to advise Clinton all the way to the election. No doubt, if Clinton is re-elected, there will be a line of future candidates at Morris' door just waiting to sign him up for all his brilliance. In fact, now even if Clinton loses, Dick Morris won't suffer. He can claim it is because he was forced to resign.<P>
It isn't just that all of this has happened that is so bad. It is the deafening silence about it from the rest of the political community. Granted Bob Dole is not in a position to say much about this, but what of the rest of his party? In their bid to show extreme tolerance, the Republicans have contributed to this dreadful situation by failing to proclaim that what Morris did is just plain wrong. The most we heard from the Republican camp was a bit of chortling because the incident caused Bill Clinton problems. That even stopped abruptly when the media pointed out that Morris had worked for Trent Lott and Jesse Helms among others. <P>
In the Old Testament God sent a plague of snakes to bite the Israelites just because they complained that they were sick of  eating the Manna from Heaven which the Lord had provided. God punished their audacity.<P>
What will it take to punish ours?<P> 
It is true that all through the history of humanity, from the Garden of Eden on, God's laws have been broken by mankind . But I guess one would have to go back to Sodom and Gomorra to find a time when people flaunted their immorality as much as they do today. Of course, God destroyed those cities.
Must we tempt God to do the same here by completely destroying the sense of shame in this nation?<P>

Political Correctness and the Media
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>On the show "Ways and Means" Tuesday night, my colleague Bob Siegrist and I had as one of our guests Mr. Roderick Conrad of Project 21, the black conservative group. We were discussing the brutal attack by Congressman Clay of Missouri, the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, on the just defeated black Republican Congressman Gary Franks. We asked Mr. Conrad twice what was driving political correctness in the black community and twice he replied, "the media" - an interesting answer.
<dd>Both Siegrist and I have been around long enough to have witnessed the profound change which has taken place in media circles which makes Mr. Conrad's answer the correct one. Mind you, most who populated the media were always liberal. But despite that they played by certain rules.
<dd>Siegrist's reporting career dates to the late 1930's, and mine to the late 1950's. Siegrist was once the celebrated prodigy of the powerful WGN radio in Chicago. Both of us worked for the Milwaukee Sentinel a decade apart. He wrote editorials. I covered local politics. About 31 years ago, I worked for Bob Siegrist as an editorial assistant. At the time, Siegrist had put together his own radio network to carry a daily commentary show. (Yes, Rush Limbaugh wasn't the first in the nation to do so). I was hired by Siegrist because he knew I generally agreed with his point of view. But I found out all too quickly that when it came to the copy I wrote for his show every day, he could have cared less about my opinion. He wanted facts. If I couldn't back up every word I wrote with cold hard data, I was in big trouble.
<dd>I mention all of this because even in this case, when I was hired because I had a point of view, I was expected to put that aside to help Siegrist deliver accurate information. When I was working for the Milwaukee Sentinel during the Goldwater campaign of 1964, the management made it clear that I was not to cover the campaign because of my political passion for the then Senator from Arizona. I sat across from Cy Rice, who did cover the campaign, and even though I heard his interviews and what he said privately afterwards, I never knew his political views and readers couldn't tell either.
<dd>That is the way it was back then and the way lots of people still think it is now. As recently as 1984, I received from one of the major daily papers in San Francisco an unsolicited letter of apology after running a tough piece written by one of its reporters. The reporter had soundly trashed a pro-family conference we were running there just prior to the Democratic convention of that year. The reporter turned out to be a homosexual activist who hated what we stood for. In the letter of apology, the paper's managing editor said he had not understood this when he assigned the reporter to cover us, and when he found out he removed the reporter from that assignment. The managing editor assured me we would receive fair treatment from there on out. We did.
<dd>That would not happen today. Whereas back then if editors found out you were involved with one group or the other, if they didn't fire you for such activity, they made it clear that you could not cover the activities of such a group. At the time I was an active journalist, black reporters  were not assigned to cover the civil rights movement precisely because editors felt they had an emotional stake in the coverage.
<dd>It is exactly the opposite today. Today homosexual reporters are deliberately assigned to cover the recent court decision on same sex marriages in Hawaii on the grounds that only they understand the feelings of that community and thus can give the correct picture of the impact of that decision. Black reporters cover the civil rights movement. That accounts for the astounding statement by Mr. Conrad that his organization, Project 21, which is the leading organization of black conservatives in the country, had yet to receive a single call from the national media asking for reaction to Congressman Clay's assertion that Congressman Franks had sold out his race because he didn't follow the liberal line. In today's media, if you are not a liberal woman, the assumption is that you cannot possibly comprehend the women's movement, so mostly radical feminist women today write about the so-called women's movement. That's why the white reporter for the Washington Times was told by the black principal and students at a Washington, DC, school to get her "white ass"  --  forgive the direct quote  --  out of the school. You see, in today's media no white person can possibly write accurately about the conditions of the oppressed blacks. Anyway, you get the picture.
<dd>Well, then, hearing all of this, you may think that things probably balance out because these same media outlets hire conservatives to cover the conservative movement and born again Christians to cover evangelicals. Wrong. That doesn't happen because from today's media perspective, what is happening in those movements is largely irrelevant. We are in what the New York Times has labeled "the post Christian era." As to conservatives and Republicans, even the back-to-back Republican control of Congress for the first time in 68 years is looked on as a temporary aberration on the inevitable road to resurgent liberalism, so why bother.
<dd>Siegrist and I were always a minority in our chosen profession. But it didn't matter as much then. True, it did effect what stories were covered. But once a decision was made to cover a story, even liberal reporters felt some obligation to cover the facts without getting caught up in the insider feelings of the moment.
<dd>No, what you are getting today, which passes for news and factual information, is beyond bias. It is a reflection of the agenda of those who are doing the reporting. That is why, more than ever, you need NET. We have an agenda too. But it isn't partisan. It is called telling the truth. Three years ago when we started NET, I was asked by Stone Phillips of NBC who was going to provide the balance in NET's coverage. I replied that we are the balance, and I said "we need a whole network just to balance out Bryant Gumbel." I haven't been back on the "Today" show since. That's just fine. I stand by my statement.

<h2>Remaining Undecided Races</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>It has been a week since the voters have spoken but throughout the nation not all of the races have been settled yet.
<dd>Oregon supposedly adopted the most modern election system of all with its vote-by-mail operation. In the special election to replace the ousted Senator Bob Packwood, voters could cast their ballots over a three-week period. Well, that system wasn't in effect for this election, but the voters thought it was anyway. So over a third of the state's voters asked for and received absentee ballots. Come election night, officials could declare no winner in the contest to succeed retiring Senator Mark Hatfield. It took until last Friday night to determine that State Senate President Gordon Smith had won the election. Rep. Jim Bunn of Oregon had to wait still another day to find out he had lost his election.
<dd>Meanwhile in California, Rep. Bob Dornan has been hanging on by the skin of his teeth to the 233-vote margin he had on election night. Counting of absentee ballots is proceeding but election officials said they won't release the final results until tomorrow. Why on earth must it take over a week to count absentee ballots? Dornan now thinks there may have been tampering with these same ballots. He is toying with possibly seeking an injunction to keep the election records intact.
<dd>Up the coast in Washington state, not only the networks but also both parties have pronounced Rep. Linda Smith defeated in her re-election bid. The only problem with that is Smith is now leading as officials count the absentee vote. Her office contends there is no way she will lose the election. Meanwhile, in another Washington state district, Rep. Jack Metcalf, who was also pronounced as defeated by everyone, has narrowed the numbers between him and his opponent. If the that trend continues, there is some chance that he, too, could rise from the political dead.
<dd>Down in Louisiana, the canvass of all the precincts shows that Mary Landrieu has defeated State Rep. Woody Jenkins by 5,800 votes out of 1.7 million cast. However, Jenkins is morally certain that more than 5,800 fraudulent votes have been cast in that election. Proving it may be another problem. In Louisiana you sign a document when you register to vote and you sign another document when you actually show up to vote. If there is fraud, a comparison of signatures should do the job. Except that the Motor Voter law, on which Republicans acquiesced to President Clinton, makes those original signature cards, which used to be public documents, private documents. It now takes a court order to permit the Jenkins campaign to inspect the cards and there is no guarantee that the federal court will permit him to do so. If he fails in that attempt, he can ask the United States Senate to examine the election, but that would be unprecedented.
<dd>In Pennsylvania the recount is underway in the district where Rep. Jon Fox has held a 10-vote lead since election day. No one is alleging any fraud in that election. It was just an uncommonly close contest. Likewise, Rep. Peter Torkildsen of Massachusetts is hoping a recount will reverse his paper-thin defeat in that state's Democratic landslide. In these two races, the delay in the final results is justified because the results on election day were about evenly divided. But out on the West Coast, the delays in reporting the results are indefensible. In all three states where I have lived, absentee votes are counted on election day itself and simply added to the total, precinct by precinct. That way both candidates and voters know the results when the totals are reported. True, an election here or there can be so close that a recount must take place before a winner is certified. That happened in the Virginia Senate race of 1978 when John Warner finally emerged the winner by 4,000 some votes. But at least the preliminary totals were known on election night itself. This is all a matter of state regulation and it seems to me those West Coast states would do well to get with the rest of the nation in the way they count their ballots.
<dd>What has happened in Louisiana, however, is quite distinct from the other contests. The Jenkins campaign has been gathering evidence that gambling interests, which had several ballot propositions at stake in that election, spent money illegally to bus voters to the polls, which is not permitted by Louisiana law. Moreover these same gambling interests distributed ballots to those they recruited to vote. The ballots had Mary Landrieu's name on them, which is a likely violation of the law forbidding corporations to participate in federal elections. Jenkins has been an outspoken opponent of gambling in Louisiana. The most outrageous aspect of all of this is the open invitation to fraud which the Motor Voter law has brought about by not making the original registration signature cards available for public inspection. Former Congressman Rick Tonry was elected in that state in the 1970's when corrupt precinct officials added to the tally many of those who had registered but had not shown up to cast their ballots. When the voting records were examined, Congress vacated the seat and ran a new election and Congressman Bob Livingston was the victor of an honest count. In a state with that sort of history, cheating on elections should be made more difficult, not shielded by federal law. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of that cliffhanger, the law there must be changed to make the sort of outcome we are now dealing with in Louisiana impossible to ever happen again.
<dd>If in this day and age elections can still be stolen with ease, then our system of government isn't safe. Who is to say how many Senate votes decided by a margin of one would go the other way if an election had been honest instead of corrupt. The whole nation has a stake in the outcome in Louisiana.

<h2>
Clinton's Difficult Choice
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Poor Janet Reno. She can't win no matter what she does. Just a few days ago, the Republicans were singing the praises of the Attorney General calling her "honest and independent". That was because close aides of the President had been all over town telling anyone who would listen in the media that the President wanted to dump Miss Reno because she had been too willing to apply the independent counsel statute. Four times she had invoked that procedure regarding Clinton Administration officials and so there are that many high level investigations going on at the present moment.
<dd>The White House was especially concerned that the Attorney General would invoke the independent counsel statute in the matter of the foreign fund-raising practices of the Democrats, which became an issue in the final days of the 1996 campaign.
<dd>Well, whether the threat to her job was enough to get her attention, or whatever the reason, and at this point the lady deserves the benefit of the doubt, Janet Reno declined to invoke the independent counsel statute in the Democratic party fund-raising case. In her reply to Senator John McCain of Arizona, signed by a Deputy Attorney General, Janet Reno said one thing which is absolutely true and another which is highly questionable. First, she said that the statute itself was not designed to cover issues involving a political party, which is a private organization. True enough. But then the Attorney General went on to say that there is no evidence that either the President or Vice President has been improperly involved in the case (which, if true, would trigger the statute) and thus the investigation will be handled internally by the Justice Department and not by an independent counsel. But that statement misses the whole point.
<dd>We don't know what the role of the President and Vice President was in this episode. True, they both have denied any wrong doing. Richard Nixon also assured us he wasn't a crook. But it is essential to understand just what sort of influence foreign money paid in determining our government's policies. While Al Gore says he had no idea that a fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple handled illegal contributions, (including several $5,000 contributions from Buddhist nuns who had taken a vow of poverty), the really suspicious activities involve the President himself. He met several times with Democratic fund-raiser John Huang, formerly with the powerful Indonesian conglomerate known as the Lippo group. In at least one case, U.S. policy toward Indonesia changed following one of those meetings. Maybe that was all just coincidence, but that, at least, is one huge question mark hanging over this matter.
<dd>So Senator McCain, (who had written Reno to ask her to invoke the independent counsel statute) and Majority Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma, have both suggested that in view of Reno's decision, the Republican majority in Congress will just have to hold hearings on Democratic fundraising. That is entirely appropriate under the circumstances, because those hearings will put pressure on the internal unit at the Department to Justice to make its investigation honest.
<dd>Attorney General Reno did say that if the internal investigation warranted it, an independent counsel could always be appointed later. Maybe after the President reassures her that she will be retained during her second term she will feel more liberated to act.
<dd>The issue, in any case, is not going away. Now the Attorney General has earned harsh words from the same folks who had been lauding her  just days ago. It remains to be seen, however, if the White House aides who had been trashing her will now feel she has demonstrated sufficient loyalty to the President to be kept on the job. Bill Clinton has a big problem regarding Janet Reno. If he fires her, he will suffer great political damage because the assumption will be that she got the axe because she was too anxious to see his Administration investigated. On the other hand, if he retains her, he does run the risk of her rediscovering her independence because she retains considerable credibility with the media and the Congress and could easily recover from this temporary setback.
<dd>Yes, poor Janet Reno. The lady is not well physically and she has problems no matter which way she elects to go. It is Bill Clinton who deserves the real pity, however. He has a problem if he fires his Attorney General and he may well have a problem if he doesn't. It is for this reason that Presidents have always looked for close friends to put in that position. Janet Reno was Bill Clinton's third choice. They hadn't even met until he made the appointment. Maybe, considering all the trouble he is in, Bill Clinton really wants a close friend in the  Attorney General's office. Too bad Vince Foster didn't live to see this day. He might well have made the ideal Attorney General for Bill Clinton.

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Monday, January 6, 1997 </h3>
<h2>Will the Supreme Court Turn Lose Dr. Death?</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> In many ways,
a nation can be judged by how it treats the weakest of its people, those unable to fend for
themselves.  No, I am not making an argument for welfare benefits here.  Much of the
government assistance which has been granted over the past many decades has made people weak
and dependent.  There government intervention is counterproductive.  I am talking here about
those who cannot speak for themselves.  The unborn constitute one such group at one end of
the spectrum.  The aged and infirm, especially those who are disabled, are at the other end
of the spectrum. <dd>

The U.S. Supreme Court, having taken away the force of law which at one time protected the
rights of the unborn, is now about to hear Glucksberg vs. the State of Washington and Vacco
vs. Quill.  These cases will determine if the Supreme Court will now find a "Constitutional"
right to die the way the Court found the "right of privacy" which led to abortion on demand.
 Also being tested is physician assisted suicide.  In other words, will the Supreme Court
turn lose Dr. Deaths, symbolized by Jack Kevorkian, in every community in the land?.  The
way this Court has shown such an utter disregard for the sacredness of life, I would not be
at all surprised to see a majority opinion affirming death at this end of the spectrum as
well. <dd>

Evan Kemp, Jr., who was Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the
Bush Administration, and who has had a disabling disease since he was 12 years old, had a
moving piece in Sunday's Washington Post op-ed section entitled, "Could you Please Die Now?"
 In it, Kemp argues forcefully against the idea that assisted suicide should be legalized,
because, he rightfully contends, disabled people like himself have the most to fear from
such an idea. <dd>

Already, some hospitals are virtually forcing patients to sign "do not resuscitate" or DNR
orders requesting that so called heroic measures not be taken to keep the patient alive in
the case of an emergency which might develop.  Kemp goes on to cite several cases which are
just a sample of things to come if the court rules the way that some us fear it will.  Joe
Ehman is a 30 year old newspaper reporter in Rochester, New York who uses a wheelchair. 
Social workers hounded the poor man to sign a DNR form when he entered the hospital in 1995
for back surgery.  He declined to do so.  But just a few hours after surgery, while he was
still half under the anesthetic, another social worker tried to again get him to sign such a
form.  He managed to let her know that he would not because he didn't want to die.  God only
knows what would have happened had Ehman not had the presence of mind to resist. <dd>

He might have suffered the fate of Marjorie Nighbert, a 76 year old Florida woman who was
hospitalized last year after a stroke.  She did sign a DNR order, so her family used that to
push the apparently willing hospital authorities to deny the lady food and water.  The
hospital medical ethics committee ruled that she was "not medically competent to ask for
such treatment."  The lady starved to death 10 days later, strapped down to her hospital bed
to prevent her from stealing food from other patient's trays.<dd>

Kemp, for whom my daughter once worked as a speech writer, has more than a casual interest
in the subject.  When he was diagnosed with a progressive neomuscular disease, doctors gave
him just two years to live.  That was 47 years ago.  He, as with so many people we have
known, beat the odds.  What if, on the basis of their original estimate of his life span,
his doctors had decided that it would be better for him to die.  That way, he wouldn't have
been such a burden to his family.  Yes, Kemp is right when he suggests that the right to die
is going to lead to health care rationing.  Once we give physicians the right to help people
who supposedly are terminally ill and want to die, it is just a very short leap to permit
these same physicians to determine that a person should die even against his will because he
would require too much medical care for too long. It is coming and coming fast. The fact
that no jury in Michigan would convict Dr. Kevorkian tells us that society has bought the
notion that we, not God, ought to determine when we die.  If we can do that for ourselves,
why not someone else?.<dd>

It is not for nothing that Evan Kemp draws an analogy between what we are seeing today and
Hitler's first attempt at killing, which was of those who had disabilities, which he did on
the basis that such people were "useless eaters" and constituted "life unworthy of life". 
When that was tolerated by the society, the mass killing of Jews was not far behind. <dd>

Kemp, despite his disabilities, will be one of hopefully thousands who will be keeping vigil
outside the Supreme Court as they hear these cases. It is an unusual coalition.   Dr. C.
Everett Koop, former Surgeon General, will be among those addressing this mass protest
because he believes that the disability community is "so threatened by physician assisted
suicide."  For once the Clinton Administration, the AMA, the Catholic Church, Orthodox Jews,
the disability community and most conservatives are all on the same side.  The ACLU, which
always claimed to speak for the less fortunate, is to be sure on the side of death.  <dd>

Many of you watching this commentary can't be there with this Coalition.  But you can write
and let the Supreme Court know what you think on the subject.  Perhaps had that been done in
1972 when oral arguments were heard on Roe vs. Wade, the nation would have been spared that
horrendous decision which has led us directly to this point.  Never make the mistake of
believing that the Court is isolated from public opinion.  Not this court anyway.  This is
one issue where all of us have a stake in letting this aging court know where we stand. 
Maybe, just maybe, considering that they may one day soon be in a position where some doctor
or family member wants them to die before their time, just maybe they will understand. <P>

<h2>
Some Freshmen Have Some Problems
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>Ive said a fair amount over the past year and a half about the freshman class of Republicans, that eager group of legislators that swept into office in the Republican landslide year of 1994. As a group they have performed well for the nation. Unfortunately, their elders for the most part were not as eager to make the changes these freshmen felt they had a mandate to make. So the overall record of the 104th Congress is disappointing to say the least, but as a group, the freshmen are not to blame for this unfortunate fact. 
<P>As I say, taken as a group, the freshmen Republicans are an impressive lot. Individually, however, some of them have problems. There is Congressman Jon Christensen of Nebraska, whose campaign centered around family values. He wasnt in office for a year when he filed for divorce and took the unusual step of forcing his wife to file an affidavit that she had been unfaithful. She now is contesting the divorce, saying she doesnt want to break up the marriage. He says it is all over. He is in one tough race for re-election. 
<P>There is, of course, the soap opera like drama of Enid and Joe Waldholtz. Joe is on his way to the federal pen and the big question is whether or not he takes Enid with him. She has already dumped Joe and has even changed her name back to Enid Green, but she wisely chose not to run for the House again. 
<P>Then there is the very strange case of Rep. Wes Cooley of Oregon. Cooley came out of nowhere to win a state senate seat in 1992. When Rep. Bob Smith unexpectedly announced his retirement in 1994, everyone and his mother got in the race for the Republican nomination for Congress. Cooley won a seven way primary with under 30% of the vote and went on to win the rural conservative district rather handily with 57% of the vote. 
<P>Cooley is as affable a person as you would want to meet. You can well imagine him operating a country store, sitting around the cracker barrel and spinning tales. The problem for Cooley is that he is a Congressman now and people take what he says for real. 
<P>Cooley already has admitted that he lied about being married to the woman he now calls his wife. It seems that if the couple wasnt married, she could still collect widows benefits from a previous marriage. But after he got elected to the state senate, Cooley thought perhaps they ought to regularize things. He had what was called an anniversary party, but it would appear that when he was said to be renewing his vows, he was, in fact, actually getting married. We dont know for sure because Cooley has gone to the extraordinary length of having the date of his marriage kept sealed by the courts. 
<P>Cooleys biggest problem stems from his claim that he served in a special unit of the military during the Korean war. He claims that the Pentagon lost all of his records. He also claims that every single person with whom he served is now dead. The unit was a secret one, he says, so he cant disclose anything about it. When asked to at least recite some recollections from his days in the service, Cooley says his memory fails him. 
<P>Cooley blames all of his troubles on the news media and left wing opponents. Now lest you think I have taken up unsubstantiated claims by a media out to get the Oregon Congressman, consider this: Coalitions for America, a lobby organization of which I am the national chairman, holds a weekly luncheon in this building which is attended by Members of Congress and various conservative and pro-family groups. Among the attendees of this luncheon from time to time has been Rep. Wes Cooley. So when the allegations against him broke, I expected that he would want to give his side of the story. <P>
Instead, Cooley said nothing. Finally I called on him and asked him if there wasnt something he wanted to tell his colleagues and philosophical allies. He said that all of the charges against him were false and made up by his enemies. I told him that if such charges were really false that we were the sort of people who would go to bat for him, we just needed to be equipped with the facts. He promised he would supply them just as he promised he would hold press briefings to refute the charges against him. No facts were produced and no such press briefings were held. <P>
Lets be perfectly candid about it. Wes Cooley is lying. Former Rep. Bob Smith, who campaigned hard for Cooley after he won his primary, now says he is embarrassed by Cooley and has called on him to step down. Cooley says he will let the voters decide. They will indeed. His Democratic opponent now has a commanding lead in a district which is solidly conservative and Republican.<P>
The fact that Enid Green and Cooley vote right is beside the point. Members of Congress need to be role models. People in the community should be able to look up to them as prototype citizens.<P>
Enid Green at least had the decency to retire, although she should have resigned from her seat because she clearly obtained it by fraud. Cooley deceived the voters of Oregon by making exaggerated claims about his service to his country, about his education, about his marital status, and who knows what else. Cooley, having just won renomination for second term, should now step down and permit the Republican party to name some one else to take his place. By the way, in his district more people voted for others on the primary ballot than those voting to renominate Cooley.<P>
This is clearly a case where "None of the Above" or NOTA is badly needed. These conservative voters should have an additional choice between Cooley and his Democratic opponent who will vote against their wishes. They ought to have the chance to vote for "None of the Above" and void the election. But since NOTA is not on the Oregon ballot, it is now up to Cooley. Former Congressman Smith says now that he has spoken out against Cooley, no doubt Cooley will label him as part of a great conspiracy against him. Thats what Cooley told us at our lunch  that a great conspiracy was out to get him. Sorry, Congressman. The only thing that is out to get you are the lies you have told, the stories you have made up, the deceptions you have concocted. If you care at all for your country, instead of just yourself, then resign.  Resign so that your district, as conservative as it is, doesnt contribute to the possibility of the Democrats re-taking the Congress. <P>
After so many years of telling so many lies, you may believe all of your own stories, Congressman. Thats fine. Retire to your ranch where no doubt the dumb animals will give you the attention you deserve.

The Independent Council
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

When Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh was busy harassing witnesses over Iran-Contra during the Reagan Administration, Democrats cheered. As Independent Counsel Ken Starr conducts his Whitewater trial in Little Rock, Republicans cheer.<P>
What of the ordinary Americans who are not part of the established political parties? Well, in my opinion, they have little to cheer about when it comes to the way the Independent Counsel system functions. It is a system out of control.<P>
In reality, Independent Counsels are accountable to no one. Lawrence Walsh spent $40 million of taxpayers money, obligating his victims to spend millions of their own money defending themselves. For this he got a couple of forced convictions which probably would not have taken place had Walsh's targets not panicked and agreed to plead guilty. The Independent Counsel, investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, went so far afield in his investigation that he even drew a rebuke from the federal judges who appointed him. <P>
I know that Republican partisans are hoping against hope that Independent Counsel Starr will get convictions in Arkansas. However, there is every indication that Governor Tucker, at least, will be found not guilty and that the Starr investigation may collapse thereafter. Meantime, Democratic Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and John Breaux of Louisiana have called on Starr to resign because of alleged conflicts of interest in his private law practice. Among the charges that these Senators and others make is that Starr represented the Bradley Foundation in a Milwaukee school choice case and the Bradley foundation has provided funds for, among other entities, NET. NET, after all, doesn't approve of much of what the Clinton Administration has done. What many think about the work of Independent Counsels depends upon whose ox is being gored.<P>
Against this background, Congressman Jay Dickey, a Democrat turned Republican from Arkansas, has introduced legislation which would require that after two years the Independent Counsel would be subject to the usual oversight process of the Congress. Such counsels would have to come to the Appropriations Committees to seek a renewal of their funding. Moreover, the Dickey legislation would require that Independent Counsels drop outside legal work while serving in that capacity.  This would prevent accusations of conflict of interest.<P>
Dickey's bill is getting a lot of favorable coverage in Arkansas because it is seen as a slap at Ken Starr. But, in fact, Dickey has made it clear that he has high regard for Starr and does not think the charges of conflict of interest against him are meritorious. Dickey is moving on a principle here. He believes, as do I, that no one should be above our system of checks and balances.
<P>Right now Independent Counsels have a blank check to spend as much as they want for as long as they wish. Their mandate is limitless so they often conduct fishing expeditions at the taxpayers expense. Those of us who believe in a rule of law know very well that our Founding Fathers would have a collective heart attack if they saw this system in operation. 
<P>Dickey's bill should be approved by this Republican Congress. The Democrats would have to vote for it. Senate Democrats certainly could not filibuster the legislation after what they have said about Ken Starr. President Clinton, thinking he will be re-elected, will eagerly sign the legislation.
Regardless of who is in power, this bill is necessary because it will end the highly dubious status of these Independent Counsels who have no accountability.
<P>Two years is enough time to pursue a valid investigation if there is substance to charges being made. In that case, an Independent Counsel will have no problem justifying his work and even a partisan Congress, under pressure from the media, will have to continue an appropriate level of funding. 
This legislation restores some badly needed balance to the system.
<P>The problem here is that some in the Republican Leadership rather enjoy seeing President Clinton and his associates twisting in the wind. They have forgotten what it was like to have Lawrence Walsh on his rampage. Now they've gotten their pay-back at the expense of Bill Clinton. But a pay-back in reverse may be coming with a vengeance if Bob Dole gets to be President. 
<P>No partisan advantage is worth the distortion to our constitutional system which the Independent Counsel system represents. This Congress should immediately pass the Dickey initiative. In fact, Dickey's bill doesn't go far enough for me. The whole system should be repealed. But since the votes aren't there to accomplish that, at least the Dickey bill is a step in the right direction. If the Republican leaders have any sense of integrity they will act on the Dickey measure forthwith. 
<P>

<h2>The September Budget Battle: Truth and Consequence </h2><p>
<h3>Pete du Pont</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
When the Congress returns from its recess after Labor Day, the battle 
of the budget will begin in earnest.   <p>
 
While the Congress has adopted a budget resolution providing for a 
balanced budget by 2002, now it must pass legislation implementing 
that budget.  Assuming the appropriations bills follow the resolution, 
and thus reduce spending, what will President Clinton do with them?  
The budget resolution Congress adopted was not subject to a 
Presidential veto, but the appropriations bills are another matter.  
President Clinton could shred the Republican budget by vetoing 
appropriations bills that include more spending cuts than he wants.   <p>
 
But the President is in a box.  The truth is his initial economic 
policy, enacted in 1993 by a single vote in each House, has failed 
badly.  One of the consequences was the election of a Republican 
Congress.  And the consequence of that is very little room for the 
President to maneuver.  <p>
 
In the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to balance the 
federal budget in 5 years.  His first budget proposed to reduce the 
deficit primarily through one of the largest tax increases in U.S. 
history.  Spending cuts in his budget were largely offset by spending 
increases elsewhere. <p>
 
So how has this liberal fiscal policy fared? <p>
 
In 1993, before the Clinton plan was enacted, the budget deficit was 
around $250 billion.  Under the latest budget projections, excluding 
proposed Republican changes, the deficit is projected to rise to $300 
billion per year by 2000. <p>
 
The economic rationale for the Clinton budget plan was that cutting 
the deficit would reduce borrowing pressures, and consequently reduce 
interest rates.  Lower rates would in turn stimulate investment and 
economic growth.  But by the end of April of this year, the prime rate 
charged by banks was 50% higher than in 1993 when the Clinton plan was 
adopted.  Other interest rates from new home mortgages to AAA 
corporate bonds and Treasury bills and bonds were all substantially 
higher as well. <p>
 
Meanwhile, the dollar has collapsed against foreign currencies.  From 
January, 1993 to June of this year, the dollar is down one-third 
against the Japanese yen, almost one-fourth against the Swiss franc, 
and one-eighth against the German mark.  As a result, all Americans 
are poorer because their dollar incomes now buy less of the world's 
goods and services.  This is in sharp contrast to the strong dollar 
policy of the Reagan administration, which led the dollar to soar to 
record levels, making all Americans richer. <p>
 
Real incomes and wages have continued to fall under Clinton's economic 
policies, a trend which started with the tax and regulation increases 
of the Bush Administration. <p>
 
Finally, economic growth has been sluggish.  With the Clinton tax 
increases, the recovery from the recession of 1990-1991 has been the 
weakest post-recession period on record.  Job growth has been half and 
real GDP growth  only about two-thirds the rate of prior recoveries.  
Indeed, in the last full quarter, the economy barely grew at all. <p>
 
Surely the President does not want to return to this sort of fiscal 
policy.  In any event, he cannot, for the Republican Congress will not 
raise taxes.  So the best the administration can do is veto a few 
appropriations bills and hope to keep government as large as he can 
for as long as he can. <p>
 
But remember that the Constitution dealt all the budget cards to the 
Congress.  If the Congress reduces funding for a department, the 
President cannot restore the spending simply by vetoing the 
legislation.  A veto ends all funding for all of the activities of  
the department, until the President signs a Congressionally approved 
bill. <p>
 
Remember, too, that at the end of the current fiscal year on September 
30, the government cannot operate if Congress has not authorized 
spending for the new fiscal year.  Congress can consequently turn off 
the government -- or parts of it -- if the President does not accept 
the Congressional budget.  In the fall, Congress will also have to 
approve an increase in the debt ceiling for deficit borrowing to 
continue, so it holds all the cards here as well. <p>
 
So the Congress leads from strength.  The only real risk is that the 
Republicans will compromise with themselves and hand the President a 
victory he otherwise could not have won. <p>
 
If the Republicans continue to reduce regulation and taxes, 
encouraging both job and real wage growth, and stay on the glide path 
to a balanced budget in seven years, the President will have little 
choice but to sign the appropriations bills and say it was all his 
idea in the first place.<p>

"Republicans Have Lost Their Vigor"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>These are dark days for the Republicans.<P>
<ul>
<LI> Speaker Newt Gingrich says his party is in a funk.
<LI> Former Cabinet Secretary Bill Bennett says that the campaign of GOP Presidential nominee Bob Dole is uninspiring and unfocused. Bennett suggests that Dole step down as Majority Leader. 
<LI> Liberal attacks on Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr have begun to take hold. The Democrats believe they can now blunt the effects of any convictions which might come out of the current Arkansas trial as well as any revelations from concurrent Senate hearings. 
<LI> Democrats in Congress unite to defeat any and all significant Republican initiatives on any legislation, leaving Bill Clinton in the driver's seat. 
<LI> The respected political analyst Charles Cook now says the Democrats have a one-in-three chance of recapturing the Congress, something which would have been unthinkable six months ago. 
<LI> Organized labor is spending huge sums of money targeting freshmen Republicans on the minimum wage through radio and TV commercials. No comparable spending is countering this from the Republican side.
<LI> Talk show host Rush Limbaugh, one of the most reliable parties supporting Republicans on the air, now says he may file for a trial separation from the Republican party because he doesn't want to be associated with people who are unwilling to stand up and fight for what they say they believe. 
<LI> All polls now show Bill Clinton leading Bob Dole by double digits. Polls also show Democrats in the lead for Congress. 
</UL>
<P>As I say, these are not happy times for Republicans. Rush Limbaugh is on to something. The problem here is not that the electorate has suddenly turned liberal. The problem is not that the so called mainstream media is more vicious than they were during the 1994 election season, for example. The problem is not that the liberals suddenly have a set of ideas which have captured the imaginations of the American people. The problem is not that times are so good that it is inevitable that the incumbent President will win. 
<P>The problem is simply this: The Republicans have lost all passion for their beliefs. A year ago, as they worked through the Contract with America, Republicans fought for their ideas with great conviction and the public was with them. They did so, it turns out, because they were dead certain that Bill Clinton would collapse from the momentum they had started. Republicans had but one battle plan: force Clinton to surrender, then declare victory and go on to the next triumph. 
<P>But Bill Clinton did not surrender. In fact, Bill Clinton rallied his troops. There seems to be a lot of passion left in those who believe in big government. The Republicans collapsed, not Bill Clinton. The Republicans began to compromise and compromise and compromise. The more they gave in, the more the Democrats united in the Senate to stop Republican initiatives. The more the initiatives died, the less the Republicans wanted to continue fighting for them. Now all the intensity is on the side of the Democrats who smell the chance to come back to power in a major way. 
<P>Republicans, meanwhile, are paying lip service to a host of good ideas in which they once insisted they really believed. These range from term limits to cutting out harmful federal programs to medical savings accounts. The problem is that there is no passion behind their rhetoric. They give their supporters little to get excited over. Compare what is happening today to the fight the Republicans waged against Bill and Hillary's health care plan in the 103rd Congress. The intensity back then was all with the Republicans. 
<P>So what happened? What happened is simply this. The mainstream media attacked the Republicans vigorously. Some among their ranks couldn't take the heat. They urged compromise. Republican leaders tried to appease this group through compromise. Democrats, upon hearing of proposed compromises, sensed weakness and decided to go for the jugular. 
<P>Then came the 1995 off-year elections. Republicans lost them. Fear and panic swept their ranks. They offered more compromise, emboldening the Democrats, who managed to get themselves together after having been badly split last year. Republicans, then, all but threw in the towel on a variety of issues, demoralizing their own troops. This, combined with a bruising Republican primary season where all the passion and excitement was with the losing candidates for President, brought us to where we are today. 
<P>Limbaugh is essentially correct. If the Republicans don't want to go all out to fight for their ideas, if they don't want to stand up and defend themselves, and if they don't want to be on the offensive instead of the defensive, then they do not deserve the blind loyalty of Limbaugh or anyone else. Defeat is not inevitable. But as any good coach knows, to win on the playing field you have to believe in your own team. If the Republicans don't believe in their own ideas enough to fight for them, then they shouldn't be surprised when people who believe in contrary ideas, no matter how wrong they may be, end up trouncing them for good. 
<P>If the Republicans keep going where they are going, they will give Limbaugh one more chance to say, "See, I told you so." 
<P>

<h2>Dornan Will be Missed</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Congressman Bob Dornan called me yesterday afternoon to say that in the absentee ballot count, he had lost his race for re-election. Dornan contends that the election was stolen from him. Boxes and boxes of illegal ballots, he says, were brought in after the polls closed and the voters they supposedly represented were never matched with the voter rolls. Dornan says these are the votes of illegal aliens and he blames the Motor Voter act for making this sort of thing possible.
<dd>Dornan told me that the Republican party, which had pledged to help him go to the wall on this race, has now abandoned him when they realized that they would have to challenge Hispanic groups in the process. Some Hispanic groups have threatened to shut down the Congress if Dornan's opponent, Loretta Sanchez isn't seated. The GOP, he said, doesn't want this sort of confrontation, even if it means losing a seat in the Congress.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be missed. I first met him in 1975 when he was a talk show host in California and I appeared on his show. Ironically, Dornan called me earlier this year when one of the radio networks had approached him with a healthy contract to do a syndicated radio talk show. He has often filled in for Rush Limbaugh. Dornan asked me for my advice on this offer. I told him he should take it, because I was convinced that he would do more good on the outside than he could do on the inside, where he was constantly clashing with the Republican leadership. He did not follow my advice but instead ran for re-election. Now he hopes the network offer is still available.
<dd>Ever since bursting on the electoral scene in 1976, Bob Dornan has been a thorn in the side of liberals. The White House, for example, was thrilled yesterday when they heard that Dornan had gone down. For years Dornan has been on Bill Clinton's back on everything from draft-dodging to baby killing. In 1992 he made more speeches than George Bush warning the nation what the election of Bill Clinton would mean. Unfortunately much of what he predicted would happen has proved to be true.
<dd>Dornan served a total of eighteen years out of the last twenty, taking off a two year stint for an unsuccessful try at the United States Senate. In 1996 he ran for President, not because he ever thought he could win, but because he felt his presence would force the other Presidential candidates to address the social issues. Dornan was wrong about that and his poor showing and prolonged absence from his district were not helpful in his re-election bid. What also didn't help Dornan or others in California was the early declaration by all the media that Bill Clinton had won the Presidency while the polls were still open out there. That caused many Republican leaning voters to skip the election. The Democrats did turn out, but participation by voters in California was at an historic low.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be most remembered for his passion on the issues of the sanctity of life and on our national defense which earned him the nickname B-1 Bob.
<dd>He was always ready for a confrontation. It was Dornan who helped to convince Pope John Paul II to issue the declaration forbidding Catholic priests to hold civil office. That forced Congressman and Catholic priest Robert Drinan to have to retire from his Congressional seat. Dornan particularly disliked Drinan's politics because he felt his fellow Roman Catholic had betrayed his faith.
<dd>It was Dornan who was willing to confront the homosexual lobby. The pro-life movement has other passionate advocates, but no one else in the entire Congress of either party is willing to take on the homosexuals. Dornan did and they were among the groups working hard for his defeat in this election.
<dd>Dornan is from the Fidel Castro school of political rhetoric. He can give a two hour speech and never notice the time. Moreover, I've been present when he has done so with the whole audience sitting on the edge of their chairs hanging on every word. He is tough to follow on the podium, I can tell you from personal experience.
<dd>Perpetually disorganized, Bob Dornan's office always looked like a scene from the movies just as the Second World War concluded. Yet he always knew exactly where everything was.
<dd>Congressman Robert Dornan is above all else a man of his convictions. In an era when pale pastels seems to be the way to get elected, Bob Dornan's colors are blinding. He distinguishes himself from most of his colleagues because he actually believes in what he says.
<dd>Bob Dornan leaves a great void in the Congress. Lots of conservatives were elected last week, but not a one of them has the sort of passion Bob Dornan represented. In that sense, he belongs to another era when politicians, without the benefit of slick television commercials, actually had to excite people. That he does. You are either for him or against him.
<dd>Bob Dornan's voice in the Congress may be silenced but I can assure you, you haven't heard the last of him yet. Some radio network will be fortunate enough to employ him and when they do, it won't be long before the nation will be talking about him the way it now talks about Rush Limbaugh.
<dd>He is one of a kind. Without him in the Congress, we need to invent someone just like Bob Dornan.

<h2>Bob Dole and His Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>It is a strange world, this world of politics. Reality seldom penetrates the consciousness of the players. Perceptions, which are often created by one's political enemies, become reality. And politicians act upon that false reality. <P>Such is the case concerning the 1992 Republican national convention in Houston.<P>On the first day of the convention, the man who challenged President Bush, Pat Buchanan, gave a barn burner of a speech. The late John Chancellor of NBC called it one of the finest speeches he had ever heard at a convention and that was saying something since Chancellor had covered politics since the 1950's. Also speaking that evening were former Education Secretary and Drug Czar Bill Bennett and former President Ronald Reagan. Both gave excellent speeches. Polls were taken that night and for the one and only time during the peak political season, George Bush led Bill Clinton in the Presidential race.<P>But other media began to criticize both the Bennett and Buchanan speeches, especially the part of Buchanan's speech where he suggested we were in the midst of a culture war. Excerpts of that speech were played over and over again, out of context, and Buchanan was ripped apart by the media and by liberal politicians. When George Bush lost to Bill Clinton, this same media blamed his loss on Buchanan and conservatives who allegedly scared moderate women away from the Republicans. <P>Now mind you, those speeches, including Buchanan's, only helped Bush in all actuality. In truth, George Bush was fired by the American people for two reasons. First because he pledged not to raise taxes and then engineered the largest tax increase in history up to that point. Second because Bush seemed to be preoccupied with foreign affairs at a time when the United States was in a mild recession. <P>One person, however, bought the media line about 1992 wholesale. That person is Bob Dole. Determined not to scare these same fictitious voters, Dole has banned Pat Buchanan from speaking in a major time slot at the convention, even though Buchanan ended up the runner up in the Presidential contest. Such a move is without precedent in modern American politics. Moreover, Dole has put forward the feminist Republican Susan Molinari as the keynote speaker. Colin Powell, a self declared Rockefeller Republican who disagrees with most of the GOP platform, will also be featured that first night. The Dole advisers are confident that when he puts forth this moderate image to the American people they will come flocking to him in droves. <P>It is an interesting theory. By that measure, Dole can be elected President by doing what the media wants. Never mind that in reality Dole will be driving away millions of conservative voters in the process. That is the truth. Oh, yes, and there is one other little problem. The media loves Bill Clinton much more than Bob Dole no matter what Dole does to try to please them. When all is said and done they won't give him much credit for doing what they have proscribed for the Republican party. Perceptions will vanish and reality will hit home to Bob Dole on election night. For Dateline Washington, I'm Paul Weyrich.

<h3>September 25, 1996</h3>
<H2>New Hope for the Senate</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
As a follow up to a commentary of a couple of weeks ago, there is some good news to report. After we took on Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the GOP Senatorial Campaign Committee, over the matter of his lack of support for Woody Jenkins, the endorsed GOP candidate in Louisiana, things began to happen.
<P>
Picking up that theme, Columnist Bob Novak wrote a column quoting this commentary and his piece ran in the New York Post. D'Amato got the message. Realizing that if the Louisiana general election ended up with two Democrats facing each other he would have it hung around his neck, D'Amato swung into action. The Senatorial committee began to poll to see which of the six GOP candidates had a chance to be in the runoff. They found, to their utter surprise, that Woody Jenkins was that candidate. Jenkins had built up a significant organization to the point where he scored in lower double digits even though most of his opponents had spent millions of dollars on television which Jenkins didn't have to spend.
<P>
Based on that data, D'Amato first tried to get other candidates to withdraw from the race. They would not do so. So, D'Amato got together with other GOP leaders in the state and one by one they agreed to support the candidate so that in the last week before the election, each day a different prominent Republican endorsed Jenkins. Four days before last Saturday's election, D'Amato then wired the Jenkins campaign about half of the money they could have given under the law so that Jenkins could, at the end, have lots of television and radio commercials. All of this created a surge effect. When the ballots were counted, Jenkins was not only in the runoff, he placed first among all the candidates. As a result, Republican Woody Jenkins will face Democrat Mary Landrieu, the daughter of the former mayor of New Orleans.
<P>
D'Amato called me to assure me that what happened was all part of the plan from the beginning. His own staffers assure me that it was not. But in any case, what happened worked. Now Republicans have a better than 50-50 shot at taking the Senate seat. In the primary, all the Republican candidates combined got about 58% of the vote. The Democratic candidates got 42% of the votes. Landrieu is on the far left of the Democratic party, although she is now trying to run as a moderate. Jenkins is the most solid conservative running for the U.S. Senate in the country. He is not backing away from his views at all. So we have a classic philosophical contest. Of course, the turnout in November will be far higher and right now Bill Clinton has a huge lead in Louisiana, but still Jenkins can be considered the slight favorite. 
<P>
What happened in Louisiana mirrors what has happened in just about all the states except in the East. Conservatives have been nominated for the U.S. Senate. Except for Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the Republican nominees are good on the issues. 
<P>
The liberal mantra is that conservatives can win primaries but they will all be defeated in the general election. Some no doubt will. But some will also likely be elected. Al Salvi is running an outstanding campaign against Congressman Dick Durbin in Illinois. He is behind, but he showed in his primary that he knows how to come from behind to win. Sam Brownback in Kansas is an excellent campaigner. He is slightly ahead in his contest with Jill Docking. In Alabama, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is slightly ahead. Congressman Tim Hutchinson has a shot at winning the Senate seat in Arkansas despite Bill Clinton's being at the top of the ticket. In Colorado, Congressman Wayne Allard is even in the polls with lawyer/lobbyist Tom Strickland. And so it goes. I don't have time to mention all of the races at this point. 
<P>
But the point is this. Unless the Republicans are completely destroyed by a Democratic surge at the end of the election, similar to what happened with the Republicans in 1994, the Senate should be an improved body after November.
<P>
That is good news for those of us who have been so frustrated by the Senate's resistance to constructive measures passed by the House.
<P>
Oh, and by the way. If it is clear that Bill Clinton is going to be re-elected, the Wall Street Journal poll reports that by a margin of 53% to 39%, voters want a Republican Congress to keep Clinton in check, rather than a Democratic Congress which can enact more of Bill Clinton's agenda.
<P>
The fact is there is some hope after all in this otherwise dismal political season.

<h2>U.S. Inherits Soviet Traits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Two recent incidents with two different airlines well illustrate how the United States is fast becoming a nation of bureaucratic rules rather than a nation of individuals empowered to make common sense judgments.
<dd>The other day I had to make a quick trip to Phoenix to address the annual meeting of the Arizona Transit Association. I chose Southwest Airlines out of Baltimore Washington International airport because that airline saved me literally four hours over the other choice I was given, was a United flight out of Dulles airport.
<dd>Southwest is a well-run and efficient airline with lower fares than all of the competition.
<dd>Somehow they have managed to get in and out of interim terminals in 20 minutes while their competition takes at least an hour. The only problem with Southwest is that in order to keep costs down they always seem to have the last gates in any given terminal concourse. Gates are usually auctioned off and Southwest wants to pay the lowest price possible in order to keep their fares down.
<dd>As some viewers know, I broke my back early this year and am held together by 16 metal parts. I am very blessed to be walking at all. I can now walk reasonably well but when I have to carry a bag it is quite difficult. I had only one bag when I arrived at BWI. When I got through the security system, which at BWI now requires that hand carried bags be unpacked and searched, I asked if there was an electric cart to take me to gate 16 at the very end of the concourse. I was told that Southwest did not operate such carts, whereas other airlines on other concourses did. They do need to cut costs to keep the fares low. So I managed to walk carrying my bag to the end of the terminal. I wanted to check in early because on Southwest, there is open seating. Southwest doesn't serve real food and this was 1 p.m. so I wanted to get something to eat, but the cafeteria was half way down the concourse. So after I received my boarding pass, I asked the gate attendant if I could leave my bag with him, explaining my circumstances. Southwest is known for its cheerful, even funny employees. Not this fellow. He literally growled at me, &quot;Your bag has to be attended at all times.&quot; I replied, &quot;yes and if you keep it, it will be.&quot; Then he really got surly. &quot;You have to keep your bag with you at all times,&quot; he barked. So off I went carrying my bag. When I got to the cafeteria, the arrangement was such that I could not set it down anywhere and keep an eye on it. So I carried my bag and a tray at the same time. Unfortunately carrying both elevated was more than I could handle and some of the contents on the tray ended up on the floor.
<dd>The second incident involved a United flight out of New York. We pulled away from the gate and onto the runway, whereupon the pilot came on and said, &quot;We're sorry folks, we are 18th in line and because of the weather, take-offs are very slow. We will be here at least a half hour.&quot; The man across the aisle from me summoned the stewardess. He told her, &quot;I almost missed this plane. I didn't have a chance to get to the bathroom and I was counting on going after takeoff. I need to get to the bathroom.&quot; She told him emphatically, &quot;You must stay in your seat while we are on the runway.&quot; He asked again: &quot;Please, this is really an emergency. I am not feeling well.&quot; She got very agitated for no good reason as the gentleman was as polite as could be. &quot;You stay in your seat and if you try to get up I will have you arrested,&quot; she told him. At that point other passengers around the man hissed and booed at her. I got her attention and told her, &quot;You know if this man is ill and suffers any damage as the result of your order he could sue you.&quot; At that point she threatened to have me arrested. Then just like the Soviet attendants on Aeroflot used to do before the collapse of the Soviet Union she stood in the aisle of the plane with her hands on her hips and shouted, &quot;I have complete authority to enforce FAA regulations. If anyone else objects I will get the police.&quot; The poor man was forced to sit there in agony for over 40 minutes until the plane was in the skies and the captain had turned off the seat belt sign.
<dd>In an earlier time, in both instances, an attendant would have been able to use his own judgment. To the Southwest gate attendant I had pointed out that my bag had just been completely unpacked and repacked and that he himself had removed the red tag indicating that the bag was okay. I don't think I exactly fit the profile of a terrorist. He should be allowed to make such judgments. Aboard the United flight the other passengers all assured the stewardess that if she let the man go to the bathroom, they would not ask for the same privilege. No, this &quot;lady&quot; wanted to play the role of the enforcer.
<dd>The irony is that on my last Aeroflot flight from Ulan Bataar to Moscow, the stewardesses were as polite and helpful as could be. They accommodated several unusual requests from passengers. They now have competition from Mongolian Air which is a superbly run U.S.-style airline using Boeing 737's.
<dd>Maybe the late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov was correct. He predicted convergence between the Soviet system and ours. As far as I can see, the Russians are becoming more like the United States used to be and we are becoming more like the Soviets used to be, a land of mindless regulations where the individual counts for nothing.

"House Speaker Cultivating Challengers"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
These are not the best of times for Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. First, he was savagely attacked by New York Senator Al D'Amato who claimed that Gingrich had misread the 1994 elections and thus had proposed radical initiatives instead of the incremental changes the voters wanted. Now comes word from inside the House that some Members are talking seriously about challenging Gingrich for the Speaker's post in the next Congress.<P>
The challenge comes not from the dozen or so hard-core conservatives among the freshmen who have never cared much for the Speaker. Rather, the challenge comes from an outer core of less-adamant conservatives. One multi-term Member told me he knew of at least two candidates who were considering the run. All of the current members of the leadership strongly back Gingrich and are opposed to any run against him.<P>
This whole issue is relevant only if Republicans keep control of the Congress, because in the event they become a minority, the Republicans will lose one leadership position and Gingrich has already said publicly that he would drop out in such a case.<P>
The rap against the Speaker from those who want an alternative is two-fold. First, his opponents claim, he plays games on crucial issues. There is now a dispute, for example, between the Speaker and Majority Leader Dick Armey over the minimum wage issue. Armey says he doesn't want to vote on the issue at all because the minimum wage is part of the Democratic agenda. Gingrich points to a letter he received from 38 "moderate" Republican Members of the House who back the Minimum wage.  He says a vote on the issue is inevitable and so he wants it brought to the floor with Republican provisions attached. <P>Conservative opponents of Gingrich claim that he actually encouraged the "moderates" to write the letter to him in the first place. They quote one of their colleagues as telling them "I didn't want to sign the letter (on the minimum wage) but Newt asked me to." Their claim is that this is all too typical of how Gingrich operates, pitting one side against another. Moreover they contend that when liberal Republicans bolt the party line, nothing is said to them at all. But when conservatives disagree with Gingrich they are taken to the woodshed, cursed at, and told to get in the real world.<P>
The second rap against Gingrich is that he is often unfocused and flits from issue to issue. The Gingrich opponents claim that the Speaker all but abrogated his responsibilities earlier this year, telling the other House leaders they were going to run the show while he concentrated on strategies to get Bob Dole elected President and to raise money for the Republican party.<P>
Opponents think they have a chance to defeat Gingrich because of the dissatisfaction among the current freshman class as well as the fact that a number of older Members were never fond of the one-time fire brand in the first place.  In addition, they believe, incoming freshmen won't have the kind of attachment to the Speaker that this class once had.<P>
As I see it, the challenge to Gingrich, when all is said and done, probably won't work. I think his adversaries ought to step back and look at the situation and then take some action.<P>
First off, they should acknowledge that Gingrich is without peer in proclaiming a vision for their party. It is a party which otherwise lacks vision.  They should be reluctant to toss overboard the one person they have in their midst who has that capability.<P>
Second, they should call the Speaker's bluff when they think he is playing games with them. Newt is, above all, a realist. If he knows he can't get by with the sort of tactics which enrage his opponents he won't try them. The next time they get "woodsheded" for doing the right thing, they should go public with the issue. In such cases, the vast majority of ordinary folks will be with Members trying to do the right thing, not with the Speaker. This is part of Newt's style. Last year, for example, a delegation from Focus on the Family visited the Speaker expressing extreme discomfort at the direction of the Republican party. Gingrich told the delegation if he were in their position, he would threaten a third party. This is exactly the way Gingrich operates.  If things like that become a public issue, the Speaker is not likely to continue down the same path.<P>
Finally, these conservatives should look for someone among their ranks to fill the shoes of Vin Weber and Bob Walker. When Newt Gingrich first came to the Congress back in 1978, he was extremely unfocused.  As a result, he was not taken seriously by his colleagues. Mr. Weber, a former six-term Congressman from Minnesota, recognized great potential in Gingrich. So did Rep. Walker (R-PA), the watchdog of the House floor. Together, they gently but firmly took Newt's hand and helped to organize and focus him. They were an integral part of his success. But Mr. Weber left the Congress in 1992.  Rep. Walker is leaving at the end of this term. Both need to be replaced. Speaker Gingrich came to trust them and rely on them even though initially they were not the best of friends. I would suggest that conservatives disgruntled with the Speaker try to become to Gingrich the kind of assets that Weber and Walker were.  This would afford them the type of positive influence over the Speaker that these two Members had.<P>
Most challenges to Republican leadership figures turn out to be just talk. This challenge, although being discussed by serious Members of the House, will likely also turn out to be just talk.  That is, unless of course, the Speaker himself performs in such a way that he drives Members into the arms of his opponents.<P>

"Making a Tax Cut Better"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
Last week, Wednesday, I was witness to a dialogue between a freshman Senator and a freshman Congressman. That conversation got to the essence of where this nation is going in fiscal terms.<P>
The Senator was John Ashcroft, the former Governor of Missouri. He was explaining his proposal to make social security taxes deductible. Such a tax cut would mean an average middle class family would save more than $1700 a year in federal taxes. The Ashcroft program would cost $35 billion for its first year and more than $50 billion each year thereafter.<P>
The Congressman was Wisconsins Mark Neumann, the single most focused Member of the House on the question of our national debt.<P>
Neumann asked how the Senator was going to "pay for this legislation in terms of spending cuts."  The Senator from Missouri was vague.  "Well cut some money from corporate welfare and well get some money through welfare reform and from overhead expenses from the federal government," Ashcroft told the Congressman.<P>
"No, I mean specifically," Neumann replied. "What exactly would you cut and how much?"<P>
The Senator didnt know. Neumann continued, "Look, I like tax cuts. I want to vote for this legislation. But I cant vote for anything which will enlarge the deficit. Unless you know exactly what you are going to cut and from where youre going to cut it, the bill will end up enlarging the deficit."<P>
The Senator was silent. Neumann was exactly right. <P>
I think the Ashcroft idea is a splendid one. It would provide a middle class tax cut in exactly the way it should be provided. I hope his bill gains traction. But the day has passed when any responsible legislator should propose any piece of legislation without giving specific consideration to what will be cut from federal spending if the legislation is passed. <P>
With trillions of dollars in off book debt and unfunded liabilities, not to mention the current budget deficit, we simply cannot afford to pass legislation without looking at the precise consequences of enacting such bills. We have been avoiding such consequences for the past several decades. Look where it has brought us.<P>
The correct answer to all this is that we should do both. We ought to pass Ashcrofts bill, but Ashcroft should spell out precisely what portions of the federal budget he will cut out in order to make up for the lost revenue his bill would engender. Then we will have the best of both worlds. We will be giving a tax cut to the people who need it most, in the most equitable method possible. At the same time we will further cut federal spending in other areas so as not to enlarge the debt. All responsible legislators need to ask the questions Mark Neumann asked. Then we will truly be making progress. <P>

<h2>Second Thoughts About a Constitutional Convention
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>


I am about to upset a lot of people. So get your pens ready, crank up your computers, and oil your fax machines. Here we go. <P>
I am sitting here thinking about another dreadful Supreme Court decision, the 7 to 1 rendering on the VMI case which outlaws same sex educational institutions. It paves the way for women in combat and a host of other things we have fought over the years. It continues what my colleague Tom Jipping has called "the cultural Jihad." <P>
I, of course, have called for the impeachment of the majority on this court, although I know how far that will get. Still, the question is, as Lenin once said, "What is to be done?" <P>
If you watched Direct Line Wednesday night you understand that Congress will do nothing about this decision. There are constitutional remedies available to the Congress, such as withdrawing jurisdiction from the Court on certain issues, but they never, ever use them. Lets face it, after more than fifty years of watching the Court erode its power, the Congress is afraid to do anything about it. <P>
I keep thinking of what the Court has done to votes of the people such as in the Colorado homosexual rights case and in the Arkansas term limits case and on and on. I will bet that had the people in Virginia voted on VMI or the people of South Carolina voted on the Citadel they would have voted to uphold tradition. It is clear that with this Court the votes of the people dont matter. <P>
This Court keeps altering the Constitution to the point where it can no longer be recognized. They find rights which are not there. They do not respect, in any way, the 10th Amendment which reserves to the states and to the people those matters which are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. <P>
The argument against a Constitutional Convention is that it would change our constitutional form of government. But our form of government is being changed by this Supreme Court case by case, year by year. The Court does so without the consent of the governed or even of the Congress elected by the governed. With this Court there is no Constitution unless it is found convenient to resurrect it from time to time. <P>
I know this is going to send my friend Phyllis Schlafly into orbit and I will be forever branded as a traitor to my country by various committees of correspondence who busy the fax machines and the Internet. But I have to ask the question. Can we be worse off with a Constitutional Convention elected by the people than we are with a Court that constantly undoes the work of the people? <P>
I guess I have more faith in the people than others do. I recall that the same fears which have been expressed about a national Constitutional Convention were expressed about both Maryland and Louisiana when they held such conventions to rewrite their state constitutions. No real damage was done in Maryland, despite it being one of the most liberal states in the country. Louisianas constitution came out far better after the convention than before. <P>
If my good friends at the NRA, the Christian Coalition, in pro-life groups, and a host of other groups can help win elections all around the country, why cant they help elect a majority to a Constitutional Convention? If we ran slates of delegates to such a convention on a reform ticket which included items such as term limits and a real balanced budget amendment with tax limitation and so on, Ill bet we would win a majority of the convention hands down. Maybe then we could change the Constitution to protect the unborn, insure that citizens have their rights restored on issues such as Amendment Two in Colorado, insure that the court cannot repeal human nature as they have tried to do in the VMI case, and so on.
It is true that we could lose the elections to such a convention. That is always the chance you take when the people vote. But what is the alternative? At least such a Convention would be acting on a vote of the people. The way things stand, our way of life, our Constitution, our culture, our system of government are all being changed by a Court which is responsible to no one. Do we sit here and let it happen? Or do we try to take back our country? My colleague Bill Lind wants a new political party. Well and good, but what will that accomplish if this Court takes all of our rights away in the meanwhile? <P>
Let me make something clear. I revere the work of the Founding Fathers. I think the Constitution they produced has a near sacred quality to it. I believe it produced the best government the world has seen for a century and a half. Remember that these same Founding Fathers provided for the very Constitutional Convention we are discussing. <P>
But lets face it, the era when the Constitution was respected by the Supreme Court has long been over. Several Republican Presidents have tried to appoint so called "strict constructionists" to the court to reverse what has been happening since the New Deal. It hasnt worked. The majority in the VMI case were Republican appointees. <P>
It seems to me that we have to face reality. I want the opponents of a Constitutional Convention to make the case to me that we are better off letting this runaway Court strip us of our heritage on a systematic basis, than we would be if the people had a chance to elect a convention that could express their will.
I think a national election for a convention would be a very serious affair. Ill bet it would be treated that way by the voters and it would be a remarkable opportunity to educate people about what our constitutional form of government should be. Im sorry, but I cant accept the view that we should do nothing. We mourn and we complain and we express regret at what is happening but we do nothing.
I say it is hard for me to imagine that we would be worse off than we are now with a vote of the same people who passed term limits, voted for Amendment Two in Colorado, voted for three strikes and youre out in California, and so on. <P>
Go ahead. Come at me. Lets debate this proposition. It sure is better than sitting around and ringing our hands. <P>

<h2>Election Results Seldom Meet Expectations</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>In some locations in the nation, the polls are about to close, in others the polls will be open for another four hours yet, but soon enough we will know the verdict of the American people in this election.
<dd>Whatever the outcome, it is good to keep this election in perspective. Every two years I hear several people say, "This is the most important election we have ever faced in our history." Usually they cite some burning issue of the day as their reason for feeling that way. It is true that elections have significance, but usually that significance is not as profound as we think. When FDR was returned to office with a landslide and the Democrats actually gained seats in Congress for the fourth election in a row, FDR thought he could get whatever he wanted. He proposed packing the Supreme Court which had ben resistant to some of his initiatives. Yet it was that very Congress, where FDR's opposition had been reduced to next to nothing, which stopped his court-packing scheme.
<dd>My first election in which I was active in a major way was 1958. I was by then the youngest member ever to serve on the Board of the Young Republicans of Racine, County, Wisconsin. That year, we got wiped out by the explosion of the AFL-CIO's Committee on Political Education or COPE. The Democrats won huge majorities in the Congress. Yet that Congress produced little of what the Democrats wanted. All of President Eisenhower's vetoes were upheld. He actually was a better President with that Congress than he had been when he was dealing with a much friendlier Congress. In fact, that Congress -- which was practically owned by big Labor -- passed the Landrum Griffin Labor Reform act over the strident opposition of the very Members of Congress who had been elected to stop it.
<dd>It is true that in 1964, then Conservative Republican candidate Barry Goldwater got crushed by Lyndon Johnson and the Congress which followed gave us all of the dreadful Great Society legislation we are still trying to cope with today. But also out of that election was born the modern conservative movement which produced Ronald Reagan, first as Governor of California and then as President.
<dd>The Democrats again crushed the Republicans in 1974 and some of my friends were suicidal. Yet that Congress upheld all but one of President Ford's vetoes. By the way, in my three decades here, the two least damaging Congresses were the Congress elected in 1966 and the Congress elected in 1978. Both anticipated the election of Republican Presidents and the Republicans finally got their act together and held off just about everything that was destructive.
<dd>Expectations were high for the Congress which came in with Ronald Reagan in 1980, and indeed the first eight months of the Reagan Administration were exciting and did good things. After that, it was back to more of business as usual. By the second session of that Congress, the largest tax increase in history, up until Bill Clinton's tax bill of 1993, was passed and signed into law by Reagan.
<dd>The election of Bill Clinton with a Democratic Congress in 1992 was very troubling. Yet many bad initiatives were stopped by that Congress, some of which were passed by the Republican Congress which followed it. Expectations were never higher than two years ago. The first few months of the 104th Congress were terribly exhilirating. But that Congress too left town with a whimper with most of its urgent business left undone.  My point is simply this. Whichever way this election goes tonight, it will be neither as good nor as bad as contemporary observers believe it will be. If Bill Clinton gets back in with a Democratic Congress, probably a united and outraged Republican opposition may get its act together. On the other hand if somehow the voters deft the odds and elect Bob Dole with a Republican Congress, true believers out there who think the nation has now been saved will be disappointed. We may, in fact, get mixed results. I have come to believe that the American people do that by design. They give us a President of one party and a Congress of the other because in their minds less damage will be done that way, and sometimes they are correct.
<dd>What is important, in the long run, is not this particular election. What is important is that we begin to face our real problems as a nation. These are not the problems which were ever talked about by the major candidates in this election. They are the sort of problems being discussed by my colleagues Bill Lind and Brad Keena on the "Next Revolution." Sooner or later elected officials will be forced to face those problems. Let us fervently pray that at that moment in our nation's history, there will still be time.

"Washingtons Misplaced Perspective"
</h2>
(Delivered by Brad Keena)
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
	There is old adage that says "politics is like sausage  you don't want to know how it is made!"
	Considering this is an election year, each passing day is proving those words were inspired to describe Washington and its establishment.  Washington today is like a great big sausage factory.  Broadcasting here so close to the factory, we sense it all around us.  Even now, as I listen carefully, I can hear the haunting screams of ordinary citizens falling into giant tax machines ripping out their wallets; tossing what remains in huge grinders designed to pulverize faith and morality through the terrible engines of an unstoppable federal judiciary.  In the air this election year is the malodorous waft of this huge sausage factory we call Washington.  The mixture created in this factory is ghastly to look at until the Administration adds its coloring to give the final grind an appearance of being edible.
<P>	Like short-order cooks, the establishment media fries up this nasty glop into bite size bits, served on plates with ugly china patterns with names like HUD, Education, Commerce, and Labor.
The table is set before the hungry establishment elite competing in a sausage-eating contest  a game which will last until November.  No one at the table is willing to admit where the sausage came from, how it is made, or what's in it.  To admit this would cause each at the table to lose his or her appetite:  for the sausage has come from outside of Washington.  It has been scandalously and horribly made with the most vile additives.  Its ingredients include the faith and hopes and dreams of ordinary Americans.  Together the future of each has been reprocessed into morsels prepared for the gluttonous elite seated at Washington's table.
<P>	The machine grinds on.  The terrible sounds continue night and day.  The stench of this factory permeates the air.  Unending is the Establishment's voracious appetite for power over its citizenry.
Perspective is a remarkable thing.  As humans, we tend to get lost in the false perspective of seeming permanence.  Time is slow moving.  Often we think what we see at the moment is permanent, but we're wrong.  America did not always look this way.  We have allowed our own government to remove itself from morality's scale.  The courts have overruled God's moral measurements, the government has thrown aside God's ethical scales.  The true measurement is sure.  It's weight is exact.  It's precision remains for all time.  Yet our culture has chosen a perspective which avoids to close a look at the moral and ethical realities.  Don't ask, don't tell about homosexuality in the military; don't ask, don't tell about the murder of babies even moments before birth; don't ask, don't tell about a political process promising to deliver everything we want at the expense of everything we've got.
<P>	This is not America.  This is another nation.  It's capital has become the sausage factory.  
In the banquet hall, its king and his lords, his wives and his concubines are drinking the blood of society in silver vessels, praising the gods of the Establishment.  On one wall of Washington's terrible banquet hall is a great hand.  It is writing Washington's future, telling the measurement and weight of the moral scales society had allowed Washington to disregard.  The writing on this wall is becoming visible for all to see:  "Moral integrity has been found wanting. Days are numbered. The kingdom is about to become divided."
<P>	Meanwhile, the banquet continues.  The writing on the wall has gone yet unnoticed.  The Washington sausage factory drones on.<P>

<h2>Senate Should Not Seat Landrieu</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> It was exactly 30 years
ago, January 5th, 1967, when this naive, eager 24-year-old set foot inside what is now the
Dirksen Building (Dirksen was still alive then) to begin to work in the U.S. Senate. What an
education that was. Within the first month I learned something which utterly shocked me. The
Senator I worked for introduced a bill in the Senate with which he didn't agree. When I
questioned this, he said he did so to help a constituent. I said, in my ignorance, "But what
if the bill gets passed?" Gordon Allott smiled at my question and said reassuringly, "I have
a deal with Scoop [Jackson (D-WA), then Chairman of the Senate Interior Committee] that the
bill will never see the light of day." And this, by the way, was done by one of the most
honest men ever to have served in the Senate.<dd>

Such began my insight into the long-playing game of Washington deception. The trick is to
look like you are doing one thing while doing the opposite. These games never cease.<dd>

The Senate is getting ready to seat Mary Landrieu of Louisiana "without prejudice," meaning
that if it turns out there is sufficient evidence of voter fraud in the recent Senate
election there, theoretically the seat could be vacated and a new election held. I say
theoretically because, although key Senators are telling Landrieu's opponent Woody Jenkins
otherwise, the fact is the way this is being orchestrated means the race is over. Even if
the Senate Rules Committee concluded that there was enough fraud in the election to have
turned the results (and more evidence is coming in every day), all the Democrats would have
to do is to filibuster and Mary Landrieu would keep her Senate seat. And they would, of
course. This is all a cozy little deal worked out between the majority and the minority in
the Senate.<dd>

The fact is, if the Republican majority were serious about the problems in Louisiana, they
would not allow Mary Landrieu to be seated at all. That is what the Democrats did to Louis
Wyman of New Hampshire, the certified winner of the Senate race in that state in 1974. The
Democrats claimed voter irregularities. There was no evidence whatsoever of the sort that
has turned up in Louisiana. In any case, the majority in 1975 refused to seat Wyman.
Governor Meldrim Thompson then appointed just-retired Senator Norris Cotton to the Senate
seat to serve in the interim and a new election was held. In that election, the certified
winner, Louis Wyman, was defeated by the loser of the general election in 1974, John
Durkin.<dd>

This took place before Vice President Nelson Rockefeller maneuvered to change the Senate
rules. In those days, Republicans could have mounted a filibuster with just 34 votes. They
had 38 Senators that year. Democrats didn't take that chance. They did not seat
certified-winner Wyman conditionally.<dd>

The fact is that there is evidence enough right now to deprive Mary Landrieu of that Senate
seat. If only the Republican majority had the stomach for confrontation this is exactly what
they would do. Instead, we will go on with the charade of an investigation. From their point
of view, the Republicans will do Woody Jenkins the favor of validating his claims and lay
the blame on the Democrats for filibustering a move for a new election.<dd>

Well, Republicans, how about doing the nation a favor? How about preserving the integrity of
our electoral system? How about, for once, standing up and behaving as if you were the
majority? Mary Landrieu should not be sworn in as a Senator in the 105th Congress on
Tuesday. This would be the perfect occasion to stop playing games and to start leveling with
the American people.<P>

<h2>
Leadership in Lott
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 <DD>Trent Lott was re-elected Senate Majority Leader
today by his fellow Republicans without any opposition. He leads
the most conservative group of Senate Republicans since, perhaps,
the 1920's.  Lott is a symbol of the changes in his own party.
He came to Washington as a Democrat. He served on the staff of
the late William Colmer, Chairman of the House Rules Committee,
and one of the last of the crusty old Conservative Democrats to
rule a House Committee with an iron hand.
<DD>
 Lott left Colmer to run for the House as a Republican
in 1972, the year that Richard Nixon swept the South. Ed Feulner
and I told Lott he was crazy for doing so. [Feulner, now the President
of the Heritage Foundation, back then was an influential House
staffer.] Lott could see already then what we didn't yet recognize
and that was that the Republicans were going to one day dominate
the South.
<DD>
 In 1980 when Ronald Reagan swept many new and conservative
Republicans into the House, Lott ran for and was elected House
GOP whip. He defeated Bud Shuster, the favorite of the GOP establishment
at the time. He held that position, largely in frustration, under
Bob Michel for eight years and finally opted to run for the Senate.
<DD>
 When in 1994 another large crop of freshmen Senators
was swept into office, Lott challenged then Majority Whip Alan
Simpson and defeated him by one vote. When Bob Dole resigned,
Lott faced off against his fellow Mississippian Thad Cochran and
beat him 44 to 8. Lott has never lost an election at home or in
the Congress.
<DD>
 It is clear that Lott knows when to hold 'em and
when to fold 'em. Two votes were added to Lott's majority in an
election which saw Bill Clinton sweep the nation. Not only that,
most of the incoming Republican Senators are more conservative
than the Republicans they replaced. The liberal wing of the party
is down to a few votes.
<DD>
 But the one thing Lott doesn't have which he had
when he entered the leadership in 1980 is conservative Democrats.
Lott became famous for being able to reach across the aisle to
get votes for Ronald Reagan's favorite programs. Conservative
Democrats trusted him. He may have changed parties but at heart
he was still one of them. Today when Lott looks across the aisle,
he finds almost no moderate to conservative Democrats left. Those
he could get from time to time in the last session, Heflin of
Alabama, Johnston of Louisiana, Exon of Nebraska, are all gone,
replaced either by Republicans or liberal Democrats.
<DD>
 In the Senate, even if Lott can keep his 55 Republicans
together on some votes, he still needs another five votes to break
a filibuster. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle knows that and
will play it for all it is worth.
<DD>
 Lott is, when all is said and done, a wily Southerner.
He likes to make deals, but sometimes, when he feels a great principle
is at stake, he can be tough as nails. Following the Civil War,
Southerners learned to adjust. They learned to sound accommodating
even when they didn't intend to be. Lott is very much that way.
What you see and hear is not always what you get. And that often
surprises friends and enemies alike.
<DD>
Lott is the most clever GOP leader in the Senate
since the late Everett Dirksen passed on to his eternal reward
in 1969. He is a man who keeps his word once you can be absolutely
sure what his word is.
<DD>
Lott is someone who knows how to use power, but he
uses it very sparingly. He is often compared with former Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell. He likes the comparison. Mitchell
just smiled and smiled while he was driving a stake through the
heart of the Republicans. Lott wouldn't mind repaying the favor
from time to time.
<DD>
 Lott will have at his side a conservative team to
help him. That team reflects where the GOP has gone these past
years: Don Nickels from Oklahoma as whip; Larry Craig of Idaho
as Policy Committee Chairman; Connie Mack of Florida as Conference
Chairman; Paul Coverdell of Georgia as Conference Secretary; Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky as Chairman of the Senatorial campaign committee.
The South and the West, that is where Republicans tend to do well
and that is where the leadership team comes from.
<DD>
The Senate is a far different place than it was 30
years ago when I first encountered it. Half of the GOP membership
back then was liberal and Southern Conservative Democrats dominated
the structure.
<DD>
Trent Lott is truly a creature of the body which
he will lead for another Congress. As with the South itself, what
change comes about during his term will be incremental, steady
and managed. Trent Lott is no revolutionary but in terms of the
Senate itself, it is revolutionary that he is its leader.<BR>

"We Are Winning"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P><center>
by Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI)
</center>
<P>
<P>In 1995, I came to Congress along with 72 other newly elected freshman Members.  
<P>Before any of us even took our oath of office, we resolved ourselves to achieving a very specific goal  to reduce the federal deficit, to balance our budget and to eliminate wasteful Washington spending.  	
<P>Now, just 16 months later, I have good news to report: we are winning this battle!
<P>It hasnt been easy, I can assure you of that.  But the results we have achieved, are well worth the effort.
<P>Let me show you the financial picture of our nation, when I came here, and where we stand now. 
<P>When we arrived here a year ago, this is what we found:  The red line on this chart illustrates the problem of the federal deficit.  It was at about $200 billion per year and growing indefinitely.
<P>If we had allowed this trend to continue, our country would sink further and further into debt, creating a disastrous future for our children and grandchildren.  But we did not allow that to happen.  We took action.
<P>First, we passed a recessions bill.  That means that right off the bat, we took $11 billion of wasteful spending out of the budget.
<P>Then the appropriators went to work.  John Kasich, the chairman of the Budget Committee, set a goal and said $23 billion of wasteful spending had to be eliminated. "Come in $23 billion under the previous year, or our plan to balance the budget wont work," Kasich told them.
<P>Folks, this is the first time in a generation this has been done. 
<P>By December, this is where we were.  We were making progress, but still, we dared to dream.  We dared to dream that we could restore a better future for this Nation.  We dared to dream that we could get our country back on track.
<P>If you look at this chart, you see that this green line is the path to a balanced budget, and the road to a secure financial future for our children and grandchildren.
<P>So we set a deficit target for fiscal year 1996.  That target was $157 billion.  So what happened?  The financial markets looked at this and they reacted positively, and exactly as predicted.
<P>The most positive and helpful sign for the American people was that interest rates stayed down.  And when that happened, more people  especially younger folks  could afford to buy houses and cars.
<P>This created jobs and job opportunities for our young people because somebody has to build those houses and cars.
<P>Folks, this is exactly how America is supposed to work.
<P>What followed next was our unemployment rate went down, as did the welfare rolls and interest cost to the government.
<P>But that was not the end of the story.  When the markets reacted in a positive way, and the appropriators fulfilled their commitment to our Nation, not only did we hit our target for a balanced budget, we came in $8 billion less than where we needed to be in order to reach a balanced budget in 2002.
<P>That is the story behind the story. We are $8 billion ahead of where we need to be in order to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002!
<P>This is great news, and Im happy to deliver it to you, because its not often that you hear good news out of Washington.
<P>And theres even more good news.  Were on track to balancing the budget without raising your taxes.  We did not go back to the 1993 way of raising your taxes.  Weve accomplished this by truly shrinking parts of this government.
<P>This Congress has kept its commitment to balancing the budget.  In the past, other Congresses have spent money hand over fist thinking that was the way to win over the voters.
<P>But this Congress understands that the best thing we can do right now for the American worker, and for our children and our grandchildren is to balance the budget.
<P>A balanced federal budget is a permanent solution to our Nations economic problems.  Never again should we give in to quick-fix gimmicks, election year charades, and snake-oil solutions.<P>
What does a balanced federal budget mean to you and your family?  It means:<P>
<ul><li>lower interest rates which makes it easier to buy houses, cars and other goods;
<LI>it means lower taxes;
<li>it means more jobs, lower unemployment, and fewer people on the welfare rolls;
<li>and finally it means higher salaries and more take-home pay to spend as you see fit.
</ul>Folks, we are winning! Is there more to be done?  Sure there is.<P>
But with your help, we can cut through the demagoguery of the other side and keep our focus on balancing the budget.  When we do that, we will return economic security to you, and a brighter financial future to your children.<P>

<h2>Congressman Gunderson's Allegations</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
A point of personal privilege. Congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin yesterday held a press conference which attacked me personally. Here is the background. Last year Gunderson, who has served in office in the 3rd Congressional District from Wisconsin since l980, announced that he would not seek another term in Congress. <p>

Subsequent to that time, Congressman Pat Roberts, who has been Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, decided to run for the U.S. Senate for the seat now held by Nancy Kassebaum. The man in line to succeed Roberts as Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Bill Emerson, died. Thus Gunderson, who was next in line, began to change his mind. He asked the Republican candidate for Congress Jim Harsdorf to step aside. He declined to do so. Notwithstanding that Gunderson, one of the openly homosexual Members of Congress, encouraged a write in candidacy on his own behalf. Yesterday he announced that he was pulling the plug on that effort and that he would not be a candidate for re-election after all.<p>

In the process of making that announcement, Gunderson said the following: "It has come to my attention that conservative social groups in this country, led by Paul Weyrich, have informed the Speaker they would initiate a major independent expenditure against me. I have been informed that these people were prepared to do whatever was necessary to not only defeat me, but destroy me. I have been informed these groups were going to make allegations regarding my health status and AIDS. I have been informed that they were going to engage in other elements of character assassination....... Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is that to some people in this country, the possibility of someone who is openly gay assuming the chair of a major Committee in Congress somehow legitimizes their personal life. And sadly, they could not accept that. "<p>
 
Gunderson said he had been assured by Speaker Gingrich that he would support Gunderson all the way if he chose to do the write in. This is the same Speaker Gingrich who is punishing Congressmen Smith and Dornan for standing on principle. <p>

Now let me make this clear. I wish I could take credit for driving Steve Gunderson out of the race. His lifestyle is his own business, and I have not sought to make it an issue. He did. He openly flaunted his lover at Congressional functions. His partner, whose name is Rob, even enjoyed a spousal pass in Congress which meant he had a special parking place and get into otherwise restricted areas. <P>

But I opposed Gunderson because of what he believed in. He was one of these so called "moderates" who was nearly always working at cross purposes with those of us who believe in traditional values.<p>
 
The fact is , however, that Gunderson made up this charge about an independent expenditure against him. I have made no such move. I have never discussed such an idea with anyone. Anyone who knows me knows that I deal with issues. Lifestyles only become important when the high nature of the office demands it (for example, a President who was on drugs could not perform his duties appropriately) or when the person himself makes it an issue by his or her conduct. <p>

Speaker Gingrich would not possibly have known about such an independent expenditure because I have not spoken to the Speaker or his staff or any other Member of the leadership or their staffs or anyone else for that matter about such a campaign. <p>

The fact is, and he admits it in his own statement, that leading Republicans in his own state were adamantly opposed to his running. I had nothing whatsoever to do with that. I never spoke with any of them. Gunderson, despite the poll he released which claims that the people were clamoring for him to run, was afraid he would lose. In Washington, the game these days is to blame someone else for your decisions. I guess for Gunderson, I was a convenient target.<p>

As difficult as it is for anyone who is considered a public figure to win a libel or slander suit these days, I have my attorneys looking into the matter. As happy as I am to see him leave the Congress, Steve Gunderson should not be permitted to make things up about me or anyone else. He should not be permitted to sully my good name.<p>
 
Gunderson said that "ugliness has become the rule, rather than the exception in modern day campaigns." If that is true, then what Gunderson did is one of the worst examples of ugliness I have ever seen in the electoral process. He is truly a pathetic public figure. All of us should pray for him.<P>

<h3>September 26, 1996</h3>
<H2>Watergate All Over Again</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
Richard Cohen of the Washington Post is an honest but doctrinaire liberal. There is hardly an issue where he and I don't disagree. Recently, however, he reversed himself on the partial birth abortion issue because, he said, he was misled by the pro-abortionists who had claimed  incorrectly  that it was a rarely-used procedure.
<p>
But Cohen can usually be counted on to boost the liberal end of the Democratic agenda. That is why it was startling to read his column in this morning's Post in which he suggests that we might be on the verge of reliving history. The sort of history Cohen has in mind is Watergate, 24 years ago. Then, as he correctly points out, Washington was consumed with the Watergate story but out in the countryside it didn't mean a thing. Richard Nixon was overwhelmingly re-elected. Then the nation had to come to grips with the Constitutional crisis that followed.
<p>
What troubles Cohen and should trouble all of us is the reaction of the White House in the face of the latest report by the office of Inspector General of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Hillary Clinton was involved in an effort to deceive federal regulators into approving a sham real estate transaction, the report said. But the reaction of the White House is to attack those who have written the report. According to the Clinton White House, those who wrote the report were unduly pressured by Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
<p>
As to the other troubles visited on the Clintons, why, that is all the fault of the alleged partisan activities of Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Even Clinton himself has gone on the attack against Starr, echoing the complaint of Susan McDougal who says she'll rot in jail because Starr wants her to lie about the Clintons. Of course, this same Bill Clinton has hinted that he would not rule out a pardon for Susan McDougal and the others.
<p>
All of this has a familiar ring not just to Cohen but to the rest of us who were here in Washington at the time of Watergate. I cheered when then Republican National Chairman Senator Bob Dole told us that Watergate was just the product of the liberals being pushed by the left-wing Washington Post. "Tell it like it is, Bob," I thought as I watched Dole defend misdeeds at the White House. It turns out Dole had been lied to about the situation by Nixon and company so he was doing what he thought was right.
But the tactic is the same. When you can't explain your actions, blame someone else for asking the questions.
<p>
In the same paper in which Cohen's column appears there is a headline spread across page A-10 which reads "GOP Says White House Logs on Readers of FBI Reports have 6 Month Gap." Hmmm. Sound familiar? The 18 minute gap on a tape-recording just about sealed Richard Nixon's fate. But, of course, the Clinton White House blames their gap on a low-level aide named Mari Anderson, who just happens to be in hiding right now, unable to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Don't worry Mari. Congress is about to go out of session and then you can come out of hiding. After all, it's only five weeks until the elections and Bill Clinton's second term triumph. He'll take care of you and all the rest after that.
<p>
Yes, Cohen is exactly right. We have heard all of this before and it has an eerie ring to it. The fact is Richard Nixon's list of transgressions is minor compared with Bill Clinton's. If, in one narrative, you string together all of the problems this Administration has had, it is absolutely mind boggling. Yet the nation seems to care less. Things are going well. Unemployment is low. Inflation is stable. The stock market is high. We are all just fat, dumb and happy.
<p>
However, it is clear to Cohen and should be to the rest of the country that we may well be headed for the repeat of what happened in 1972: a Presidential re-election triumph and then a Constitutional crisis thereafter. No wonder the cartoon character Doonsbury, penned by the liberal but politically savvy Gary Trudeau, is preoccupied with Al Gore pretending to already be President. If this is indeed history repeating itself, then Gore ought to be President by 1998.
<p>
But wait a minute, folks. We are not the victims of some unstoppable historical forces. We have the power to make a difference. The clock hasn't stopped yet. We can still determine who wins in November. There is still time to wake up from the collective dream we Americans seem to be in to do something about this sorry mess before it is indeed too late.<p>

<h2>Clinton Dodges Another Scandal
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>







It is always nice to have friends on the Supreme Court. Bill Clinton had at least four of them which is why he won't be giving depositions this Summer in the Paul Jones sexual harassment suit. The court agreed to take up the question of whether or not a President can face a civil suit during his term in office. Now the court will decide in l997 if the decision by the court of appeals that the lawsuit may proceed is valid. Had the High court simply upheld the decision of the appeals court, the law suit would have gone ahead. <P>

But then we shouldn't be surprised. Bill Clinton's entire history is one of close calls and of voters giving him the benefit of the doubt. And it appears they are about to do so again.<P>

Of all the data I have reviewed on elections, which began with a tutorial the pollster Richard Wirthlin gave me in l970 right after then California Governor Ronald Reagan's re-election, I must say I consider some of the recent findings most remarkable.<P>

The public does understand that President Clinton is less than honest. The public believes that the White House is not telling the truth on filegate. The public believes that Hillary Clinton is lying. The public thinks that Bill Clinton is not a good role model for children. The public thinks that the Clintons have covered up their role in Whitewater. But the public says they want Bill Clinton to be President anyway.<P>

Because I rise at 4:30 every morning, I seldom watch the late night TV shows. But I didn't have to get up Saturday morning so I tuned in for a change. Non stop jokes about Bill and Hillary. Jokes about the President dating while in office. Jokes about the President's friends serving time in prison. Lots of jokes about the First Lady, and that was before the revelations about her conversations with long dead political figures. For example, in comparing music to politics, Jay Leno said that in music Dolly Parton does 9 to 5. But in politics Hillary Clinton will be doing 5 to 9. And so it goes, I am told, night after night and the audience cheers, yet they continue to favor the President's re-election. <P>

What gives here? How could voters believe someone is dishonest, has become a sort of national joke, and yet is favored to win in November.<P>

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson thinks the problem is that the media has so devalued the Presidency that voters now believe it doesn't matter who we present as our leader to the rest of the world. Author Kevin Phillips believes that the voters are so cynical, since they believe all politicians are dishonest, that they simply are inclined to be with the devil they know rather than the devil they don't know.<P>

I think there is a third factor at work. When you quiz voters about why they favor Bill Clinton's re-election, they will tell you that he understands their problems more than his rivals. Others will say he will do more for them than his opponents. I think what we have here is the ultimate conclusion of the "me generation". Bill Clinton is the defender of the status quo as far as government benefits are concerned. So voters are saying "I know this President is dishonest, but what the heck. He'll see to it I don't get hit too hard, so I'm going to support him and frankly I don't care what happens to the rest of the country." <P>

I think back to the young man who asked the l992 Presidential candidates at one of the debates how they were going to take care of him. Instead of telling the kid to go take care of himself, the candidates all fell over themselves telling him what they were going to do for him, but Bill Clinton gave him the most sympathetic answer. <P>

I think my driver John Blackwell, who also drives a taxi part-time in Washington and thus is in touch with the real world, has the right answer. Blackwell points out that over half of the population is now dependent on a government check of one kind or another. "The voters are just looking at their own pockets and thinking that Bill Clinton will keep their checks coming", Blackwell said. I am afraid he is right. <P>

It worked in Roman times. Bread and circuses kept the population happy as their freedoms were taken away. The public doesn't want to face the bad news that we are going bankrupt as a nation. That our debt is robbing us and especially our children and grandchildren blind. In a few more years, there simply won't be any money at all to pay the bills. But, hey, that's after Bill Clinton leaves office after his second term. Why should we worry? <P>

September 24, 1996
</h3>
<h2>VMI Decision Tragic for the Nation</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
A tragedy occurred in the State of Virginia over the weekend for which the whole nation will pay. By a one-vote margin, the Board of Visitors of the Virginia Military Institute voted to end its 157 years as an all-male academy. Beginning with the 1997 school term, VMI will admit women.
<P>
By the same 9 - 8 vote, the Board also rejected a plan to take the school private - a move by which the Board could have avoided a court order requiring the admittance of women.
<P>
The action against VMI began in the Bush Administration. The State of Virginia fought against it. But earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state-supported all-male schools are unconstitutional. Never mind that the State of Virginia has opened a military academy just for women so that women who desired a military education could have an equal chance to do so under the law. No, that wasn't good enough for the fanatical Supreme Court, the majority of whose Justices deserve to be impeached for undermining the Constitution.
<P>
Nevertheless, the Virginia Board of Visitors could have maintained VMI's all-male status by voting to take VMI private, thereby placing the school out of the reach of the court ruling. But, the Board voted not to. What was tragic about that narrow decision is that it was dictated not by what is right for the country whose military VMI serves, not by what was best for the students attending VMI, not by the wishes of the alumni who were prepared to raise the money to buy the school, but by the liberal media and its accomplices in the political community.
<P>
Virginia's Republican Governor, George Allen, who had originally supported VMI in its court case, changed his position, a few days before the Board of Visitors meeting. Allen got a case of political correctness and declared VMI should not go private because the media would make it into a pariah institution. That statement was enough to tip the balance in favor of admitting women. Several of Governor Allen's appointees to the Board of Visitors voted to reject the motion to take the school private.
<P>
Thanks, Governor Allen, the supposed conservative Republican with national ambitions. We'll remember this whenever you seek whatever office it is you want after leaving the Governorship next year.
<P>
I well recall the words of Dr. Ben Alexander, the former President of The University of the District of Columbia. He courageously tried to get rid of the politician imposed students who were not there to learn but just to get a worthless degree. Dr. Alexander wanted to place standards on UDC. He was doing exactly the right thing. Many of us tried to help him. But he resigned. Afterward, I asked him why he resigned when it was the right fight at the right time. He said because he was told that if he continued to fight the Washington Post would ruin him. "If I had NET back then, I might well have stayed to fight," Dr. Alexander said. But this was in the early 80's before there were many alternative means of communications.
<P>
Ben Alexander at least had an excuse. What is the excuse of the majority on the VMI Board? That their Governor considers them an embarrassment? That they would be attacked by the national media? Just when are we going to get some people in this country who will say "I don't care if we get attacked. This is the right thing to do. We are going forward." I will tell you there would be an emotional outpouring of support that would amaze and overwhelm the politicians. 
<P>
But no, the majority on the VMI Board had to listen to the state's chief politician who just didn't want the fight, lest it damage his plans for national office. Well, Governor Allen has likely brought VMI to the end of the line as a viable institution. "Without a distinctive, attractive educational niche, VMI, a small school with limited offerings in close proximity to three major state universities, will lose its ability to compete for students," Anita Blair, a VMI trustee who voted in favor of taking the school private, said after the vote. "A coed VMI soon will become indistinguishable from the existing cadet programs at Virginia Tech and elsewhere." She is absolutely right. And who will suffer in the process? The U.S. military which has used VMI to train officers now for over a Century and a half.
<P>
Isn't it time that the American public and the politicians asked themselves why it is that the media should be able to dictate what private citizens want to do? The pseudo macho majority on the VMI Board said they aren't going to change a thing at VMI when it admits women. Right. They claim that the tradition of treating freshmen cadets as rats, with shaved heads, will continue. It will never happen. But even if it did I would be against it. Women, even if they desire this kind of punishment, should not be treated this way and as the Citadel has proven, at the end of the day, they won't be.
<P>
It is all part of the effort to pretend that men and women are all the same. It is the same sort of pretend world that the Soviets invented with their concept of the "new man." It defies reality. But this sort of fiction is permitted to continue because politicians such as Governor Allen refuse to stand up and fight for what is right.
<P>
It is no wonder that Robert Bork was motivated to write his new book "Slouching Toward Gomorra." The culture is collapsing, not just because forces of evil such as elements of the media are pushing it in that direction, but because in public life there are no real men left who are willing to stand up and say "enough is enough."
<P>

<h2>Clinton and Terrorism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
It is an all too familiar sound. President Clinton, in a broadcast to the nation, offers
                      sympathy to the families of the victims of terrorism. Then he insists that no stone
                      will be left unturned to track down and punish those responsible. 
<P>
                      Those words, used over and over again recently after the blast in Saudi Arabia,
                      after TWA's Flight 800 and after the Olympic pipe bomb incident, just to name a
                      few in the past weeks, may comfort the nation. But the deeds of the Clinton
                      Administration are another matter. 
<P>
                      One of the nation's leading experts on terrorism told me privately the other day that
                      this Administration has resisted doing what is absolutely necessary if we are
                      actually serious about tracking down those responsible, and if we truly want to
                      prevent future incidents of terrorism. The Administration doesn't want to use human
                      agents to infiltrate suspected terrorist groups. 
<P>
                      "The problem with the Clinton Administration", this expert in terrorism told me, "is
                      that they think you can track down everything by satellite and other electronic
                      means. But in combating terrorism, there is no substitute for having real live bodies
                      on the scene. That's how you really get the job done". 
<P>
                      It is ironic too because after Oklahoma City, when it was clear that the suspects
                      were domestic anarchists, the Administration was only too willing to engage in
                      spying. The Republican Congress finally stripped most of those powers from the
                      legislation which Bill Clinton submitted to Congress. 
<P>
                      But when it comes to the international variety, the Administration, trapped by its
                      own l960's view of the world, rejects escalated spying. 
<P>
                      That is, in fact, typical of the attitude of the far left, which formed its attitudes about
                      spying in the depth of the cold war. Somehow, for the far left, it was acceptable for
                      the Soviets to have their agents everywhere in the United States. But it was
                      impermissible for the United States to spy on Soviet activities. The left has never
                      been shy about double standards. 
<P>
                      President Clinton is one of the most able Presidents we have ever employed when
                      it comes to sympathizing with the victims of terrorism. The relatives of those killed
                      in TWA Flight 800 sang the praises of Clinton as he spent several hours with them
                      last week. His efforts in that regard are commendable.
<P>
                      But the one effective thing Clinton could do for those relatives-- to track down
                      those who were responsible for the tragedy itself by the most effective means
                      possible, the President is reluctant to do.

<h2>Lamm Candidacy Adds Dimension</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
I was out of the country when former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm announced that he was going to run for President. Fortunately, I returned last night from Bulgaria just in time to see the repeat of that press conference on C SPAN.<P>
Lamm has burned his bridges and has now agreed to support the nominee of the Reform party, even if that nominee is Ross Perot, against whom Lamm is now running for the Presidential nomination.<P>
On the surface Lamm's candidacy looks like a quixotic one. He is barely known outside of Colorado. He is running in the party which Perot founded with Perot's money. It is unclear who will vote in that party primary, which is being conducted by mail over a several day period.<P>
Lamm has only about a month to get himself well enough known that he would have a shot at defeating Perot in the Reform party primary. Given his lack of financial resources, Lamm would seem to be a sure loser to Perot. But Lamm is touching a chord with his message. In fact, his candidacy was the result of his stark assessment of where we as a nation have gone wrong. He delivered that assessment to a state convention in California. Delegates, right then and there, circulated a petition and urged Lamm to run. Other states followed. This prompted Perot, who had planned on a coronation for the Reform party nomination, to announce prematurely that he was likely to run again and so the campaign has begun.
Mind you I completely disagree with Governor Lamm's social issues policies. We are about as far apart as two people can get on that spectrum. But I have long admired Dick Lamm as a man who believes in what he says and has the courage of his convictions.<P>
I am also a big fan of former Colorado Senator Bill Armstrong, who in my view, missed his calling by not being a Presidential candidate in 1996. I think he would have swept all the others away. Were he the nominee, Republicans would not now be facing the sort of electoral disaster that awaits them if Bill Clinton continues to hold on to the sort of numbers he has now.<P>
The year was 1984 and Armstrong was seeking his second term in the U.S. Senate. Dick Lamm was then Governor of Colorado and widely thought to be a possible candidate for the Senate. Armstrong proposed that if Lamm were the Democratic candidate for the Senate, the two of them should go city by city throughout Colorado together, debating the issues. For whatever reason Lamm did not run that year. I suspect he wasn't sure he could defeat the equally articulate Armstrong.<P>
What a Senate campaign that would have been. Two of the most knowledgeable and attractive candidates ever to have run for public office debating real issues in the public forum. That is the way our system ought to work. <P>
Now Lamm is out there for President and the odds are very much against him. Unfortunately he has to run at a time when the American voters are least tuned into politics. It is a pity because, agree or disagree, they need to hear what Lamm has to say. He is making points that other politicians simply refuse to talk about. True, Bob Dole does pay lip service to the notion that excessive spending by government is not a good idea, even though he has helped to pass much of what he now complains about.<P>
Lamm, coming as he does from the liberal wing of the Democratic party, has the greater impact on such issues. What Dole says is expected from a Republican candidate. When Lamm says it, it has real credibility. Dick Lamm is to entitlements and the bankruptcy of America what Richard Nixon was to China. His message is tough, but he has a non-threatening personality. Lamm can say what he says without scaring people the way some republicans manage to do so. He makes you stop and think. And by the way, what he says about entitlements is the same thing that senators Al Simpson of Wyoming and Robert Kerry of Nebraska have been saying now for some time. Perhaps at the Presidential level Lamm can get the audience Simpson and Kerry have never managed to get.<P>
I wish Dick Lamm well. His policies on values questions preclude my voting for him but I think he is doing the nation a service just by running. He brings a desperately needed level of candor to the Presidential campaign in which Bill Clinton lies, Bob Dole speaks unintelligibly, and Ross Perot speaks only in platitudes.<P>
If by some wholly unexpected chance he were to defeat Perot in his own primary and go on to the general election, Lamm would totally destabilize the November election scene. Liberals would have an alternative to Bill Clinton and conservatives whose primary focus is our entitlement mess would have an alternative to Bob Dole. A debate between the three of them is a Presidential campaign to die for.<P>
Just like the exciting possibility back in Colorado in 1984, it is unlikely to happen. But given this uninspiring political campaign, our thanks to Dick Lamm for giving us something to at least dream about.<P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 21, 1997
</h3> <h2>Getting on With the Business of Governing</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Now that
the shallow rhetoric of the inauguration is history, and now that the latest Gingrich matter
has been disposed of at least for the moment, may we please get down to the business of
running this nation?<p>

There is much pious talk about everyone getting along. There are all of these platitudes
about bipartisanship. There are visions of leaders meeting at a summit to come up with grand
agreements.<p>

Now let's get real.  The fact is while everything has been at a standstill since the
elections, the national debt has continued to expand.  Not a word has been heard by any of
our leadership about tackling that one. Oh, the deficit is down. But the deficit isn't the
problem.  It is the debt that is the problem and almost no one from either party is
discussing this little item which threatens to sink us all.<p>

Then there is the matter of Social Security. Some members of the latest Commission have
actually recommended that Social Security be privatized.  The defenders of the status quo
have, of course, said no.  At least this issue is at last, after years of total silence,
being debated.  The advocates of privatization need champions in the Congress.  They have
none in this Administration. Right now there are too many voices accusing and defending
Speaker Gingrich to find out if anyone is aware that we do have a Social Security problem on
our hands which urgently needs fixing.<p>

And then there is Medicare.  The President wants a fix which will last just long enough for
him to get out of office without the "gone bankrupt" sign being nailed to the door on the
oval office.  Some Republicans are talking about block grants to the states.  Others are
talking about privatization of Medicare through Medical Savings Accounts.  There are lots of
proposals.  No real solutions at hand. And the beat goes on.<p>

The food stamp problem gets worse every year.  The Congress did not have the political will
to do something about it in the 104th.  Does anyone think that the 105th Congress has more
political will than the last gathering?  If, however, this problem isn't tackled, the
welfare reform bill which passed in the last Congress and which Bill Clinton now wants to
repeal will end up effecting very little of the welfare mess this nation has amassed.  That
bill, after all, effected just six percent of the welfare and entitlement programs which are
federally funded.<p>

I am just touching on a few things here.  I haven't tackled regulation, national defense,
the evils of multinationalism, trade and a whole host of other problems staring us in the
face.  And we have time to utter meaningless slogans such as "nothing big has ever come from
being small?"  These problems come close to overwhelming us and yet we can spend days
pondering where the money should come from to pay Speaker Gingrich's fine?<p>

The way we are governed reminds me of how certain of my kids became experts at diverting
their parent's attention from the real issues we wanted them to face.  They did this by
creating a series of side shows.  The side shows were amusing for a time.  They even
succeeded in distracting us for a while.  Sooner or later, however, we and they had to face
the music.<p>

That time has come for America.  We've had our little vacation from reality.  The
celebrations are over.  Now, will someone, anyone, please propose some solutions which will
have lasting impact on the genuine problems facing the country?  Or as my kids used to ask:
"Are we there yet?" <P>

"Doles Bold Move"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
<P>
<P>
"Doles Bold Move"
<P>
I thought I would wait until the dust settled a bit before commenting on Senate Majority Leader Bob Doles gamble to resign and run without office for the Presidency. That I was surprised by this development is an understatement. That Sheila Burke was not one of the five people in the world who knew several weeks ahead of time that Dole was going to do this, is the best element of all. It demonstrated that at last Dole had shed his emotional dependence on Burke, which is a positive development. <P>
Dole demonstrated that it is possible to teach an old political dog new tricks. Most of us who thought we knew him well did not believe he had it in him to pull this off. After all, even if he lost the Presidency, Dole still would have been the Republican Leader. Although there was brave talk about running someone against him, when it came to the moment of truth, he probably would have remained Republican Leader for another two years. <P>
The Dole move probably means that Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott becomes Majority Leader. He will likely prove to be a far more energetic and able Leader than Dole and that has boosted the morale of the Republican Senators. So giving all of this up to go after the big prize indeed was a stunning development, at least in Washington. In the rest of the nation, it was not greeted as such a remarkable event because the rest of the nation is sensibly not as caught up in politics as Washington. <P>
The Dole move did have an effect on his campaign. It gave his troops new hope that he could win, which is something he badly needed to do. It afforded him a new opportunity to redefine himself. Up to now, to the extent that anyone knew anything about Bob Dole, it was that he was the consummate Washington Insider, not exactly a compliment these days. The Dole move represents a break with the past, even though stunned Democrats bitterly complain that Dole cant shed 36 years of Congressional service just like that. <P>
Now comes the hard part. Without the advantages that being Senate Majority Leader gave him to generate headlines, Dole must distinguish himself boldly from President Bill Clinton. Can Dole, who supports Clinton on Bosnia and China really distinguish himself from Clinton on foreign policy? Can Dole, who is no stranger to tax increases, really be credible in calling for a tax rate reduction? Can Dole, who voted for almost all of Bill Clintons judicial appointments, really come down hard on the sort of judges Bill Clinton has appointed? <P>
The Dole camp has maintained that this election would be about character and integrity. Unfortunately for Dole, all of the latest polls show that the public, by a large margin, actually believes Bill Clinton is more honest and has greater integrity than Bob Dole. That is probably the most remarkable development of this campaign. If someone like Bill Clinton, who has made a career out of dissembling, can sell honesty and integrity to the American public, Bob Dole had better hope that he can distinguish himself from Clinton on issues.<P>
Clinton is not helping Dole in any way. Dole was about to deliver a speech on welfare reform and the Clinton folks heard about it. Clinton rushed to embrace the welfare reform model proposed by Wisconsin Republican Governor Tommy Thompson. Republican Governors were outraged, but Bill Clinton got on the scoreboard first. <P>
A  Washington Times cartoon showed Clinton in the form of a parrot in a cage next to a radio. On the radio was news of Doles impending speech on welfare reform. The Clinton-like parrot squawked "Welfare reform. Bawk. Welfare reform." That is about the size of it but Clinton has done it well. <P>
The truth is that the Republican Congress sent the President two versions of welfare reform, both of which he had praised at one point. Clinton vetoed both. <P>
Therein lies the one hook that Dole has on Clinton and one which could prove to be decisive in this campaign. The President says one thing and does the opposite. Voters may think they trust Bill Clinton right now. They may think he agrees with them on the issues. But if Dole can pound home the truth that Bill Clinton is, in a sea of Washington hypocrisy, the biggest fish of them all, then Dole may actually have an effective weapon against the President. <P>
Voters, at the end of the day, dislike hypocrisy more than anything else. It remains to be seen if Dole can be bold enough, after this very bold restart to his campaign, to carry that issue to the finish line. <P>

<h2>
Third-party Candidate Would Force the Issues
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm has announced that he is joining the Reform Party of Ross Perot and has suggested that if Perot himself does not run for President, he (Lamm) just might do so. I hope he does. Not that I could vote for the former Governor of my adopted state. His positions on some of the social issues preclude that. But Dick Lamm is one very forthright and candid fellow. 
<P>Unlike Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Lamm is willing to frankly discuss the need to get entitlements under control. Dick Lamm doesnt mind touching the so called third rail of American politics, namely Social Security. Governor Lamm is willing to tackle the enormous problem of the trillions of dollars in unfunded mandates. Lamm will discuss, while the others will not, the effect that our crushing national debt will have on future generations. Governor Lamm is not afraid to raise the conflict of interest questions which plague both political parties. He may be wrong on some things, but he is one honest fellow. 
<P>Dick Lamm, barring some remarkable turn of events, wont be elected President if he is out there running on a third party ticket. But Dick Lamm can do an immense service to the American public by forcing the major parties to face up to the issues he raises. True, Perot has raised some of the same issues. But Perot is regarded as an eccentric. Lamm is non-threatening, yet highly articulate. He was very popular among voters in both parties when he was Governor of Colorado, even though he frequently said the unthinkable. 
<P>Numbers, charts, graphs, and even the reality of the impending bankruptcy of Medicare have not forced the major parties to face the truth. Americas debt is killing its future. But Dick Lamm, if he turns out to be the Reform Party candidate, will force the debate which America should have been having on these issues since 1960, indeed since the 1930s. 
<P>America badly needs this debate. Our future depends on it. Thats why members of all parties, regardless of philosophy, ought to be cheering on Governor Lamm. If he runs, and raises the issues the other candidates refuse to face, the entire political landscape will change. Then maybe, just maybe, the 1996 election will have a lasting impact. <P>

<b>Senator Dole</b>: Thank you very much.  It's a privilege for me to be here, and a privilege to see Ben Franklin again.  He was just telling me about his childhood with Senator Thurmond.  But Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and the rest of our founding fathers probably never imagined the
 technology that produced the computer age, and the Internet.  But one thing they did imagine -- a
 government closer to the people; a government that listened to the people, and a public that took active
 involvement in the issues today, and that is what Town Hall is all about.  Thanks to Town Hall, Americans are into the information age and the super-highway to take a detour around the traditional media road blocks.  And I am just one of countless Americans, who will be taking a right on the information highway, and heading straight for Town Hall.<p><hr>

<title> Town Hall Launch</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Town Hall Launch</h2>
June 29, 1995
</center>
<p>
<hr size="3" width="45%">
<p>
<b>Tim Butler</b>: About four years ago <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> had an idea.  Now there is nothing new there, but he understood that a new emerging on-line technology was going to have a tremendous impact on the way America and the world communicates.  He also understood that the conservative movement must embrace
 these new communications opportunities.  The result of that is Town Hall.  Today Town Hall moves into a new dimension, the Internet.  And I'm very pleased to introduce the man behind the dream, Dr. Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., Town Hall's Chairman of the Board.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Thanks very much Tim, for that very nice introduction.  I appreciate it.  I'm very pleased to have with me my colleague from the Town Hall Board of Directors, Ed Capanno whose real job is publisher of <a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html"><i>National Review</i></a>.  Town Hall, from its very beginning, has been a joint project of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> and <i>National Review</i>.  And Ed, it's been a great learning curb for us, certainly, and we've been through a lot, but I think today bears witness to the fact that it has been worth working at.
<p>
 We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, Town Hall has been created to serve people.  To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue -- an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who's interested.
<p>
 And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.
<p>
Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty, joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families, their children, and their communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.
<p>
I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation and National Review, together, created Town Hall as the conservative meeting place on the Internet, and I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.
<p>
 From the Senate, we have Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country.  In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a national leader -- a man of action and a man of accomplishment.
<p>
On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.
<p>
 We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began
 with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
<p>
Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  We're honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to produce someone who ought to know.  Please welcome in his 290th year, the father of invention and innovation, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.
<p>
Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboards and Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors, please?
<p>
<b>Benjamin Franklin</b>: Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand
  nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good
  will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny, and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentlemen, on the count of  three.... one ... two ... three ... start your engines.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Alright!  Town Hall is officially launched!
<p>
Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, you too Mr. Franklin.  Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations who vision and creativity have spurred them to join in this innovative effort.  I'm very please to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.
<p>
As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall on big screen.
<p>
<ul>
<li>First, please welcome, <a href="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a>, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/welcome.html">American Conservative Union</a>.
<li>Next, Shades of the Boston Tea Party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.
<li>It is a great pleasure to welcome Charlie Kupperman Executive Director of <a href="/empower/welcome.html ">Empower America</a>.
<li><a href="/townhall/FRC/bauer.html">Gary Bauer</a>, President of the <a href="/townhall/FRC/welcome.html">Family Research Council</a>.  Welcome aboard, Gary.
<li>Representing <a href="/lead-inst/home.html">The Leadership Institute</a>, William Forrest, its Vice President.
<li>The Executive Director of the <a href="/taxcom/welcome.html.cgi">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>, Grace-Marie Arnett, unfortunately is unable to attend.
<li>We are delighted to also have with us, <a href="/nmp/home.html">National Minority Politics</a> and its distinguished publisher,<a href="/nmp/i-col.html"> Willie Richardson</a>.
<li>John O'Sullivan, Editor of <a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html"><i>National Review</I></a> Magazine.
<li><a href="/pff/people/staff.html">Bethany Noble</a>, Vice President of the <a href="/pff/">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a>.
<li>The president of the <a href="/sbsc/home.html">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, Karen Kerrigan.
<li>We're indeed pleased to announce that the <a href="/wash_times/">Washington Times National Weekly Edition</a> will be on Town Hall and represented is its Editor-in-Chief, Wes Pruden.
<li><a href="/yaf/home.html">The Young America's Foundation's</a>, <a href="/yaf/sharp.html">Michelle Sharp</a>, Director of Lectures, is here.
<li>And Finally, my colleague -- <a href="/heritage/staff/truluck.htm">Phil Truluck</a>, the Executive Vice President of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>.
</ul>
<p>
As Tim said, it's a great starting line-up, but only the beginning of a conservative community.  We thank  you all for being here today.  I would now like to give you all an opportunity to hear from our two  wonderful leaders here today.  It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- the Honorable Newt Gingrich.

<img alt="Picture of Speaker Gingrich" src="gingrich.jpg"><p>


<b>Speaker Gingrich</b></a>: I want to say first of all that I am delighted to be here.  I was explaining to Senator Dole that last night we pretended we were the Senate.  And we ran all night, and we're not use to this, we didn't get out till almost ten o'clock this morning.  He's used to these kind of marathons where you have to go all the time, but we're not quite that tough.  I'm a little blurry eyed, but delighted to be here.  I believe this is part of entering the information age, I think that this is a very important commitment to reach out and to allow literally people around the entire planet to be able to interact, have ideas, to have dialogues, to know
what's going on.  And to contribute good ideas.  And I'm just delighted that Ed Feulner brought all of us
together here today, to participate in creating Town Hall, and I can tell you from our stand point we look
forward to having lots of Americans, and frankly lots of people all across the world, to share with us their
ideas and their comments, and then to work with the various groups who will have their pages on this site.  We're very grateful, and I'm delighted to behalf of the House Republicans to be here to help inaugurate this.<p><br>

<h2>An Examination of Election Results</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Some random and hopefully not too disconnected thoughts about yesterday's elections. 
<DD>First, we had the lowest voter turnout since the Presidential election of 1924 when the Democratic nominee John Davis was actually more conservative than the Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge. Those who wanted change opted out. It says a lot about our system when half of those who registered have declined to participate. Candidates of both parties failed to address the real concerns on the minds of the American people. Both parties are on life support systems, but, as if often the case, neither recognizes it yet.
<DD>Second, the big loser in this election was organized labor. They spent a minimum of $200 million to try to buy the Congress and it didn't work. Some of the money which was spent was spent illegally. That needs to be investigated.
<DD>Third, coming out of this election will be a big push for Common Cause-style campaign reform. If the Congress is foolish enough to pass such a bill, it will only make a bad system worse. Yes, we need to get foreign money out of politics. But as far as American citizens are concerned, we need to deregulate the process, not make it more difficult for candidates to comply with cumbersome laws.
<DD>Fourth, the caucuses of both parties in Congress in both Houses will be further apart as the result of the election. Republicans in this Congress are more conservative. It is hard to find liberal Republicans these days. It is equally hard to find conservtive Democrats. The Democrats in the Congress are more liberal.
<DD>Fifth, Bill Clinton may, in due course, wish he had lost. Investigations of wrong-doing in the Administration will continue and this time the Republicans will have their act together a bit better. Moreover, the bills are now going to come due for Bill Clinton from organized labor, the enviornmentalists and the radical lifestyle community. He will have to pay up or risk losing his base. But when he pays up, he will be perceived as moving to the left. That, in turn, will strengthen the Republicans in the next election, known as the six-year-itch election.
<DD>Every six years of a Presidential cycle where one party keeps the Presidency for eight years in a row produces a six-year reaction of great proportions. FDR caught it in 1938. Truman in 1946, Eisenhower in 1958, Johnson in 1966, Reagan in 1986. The last two years of the Clinton Administration, if he survives that long, may turn Clinton into the all-time lame duck.
<DD>Sixth, some of the non-Presidential and Congressional results may be, in the long run, more significant. The California Civil Rights initiavtive was passed handily, dealing a blow to affirmative action programs. Look for similiar initiatives elsewhere in the USA , which may even force the leadership of the 105th Congress to act. Meanwhile, Tax limitation initiatives passed nearly everywhere. A unique term-limits measure passed in nine states and may even yet pass in two others. If upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, this particular measure may finally be the key to winning the term-limits issue at the national level. If a district votes in favor of term limits and the Congressman disregards the voter's wishes, that information would be right there on the ballot the next time that Member of Congress came up for election.
<DD>Seventh, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who became the whipping-boy of the liberals, can take some comfort in the defeat of Harold Volkmer in Missouri. While David Bonior was very strident, Volkmer became a pathalogical opponent of the Speaker's. Volkmer will not be back next year. Gingrich will be. But all the power he managed to get the Republican caucus to cede to him at the beginning of the 104th Congress may not be appropriate for him as he tries to govern his reduced majority in the 105th Congress. He may be forced to give back some of that power to his colleagues to keep the ship together. By the way, the GOP loss in the House which will be anywherefrom 7 to 10 seats, compares very favorably to pick-ups for Presidents being re-elected to a second term. Ronald Reagan, in winning his landslide in 1984, gained 14 seats in the House.  
<DD>Finally, while there were some excellent men and women who were elected to Congress yesterday, there were few known leaders. We suffer so greatly for lack of leadership. Maybe the Lord will see fit to raise a few of them up to help lead this nation back to sanity.

"Elite Hits Justice Thomas Again"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was invited to speak next month at the Thomas G. Pullen Creative and Performing Arts School in Maryland.  This week, school officials say they have now "uninvited" Justice Thomas.  They have told him not to address the schools June 10 awards ceremony. The reason: because of  threats of a protest.
<P>``Several parents and other community members ... expressed their concern about a possible visit by Justice Thomas and in fact, threatened to stage some kind of protest, Chris Cason, a spokesman for the Prince Georges County school system in suburban Maryland, said Wednesday.
<P>In short, Maryland school officials have told a member of the United States Supreme Court he is suddenly no longer welcome at their event because the school system is now worried about even the threat of a protest from several people.  What the leaders of this school system have done is shameful. They have dishonored their original commitment to Justice Thomas and by doing so they have dishonored themselves as well as the school system they are supposed to represent. They have chosen to cower to threats of a few rather than stand on the principle of their original commitment.
<P>The action by Marylands Prince Georges County school system sends a chilling message to students. In effect what the school system says by this is that children must heed the bullying threats of the few in order to get along. It says children must put aside doing what is right in favor of doing what is safe. The action signals to children that freedom of speech for the many can be shouted down even by the threatened protest of an elite few.
<P>Of course, it is no accident that the uninvited Justice is Clarence Thomas, who is, by the way, one the most principled jurists ever named to the bench.  You see, unlike the leaders of this Maryland school district, Justice Thomas is not politically correct. His actions are not dictated by the threats of the radical few. In decision after decision on the bench, he has proven an unwavering loyalty to one thing: the United States Constitution. Because of that, almost daily, Justice Thomas is pummeled by the liberal media which hates the idea of a black conservative holding a such a powerful position.
<P>But theres one thing in particular that Justice Thomas has going for him: he doesnt care what they think. In a meeting several months with liberal reporters who complained about his position on the issues, Justice Thomas told them, "Im here to stay. Deal with it!"
<P>Deal with it. The character of Justice Clarence Thomas has been horribly and ignobly assassinated by the establishment elite and yet this man lives.
<P>The action of the Prince Georges County, Maryland, school system proves one thing: there are two kinds of public officials: those who cower before the shrill of an elite few and those who act according to principle. Pity the students: the former have defrauded these children the right to hear the latter.<P>

<h2>The Establishment is Having a Fit</h2>
<P>

<P>
                      Establishment Republicans across the country are upset at the rising influencing of
                      anti-establishment Conservatives in their party. These party professionals have drawn
                      quiet sympathy from their Democratic counterparts who share their disdain over the
                      revolutionary voices of an anti-Washington public threatening the status quo of the
                      cozy two-party system.
<P>
                      In Kansas, the establishment has quietly criticized Sam Brownback, a conservative
                      freshman Congressman, because he is running for Bob Dole's vacated Senate seat.
                      The Republican establishment has chosen a liberal to fill the seat, and view
                      Brownback as a threat to the carefully-crafted status quo.
<P>
                      In South Carolina, eleven Christian conservatives outpaced former Governor Carroll
                      Campbell this Spring in the voting for the state's delegates to the National Convention.
                      Campbell was furious that unknowns would challenge the establishment. "I play in a
                      much bigger league than they do," Campbell later told reporters. "I don't have time to
                      fool with them."
<P>
                      All of this intolerance towards anti-establishment conservatives is masked in official
                      calls for tolerance toward liberals in the Republican party. The center of gravity in
                      today's political debate is the culture. The issue most symbolic of the cultural debate is
                      abortion. It is for this reason that the establishment insists on language of tolerance
                      only in the abortion plank.
<P>                      At the same time, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic
                      Platform. Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually
                      says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would
                      have no guarantee of saving unborn lives. The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts
                      the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the
                      practice. Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes
                      in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.

                      While the two parties continue to apply a double meaning to the term "tolerance," a
                      vast group of Americans have begun to rethink their support for the Republican Party.
                      In fact, the day is coming when ordinary American voters will no longer be able to tell
                      the two parties apart. When that happens, it is likely that a new, anti-establishment
                      party will arise, fueled by a public outraged at being ignored by both Republicans and
                      Democrats.

                      You see the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms. The real
                      contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest
                      which pits Washington against its own citizens. Let's be honest about one thing: the
                      Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by professional
                      politicians. It is this same establishment that long ago took Washington into captivity,
                      controlling the media, lobbying for special interests

<h2>Schools Sending the Wrong Message</h2>
<P>
"Direct Line" Commentary<br>
By Special Columnist <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<P>
<br>
<DD>Lately it seems that America's schools are spending more time playing parent than teaching our kids how read, write, and spell. Schools all over the country are getting out of hand with their "It Takes A Village" mentality, confusing their role as educators with the role of parents, or acting fearful that one wrong move will bring on a lawsuit.
<P>Take for example the most recent news of Kimberly Smartt, the girl who was suspended for four months for taking a Midol tablet and giving one to a friend. The school claims that she violated the drug policy and is forcing her to pay for and undergo drug counseling. Kimberly, who is black, claims she is a victim of race discrimination and is suing the school superintendent, school principal and the county board of education. All of this over a drug that is as harmless as Tylenol and caffeine and a problem that could have been solved with one trip to the principal's office. What makes this situation more outrageous is that this very same girl could be given a condom or help in obtaining an abortion by the school without a blink of an eye.
<P>You may also remember the case in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania where 39 8th grade girls were given gynecological exams without their parents' consent. The school not only didn't think there was anything wrong with this, they actually argued that they were mandated by law to do it. No outrage on the part of the school there.
<P>And how about the schools around the country that are making it mandatory for students to volunteer as a requirement of graduation. Not just any volunteer work will do, it must be approved by the school and as you may have guessed, activities including religion or pro-life work is frowned upon or not allowed at all.
<P>What all of this means is that the liberal Department of Education and Hillary devotees are having an impact on our school system to the degree that education is now secondary. The schools know what's best for your child even if it defies common sense and violates your moral beliefs. Bob Dole articulated the first step in solving this problem the other night during the debate. When asked if he still supported abolishing the Department of Education, he said yes. What more needs to be said?

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Wednesday, December 18, 1996
</h3> <h2>People Are Tired Of The Media Elite</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD>The Media
Research Center engaged the Harris poll to do a survey of the news media and, in the words
of Robert Lichter, the Center's Director, "people are tired of the media elite." <DD> It is
about time. Media has been out of control in this nation for a long while, especially with
the shift to advocacy journalism which occurred in the late 1960's and early 1970's
accelerated by Watergate. Now two thirds of the public, according to Harris, want just the
facts rather than the journalists' judgment calls in stories involving public figures. <DD>
The top complaints the public has against journalists are the following: Journalists ignore
people's privacy. Ask Richard Jewell if he agrees with that one. Journalists are politically
biased. The funny thing is that everyone from Jesse Jackson to Jesse Helms would agree with
that complaint. Journalists are too influenced by the powerful. The real problem here isn't
that journalists are paid off. The problem is that the powerful have access to important
information and they become the sources for the journalists. You don't bite the hand that
feeds you. Journalists provide one sided coverage. Take a look at any story, on television
or in a major metropolitan daily. You will find that the opposing viewpoint to the thesis of
the story will either be at the very end of the story, mentioned only briefly, or it will be
entirely missing. <DD> Journalists are too negative. The prevailing attitude in newsrooms
these days is that America is among the worst places on earth and that we are responsible
for most of the world's problems. If you have that view, it is not hard to be negative.
Journalists have too much influence. I can personally report on hundreds of meetings I have
attended with political figures over the past 30 years, the outcome of which was driven by
fears of the media and not by what was best for the nation. Journalists abuse freedom of the
press. Nothing is sacred anymore to some journalists. If you know it, air it is their
slogan, regardless of who is hurt. <DD> Journalists don't care about people. We live in a
cynical age, but you can take that cynicism to the l0th power by surveying any newsroom. The
media makes people guilty until proven innocent and when they are proven innocent they drop
the story. The media portrays too much violence. The media believes that the public has an
insatiable appetite for the gory details on everything and judging by the ratings of various
TV shows, the media may be right on that score. The media is often inaccurate. Concern for
accuracy went out the window with The New York Times v. Sullivan case. In that case, since
expanded by the U.S. Supreme Court, the ruling was that anyone suing the media over
misstatements had to prove malice in order to collect. That is well understood by the lowest
journalist on the ladder. <DD> The media is too sensational. Again, the public needs to look
to itself on this question. Unfortunately it is the sensational coverage of things which
gets the ratings and sells the papers. Journalists ignore their errors. They do indeed.
Retractions happen all too seldom on television and in the papers, retractions are generally
on page 2, the least read of all of the pages of the newspaper. I agree with most of the
findings of this survey, but one issue greatly disturbs me. An astounding 84% of the public
says that the government could require balanced reporting of controversial issues to the
point of imposing a fine for inaccurate or biased reporting. Hold on just a minute here. The
same people, a majority of whom in the Harris survey find the media too liberal, wants the
Clinton Administration to force balanced reporting? <DD> When we had the so called "Fairness
Doctrine" in force, we didn't have radio and television talk shows as we now know them
because most stations didn't want the burden of providing repines time for opposing
viewpoints. <DD> Government is not the solution to this very serious problem just as
government is not the solution to much of anything. This calls to mind the statement of
Senator Bill Cohen of Maine, Clinton's new Defense Secretary." Government," he said, "is the
enemy  until you need a friend." I am afraid that is the attitude of far too many Americans
these days. We complain about the excesses of big government, but as soon as there is a
problem as big as this one is, we want the government to solve it. The government is the
last place we want to turn to solve the problem of inaccurate, biased and abusive media.
Most Americans don't seem to understand that they have the power to control all of this. If
we don't buy their papers, advertisers won't spend their money to reach fewer and fewer
numbers. These papers will go out of business. If we turn off the news shows on radio and
television that we find are biased and provide one sided coverage, the ratings will do them
in. <DD> We don't need government. We need to match our outrage with the media with our
willingness to continue to buy their product. That's all for Direct Line for tonight. <P>

</h3> <h2>Colorado's Growing Importance in Party Politics</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD>In
one of Ayn Rand's novels, the final fight for freedom takes place in Colorado. Well, I don't
expect this to be the final fight, but it is entirely possible that the National Chairman of
both parties will be from Colorado.<p>

President Clinton has now named Roy Romer, the three term Governor of Colorado, as the new
Democratic National Chairman and there is a fair chance that Republicans will end up with
GOP National Committeeman Jim Nicholson of Colorado as the successor to Haley Barbour. 
Perhaps all the news organizations will suddenly need bureaus in Denver.<p>

I have known Romer for over 30 years.  When I was News Director for a Denver radio station
in the mid 1960's, then-State Senator Romer was a candidate for the US Senate in the 1966
elections. His opponent was incumbent Senator Gordon Allott who was seeking a third term. I
spent a day with each of them traveling the state to produce a half-hour documentary on each
candidate called "A Day with..."  That is how I met Allott who a few months later brought me
to Washington as his Press secretary.<p>

Romer is described as a Centrist Democrat.  I suppose compared with some of the outright
Marxists occupying Congressional seats these days, that may be a correct description. 
However, the real Romer is very much like Bill Clinton.  He talks right, acts left.  And he
has been able to stay in the Governor's chair, with a Republican legislature, for years now.
 As with Clinton, the voters like the rhetoric, and don't watch the actions.  I last saw
Romer when I was covering the Democratic National Convention last Summer in Chicago.  This
was at the time of the Dick Morris scandal and Romer complained bitterly that Morris was
being accused of all sorts of things without his side of the story being heard.  I asked him
if he spoke up at the time Clarence Thomas was going through the same ordeal.  He said "No,
but I thought about it."<p>

In Romer, Clinton will have someone who is almost as comfortable with the right spin as is
the President himself.  It is truly a match made in, well, probably not Heaven, but you get
the idea.<p>

On the other side, it is clear now that no candidate has a majority of the votes to become
GOP National Chairman.  Just-retired Governor Steve Merrill had the inside track until it
was revealed that he had appointed Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign chairman to the State
Supreme Court.  It was the only appointment he had, and not only was his appointee tied up
with Clinton, but he was a director of the hated Legal Services Corporation as well.  That
may be too much for even some of the bland wimpy Republicans who make up the majority of the
National Committee.  The Texas GOP Chairman, Tom Pauken, is also one of the front-runners,
and certainly is my sentimental favorite.  He has been laboring in the vineyards for nearly
four decades for the principles I support.  But given the composition of that committee it
is hard to believe that Pauken will make it, especially since former Governor Bill Clements
has said that the worst mistake he ever made was supporting  Pauken for state chairman. 
Translated, Pauken brought in so many of the great unwashed rural Protestants and urban
Catholics that the business establishment no longer controls the party.  My guess is that
Pauken won't fly.<p>

I also think that Norcross of New Jersey may prove to be too liberal for even this crowd. 
In former years Ohio Chairman Bob Bennett would have had a good chance because he has a
splendid record of party-building in Ohio, but he doesn't look attractive on television.  So
the race may boil down to a couple of businessmen, Chuck Yob of Michigan or Jim Nicholson of
Colorado.  The voting system eliminates the lowest vote-getter one at a time, so if he can
hang in there until the end, Nicholson stands a good chance.<p>

Nicholson is a businessman who has taught himself to be articulate.  He has also learned
through his business that it is the culture that really matters in the long run, so he would
be more attuned to those sorts of issues than would the usual Republican.<p>

This race is more important for the Republicans than the Democrats. Bill Clinton will
overshadow Roy Romer simply because he is in the White House.  Romer will be left to explain
what Clinton does.  Whoever becomes Republican Chairman will often be their voice going into
the '98 elections.<p>

Still, anything can happen in the Republican contest.  It depends on who is able to put the
best coalition together.  If it does turn out to be Romer for the Democrats and Nicholson
for the Republicans, I feel it will be absolutely necessary for NET to open a Colorado
bureau.  I think I'll consult with the Chairman of the Free Congress Foundation Board, which
currently owns NET, on that issue.  His name happens to be Jeff Coors. <P>

<h2>
"A Call for Impeachment of the Six Justices"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>In the history of nations, there comes a time when a crossroads is reached. Down one road is the slippery slope to perdition. It is the easier road, but at its end civilization lies in ruins and historians are left to chronicle the demise. Up the other road is the narrow, difficult path to the recovery of sovereignty of the people. The latter road is fraught with peril and many turn back along the way. But for those who make it, the possibility of passing on the heritage of the nation is made possible. 
<P>I believe we have reached such a crossroads with the Supreme Courts decision this week which struck down Amendment Two of the Colorado Constitution. This sweeping declaration by the Court is now being celebrated, if you will pardon the term, with gay abandon by those in the society who seek to undue all civilized restraints. It will take us down the road to the ultimate destruction of our society. 
<P>Again the Court has invented a new right under the Constitution which was never contemplated by the Founding Fathers. It was never given to the Court by any vote of the legislature or referendum of the people. The Supreme Court has now struck down, it would seem for all time, the one weapon citizens thought they had to preserve their society  the vote of the people.<P>
The issue was simple enough. The people of Colorado voted to instruct their own legislative bodies not to give special rights to homosexuals. No rights were taken away. Only rights not enjoyed by other groups in society were enjoined. <P>
The state of Colorado presented several arguments to meet the reasonableness test which the Court imposes in consideration of such issues. But six Supreme Court Justices rejected all those arguments and told the people of Colorado: You have lied to us. We here know that the reason you voted as you did is because you are bigoted against homosexuals. So we will thwart your will. We will void your sovereignty. We, the elite, will overturn your decision and we will open the door to anyone who feels he has been defeated by the democratic process to seek our protection from the people. <P>
The Justices said that the Colorado amendment "imposes a special disability upon (homosexual) persons alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without constraint." But as an editorial in the Chicago Tribune suggests, "The inflated rhetoric masks analytical weakness. All the amendment says is that gays cant obtain civil rights protection without amending the state constitution, which they are free to attempt. They are at no more of a disadvantage than any other group adversely affected by their state constitution."<P>
This same Court, not a decade ago, said that it was constitutional to criminalize the behavior of homosexuals. They can be arrested and jailed for what they do, but the rest of us can be jailed for trying to prevent them from having special rights and protections not enjoyed by other groups of citizens. <P>
This is only the beginning, as various homosexual rights groups gleefully proclaim. This decision paves the way for the complete acceptance and sanction by this society of a lifestyle which is openly condemned in the Bible more times than any other specific sin. "An abomination unto the Lord" can now receive privileged treatment from legislative bodies. If this decision is allowed to stand, historians will look back upon this time as the critical turning point in our society. <P>
What is to be done? In the past I would have exhorted you to elect a President who would change the High Court by the appointment Justices who would adhere to the Constitution. That was the cry of Richard Nixon in the 1968 Presidential election. Nixon effected no such change. Nor, as it turned out, did Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, or, of course, Bill Clinton. Each of them contributed Justices who constituted the 6 to 3 majority of the Court on the Colorado decision.<P>
It is clear that no matter who we elect to the Congress and no matter what protective statutes they pass, this Court will declare them unconstitutional. The Marriage Protection Act is making its way through the Congress right now. By the standard of this Court, declaring that homosexuals cant marry constitutes bigotry. It is also clear that a vote of the people in the so-called sovereign states means nothing to this Court as it demonstrated in this case as well as in the recent case on term limits.<P>
There remains but one option for citizens who wish to protect themselves from the tyranny of the majority on this Supreme Court: impeachment.<P>
It is not a course I recommend lightly. In the early 1960s when the John Birch Society was pushing to impeach Earl Warren, I didnt buy into the idea even though I detested the decisions of the Warren court. There were many other remedies available, or so I thought, such as electing the right kind of President. In the mid 1960s when then Congressman Gerald Ford first raised the possibility of impeaching Justice William O. Douglas, I opposed the idea in a radio editorial even though I found Douglas and his views reprehensible. But this time it is different. We are out of remedies. Impeachment is our only hope of bringing a Court which is out of control, back under control. <P>
I would remind you that Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist paper number 81, wrote of the "important constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachment would give to (Congress) upon members of the judicial department."  Hamilton said, "This is alone a complete security. There can never be danger that the judges, by a series of deliberate usurpation on the authority of the legislature, would hazard the united resentment of the body entrusted with it."<P>
Indeed, the National Legal Foundation has compiled a history of impeachment which shows that in the early part of our nations history, the legislature was far more ready to act upon impeachment of judges, even a Justice of the Supreme Court, than we are today. That time was closer to the intent of our founding fathers. <P>
To the argument that impeachment can only be initiated for matters such as embezzlement or bribery, let me cite what then Minority Leader Gerald Ford said in 1970 during his drive to impeach Justice Douglas:  "What, then, is an impeachable offense? The only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history; conviction results from whatever offense or offenses two thirds of the other body considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office." As Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in his opinion in Rochin vs. California, justices who do not restrain themselves are subject to only two remedies. A constitutional amendment or impeachment. <P>
I understand the implications of what I am recommending. I have no illusions that the Senate would remove these Justices from office. But the mere act of initiating impeachment would finally focus the attention of this nation on the enormity of the crimes which this Court has committed against our constitutional form of government.<P>
Rather than stand aside and watch this nation slide further down the path to ultimate destruction, I hope and I pray that citizens will petition their Representatives to impeach the majority of this court and in doing so, will employ the one remaining remedy they have to save the nation. Thats all for Direct Line for tonight. <P>

<h2>Business-As-Usual No Longer Works</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>

This morning's Washington Post is just gloating over Republican Senators who, the Post says, have rediscovered government. They cite among others, Senator Bob Bennett of Utah who fought to add another $10 million to the appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts because, he says, the Endowment supports dozens of small cultural entities in Utah.<P>
The Post describes Bennett as a Mormon with strong culturally conservative views. Those views, the paper is happy to report, were not enough to override his desire to bring federal money to his state, even though the National Endowment for the Arts funds pornography and homosexual art. The last time I checked, neither was well thought of in Mormon circles.<P>
But the case of Bennett, and several other Republican Senators mentioned, serves to illustrate why the Republican attempt to balance the budget by 2002 absent a Constitutional Amendment is folly. There are always just enough so-called conservative Senators who are willing to play the game of trying to be the local hero who brought home the federal bacon. Therefore cutting federal spending becomes next to impossible.<P>
We had cultural activities in my hometown, but local people supported them with their own money. If they didn't, the local symphony and museums and other projects would have disappeared. And this is as it should be.<P>
If the question is should cultural projects in Utah be funded by the rest of us taxpayers, sure voters will say yes. But if the question is should we as a nation go into debt to fund these projects, my betting is the answer would be different. Bennett, I am willing to wager, could maintain his political support by posing the second question rather than the first.<P>
This Congress came within a single vote of passing a Constitutional Amendment to balance the budget. With Bill Clinton continuing to lead Bob Dole and Ross Perot by such impressive numbers, I fear that the next Congress will be even less willing to pass such an amendment. Yet the fiscal condition of the nation demands that this be done. We are on the verge of bankruptcy.<P>
I have to give credit to Perot and Dick Lamm, the rivals in the Reform party. At least they are talking about this issue. You don't hear either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole saying much about it, and they would say nothing at all if the Reform party weren't in the mix.<P>
If the next Congress is unable to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to pass a Constitutional Amendment, then there is no alternative to a Constitutional Convention to take up that issue, term limits and other such questions which are beyond the courage of the Congress. Then at least the states would be given the chance to ratify or reject such proposals. My guess is that at the state level, a balanced budget would get overwhelming approval.<P>
The politicians like Bennett just don't get it yet. The way we've done business for the past sixty years just doesn't work anymore. The nation can't afford it. But since there seems to be no hope of replacing enough ordinary politicians in the Congress, our only hope is an extraordinary measure such as a Constitutional Convention. I regret that is the case and there are dangers in calling such a convention. But the alternative is to have business as usual and this business is going belly up.<P><P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Wednesday, January 15, 1997
</h3> <h2>Where Are the Democrats of Conscience?</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Frankly, I
would like to comment more on the so-called peace accord announced in the Middle East,
President Clinton's plan for the District of Columbia, developments in Belgrade, changes at
the Justice Department and other stories.  I am tired of the never-ending Gingrich story,
but I am compelled to comment once again on the actions of Congressman Jim McDermott, the
ranking Democrat on the so-called Ethics Committee.<p>

Please understand that I do not come from the camp which says Democrats are evil and do
nothing but evil things and Republicans are pure and none of their motives is suspect.  My
mother didn't raise an idiot.<p>

Yet even as much corruption as I have seen in three decades in both parties and involving
people from all parts of the political spectrum, I must say the McDermott flap takes my
breath away.<p>

Let's look at this situation from the other side.  Let us suppose instead that it was Dick
Gephardt who had been elected Speaker by a majority of Democrats two years ago, and that
Republicans were angry over this development so that they filed charge after charge against
Gephardt.  Nearly all the charges are dismissed.  In the process, however, they have caused
a two-year long investigation to take place that has resulted in a Special Counsel. In this
process, the ranking Republican on the Ethics Committee, Nancy Johnson, does not seem
interested in getting at the facts.  While not vocal in the outside world (she leaves that
to Tom DeLay), she nevertheless uses every tactic in the book to obstruct the investigation.
 She gives out information when she has no right to.  She leaks information about sensitive
matters to major media outlets.  Chairman McDermott is at his wits end. He has done
everything to try to be accommodating, but nothing satisfies Johnson.  When a bipartisan
agreement has been reached on hearings and a vote to punish Gephardt on the one charge which
finally was investigated, she blows apart the agreement, even to the dismay of other
Committee Republicans who have signed on board. While complaining constantly about a breach
of House rules, she breaks all the rules herself and throws the whole situation into
chaos.<p>

Then, along comes a couple of Republican activists.  They somehow manage to intercept a
cellular phone conversation which involves Speaker Gephardt talking with Martin Frost, David
Bonior and other Democratic leaders about how to deal with the media spin which Johnson and
DeLay and others were likely to put on the upcoming release of the ethics committee report.
The couple at first gives their tape to their local Congressman Mark Foley of Florida.  He
later says he never listened to the tape, and yet when these activists subsequently show up
at his office, he helps them write a letter to Johnson and suggests that they give her the
tape.  Johnson accepts the tape and has it for several days.  Then a transcript of the tape,
along with Johnson's spin, appears in the Wall Street Journal.  Suddenly the focus shifts
from Gephardt's problems to Johnson's handling of the tape. Leading Democrats call on
Republican Johnson to step down from the Committee.  She refuses to do so.  Instead, she
doesn't even mention the tape and issues a blast saying that Congressman McDermott, the
Chairman of the Committee, was responsible for conducting a charade and that his
chairmanship of the Committee was "arbitrary and authoritarian and autocratic."<p>

Now, I ask you?  Would all of that fly? <p>

How long do you think it would take other Republicans to distance themselves from Johnson? 
My betting is that by close of business today, at least 25 Republicans of all shades would
have said that Johnson doesn't speak for them, that the tape episode is a disgrace, that
Johnson should be prosecuted, and that she should resign as ranking Republican on the
Committee.  In fact, I think a handful of her colleagues would even suggest she resign from
Congress.  By tomorrow others would join that cry.  By Friday she would have resigned from
the Committee.  By the end of next week she would be gone from Congress.  And such would
have been the case if the roles and the parties had been reversed.<p>

I am not surprised that McDermott has behaved as he has.  He is one of the most bitterly
strident liberal Congressman the Democrats have in their caucus. His pathological hatred for
Newt Gingrich is well known.  I use the term advisedly.  McDermott is a psychiatrist by
profession.  What does surprise me is that the rest of the Democrats have stood by him. 
They continue to do so.  But why am I surprised?  Not a single democratic voice was raised
about Bill Clinton's scandals throughout the four years of his first term.  No one broke
ranks.  Some said privately they thought his administration was a disaster.  But was any
voice heard publicly?  Many Democrats are decent men. Some vote with conservatives on nearly
every substantive issue.  There are those who, by all appearances, have nicer families and
treat them better than do many Republicans.  But where are their standards?  Why doesn't
this outrage them the way it does some of the rest of us.  I am not outraged because
McDermott got caught stooping as low as he could to do in the Speaker.  I am outraged
because here is someone who has been an incredible obstructionist on the Ethics Committee
who is now engaged in something which, by every objective standard, is a lot worse, at least
in criminal terms, than anything Gingrich is accused of.  Why aren't we hearing from the
voices of decent Democrats on this matter?  Why do they, by their silence, defend the
indefensible? Perhaps most of them have been here too long. But there are some new Democrats
on the scene. By all accounts Congressman Virgil Goode of Virginia is a decent man.  He ran
against Chuck Robb in the Democratic primary for the US Senate because he said he was
offended by Robb's scandals. Why don't we hear him speaking out, calling for McDermott's
resignation?  There are other new Members such as Congressman Kind of Wisconsin, a former
prosecutor.  Friends tell me he is a decent fellow.  Where is his voice in all of this? <p>

I expect liberal scoundrels to behave like liberal scoundrels.  Even though the sheer
brashness of McDermott is worth noting, I am not ultimately surprised by his actions.  What
surprised me is the silence of those, like my long-time friend and associate Ralph Hall of
Texas, who know better. America needs to hear from them.  If Republicans who voted against
the Speaker can be praised by the media as men of conscience, where are similar men of
conscience in the other party? <P>

"Why Clinton is Winning in the Polls"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>Remember those grade school stories of long ago about George Washington telling his father, "I cannot tell a lie. I chopped down the cherry tree," or Abraham Lincoln reading books by the light of the fire in his familys log cabin?
<P>Well if the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll is correct, you can forget all of that. 
<P>When asked if having someone of sound moral character was important in electing a President, only 22% of the respondents said yes. When asked if having a President who understood the problems of people like you was the most important factor in choosing a President, 77% responded in the affirmative.
<P>No wonder Bill Clinton is killing his rivals in the polls. In the same survey, 57% said he deserved another term in the White House. 
<P>The American people now want a President who feels their pain, not a President who has the strength of character to lead the nation. I guess that is why Bill Clinton will get by with asking that the Paula Jones lawsuit be delayed because he is Commander-in-Chief and thus is eligible to invoke a law passed at the time of World War II.  The law Bill Clinton is hiding behind was aimed at preventing a GI in a fox hole from being sued because he didnt send a payment for an appliance on time. 
<P>At a time when Admiral Boorda supposedly killed himself to avoid shame, Bill Clinton has no shame and the public thinks it is great. I guess if their President has no standards, they can excuse their own behavior somehow.  
<P>If moral character means next to nothing to Americans then no wonder Bill Clinton is Americas favorite. 
<P>Bill Clinton does tell people what they want to hear. He is for the gas tax repeal. He is for Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompsons welfare plan. He is for the bill to permit states to ban same sex marriages. He is for the balanced budget. He supports all the things the rest of us do. Never mind that his Administration has been in the opposite camp on all these issues. He passed the gas tax he now seeks to repeal. He vetoed the same sort of welfare reform Thompson has initiated. His administration has been in the forefront of supporting the homosexual agenda. He has vetoed the balanced budget. But reality doesnt matter. As long as Clinton says the right things, never mind what he does. 
<P>Yes, Bill Clinton is obviously the right man for these times. Times when apparently honesty and truth and integrity and morality take a distant second place to feeling good. One thing Bill Clinton can do better than anyone else, no matter how bad things really are, is make us feel good. Chelsea is such a lucky kid to have a father like Bill.
<P>

<h2>Dwelling in the Past</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>


<P>
Yesterday I attended part of a two day conference called " A Dialogue on race" at Towson State University in Baltimore. The conference was sponsored by a group called "Search for Common Ground" which promotes dialogues between opposing groups worldwide. They are active in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and have set up a dialogue between pro life and pro choice groups here in the United States.<p>

I stayed for only part of the conference because once my friend Lawry Chickering, the President of the Institute for Contemporary Studies in California, for whom I have great respect, persuaded me to go, we had a next to impossible time finding out the schedule of the event and meanwhile I got committed to other things. <p>

But I was present for the entire session which dealt with the barriers to racial progress. The group consisted of about half whites and half blacks. There were no Hispanics and only one Asian American present. Four of us were conservative philosophically. The rest ranged from left to far left. <p>

What struck me about the whole exercise was the fixation most of the blacks and many of the whites had on the past. The outstanding editor of the Heritage Foundation's magazine Policy Review, Adam Meyerson, tried to introduce the notion that many blacks represent the American dream. They have overcome slavery and segregation and have gone on to become prosperous and successful and have made important contributions to the society in which we live. Meyerson suggested that it would be well to study those examples as role models since they had, in fact, achieved the progress the others were seeking. <p>

That did not go over very well in this room filled with professionals, many of whom make their living working on the issue of racial conflict. After all, if we solved racial problems, some of these folks would be out of work. 
We were told that unless we could identify with and experience the pain suffered by blacks because of slavery, segregation and racism, we could never  make any progress. <p>

I began to think about that. The Treaty of Versailles, which imposed impossible demands on Germany after World War One, caused my family terrible trouble. They had never been wealthy. But what little they had was wiped out. They became poverty stricken and unable to support themselves financially. For such a reason did my father become the first in his family, at age l9, to journey to America in l923 to seek a decent living.<p>

All my life I have heard stories about that era and the pain it caused. I can acknowledge, and have done so, that the Versailles Treaty was unwise and unjust. But should I go around and insist that everyone else comprehend the damage done to my family because of that injustice? Granted, those conditions lasted a much shorter time than did slavery and segregation. But the principle is the same. <p>

I want to know about that era because I want to understand why my family on my father's side came here. I want to understand what happened in case world leaders ever again try to humiliate a nation the way France insisted on humiliating Germany back then. We know the consequences of that action. The Versailles Treaty created the conditions which made Adolph Hitler possible. <p>

But I did not remain dead in the water because of that injustice. Nor do I insist on discussing it constantly. 
Now I was told at that conference that, of course, my family could make progress because we were white. Oh, really? Does anyone remember what it was like being a German in-between the two World Wars? You were suspect. You were discriminated against. Laws were passed to prevent German language newspapers from being printed. A law in Wisconsin even stopped the sermons in German at the local parish church and the church bulletin had to be printed half in English and half in German. It was not a fun era. It was overcome by perseverance, discipline and hard work. <p>

Even though my family came from Germany and Norway, long after slavery had been instituted here, I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that this did great injustice to black people. I am perfectly willing to stipulate that segregation laws were unjust and that blacks got the short end of the stick for many years. <p>

But I am not willing to try to go through some exercise where I am expected to identify with the pain black people suffered back then any more than I should expect them to understand the pain my family suffered because of the unjust Versailles Treaty. These things happened. One participant did acknowledge that it was liberating for him to have learned that in history blacks sometimes oppressed other blacks and that whites sometimes enslaved other whites because he had been brought up with the notion that only whites had enslaved blacks.  True enough. Some of the blacks who came to the United States were sold to their white slave owners by other blacks. <p>

History is good to know and to understand, but it is not healthy or, productive to try to constantly relive that history. That is what prevents progress in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and elsewhere. Yes, we must acknowledge and ask God's forgiveness for injustices. But the main thing is that we work to be sure there is a level playing field because, as Meyerson has pointed out, many who have used that level playing field have made great progress.<p>
 
As for me, I don't need a conference to tell me what needs to be done. All I have to do is to take my Christian faith seriously. Many blacks are very religious people. I have more in common with them than I have with secular non believing whites. We can all move forward because of shared beliefs. Christianity is nothing if it is not a religion of forgiveness. In that context, and with the acknowledgment of past injustices, we have the framework for real progress. <p>

No, we should never forget the past. Nor should we try to relive the past. God put us here and now in this time and in this age. For that we should be grateful. We might start by thanking God for the privilege of living here. Having visited more than 50 nations in the world, I can affirm that it is a privilege even for the poorest of the poor.  Perhaps then, with a sense of gratitude, we can move to overcome artificial barriers to progress, some of which are constructed by the very people whose job is supposed to be to tear them down.

"Defending Caesar Against God"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
The Capitol today is filled with believers who are praying for their country. Although the "Washington for Jesus" rally did not live up to the crowd expectations of its promoters, it is nevertheless impressive to see that thousands of people are willing to take time off to come to their nation's capital to ask God's blessing on this land. 
<P>Indeed, it will take the intervention of the Almighty if this nation is going to reverse its course. Yesterday's hearings on assisted suicide, chaired by Rep. Charles Canady of (R-FL), pointed to another tragedy for the nation which is coming at us with thunderous speed. Yet hardly a whimper is heard about it from the nation's religious leaders. <P>
Saving this nation will be up to ordinary people. History is replete with examples of religious leaders who were either silent in the face of great moral crises or who actually cooperated with those inflicting moral crimes on the nation. I am not indicting all religious leaders here. There were a few leaders who did stand up to be counted at the moment of truth and there are some today. But usually those leaders are bucking the trend.<P>
Yesterday some 30 so-called religious leaders from Protestant and Jewish denominations sent President Clinton a letter backing him on the partial birth abortion veto. They wanted to give the President cover for one of the worst decisions ever made by an American President. Clinton's decision even earned him a particular denunciation by the Pope, something which almost never happens. But these Church leaders, including the presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, have seen fit to tell the President he was right in vetoing the bill. They defend Caesar against God.
<P>White House staffers say that the President has actually profited from his stand. The latest Gallop poll, taken after the President's veto, shows that Bill Clinton is leading Bob Dole by the largest margin ever, 58% to 36%. Thus, they claim, the President has done the right thing because the people back him. 
<P>Well, as I said, the ordinary folks, including the generation-X contingent who raised their hands in prayer on the mall today, are the people who will help turn this nation around. They are speaking out against the moral outrages of our time. The "Washington For Jesus" rally held a mock trial with secular society and its deadly sins as defendants. One of the teenagers wore a T-shirt which read, "I fear no evil because He is with me." Indeed, it is evil which stalks the land.
<P>When a six-year-old boy kills a two-month-old child, it is the product of evil. Yet in our time, we scarcely acknowledge evil. In fact, we attempt to turn evil into good. A new movie called "The Craft" attempts to glorify witchcraft. One of the stars of this movie says that all she is trying to do is to show that there is power all around us of which we are unaware. Yes, the power of death. All of these events happening in todays society have something in common. They are all a part of the ancient struggle between life and death. This struggle dates back to when God put man on earth.
<P>Today, however, death has more advocates. Death has the apologists. Death, whether by killing the unborn, or killing the terminally ill, or killing innocent bystanders with guns, or seducing the innocent through witchcraft, or by a thousand other means, death is triumphing over life in contemporary society. But God is life. So what the cult of death really translates to is a rejection of God. 
<P>Don't expect this nation's government or religious leaders to give the principle of life the upper hand. That will depend on the prayers of not only those who could show up in Washington today, but the prayers of all believers, of all faiths, wherever they are in this nation.  In the end it will depend on those who are willing to stand up and intone that ancient refrain, "Choose Life. Choose Life."<P>

</h3> <h2>We Used To Call It Extortion</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> I've told this story
before but it bears repeating.  A high official of Quaker Oats in Chicago told me that some
years ago Jesse Jackson held a press conference announcing that Quaker Oats would be
boycotted by his organization because Aunt Jemima is a racist symbol.  The corporate board
at Quaker Oats went crazy.  They held an emergency meeting.  My friend was called on to
negotiate with Jackson.  It turned out that what Jackson really wanted was money for his
Rainbow Coalition.  The Quaker official conveyed this to his board and they quickly agreed
to a huge contribution from the company to Jesse Jackson. Jackson then held a press
conference saying that upon reconsideration, Aunt Jemima was really a cultural symbol, not a
racist symbol and there would be no boycott.<p>

We used to have a name for that sort of behavior.  We used to call it extortion and people
used to go to prison for making such proposals.<p>

The story was called to mind again because yesterday in New York Jesse Jackson and the
National Organization for Women (NOW) announced they were calling off their consumer boycott
of Mitsubishi Motor Company in return for $200 million in potential business opportunities
for minorities and women.  I don't know what sort of business opportunities Mitsubishi has
in mind but I can just guess what the cut is for the Rainbow Coalition and now.<p>

Meanwhile, the parent firm of Denny's restaurants on the same day handed out $1.5 million to
nine civil rights organizations.  Guess who is in on the deal?  Why, the Rainbow Coalition,
of course.<p>

Now, I don't believe any company should engage in racial discrimination.  That is if race is
really at the bottom of it.  I do believe, however, that restaurants ought to be free to
tell people who behave badly to get lost.  I believe restaurants ought to be allowed to have
certain standards and if people come in who violate those standards the restaurants ought to
be able to throw them out with the help of the police.<p>

Race did seem to be a problem in some Denny's stores. that being the case, the managers of
these stores ought to have been summarily fired. Anyone who had been effected by their
behavior should have been entitled to a year's worth of free food or whatever.  The
Mitsubishi case is much weaker and seems to be confined to a very few individuals.  The
problem Mitsubishi has is the same one Quaker Oats had.  They don't want the bad publicity
caused by a Rainbow Coalition/NOW boycott.  So they write off millions as a cost of doing
business.  This is the American counterpart to bribing foreign bureaucrats in exchange for
business in some third world country.  Companies don't fight it, they just pass the cost on
to the consumers.<p>

Remember when the radical feminists boycotted the State of Colorado over the Equal Rights
Amendment some years back?  This got incredible coverage.  The fact that Colorado set a
record for tourism that year never got any attention.  You see, some of us held meetings in
Colorado that year just to make the point.  Colorado officials never backed down.  They
didn't suffer.  The radical gangs haven't boycotted a state since.<p>

They go where they get satisfaction.  When are these companies going to learn that they need
to stand up for their investors and for the customers who get stuck with the bill as well? 
Again, if some people are making slurs against blacks, fire them and make an example of them
for the whole company.  Word will get around.  Denny's corporate officials should have come
in to some of their stores and booted out personnel who wouldn't wait on blacks or other
minorities.  They could have then put their pictures in every Denny's to remind managers and
employees of what would happen to them if they were guilty of the same thing.  That would
make it clear. But to stick the investors of Flagstar Companies, the parent of Denny's, with
$54 million to settle a lawsuit because some people had to sit and wait to be served is
obscene.  Every Denny's I have ever seen is right next to about three of their competitors. 
I can't imagine these folks couldn't live without food prepared by Denny's prize winning
chefs!<p>

Some day soon, companies which are being held up this way are going to have to draw the
line. Some day the people who are calculating what business to strike next need to have
charges preferred against them under our extortion statutes.  Then the issue will finally be
debated for what it really is. <P>

<h2>Hope for Continued Democracy in Russia
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>The Russian people had themselves a remarkable election on Sunday. This is not a nation which has a tradition of democracy and yet turnout was higher than for most nations which do not make voting mandatory.
<P>Terrorists tried, with a series of bombs throughout the nation, to intimidate the voters. They did not do so. And while the election wasnt as fair as our elections, since the incumbent Boris Yeltsin controlled much of the television media, there is, nevertheless, substantial evidence that most of the Russian people followed the election.  There is also evidence that most of the Russian people were aware of the positions of the different candidates. 
<P>Since no candidate received the required 50% plus of the vote to be elected outright, there will be a runoff in three weeks between Yeltsin and Communist party boss Gannady Zyuganov. A word about that election in a moment, but first some thoughts on a few of the other candidates who ran.
<P>The surprise candidate who did far better than expected was General Alexander Lebed.   Lebed, on the one hand, is a supporter of democracy and free markets. On the other hand, he promises an authoritarian regime which will get tough with criminals. He often cites Chile under Gen. Pinochet as the appropriate model for Russia to prosper. The outcome in the runoff will probably be determined by where his votes go. Although Lebed is not pro-Communist, many of his supporters favor the Communist candidate Zyuganov because like Gen. Lebed, Zyuganov promises to bring back law and order. 
<P>Vladimir Zhirinovsky was the big loser in this election. The Russian voters apparently now see him for the fool that he is. He received only about 7% of the vote, a far cry from his showing in the last two parliamentary elections. No doubt he will favor Zyuganov in the runoff. But even if all of his voters go that route, it wont be enough to put Zyuganov over the top. 
<P>The democratic reformers did make somewhat of a showing with their candidate Gregory Yavilinsky who drew more votes than Zhirinovsky. Yavilinsky may reluctantly support Yeltsin in the runoff. Therefore, he could emerge in a new Yeltsin cabinet if there is one. 
<P>Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev got so few votes that he hardly made the charts. This comes as a surprise only to Gorbachev. When Gorbachev left office he was terribly unpopular but he never believed that. His place secure in history as the man who opened up the process in Russia, he would have been well off to try to play the role of elder statesman. Instead he insisted on running because he believed the people were demanding his return. Now his stature is so diminished that it is clear he will never again play a role in Russian politics. 
<P>The runoff election is likely to be very close. First of all, some who voted for other candidates in this round will simply stay home. They feel they have no choice between Yeltsin and Zyuganov. Second, supporters of Yavilinsky, Sergei Filatov, and other Democrats will likely, very reluctantly, support Yeltsin. However, there are not enough of those votes to get Yeltsin the extra 15% he needs to win. 
<P>That is where Gen. Lebed comes in. Lebed will likely determine the outcome. If he goes with Yeltsin, he may be able to deliver enough of his vote to make the difference. If he goes with Zyuganov, he could give the Communist leader a real shot at being elected. 
<P>While the 35% of the vote is not exactly a ringing endorsement, it is remarkable that Yeltsin managed to get the most votes in the first round. Yeltsin has had to bear the burden of the enormous changes which have been visited on the Russian people these past five years. At one point he had sunk to only 8% in the public opinion polls and was written off as politically dead. The fact that he now has a fighting chance to win the runoff makes him the real "come back kid" of the democratic process. 
<P>The joke going around Moscow these days is that on the morning after the election, a Yeltsin aide comes to him and says he has good news and bad news.
<P>"Whats the bad news?" Yeltsin asks. 
<P>"The Communists got 55% of the vote," the aide says. 
<P>Yeltsin makes a terrible face and asks, "Then whats the good news?" 
<P>"You got 65% of the vote!" the aide declares.
This election may not have been totally honest, but it is a far cry from the rigged-in-advance kind of elections the Soviets staged for the 70 years they were in power.
<P>Russia took a major step forward in its fledgling democracy with this election. Now the voters in the runoff will have a choice between continuing to edge forward, no matter how erratically, or to try to restore the past. My bet is, that despite all the hardships they are enduring, the Russian people will not try to turn back the clock. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Wednesday, January 8, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Second Chance for Gingrich</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Considering the burden
on his shoulders,  Newt Gingrich performed well yesterday as he became the first Republican
Speaker to be re-elected to that post since l928.<dd>

His speech to the House was statesman like and hit just the right tone for the occasion.
Gingrich's re-election was not the foregone conclusion the rest of the House leadership
claimed it was for the past two weeks. There were nine Republican defectors.  Four of them
were really serious defectors.  They voted for another candidate.  Had the other five who
voted "present" cast their ballots for a different candidate than Gingrich and had they
added just one more defector to their ranks, Gingrich would not have been re-elected, at
least not on the first round.  It was close.  Some of those who voted "present" had been
inclined to vote for another candidate but were talked out of that scenario by some in the
leadership, including Gingrich himself.<dd>

Whether Gingrich has really learned anything from this episode or not will be determined by
two factors.  First, how does he treat his defectors. Ronald Reagan was an artful leader.
His then Secretary of Education Terrell Bell complained bitterly in his book about the
Reagan years that he had seen me on television attacking one of Reagan's policies on one day
and then bumped into me as I was going into a meeting with the President the very next day.
Reagan did not take it personally when some of us opposed his policies.  The first Gingrich
term was often marked by petty hostility to those who crossed him, especially if they were
conservative.  The Speaker needs to look beyond the vote yesterday and to the larger
question of where he is going to lead his majority.  If he treats the nine defectors too
badly he is buying further trouble with some of his supporters.  More than one Congressman
has warned the Speaker that his tenure as Speaker could be cut short if he takes it out on
those who didn't vote for him in the Republican ranks.  A move to reconsider the vote as
Speaker can be made by anyone who voted for Gingrich at any time and it becomes a privileged
motion.  The Speaker, after all, has to still face a vote on he report by the Ethics
Committee, perhaps as early as the end of this month. <dd>

That brings me to my second point.  I was asked last evening on a syndicated radio show how
Gingrich could overcome the media created image which now has a majority of Americans
believing that the Speaker has more ethical problems than the President of the United
States.  I answered with just three words: "Push an agenda".  A solid agenda which advances
the cause of limited government, a strong defense and traditional moral values, will
overcome the Speaker's adversity in a matter of a few weeks.  If Americans can be involved
in the policy process of governing the country, and if they generally agree with the
Speaker's agenda, they will forget about the Speaker's problems, even though his Democratic
opponents will raise those issues every chance they can get.<dd>

Even though this commentary is about the Speaker, a word needs to be said about the conduct
of some of  the Democrats.  When minority leader Dick Gephardt turned the gavel over to the
Speaker, he said it was his "responsibility" to do so.  He didn't say it was his high honor
or privilege to do so, words which usually accompany that ceremony.  Perhaps Gephardt was
still smarting from Monday's Washington Post editorial entitled "Why Gephardt will never be
Speaker".  It suggested that  Mr. Gephardt's ethics problems are worse than the Speaker's
and are almost certainly deliberate, as opposed to Gingrich's problems which appear to be
more inadvertent.<dd>

And then there was Minority Whip David Bonior.   While his fellow Democrats were giving
Gingrich three standing ovations during the course of the Speaker's 19 minute oration,
Bonior sat down, did not clap, and frowned angrily, a reaction no doubt to the fact that he
took on Gingrich and lost. <dd>

Despite a passion for a good fight, most Americans still admire sportsman like conduct. 
These Democratic leaders didn't display any of that yesterday. <dd>

So, Speaker Gingrich is being given another chance.  Either he will seize this moment in
history, as he did with his fine speech yesterday, and he will lead the country in the right
direction or he will not.  When all is said and done, Speaker Gingrich will be remembered in
history not for his ethics problems but for whether things changed in a positive direction
during his tenure or things declined further.  History only gives most political figures one
chance.  Speaker Gingrich needs to thank God for this second chance and to take the
responsibilities of governing for the common good very seriously. <P>

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Thursday, January 9, 1997
</h3> <h2>A Separate Class for the Elite</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Bill Clinton is
someone who doesn't like to face major problems.  He seldom proposes politically risky
solutions to serious difficulties facing the nation.  His Medicare fix, for example, would
simply tide the system over until Clinton leaves office.  That has been true of much of what
he has proposed, with the exception of his first term health care initiative, which was
really Hillary's baby.<dd>

So Bill Clinton is praying that the Supreme Court will see things his way as the Paula Jones
case is taken up once again.<dd>

Clinton's lawyers, including the highly-priced Bob Bennett, argue that the President should
be protected from civil lawsuits while in office.  Richard Cohen, the liberal columnist for
the Washington Post, puts the argument this way: "In the end, only two people know what
happened that day in Little Rock, and their stories are not likely ever to conform.  Jones
deserves her day in court -- but not necessarily right away and not if it means that
Presidents can be legally harassed by their political enemies."<dd>

Paula Jones was no enemy of Bill Clinton.  She wasn't involved in politics at all.  It is
true that she received and took bad advice by surfacing her case at C-PAC, the Conservative
Political Action Committee annual conference in Washington.  It is also true that the
attorneys she ended up with are partisan Republicans.  That has more to do with her economic
standing than it has to do with any political motives on her part.<dd>

But those facts should not obscure the fact that what this case is really all about is
sexual harassment.  If Army drill sergeants must face the music for their misdeeds, why not
the President of the United States, their Commander-in-Chief?<dd>

What is really at stake in the Supreme Court action on the Paula Jones case is whether the
President of the United States constitutes a special class all by himself.  One set of rules
applies to him. Another set of rules applies to the rest of us.<dd>

By the way, I have taken this position consistently for nearly thirty years.  Richard
Nixon's imperial style Presidency was as offensive to me as is this Clinton argument on Paul
Jones.  I said so publicly back then.<dd>

The President's legal team argues that were he to have to stand trial on this lawsuit, it
would interfere with his work as President.  This is a President who plays golf frequently;
a President who just attended the Renaissance week-end where he mostly played hooky and
didn't attend many lectures.  This is a President who just returned from a family vacation
in the Virgin Islands.  I don't begrudge him these interludes.  Some of our better
Presidents have had a decent amount of leisure time. President Eisenhower played lots more
golf than Bill Clinton does, and Ronald Reagan frequently took naps in the middle of the
day.  On the other hand, Jimmy Carter worked day and night.  So the success of a Presidency
is not necessarily tied to hard work.<dd>

By the same token, a President who has time to engage in frequent recreation and who does
not hesitate to vacation, cannot at the same time argue, which Clinton does, that he is just
too busy to tend to this lawsuit.<dd>

The notion that political enemies would simply file frivolous lawsuits against the President
to harass him if the Jones case is allowed to go to trial now is preposterous.  A President
is sued almost daily over his policies in office.  That is fair game.  But a lawsuit
alleging improper personal conduct would have to have some basis or else it would be
dismissed immediately. <dd>

Paula Jones, before she filed the suit, had nearly gotten Bill Clinton to acknowledge that
he knew her, that they were in the same hotel together, and that he would apologize if
anything he had said had been misinterpreted by her.  At the last minute, Clinton decided
not to settle and the case went to court.<dd>

I also have no idea what went on in the hotel room where Paula Jones contends that then
Governor Bill Clinton exposed himself to her.  We would soon find out in a trial if she made
this story up. <dd>

But I do know this.  It is a dangerous doctrine which suggests that the President of the
United States is, even temporarily, above the law.  One of the reasons why the United States
was so different from other nations, even other nation states with democratically elected
governments, is precisely the fact that we always viewed our Presidents as men of the
people.  Yes, they may receive special treatment while in office to facilitate their conduct
of official business, but they are, in the words of Richard Nixon's critics, "not above the
law."<dd>

If the court goes along with Clinton, and I suspect they will because they themselves view
themselves as part of the nation's elite, then we will have established a special class of
citizen. Someone who, for four or eight years, does not have to face the consequences of his
own actions. Who will be next?  Senators?  I worked for two of them and I can attest that
they had mind boggling schedules.<dd>

True if Bill Clinton's trial is postponed, he will still have to face Paula Jones when he
leaves office.  But by then national interest in the case will be minimal.  Who pays any
attention to what happens to George Bush in his personal life these days?  The very
compensation which Jones seeks in her lawsuit, namely the restoration of her good name,
would be effectively denied her if the trial is postponed.<dd>

Clinton's lawyers say that Jones would not have suffered the loss of her good name if she
hadn't stepped forward with her lawsuit.  Let's not forget that she only did so when an
Arkansas State Trooper contended in an article for the American Spectator that Paula Jones
was the willing girlfriend of the Governor.<dd>

I am very afraid that this court will disregard what is really at stake in this case and
will grant the extra time to Bill Clinton.  Thus they would be blinded to the fact that
Clinton's behavior is the basis for this lawsuit.  Why haven't we had lots of personal
lawsuits against former Presidents who did not have any court ruling that they would have to
be protected from trials while in office.  Simply put, these recent former Presidents never
conducted themselves in such a way so as to provoke such lawsuits.  They were by no means
perfect, but they weren't out cruising for trouble with strangers either. <dd>

If Bill Clinton is upheld in this case, we will take another giant step away from a
government of the people, by the people and for the people. <P> <blockquote> <a

<h2>People Are Tired Of The Media Elite</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The Media Research Center engaged the Harris poll to do a survey of the 
news media and, in the words of Robert Lichter, the Center's Director, 
"people are tired of the media elite."
<DD>
It is about time. Media has been out of control in this nation for a 
long while, especially with the shift to advocacy journalism which 
occurred in the late 1960's and early 1970's accelerated by Watergate.
Now two thirds of the public, according to Harris, want just the facts 
rather than the journalists' judgment calls in stories involving public 
figures.
<DD>
The top complaints the public has against journalists are the 
following: Journalists ignore people's privacy. Ask Richard Jewell if 
he agrees with that one. Journalists are politically biased. The funny 
thing is that everyone from Jesse Jackson to Jesse Helms would agree 
with that complaint. Journalists are too influenced by the powerful. 
The real problem here isn't that journalists are paid off. The problem 
is that the powerful have access to important information and they 
become the sources for the journalists. You don't bite the hand that 
feeds you. Journalists provide one sided coverage. Take a look at any 
story, on television or in a major metropolitan daily. You will find 
that the opposing viewpoint to the thesis of the story will either be 
at the very end of the story, mentioned only briefly, or it will be 
entirely missing.
<DD>
Journalists are too negative. The prevailing attitude 
in newsrooms these days is that America is among the worst places on 
earth and that we are responsible for most of the world's problems. If 
you have that view, it is not hard to be negative. Journalists have too 
much influence. I can personally report on hundreds of meetings I have 
attended with political figures over the past 30 years, the outcome of 
which was driven by fears of the media and not by what was best for the 
nation. Journalists abuse freedom of the press. Nothing is sacred 
anymore to some journalists. If you know it, air it is their slogan, 
regardless of who is hurt.
<DD>
Journalists don't care about people. We live 
in a cynical age, but you can take that cynicism to the l0th power by 
surveying any newsroom. The media makes people guilty until proven 
innocent and when they are proven innocent they drop the story. The 
media portrays too much violence. The media believes that the public 
has an insatiable appetite for the gory details on everything and 
judging by the ratings of various TV shows, the media may be right on 
that score. The media is often inaccurate. Concern for accuracy went 
out the window with The New York Times v. Sullivan case. In that case, 
since expanded by the U.S. Supreme Court, the ruling was that anyone 
suing the media over misstatements had to prove malice in order to 
collect. That is well understood by the lowest journalist on the 
ladder.
<DD>
The media is too sensational. Again, the public needs to look 
to itself on this question. Unfortunately it is the sensational 
coverage of things which gets the ratings and sells the papers. 
Journalists ignore their errors. They do indeed. Retractions happen all 
too seldom on television and in the papers, retractions are generally 
on page 2, the least read of all of the pages of the newspaper.
I agree with most of the findings of this survey, but one issue greatly 
disturbs me. An astounding 84% of the public says that the government 
could require balanced reporting of controversial issues to the point 
of imposing a fine for inaccurate or biased reporting. Hold on just a 
minute here. The same people, a majority of whom in the Harris survey 
find the media too liberal, wants the Clinton Administration to force 
balanced reporting?
<DD>
When we had the so called "Fairness Doctrine" in 
force, we didn't have radio and television talk shows as we now know 
them because most stations didn't want the burden of providing repines 
time for opposing viewpoints.
<DD>
Government is not the solution to this very serious problem just as 
government is not the solution to much of anything. This calls to mind 
the statement of Senator Bill Cohen of Maine, Clinton's new Defense 
Secretary." Government," he said, "is the enemy  until you need a 
friend." I am afraid that is the attitude of far too many Americans 
these days. We complain about the excesses of big government, but as 
soon as there is a problem as big as this one is, we want the 
government to solve it. The government is the last place we want to 
turn to solve the problem of inaccurate, biased and abusive media. Most 
Americans don't seem to understand that they have the power to control 
all of this. If we don't buy their papers, advertisers won't spend 
their money to reach fewer and fewer numbers. These papers will go out 
of business. If we turn off the news shows on radio and television that 
we find are biased and provide one sided coverage, the ratings will do 
them in.
<DD>
We don't need government. We need to match our outrage with 
the media with our willingness to continue to buy their product. That's 
all for Direct Line for tonight.

<h2>A Look Back at the 104th Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The 104th Congress whimpered to an end, a mere farthing of its former self. This is the 15th Congress I've had the privilege of witnessing from start to finish. In the past three decades, only this Congress and the 97th Congress, which came in with Ronald Reagan, actually seemed poised to pass positive initiatives for the American people. Each passed one truly significant piece of legislation. In the 97th Congress it was the Reagan tax cuts. In this Congress it was welfare reform. Each of those Congresses did pass other positive legislation as well. The 104th Congress may well be remembered in the future for the line item veto, but if Bill Clinton is President the next four years, that is not likely to be a positive memory.
<DD>Each Congress is also noted for having lost its nerve along the way. In the 97th Congress, that meant passing TEFRA, which up to that point was the largest tax increase in history. For this Congress, it was throwing in the towel in the attempt to kill all sorts of undesirable government programs.
<DD>Expectations were unreasonably high for this Congress. But then the American people had just caused one of the largest Congressional turnovers in modern history. They wanted to be heard through their representatives. The first few months were exciting. The House of Representatives passed item after item in the Contract with America. But the U.S. Senate broke the back of that momentum when it failed to pass a Constitutional Amendment for a balanced budget. Even though that amendment would not have been ratified instantly by state legislatures, it would have provided a framework within which Congress would have most likely operated. When that battle was lost, Congress then tried to pass a balanced budget through legislation. But when Bill Clinton stopped that and it was back to business as usual for the remaining session.
Except for welfare, this Congress never came to grips with the rest of the entitlements. It never tackled the crippling national debt we shoulder. It left much of the important work to the next Congress.
<DD>The freshmen Republicans, who came to Washington so determined to make a difference, found that they were unable to move their more senior colleagues who were not impressed with the election results. Now, most of those freshmen are seriously threatened for re-election. The unions are spending up to $2 million per Congressional district to defeat them. This doesn't include what the environmental groups, radical lifestyle organizations and the Democratic party itself is spending. When you hear that Republicans have more money to spend in this election than the Democrats, don't you believe it.
<DD>Despite GOP Congressional Campaign Chairman Bill Paxon's brave words, a number of these freshmen won't be back. Unfortunately for those that do return, the lesson they may learn from this could be that you can't tackle the Washington establishment and win.
<DD>Sunday night on PBS, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott debated would-be Speaker Dick Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. I say debated. It was more like a friendly argument over who had indeed spent the most money for education and school lunches and who could better protect Medicare.
<DD>All of the passion which brought the Republican Congress to power was gone. There seems to be far too little difference between the two political parties. The differences seemed profound only two years ago.
<DD>For the 105th Congress, the American people need to send to Washington another crop of freshmen similar to the ones they sent in 1994. That seems less likely, however. This election is not being fought over the issue of freedom. Even though it is true, no one has made the case that the future of the very Republic is at stake this time around. In 1994, Republicans painted the big picture of the threat of intrusive government promoting radical ideas. That big picture is almost entirely missing from this election.
What a pity that Republicans lost their nerve. The folk lore here is that the government shut down was an unmitigated disaster for Republicans. I disagree. They were on the road to winning the issue when they caved in and they haven't recovered from that mistake since. 
<DD>We can only hope that in local races for Congress, absent the overarching theme, there are candidates who still believe that tackling the crippling problems of America the Bankrupt are important. Maybe we just aren't hearing about them back here. I fervently hope so. America does not need a 105th Congress less committed to sanity and true reform than this one was.

"Another Off-Book Mistake"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>


Congressman Bud Shuster (R-Pennsylvania) led a successful effort in the House of Representatives to pass his Truth-in-Budgeting bill by a vote of 284-143. The Shuster measure takes the Transportation Trust Fund out of the budget. This presumably would release more of the money collected through transportation taxes to be spent on local roads and other projects. On the surface that seems fair enough. People pay taxes on gasoline and airline tickets and the money should be spent for projects relating to their taxation.
<P>
The problem is that the transportation trust funds are used to offset other spending in the federal budget. So, in effect, this move means that another $30 billion will have to be cut from discretionary domestic spending to balance the budget if the Shuster measure should become law. That is why Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-Ohio) and Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R-Louisiana) strongly opposed the bill. "We will never eliminate the deficit if we give some programs exalted, protected status," Livingston said.
Another opponent, Rep. Chris Shays (R-Connecticut) said, "While some call it the Truth-in-Budgeting Act, I would call it the Unbalanced Budget Act of 1996 or frankly the Pork Barrel Bill of 1996."
<P>
Shays and Livingston are correct. Even this strongly conservative House of Representatives couldn't bring itself to eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or the National Endowment for the Arts. That being the case, who is going to seriously suggest that this Congress or a subsequent Congress is going to come up with another $30 billion in domestic budget cuts to balance the budget?
<P>
This is just another attempt to hide spending off-book. As Harrison Fox of Citizens for Budget reform has pointed out, the off-book obligations of the federal government are greater than those of the federal budget and in many cases more dangerous because they are hidden from the public. I have complained about the Senate stopping most of the reforms which the House has passed in this Congress. Well, this is one time I hope the Senate doesn't go along with what the House has passed. 

<P>
In theory, Congressman Shuster is right. In practice, this measure would be a disaster and would move us that much further away from ever bringing our budget into balance.
<P>

<h2>
Time to Reform the FDA
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Another in the long line of appointees of President Clinton is stepping down and in this case, not a moment too soon.
<dd>David A. Kessler will resign early next year as head of the Food and Drug Administration. Actually he was first appointed by President George Bush, but toward the end of the Bush Administration he signaled that he really was a Clinton supporter and Clinton kept him on as FDA Commissioner.
<dd>During his tenure, Kessler engineered several major power grabs which opponents contend are unconstitutional at worst or against the will of Congress at best.
<dd>Actually, Kessler's adventures against tobacco, widely embraced by Bill Clinton, is one of the key factors in continued Republican control in the House of Representatives. Although union and environmentalist money defeated many GOP incumbents in the North, Republicans picked up enough seats in the South to offset those gains and Republicans hung on to the House. Several GOP incumbents in the South and border states, thought originally to be in political trouble, all kept their seats due in part to the Administration's war on tobacco.
<dd>Kessler's departure comes at a time when Congress was beginning to take an increasing interest in his power maneuvers. There were signs that the 105th Congress was finally going to confront the FDA chief so Kessler probably thought it was a good time to get going. Former FDA General Counsel Peter Barton Hut said Kessler's unexpected announcement yesterday was "great news both for the FDA and for the public health." The FDA is "in the worst state of disarray in four decades," Hut said. The agency "now needs a real leader who will focus on the agency and not on their own personal agenda."
<dd>Indeed that is Kessler's legacy.
<dd>He greatly expanded FDA's power and in the process ran roughshod over the legislative process. The more controversial his actions became the more he seemed to enjoy the fight. Ralph Nader-style proponents of big government view him in heroic terms. Business concerns which were victims of his arbitrary and often capricious harassment view him as the devil incarnate.
<dd>As with all practitioners of power politics in Washington, he got a bit carried away with his own office. The Washington Legal Foundation just issued a report accusing Kessler of padding his expense account during his tenure. In truth, that may have prompted his resignation more than anything else. Better to leave now while some segments of the media and the public consider you a hero, then to fight charges which will tarnish your image and give opponents the opening they had longed for.
<dd>President Clinton has made noises about accommodating the realities of a Republican Congress by appointing more centrist people in his Administration. The FDA would be an excellent place to demonstrate his sincerity.
<dd>While Commissioner Kessler has used his time and energy to assume jurisdiction over products where he had no authority to do so, the United States has lagged way behind the rest of the developed nations of the world in approving new life-saving drugs. It is a travesty that U.S. citizens now have to travel abroad to seek medical treatment deemed safe in Europe and Japan but not available here. The poor, which Kessler and his friends always claimed they were championing, cannot afford to go abroad for treatment. They have been left to die untreated here at home. Kessler was bold in seeking new power, but extraordinarily timid in taking action to save the lives of U.S. citizens.
<dd>Congress should now pass legislation to reform the agency to force it to function as it was set up to do. The FDA  ought to swiftly test and put on the market new products that further the health of the nation. The FDA ought to get out of those areas where Congress has not given it jurisdiction.
<dd>The President, for his part, should look for someone sensible to head the agency. Kessler, for all of his great public relations, has actually succeeded only in tying up the agency with various lawsuits which will take years to settle. Those law suits can be put behind us if the President will make the right appointment. Bill Clinton won't appoint any conservative to office, but he doesn't have to appoint a power-mad ideologue either.
Now we will get a chance to see if Bill Clinton wants to behave as a "New Democrat," at long last, or if he intends to replace Kessler with another headline-seeking Commissioner with his own agenda. That choice, which is bound to be given significant scrutiny by the Congress, will tell us a great deal about Bill Clinton's plans for a second term.

"Preempting the FDA Power Grab"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
<P>

<P>
I am not a chess player but it seems to me that Philip Morris has dealt a rather decisive blow to the plan of food and drug czar David Kessler to assert jurisdiction over the tobacco industry. <P>
Philip Morris has announced that it will seek federal legislation to make it a crime to sell tobacco to kids under age 18. Vending machines would be banished. Sale of single cigarettes would also be forbidden. Sampling would not be permitted except in areas where minors are denied access. Retailers would have to certify that they and their employees will enforce the law. <P>
The plan would also ban tobacco products from T-shirts and hats. There would be tobacco free zones where advertising tobacco products would not be permitted. No advertising would be allowed in any transit vehicle or in terminals. Tobacco products could not sponsor any sporting event where there is a significant youthful audience. <P>
Philip Morris Vice President Steve Parrish challenged President Clinton to support this legislation and to drop what Parrish calls the unconstitutional efforts of the FDA to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products. The President can avoid years of costly litigation, Parrish said, by getting on board this legislation and getting the FDA to drop its rule making procedure. Now, clearly, we will see if President Clinton wants to do something about the problem of teenage smoking or if he just wants to expand the power of one of his favorite government agencies. <P>
As commendable as the Philip Morris initiative is, still it federalizes a matter which ought to be left up to the states. But even if the states were to adopt all of the suggestions of the Institute of Medicine, whose recommendations Philip Morris followed in coming up with their legislation, there is still no substitute for parental guidance and parental example. <P>
If adults are really concerned about teenage smoking, they ought to take it seriously when they learn that their children are smoking. They ought to stop smoking themselves. Laws, especially federal laws, are no substitute for parental responsibility. <P>
While we would rather see Congress pass a law than a federal agency seize power in an unconstitutional fashion, members of society should turn less to federal laws and more to themselves if societal problems are going to be solved. <P>

"Liberal Media Bias"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>

<P>
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich said yesterday that if the news media really believes so much in affirmative action, they should hire conservative Republicans. Gingrich was reacting to a Freedom Forum study, released by the Gannett-sponsored organization last week, which demonstrates that reporters covering politics and government are predominately liberal. 92% voted for President Clinton, as compared with 43% of the population as a whole. 
<P>
The study reveals something else, however, which is in my view, even more disturbing. It highlights the overwhelming cynicism of the national media toward anyone serving in office. This cynicism is especially pronounced, no doubt, when reporters cover politicians with whom they disagree.
<P>When I worked in the newsroom of a major metropolitan daily during the 1964 Presidential campaign, the reporters were overwhelmingly for the re-election of Lyndon Johnson. In fact, out of a staff of close to 100, I found only four supporters of the Republican nominee, Barry Goldwater. Editorially, the itself supported Goldwater, but the reporters who covered the campaign were against him. <P>

I have to say that, by and large, the professionalism of this group of reporters overcame their bias. Goldwater got fair coverage from the Milwaukee Sentinel despite the views of the reporters covering him.  When President Eisenhower got such a thunderous ovation at the 1964 GOP convention in San Francisco for criticizing the media, he was referring to columnists and editorial writers, not news reporters. Eisenhower suggested that lots of people were giving advice to the Republicans -- pundits who would, themselves, never vote for Republican candidates. The delegates roared their approval. 
<P>Today, the situation is reversed. In most papers the majority of columnists are from the center-right point of view. Even dedicated liberal papers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times have conservative columnists. Where those who believe in limited government, free enterprise, a strong national defense and traditional moral values take it on the chin is on the reportorial side of the equation. The people who cover the news are no longer taught, as they were when I was a reporter, that their personal opinions are not to show up in their reporting. <P>

The change came during Watergate. Prior to that time, there had been a small group of advocacy journalists who had made their way into America's newsrooms. They were in conflict with the traditional journalists who believed that their responsibility was to cover news, not to make news. When the Washington Post brought down the Nixon Administration, the advocacy journalists had won the day. Traditional journalists could no longer prevail because what the advocacy journalists had accomplished was to make the media a fourth and most powerful branch of government. 
<P>From that time to the present, the cynicism of journalists, many of whom do not hide their point of view, is overwhelming. They begin with the presumption that politicians, especially ones with whom they disagree, are guilty. All that remains is for them to identify the wrong the politicians have done. 
<P>
It is inconceivable, in the minds of these reporters, that the freshmen Republicans who got elected in 1994 actually believe in something and want the country to change. Rather, the reporters believe these freshmen have to be serving some special interests. They must be fronting for big money. Or at the very least they are serving their own interests. 
<P>It is not only a liberal bias, but this cynicism, which makes for the sort of coverage that has caused Speaker Gingrich to tell supporters that over the next six months they must become "personal radio stations" to overcome the bias of the media. The preference for liberal and Democratic politicians was in the newsrooms more than 30 years ago. What is different between now and then is that editors back then insisted that personal views be kept out of the news pages. This didn't always happen, of course, but the bias was subdued. Today the bias is blatant. 
<P>The only cure for this in the long run is the market place. Newspapers are in a state of steep decline. Each time new ratings come out, network television has lost some additional viewers to rival cable or direct broadcast channels. At some point, the owners of these media properties will stop being in a state of denial and will begin to examine their coverage. It is then that they may insist once again that advocacy journalism is for opinion columns and commentaries. 
<P>So when reading newspaper coverage makes you so angry you can't see straight, or when watching television news makes you want to smash the set, contribute to the growing market forces which will change the system. Don't buy the paper. And turn off that channel. There are other sources of news. The more you patronize the other sources instead of the ones which distort reality, the sooner the owners of the so-called mainstream media will be forced, for their own economic well being, either to change things or get out of the business.<P>

<h2>For Less Than This Colson Went to Jail
</h2>
<P>
<P>

<P>
What a difference a couple of years makes. On May 22, 1994, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos said this of Craig Livingstone, the then director of the White House office of personnel security: "He does a terrific job. All I know is that anything that has to do with security or logistics  Craig's going to take care of it. You don't have to tell him how to do it, when to do it. Just that it needs to be done, and he does it. And he knows how to cut through the bureaucracy and get things done." Stephanopoulos told this to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Livingstone's home town newspaper.
<P>When confronted with the quote late last week, Stephanopoulos now says, "I don't know him that well. He's a guy that was around. He came up to me one day and said 'my paper's doing this and would you give them a quote' and I said 'sure.' I never worked with him on a campaign but he seemed competent. What can I tell you?"  As to the contention that Livingstone knows how to cut through the bureaucracy, Stephanopoulos says, "I just can't think of a specific thing he handled."
<P>Which version of the truth from the White House do you believe? This is, in fact, THE crucial question as we ponder the meaning of the issue over the hundreds of FBI files on Republicans turned over to the White House. The first spin put out by the White House was that Livingstone and Anthony Marceca were just low level bureaucrats who made a mistake.
<P>Now comes Denis Casey, the former Gary Hart for President campaign coordinator in Western Pennsylvania, who tells us that Livingstone and Marceca were busy gathering dirt on union officials who supported Walter Mondale in 1984.  They were doing this in an effort to try to blackmail the officials into switching to Hart's side to the point where Casey demanded that they be fired. The Casey testimony casts a whole different light on this issue. Livingstone and Marceca, it would seem, were professional political assassins who placed in charge of all of the sensitive material gathered by the FBI on their political opposition.
<P>Now the question is who put them in their positions? Who understood their background? To whom did they report? What did Bill Clinton know and when did he know it?
<P>Attorney General Janet Reno is absolutely right in asking that Independent Counsel Ken Strarr investigate this matter. It is not something which any person connected with the Clinton Administration can be trusted to handle. Let's remember that Chuck Colson, former Nixon White House aide, went to jail for showing a single FBI file to a reporter. We need to know why these FBI files were requested and exactly how the information therein was used.
<P>The fact that George Stephanopoulos could change his story on Livingstone so easily suggests that it is going to be very difficult getting at the truth on this issue. At the heart of the matter is no less than this question: Is the United States still a free nation where reasonable people can disagree and still continue to practice politics, or have we gone down the road to a dictatorship where if our opponents win the election, the rest of us have to live in fear over what comes next? <P>

Virginia Primary a Test of Loyalty
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>A visitor from another state who might have happened upon one of Senator John Warners television commercials, aimed at voters in next Tuesdays Virginia Republican primary, would probably think that Warner is the conservative candidate. The Warner commercial talks about tradition and how proud he is to be a part of Virginias venerable conservatism. But the record of three term Senator John Warner suggests he is anything but a true blue conservative. 
<P>Warners election was a fluke. In 1978, the newly found conservative majority in the Republican party nominated the young, articulate, and very attractive party chairman Dick Obenshain for the Senate. Obenshain seemed to be on the road to victory. But Obenshain was tragically killed when his light plane crashed in the Virginia countryside, leaving the party without a nominee for the Senate at the ninth hour of the election content. John Warner, who had spent a huge amount of money in trying to win the nomination, but who was gracious in defeat and had pledged to support Obenshain, was drafted as the GOP nominee.  
<P>Warners campaign was going nowhere and the conservatives who had picked Obenshain declined to support him. My longtime friend Dick Scaife of Pittsburgh called me and asked if I would put together a meeting of conservatives with Warner. I did so on October 7th of 1978. It was a contentious meeting which lasted two and a half hours. Warner ended up pledging to vote conservative on every issue that was raised from the Equal Rights Amendment to abortion and the SALT treaty with the Soviets. Conservatives got behind Warner and he pulled off the closest senate election in Virginia history. 
<P>Warner kept most of his promises during his first term although he had to be reminded of them from time to time. When he came up for re-election in 1984, he hardly had opposition. It was during his second term that he moved to the left. He opposed, for example, Ronald Reagans nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. On many crucial votes, he could be counted on by the liberals if they needed him. When he won his third term in 1990, nearly unopposed, he decided to go the distance. Up to that point, Warner had pretty much stayed out of Republican politics in the state of Virginia. 
<P>Looking at himself as invincible, the onetime husband of actress Elizabeth Taylor, waded in knee deep. When conservatives prevailed and nominated home school association executive Mike Ferris as their candidate for Lt. Governor, Warner refused to support him. Ferris lost narrowly to Don Beyer, the man who will be the Democratic standard bearer for Governor next year. 
<P>Then when some conservatives put forth the candidacy of Oliver North for the Senate against Senator Chuck Robb, Warner backed Norths intra-party rival, former Reagan budget director Jim Miller. Miller lost narrowly to North. So Warner went out and recruited former Virginia Attorney General Marshall Coleman to run as an Independent. Coleman drew just enough votes away from North to send Chuck Robb back to the Senate for another six years. So Miller, who had enjoyed Warners support in 1994, decided that was too much for him and declared his candidacy against Warner.
<P>Warners incumbency has drawn big bucks and Miller has not had the funds to run an aggressive campaign. Still, many conservatives are very bitter about Warners betrayal of their candidates. Republican National Committeeman Morton Blackwell, just overwhelmingly re-elected to a third term to that post last week-end at a state convention, said that if the Republicans re-nominate Warner, "we ought to take up a collection and erect, on Monument Avenue in Richmond, a statue of Benedict Arnold." 
<P>Warner, for his part, is openly courting Democrats to vote for him in the primary. Virginia has no party registration so anyone may vote in this primary. Polls show Warner ahead by a large margin but the Warner folks are worried. Moral indignation against Warner runs so high among activists that if they turn out and Warner supporters take his election for granted, Miller just might pull an upset.
<P>Miller is a solid down the line conservative but a colorless campaigner who has failed to excite people. Warner enjoys so much support among Democrats, that the Democratic nominee for the Senate, Mark Warner (no relation) is given no chance to win. 
<P>Still the contest in Virginia boils down to this: in this last half of the last decade of the 20th Century, is loyalty still a virtue?  Many Republicans say that Warner turned his back on them and his party and he has no right now to turn to them to seek another term in the Senate. When the votes are counted on Tuesday, it will be known if dancing with the girl who brought you to the party is still in vogue or if Republicans prefer someone who is more loyal to the Democrats and to himself than to the party whose label he reluctantly wears.<P>

"Clinton Should Stay Out of Foreign Elections"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
By this time tomorrow we may know the projected winner in the Israeli elections. 
<P>By all measures, the contest will be determined by a razor-thin margin. The choice for Prime Minister is between the incumbent Shimon Peres and the challenger Benjamin Netanyahu. But in a sense, it is a contest between the old political order and a new order where the outcome depends largely on teenagers voting for the first time and refugees from the former Soviet Union who are also participating in their first Israeli election. 
<P>It has been an interesting roller coaster of an election. Netanyahu was chosen by the opposition Likud bloc last year and immediately began to challenge the so called peace process supported by the late Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin. Netanyahu jumped to a substantial lead in the polls and there was talk that Rabin was finished politically. Indeed the rally at which Rabin was shot was being held to drum up political support for the sagging fortunes of Rabin. 
<P>When Foreign Minister Shimon Peres took over from Rabin and the media tried to blame Netanyahu for creating the climate which led to Rabins death, Peres took what seemed to be an insurmountable lead in the polls. But Arab terrorist attacks and the ineffective Israeli response to them has permitted Netanyahu to climb back, inch by inch, to the point that he is now in a statistical dead heat with Peres and may even be slightly ahead with only 2% of the vote still undecided. 
<P>The outcome in this election will have an impact here in Washington. Throughout our history, we have always had our favorites in foreign elections. Hints were dropped here and there about what Washington thought and there were subtle moves to indicate our preference. But this time, President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and other Administration officials have gone full tilt for Peres. At the moment polls showed the election tightening, Clinton called a hastily improvised summit meeting with Peres which was nothing more than a photo opportunity for the commercials which are now running on Israeli television. Of course promises of more foreign aid to Israel were suggested, IF Peres is re-elected. 
<P>The Clinton Administration in word and deed has left no stone unturned in its effort to influence the Israeli voters who know full well that there would be no Israel at all were it not for America. They also know how dependent Israel is on American economic aid so when "big brother" says he wants Peres, it is politically significant. But it may have backfired on Clinton and if so, the price to be paid will be high. 
<P>I had discussions with Netanyahu some years ago when he served in Washington. He is one tough customer. In fact, he may be the bluntest politician running for any office anywhere in the world. He would have no hesitancy in facing down Clinton and company the way he has faced down all of his domestic political enemies, which are many. 
<P>The Arabs, who have found common ground with Peres, would find that they had quite another kind of politician to deal with if Netanyahu wins. The Arabs who are eligible to vote in the Israeli elections are backing Peres nearly unanimously. 
<P>Directly interfering in a foreign election is not only a big gamble, it goes against the democratic principles we claim we espouse. This is an election for the citizens of Israel to decide, not for Washington to dictate.
<P>The United States is also intervening similarly in the Russian elections where we have done everything but carry the suitcases for Boris Yeltsin. Indeed our involvement has become one of the principal issues in the elections. Gregory Yavilinsky, who is the one candidate who comes closest to professing the democratic and free market ideals we claim to stand for, is outraged because until the United States and its Western partner intervened massively for Yeltsin, he was thought to have a shot at the election. That intervention, done at the taxpayers expense, may have propped up Yeltsin but it has also played right into the hand of the leading candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, whose main issue is that a plot on the part of the West caused the Soviet Union to collapse and thus it must be restored. 
<P>Bill Clinton has proved to be a masterful politician when it comes to handling the Republican Congress. With the media as his ally, he seems to be galloping to a second term and perhaps taking the Congress with him. His opponents claim he is guilty of deception and political manipulation. Be that as it may, Bill Clinton ought to stick to campaigning in this country. His overt intervention in foreign elections is dangerous either way those elections go. 
<P>Bill Clinton and company are big supporters of the New World Order so they see it as their duty to intervene. But the American taxpayers have no such obligation and through our elected officials in Congress we ought to demand that this worldwide manipulation of the democratic process be stopped before it drags us headlong into another world war.<P>

<h2>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
</h2>
<P>
<P>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
<P>What is going on here? On the same day that a federal appeals court rules that the attempt by Congress to keep children from getting access to pornography on the Internet is unconstitutional, baseball owners have deprived Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott of the right to run her own baseball club for two years.
So let me understand this. It is okay to make all sorts of filthy material readily available to kids via the Internet, but the owner of a baseball team doesnt have the right to say stupid things.<P>

Far be it from me to defend the things Marge Schott has said. Most of her remarks display ignorance of history and disregard for the concept of the United States as a melting pot. But so what? Is this a crime?
Baseball owners have made it clear that Schott was disciplined, not for anything she did in connection with the management of the Reds, but because of "insensitivity." Wow! If insensitivity is a crime, some of our greatest athletic coaches will be soon out of jobs.<P>

It seems to me that the game of baseball, once known as Americas favorite pastime, has succumbed to a case of extreme political correctness. Schott has made some highly questionable remarks about Asians, for example. But no charge has been made that she discriminated against any Asian employee who might have worked for the Reds.<P>

It is quite one matter if Marge Schott were charged with discriminating against minorities who worked for her. That, after all, violates the law. But expressing her opinion? Louis Farrakhan has opinions which make me physically ill. No one, however, suggests he isnt entitled to his opinions even though they exude racial and religious hatred. So why pick on Marge Schott?<P>
If patrons are offended by what Schott says, they can boycott Cincinnati Reds games. Thats the American way. But to punish the lady by taking away her property rights because she said "insensitive" things is anything but American.<P>

I am sure that acting Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig feels good about himself now that he has exhibited this burst of political correctness. Well, he shouldnt.<P>

The precedent Selig has set may well come back to haunt him. Thats because the dictators of political correctness are always changing their standards. Who knows, maybe Selig will one day be deprived of the right to operate the Milwaukee Brewers because of something he says, which by todays standards is perfectly acceptable.<P>

As to Marge Schott, she ought to find the same ACLU lawyers who handled the Internet case. Ill bet the courts would overturn the decision of the baseball owners in a flash if they were given half a chance.<P>

The Declining Conscience of America
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
Those who watched this program regularly earlier this year may recall that when President Clinton vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion measure, I predicted that this would be the high water mark of his administration. That act, I suggested, would bring about his defeat in the Fall. It is true that Clinton, who at that moment enjoyed a 56% approval rating, the highest of his Presidency for more than a day or two, never did achieve that high water mark again. But it is not true that this issue made a controlling difference in this election. 
<p>
<dd>
The liberal columnist Mark Shields, also host of CNN's Capital Gang, said today that post election survey data revealed that abortion was important to a much greater portion of the electorate than had originally been believed. Moreover, of those for whom abortion was deemed their most important issue in this election, Bob Dole defeated Bill Clinton two to one. So much for the myth that the so called pro choice position is an automatic winner with the electorate. It can be correctly argued that abortion did not effect the outcome of the Presidential race because Bob Dole refused to make it an issue. 
<p>
<dd>
Even when, in the final debate, a minister handed Bob Dole a soft ball question about the decline in morality in America, Dole did not raise the issue and gave President Clinton a pass. Unless voters went to one of the churches where pastors made this an issue or unless voters received mailings from the National Right to Life Committee, they probably were simply unaware that this was an issue. Indeed, another survey released last week revealed that among voters who followed and understood the issues, Dole was a decisive winner. 
<p>
<dd>
But among those who simply voted without following what was going on in the country, Bill Clinton won in a landslide. There were races, however, where the abortion issue became a principal focus. In Louisiana, retired Archbishop Philip Hannan declared that it would be a sin for Catholics to vote for Democratic Senate candidate Mary Landrieu because of her abortion position. What followed was days of discussion in the media about the separation of church and state, so that voters almost could not escape hearing about the issue. Since Louisiana has the greatest share of Catholics in the South, Hannan's statement was thought to be the death blow to Landrieu. But, barring the ability of Republican candidate Woody Jenkins to present evidence to the Senate of overwhelming fraud, Mary Landrieu will take her place as a Senator in January. Just a few years ago a statement such as Hannan made on abortion would have been a death blow to Landrieu. There is at least some evidence that Hannan's statement may have actually moved some Catholic voters to vote for Landrieu out of spite. 
<p>
<dd>
Likewise in Iowa, the race for the Senate against incumbent Senator Tom Harkin became, in the words of Congressman Jim Ross Lightfoot's campaign manager John Maxwell "a referendum on partial birth abortion". Lightfoot's initiative on the issue hurt incumbent Senator Harkin badly enough that it forced Harkin to air a television commercial accusing Lightfoot of distorting his record. Harkin claimed that he really was against partial birth abortion. That caused Lightfoot to air a commercial featuring a retired Catholic priest who looked like he stepped out of a Bing Crosby movie. The priest explained partial birth abortion and said Harkin had not told the truth when he said he was against it because he had voted to keep the procedure legal twice. Then the priest looked into the camera and said :'If Harkin would lie about this...." The commercial ended. It seemed to do the trick. Lightfoot came back up in the polls. But on the day before the election President Clinton came to Iowa and supported Harkin on the issue and Harkin went on to win the closest Senate contest against an incumbent. 
<p>
<dd>
But still Harkin won. So I was dead wrong about America. The Presidential race can be explained away. The Iowa and Louisiana Senate races cannot be. Yes, both were very close races. Yes there were many other issues involved. But abortion was front and center in both cases long enough for the electorate to make an informed choice. The electorate went for the candidate who supported near infanticide, the act of killing a baby by sucking its brains out moments before it is delivered from the Mother's womb. Because I thought America still had a conscience, I was confident that this issue would be decisive with voters. It was with some, but not enough.  
<p>
<dd>
I regret to say that I was wrong about this issue, not because I made a mistake. The Good Lord knows that I make lots of mistakes every single day. I regret that I was wrong not because the candidates I hoped would win lost. I regret to say I was wrong because of what it says about the American electorate. It tells me that no matter how brutal the crime, no matter how unconscionable the act, no matter how dire the consequences for the society, a majority of those who bother to show up at the polls will blind themselves to reality. That, my friends, does not bode well for the survival of our nation.

Revolution?
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
Last year at this time the new Leadership in the House of Representatives spoke boldly of "revolution." Speaker Gingrich especially insisted that business-as-usual was out; fundamental changes in the way that Washington does business were in. When some of us suggested that the Senate and President Clinton were unlikely to go along with such changes, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston retorted, "President Clinton is irrelevant and the Senate doesn't matter. Not one dime can be spent on a single program unless the House of Representatives okays the spending." Known as the One-House Veto strategy, this was the way Republicans were going to force an end to programs which they considered bad for the country.
<P>What a difference a year makes. Speaker Gingrich may have fun cavorting with Jay Leno or acting as substitute host for "Larry King Live," but these days there is no talk of revolution. The rest of the Republican Leadership tries to put a happy face on what happened with the budget process, but it is hard for them to do. As for Chairman Livingston, he doesn't much like to answer questions on the One-House Veto strategy. 
<P>That is because on substance Bill Clinton won just about everything he fought for in the fiscal year 1996 budget which was finally approved by Congress. Americorps, which is a device to pay volunteers to be active in politics, supporting Clinton and his friends, is still with us. The National Endowment for the Arts, despite its subsidies for pornographic art, is in the budget. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, despite its ability to earn billions by marketing its own products, gets subsidized for a longer term than even budgets approved by Democratic Congresses. The Legal Services Corporation, which over the years has done more harm than any other single federal program I can think of, is alive and well. Goals 2000, which is an attempt to federalize education and to impose "outcome based" methods on local school districts survived because Bill Clinton fought for it and the Republicans were unwilling to stand up and fight against it. The Commerce Department, Department of Education, and even HUD are still with us.  
<P>I could go on and on, but you get the picture. It is true that this budget does cut more money from discretionary programs than even the Republicans had proposed when they first put forth their seven-year balanced budget. So in that sense, the Republicans have a right to some credit. They are actually ahead of where they said they would be in reducing the deficit and getting the budget into balance, which is a little-known fact completely lost in the national debate.
<P>The bad news is that the federal programs the Republicans sought to kill have been funded and will be funded again in the 1997 budget. If Bill Clinton is re-elected and if the Democrats take over Congress, as well they might, these programs will grow again and be right back where they were. True, most of them have been significantly reduced under the newly-approved budget, but the bureaucrats don't care. As long as they stay alive, as long as the infrastructure stays intact, they can survive to fight another day. That is why the freshmen Republicans wanted to pull these programs up by their roots. That is why they proposed eliminating three or four cabinet departments. 
<P>I am not faulting the Republicans because these things didn't happen. The fact is that one election simply isn't enough to turn a nation around which has been heading in the opposite direction for seventy years. What the Republicans should be blamed for is not waging an all-out fight to accomplish the ends which they originally sought. In the process of such a fight they probably would have managed to get half again as much as they got. But even if they didn't, the public would understand what the 1996 election is about.
<P>Elections are best for the country when there are clear-cut differences between the parties. Now everything is fuzzed up. Both sides are claiming credit for the budget. Under these circumstances Bill Clinton and Congressional Democrats win hands down. 
<P>It was said of Bill Clinton that he didn't really believe in anything. Indeed, if you follow his rhetoric, he is masterful in appropriating the themes of his opponents. "The era of big government is over," intoned the President in his "State of the Union" speech. But Bill Clinton fought, and fought hard, for liberal federal programs. He fought on principle. He got every single thing he fought for in one way or the other. I haven't even mentioned the wholesale Republican retreat on environmental issues. 
<P>The problem here is that one side was willing to go all out to win. The other side was embarrassed by what it was fighting for. The Republicans didn't want to defend killing the Endowment for the Arts because too many upper class suburban women gave them a hard time. They didn't want to defend killing the Legal Services Corporation because they heard from too many Republican lawyers who were afraid they would get stuck with more pro-bono work. They didn't want to defend cutting off the government subsidy for PBS lest they see one more bumper sticker proclaiming that Newt killed Barney. 
<P>In short, they didn't have the stomach to face down their opponents. Bob Livingston was right. If the House had stood its ground, none of this would have happened because not a penny can be spent by a President which doesn't get money from both houses of Congress.
<P>The voters are going to take it out on the Republicans for their cowardice because it was they who built up expectations to an unreasonable level. The sad thing is that the freshmen, most of whom fought the good fight even against the wishes of their own Leadership, are likely to get hit the hardest by the voter wrath. And when that happens, the assumption will be made that cutting back federal programs is anathema with the voters and cannot be attempted again. 
<P>No Greek drama or Middles Ages morality play ever had a more tragic ending. 
<P>

"Earth Day' its Own Religion"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>

<P>
Thirty-two years ago today, two momentous things happened. Our first
daughter, Dawn Ceol, was born and the first "Earth Day" was proclaimed.
There is no connection between the two, I can assure you, although Dawn has
shown a lot of interest in gardening of late. <P>
It is true enough that we human beings have been given custody of earth and
that we should take appropriate care of what has been entrusted to us. 
But it is also true that in the Book of Genesis, it is clear that man was
given dominion over the earth. There was not a word from God suggesting that
we should preserve everything just as it was created. Quite the contrary,
God gave man an intellect and the ability to develop the earth.<P> 
Rather than a call for us to be responsible, as we continue to make progress
in unlocking what God knows anyway, "Earth Day" has become an ideology or a
substitute religion. The underlying assumption behind this ideology is that
the earth was created in a pristine state and it is man who is the problem.
If only we didn't spoil the earth with our use of resources, then we could
live in the beauty of nature again.<P> 
No one defends the real polluters. No one suggests that all businesses or
individuals have been completely responsible or even efficient in the use of
natural resources. But the idea that we are the problem is a direct denial
of God's word in Genesis. And that is the heart of the conflict over "Earth
Day." <P>
While not all who celebrate this occasion have adopted that philosophy,
those who have created the occasion have a neo-Pantheism at the heart of
what they believe. They worship not the God of creation, but nature itself.
These views are hardly new. We have evidence of similar ideas going back to
ancient times. Since nature is to be elevated, and man is to be subject to
nature, of course private property becomes an outmoded concept.<P> 
Nature, so many of the "Earth Day" advocates believe, cannot be confined to
a single individual but belongs to us all. Private property flies in the
face of this ideology. So behind the niceties of celebrating the beauties of
the natural state of the earth is an attack on the individual and his
rights. Thus it is fair to say that most so-called "Greens" are only green
on the outside. At the core they are red or at least pink.<P> 
When all is said and done there is little difference between what the
radical elements of the "Earth Day" movement believe and what the Marxists
teach. I say teach, because if you have ever visited a Communist nation you
will note that the reality is in stark contrast to Marxist beliefs. This is
especially true about the environment. At all of the international meetings,
the Communists were always pushing the Green agenda. Yet they left their own
nations in environmental ruins. <P>
So on this "Earth Day," while mindful of the importance of taking good care
of what has been entrusted to us temporarily, I prefer to celebrate Dawn's
birthday instead. She has been an outstanding example of what it means to
develop one's God given talents. I'd rather trust Dawn and her good husband
Ed to do good things with the property they own, then to put my trust in an
ideology which defies not only the Scriptures but reality as well. So Happy
Birthday, Dawn. Now get busy in your garden.
<P>

"Republicans Should Stick to the Issues" 
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
There is no doubt that Bill Clinton is on a roll. His latest poll numbers show him with an unprecedented 21-point lead over presumed Republican nominee Bob Dole. That poll doesnt even take into account what will happen if, as is likely, Ross Perot runs again and splits the anti-Clinton vote.
<P>All of the dire predictions which many of us made about Clintons foreign policy adventures, especially our involvement in Bosnia, have thus far not come true. For a President who said that domestic issues would be his primary focus, Clinton seems to be making quite a name for himself in the Balkans, in the Middle East, in Russia and  elsewhere.
<P>And while the economy isnt exactly bustling along, growth is probably just adequate enough to prevent electoral problems for the President.
<P>Then there is Whitewater and associated problems. Whitewater was supposed to draw Clinton a primary opponent. It did not. He is the first Democrat since FDR not to have one. he President just made a three-and-a-half-hour videotaped interview for the criminal trial of James and Susan McDougal and Governor Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas. They are the three charged with conspiracy and fraud in the Whitewater affair. The text of the tape will be released but not the tape itself because the White House believes that Clinton opponents would try to turn the tape into a 60-second commercial.
<P>Whitewater has been in the news since before Clinton took office and yet it has failed to effect the standing of this President. My co-hosts and I debated this on last nights Campaign 96 show with Mark Levine of Landmark Legal Foundation. Levine believes that Clinton is in for big-time trouble down the road on Whitewater. I disagree. I think if, as is probable, Gov. Tucker gets acquitted, Whitewater will be over and done with. To pursue it after such a verdict will simply appear too partisan. Republicans would run the risk of a significant backlash.
<P>The polls show that a majority of the people in the United States believe that the Clintons are hiding something. But the same polls show that the majority doesnt care. The question is why dont they care? Well, first off Whitewater is too complicated to understand. The public will not be interested in this case unless and until there is something simple which they can relate to. They understood Hillary and the cattle futures issue. They understood the Watergate break-in. They understood Chairman Rostenkowskis misdeeds. They dont understand this case. Secondly, whatever the Clintons did, it mostly took place before he was President. True, Vice President Spiro Agnew was driven from office by what he did as Governor of Maryland. But most voters want to know what Clinton has done while President, not something which happened a decade and a half ago. Thirdly, the voters today are cynical about politicians. There is no shock value to the notion that a politician and his wife might be in this game to get something for themselves. In fact the public believes that all politicians are similarly guilty.  Since it is presumed, guilt that is confirmed just doesnt have that much of an impact.<P>
Yes, of course, there is the media which made a national cause out of John Sununu getting dental work while on official business. But the media has not covered Whitewater with any intensity. Still, I cant fault the national media on this one as I have done on many other issues. After Clinton came into office, hundreds of Pulitzer Prize seeking reporters swarmed into Little Rock seeking to break the story that would bring this President down. They did that, not because they disliked Clinton, (most of them voted for him) but because it would bring them more power. Some journalists really worked at it for months going on years, and with unlimited expense accounts. They simply never found the smoking gun.
<P>Looking at Clintons standing with the voters, some Republicans are hoping against hope that Whitewater will turn into something to rescue their fortunes. They are foolish to count on it. If it comes at all, it could well be after this President is re-elected.
<P>I have said from the beginning of this case that I didnt think it would impact politically. Republicans, I suggested, would be well off to make the philosophical case against liberalism and the Clinton Presidency. If something does come of Whitewater they will get an added benefit but meanwhile the 1996 election would be about real issues which matter to the American people. They have not done so. And now they are reduced to hoping that one of Clintons friends will drop something sensational at the Whitewater hearings or that somehow the jury in Arkansas will find Governor Tucker guilty. Thus the reality is that Bob Dole cannot win the Presidency. Only Bill Clinton can lose it. That has never been a winning strategy to gain power in this country. Even if the Republicans do take power under these circumstances, they do so without any mandate to change anything.
<P>It is the ninth-hour and the sun is nearly setting on this election season. It is still not too late for this election to be about opposing philosophies and clear differences on issues. If that case is made, Whitewater wont be needed. If something substantive relating to Whitewater does break between now and the election, it will only underscore the philosophical case which has already been made. It remains to be seen now if, at least, conservatives will stick to the issues this year instead of waiting for the political equivalent of the lottery known as Whitewater.<P>

<h2>"Dole Trashes his Base"
</h2>
<P>

<P>Bob Dole must have a death wish. His campaign seemed to get recharged when he announced his resignation from the Senate a few weeks ago. Last weekend he even seemed to forge a compromise on the abortion issue which everyone from Christie Todd Whitman, the liberal Governor of New Jersey, to Pat Buchanan, Doles rival for the GOP nomination, could live with. 
<P>The compromise would have retained the pro-life language in the GOP platform as it has been since 1980, but it would have included in the preamble a declaration of tolerance for opposing views on not only the abortion issue but other matters as well. It was a shrewd compromise which gave something to both sides who are deeply divided on the issue. Dole was widely praised for his leadership on the issue.
<P>No sooner had that matter been put to rest than the presumptive Presidential nominee re-opened the issue. Dole now insists that the so-called "declaration of tolerance" be included, not in the preamble, but as an amendment to the pro-life plank. That would have the effect of rendering the pro-life position of the party as meaningless. Moreover, such a declaration of tolerance wouldnt apply to other issues that divide Republicans including NAFTA and GATT to the assault weapons ban to term limits. Dole denounced Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council in ferocious terms, the likes of which he has never unleashed on Bill Clinton. 
<P>This move was taken as a declaration of war by social conservatives. Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, who has been very friendly to Dole throughout the primary season, told Dole in plain English that what Dole was proposing was unacceptable. Later, a spokesman for the organization suggested that if that position prevails, Christian Coalition will have to sit out the Presidential election. Christian Coalition oriented voters constitute about a quarter of the Republican vote.
<P>As if that werent bad enough. Dole, in his departing speech from the Senate which was carried live by a number of the networks, went through a litany of the programs he had helped to pass during his years in the Senate. Almost all of them were liberal programs such as food stamps and the Americans for Disabilities Act which were fought hard by conservatives. As Steve Moore of the CATO Institute put it : "Some of us have tried hard to find a reason to vote for Bob Dole. By emphasizing terrible programs that we all fought, he is just reminding us why we cant vote for him." 
<P>Indeed Doles speech had that effect among his hard core base. "It is clear that in a Dole Presidency we will get the same policies we are getting under Clinton. The difference is that there will be no resistance to those policies if they are pushed by Dole," one veteran conservative Republican pronounced. "Let him get elected with the votes of liberals," said another.
<P>But Dole wasnt content in just alienating his activist base. He went on to put distance between himself and the freshmen House Members who have been the only breath of fresh air to hit the Republican party in years. In a broadcast interview, Dole said the freshmen had gone too far in the areas of education and the environment. That caused Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin to send a message to Dole: "If that is the party line, let me know and Ill go and do something else. I have no intention of running against both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole this year." Neumann, who was elected in the closest race percentage wise in the nation in 1994, said Doles comments have put him in an impossible position politically, one which cannot be sustained in his district. 
<P>The freshmen, the only group to stand up and fight for principle in Washington in recent memory, now find themselves isolated from their party standard bearer. What Dole has done is to play right into the hands of the Democrats who have denounced the freshmen as "extremist." One Dole staffer suggested that Bob Dole wouldnt be all that unhappy if some of the freshmen were defeated for re-election because then Dole wouldnt have to deal with them when he becomes President. 
<P>There is a rule in politics which is almost never violated by successful candidates for President. First, consolidate your base. Then move outward from there. Bob Dole has spent the last week carpet bombing his base. If he wins the Presidency, it is clear that Dole wants to do so without the Christian right, principled economic conservatives, or the tough minded House freshmen. A Dole Presidency under those conditions, which no doubt would be accompanied by a Democratic Congress, would produce more victories for liberalism than Bill Clinton could ever hope to deliver.  As Eric Licht, President of Coalitions for America put it, "Bill Clinton couldnt pass national health insurance, but Bob Dole could well do so." 
<P>I guess I am always open to being shown new ways to put together a winning electoral coalition. If Bob Dole can be elected President by trashing the heart of the party which nominated him, it will truly be an election for the history books. <P>

<h2>Drunkenness at the Helm of Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Back in the Cold War days, political leaders routinely saw blocks of nations dividing the international landscape. In those days our heads of state worked hard to maintain a balance between opposing forces: the Communist world and free world; the East against the West; Russia and China verses the United States.
<dd>Apparently, many of our citizens have forgotten the struggle that gave us the Iron Curtain, mutual assured destruction, and communist subversion within the U.S. counterculture.Today a new set of opposing forces has gathered with little notice in the press. 
<dd>While the U.S. is still the dominant force for freedom and democracy, that course is uncertain as we approach the 21st century. Much of the problem rests with an outdated world perspective upon which our elected leaders and appointed officials presuppose our nation's foreign policy. The Administration and its State Department still see the world as a collection of nations divided according to geography. Stabilization, democracy, and now environmental unity are the altruistic goals of the 90s.
<dd>Unfortunately the world has become far more complicated than the two-dimensional map would suggest. Like the Cold War, a serious division has emerged. This time the battle lines have been drawn between opposing cultures, one of which has become united behind a religion whose logical conclusion is world dominance.Unwilling to recognize this, Washington is squandering our nation's military and economic preparedness, by allowing our future to become steadily drunk at the international saloon of the United Nations and its appeasement politics. <dd>Drunkards slur their speech; our foreign policy experts make vague pronouncements. Drunkards are make fools of themselves; America's foreign policy leaders have disgraced their country. Drunkards are slow to react to sudden danger; America's foreign policy drunkards scarcely see what is happening in the world around them: leaders of the modern Islam have declared war on our society.
<dd>Islamic cultural leaders are committed to the ultimate destruction of the United States, which they call the Great Satan. It is a holy war, or jihad, as they call it. The generals of this war have constructed an unlikely alliance with China and Russia. Remember, Communist China still hates the U.S.  Also, half of Russia's population are anti-West and would willingly return to life as a communist nation. Over the past several years, these two nations have helped arm key Islamic client states, such as Syria, Iran and Iraq.Foreign policy inebriation is nothing laughing matter. 
<dd>Our nation cannot remain silent while its elected leaders and their appointees wile away our future and sacrifice our safety, passed out in the UN saloon. As citizens, we must demand from our government the thing our government has no right to possess. We must demand that Washington give America back to the people before it is too late.

<h2>Public Prayer Launches Romanias New Era</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
It was a scene worthy of a Cecil B. De Mille production. Thousands of people were gathered in University
Square early Monday morning in Bucharest, Romania, as Emil Constantinescu addressed them from a 
balcony overlooking the square. "I am here to tell you that I will never betray you. We are here for the people 
who fought the guns with their bodies," Constantinescu said. With that, the new President-elect of Romania 
asked the crowd to pray with him. Thousands of people dropped to their knees, bowed their heads and 
recited The Lord's prayer.
<DD>
Thus began a new era in Romanian history, the last of the Eastern European nations to shed the old 
Communist regime. At Christmas time in 1989, just after the Berlin Wall came down and following changes 
in other Eastern European nations, Communist Dictator Nicholas Ceaucescu was captured and executed. 
The man who gave the order for the execution was Ion Illiescu, who subsequently was elected and then 
re-elected President of Romania. He loosened some government controls of people's lives which Ceaucescu 
had imposed, but he kept his government in the hands of the Socialists. Almost no privatization. Huge heavy 
and unproductive industries still owned and operated by the government. Rampant inflation and a population 
which could scarcely get by.
<DD>
Illiescu was able to keep control with his own cleverness. His agents infiltrated the Democratic 
opposition and caused them to fight each other over the smallest of points. He inaugurated political parties 
with near identical names to those of the Democratic parties so that uneducated peasants would have trouble
 telling the difference. His tactic worked. His neo-Communist Socialists hung on for seven long years.
<DD>
Finally the Democratic opposition got its act together. Finally the voters caught on to who was really 
responsible for the terrible conditions in their country. It began earlier this year when anti-Communists swept
 municipal elections. Following that, in the November 3rd parliamentary elections, the Socialists were roundly
 defeated, leading to Sunday's runoff election for the Presidency. Romania has finally taken the step which 
everyone else in Eastern Europe took years ago.
<DD>
Bob Krieble and I and our team of political trainers were the first Western democracy specialists into 
Romania, just two months after Ceaucescu was killed. Candles were still burning day and night in the streets 
under mounted icons to commemorate those who were killed in the bloody exchanges culminating in the 
Dictator's death.
<DD>
Religious believers were still meeting secretly in apartments. There were no street lights at night. 
Neighborhoods took on an eerie feeling as people shuffled about in the dark. Streetcars rumbled through the 
city jammed with passengers, but with lights off. Foreigners were looked at with suspicion. I recall one lady 
approaching me in the back of an Orthodox church, speaking to me in German. I replied that I spoke English. 
She then asked me where I was from. I said America. She threw her arms around me and began to cry. 
"God Bless you for coming here," she said, surprising herself at her public display of emotions which 
attracted the attention of other worshipers in the now-jammed church. "You are the first foreigner I ever spoke 
to," she sobbed. "Two months ago, I would have been executed if I had spoken to you this way," she beamed. 
It was a scary place. Our meetings to teach the fractured opposition were infiltrated by the Communists.
<DD>
The opposition parties, then coming out of hiding after decades in the underground, were fixated on the past, 
each blaming the other for Romania's decades of suffering under Communism. Our pleas that they work 
together at first fell on deaf ears. But gradually the efforts to divide and conquer the opposition were 
recognized and overcome.
<DD>
To Bob Krieble's credit, we continued to do training there in the years to come, long after many others had 
given up and pulled out. Sunday that effort finally paid off.
<DD>
Romania followed Bulgaria, which had just elected an anti-Communist parliament a couple of weeks ago 
along with a pro-free market President as well. Now comes the hard part. Romania is so far behind, it will take
an extraordinary effort to catch up.
<DD>
In today's Washington Post, right next to the article about the developments in Romania, is a long article to 
the effect that the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher, 17 years after she first took office, are now finally 
paying off for Britain big time. Things are booming in the old British empire. But that took 17 years of 
uninterrupted rule by the Conservative party -- the same party which the voters seem poised to retire from 
office next year.
<DD>
Romania, in this new highly competitive atmosphere in Europe led by Britain, will find the going rough. 
However, the suffering people there kneeling in the streets praying to the Lord is an auspicious start. The 
situation may look on paper hopelessly complicated, but the Romanians know, with God all things are 
possible.

<h2>Hillary Talks to the Dead?
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>



According to Bob Woodward's new book "The Choice", Hillary Clinton held an imaginary conversation with the late First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who died in l962. <P>

      Talking to Eleanor was the brainchild of Jean Houston, the Co-Director of the Foundation for Mind Research. <P>

      Now, of course, I wasn't present for that conversation between Hillary and Eleanor, but I can well imagine how it went. <P>

       "Oh, Eleanor", said Hillary," You just can't imagine what it is like being married to a man who almost never tells the truth". Replied Eleanor : "Come, come dear. I know exactly what it is like. In fact, that is why my husband is your husband's role model. And I must tell you it works. Take the Depression, for example. We never really did anything to solve it. In fact, things were worse in l938 than they were in l933 but people THOUGHT we had done something, and that's what is really important. You tell Bill to always sound confident. He should keep on saying things like 'the economy is in the best shape it has been in fifty years'. Now never mind that it isn't true. If he just says it often enough, people will believe it. Just think of how well he did by telling the voters in l992 that the economy was in the worst shape since the Depression. People believed him even though it was an outright lie. It's all in how you say it, my dear".<P>

           The conversation continued with Hillary asking for advice on Bosnia: "I'm not sure what we should do. My husband got us into the war over there. We promised to get our troops out before the election, but there is no way we are going to be able to do that. In fact, we may be there for years. What do we do?" Eleanor Roosevelt answered : "Well, that's a tough one. Franklin got us into the war by ignoring all of the warnings and failing to prevent Pearl Harbor. But you see, Hillary dear, we had Hitler and the Japs. You don't have enemies people can identify with. I'm afraid you have a harder task. About the only thing you can do is to start to remove the troops before the election. Send new ones quietly a few at a time and be ready to deploy lots of them the day after the election. But if people think they are coming home on schedule, they will go ahead and vote for Bill."<P>

             "Now let me ask you Eleanor, you don't mind if I call you Eleanor do you?", Hillary continued, "I feel as if I know you. I've read everything I can about you, I admire you so much." Eleanor replied "It's all right dear. We used to be more formal, but I understand the times, so go ahead call me Eleanor". <P>

               "Well", said Hillary, "I don't quite know how to raise this question. But I know you've had experience. You see Bill hasn't been exactly faithful. I mean dealing with the Paula Jones matter in public and all, how ever did you cope?" Eleanor turned somber. "Well I had one advantage over you. The press didn't pry into our personal lives in those days. The boys who covered Franklin all knew about Lucy. But they didn't say anything. All the things that have been published have seen the light years after Franklin died. In fact, decades after I died. So I never had to cope with the public humiliation of it all."<P>

               But Hillary persisted. "I'm sure you knew. How did you put up with it?" Said Eleanor in reply: "My dear. It is worth it being First Lady, especially when you have your own agenda. I did. Franklin didn't much agree with it. But he was in no position to object. In those days if I had left him, he would have been finished. So he let me do my own thing. I see that Bill lets you do what you want as well. That's good. Any time he gets testy about your doing what you want, you just remind him of what you know and how if you confirmed all the rumors, even in this day in age, he'd be packing for Tennessee". <P>

               "Arkansas", Hillary interrupted. "We're from Arkansas." Eleanor apologized. "Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I knew it was one of those states down there. Personally I preferred the North."

               Hillary went on : "I have other problems. There is the cattle futures issue and the billings at the Rose law firm and the allegations that I was the go between for people who wanted favors from Bill when he was Governor. Franklin was Governor before he was President. How did you manage these things?" Eleanor shook her head. "I'm afraid I can't help you. Women didn't hold down those kind of jobs when I was around. I will say this. I did get into trouble from time to time, and I found loss of memory to be an excellent way to handle things. No one can prove you remember anything." <P>

              "I've tried that and so far it has worked. But I'm worried", Hillary confessed. Eleanor broke into a smile. "My dear, so long as you have Bill to lie for you, don't worry. People want to believe their President. And even if his wife is unpopular, and believe me dear I was unpopular, so long as they are comforted by what their President says, they'll keep you right where you are."<P>

                "Even if I am indicted?", Hillary asked. "Well now", said Eleanor, "I don't know about that. I was careful. I never did anything they could get me for later."<P>

                "And what do I do if Bill loses?", Hillary whined. Eleanor looked puzzled. "We never had to cope with that problem. And I don't think you will either. After Bill's term, you run and then the two of you can serve longer than Franklin and me. But don't worry, there is life after the White House. I mean I did commercials for oleo margarine. I'm sure there are plenty of things you can sell. And you can always try writing a book."<P>

                  "I just did", Hillary replied. "I'm surprised you haven't heard about it. It's called 'It Takes a Village.'" <P>

                   "I'm terribly sorry", said Eleanor", But down here we don't hear about many new books. We do see MTV videos a lot, so if you make one of those I'm bound to see it. It is part of our punishment."<P>

                   "I think Bill is about to make one. Do you think he should wear boxers or briefs", Hillary asked. Eleanor pretended not to hear the question. <P>

"A New Scenario for Dole"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
"A New Scenario for Dole"
<P>
Right now things are pretty grim in the Dole camp. As former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested yesterday, things will probably get worse before they get better because Dole is out of money. Moreover, because Bill Clinton was unchallenged in the primaries, he has millions to spend. Dole, on the other hand, remains mired in the muck of Senate procedures where the likes of Ted Kennedy can get the best of him.<P>
There is an alternative scenario kicking around which, if Dole can pull it off, would transform his campaign overnight. You will recall that the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment failed by a single vote in the U.S. Senate last year. It received the two-thirds majority needed in the House with votes to spare. But six Democrats who had previously voted for such an amendment suddenly switched positions and the Amendment went down to defeat. When that happened the whole push for the "Contract With America" went into the tank.<P>
The reason that some of the Democrats claimed they switched was articulated by Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota in two words: Social Security. Because the so called Social Security Trust Fund is considered on budget, the surpluses it presently produces are used to offset other government spending. Dorgan insisted that this does not offer enough protection for Social Security. In fact, Dorgan came off as some sort of hero in North Dakota because voters believed he had helped to save Social Security.<P>
Well, Republicans ought to just accept that argument. Taking Social Security off budget would mean that to achieve a balanced budget another $35 billion per year would have to be cut from domestic spending. Sounds good to me. Maybe we finally could eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, the National Endowment for the Arts, Goals 2000, Americorps, and other such programs which produce more harm than good.<P>
Right now, quietly behind the scenes, Dole and Illinois Democratic Senator Paul Simon, who fervently believes in a balanced budget and who would like to cap his Senate career by seeing such an amendment passed, are trying to see if the votes are there to pass a new version of the Amendment which takes Social Security off budget.<P>
It is hard to believe that Democrats would provide Dole with such an opportunity. However, the two North Dakota Senators, especially, were so high profile in their contention that they really did favor a balanced budget. If the Amendment got Social Security off the books, it may be hard for them to back away from the issue now.<P>
This new version of the Balanced Budget Amendment should be able to easily pass the House. And guess what? A Constitutional Amendment does not go to Bill Clinton for his signature. It goes directly to the states for ratification.<P>
Picture this:  there are now 31 Republican Governors and half of the state legislative houses are controlled by the Republicans. Imagine that Presidential candidate Bob Dole, now lacking money to run a regular campaign, would go from state to state urging the legislatures to ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment. It would highlight the fact that he was able to get such an amendment through the Congress; it would give the Republican Governors and legislatures a chance to showcase positive changes they are making in state government; and Dole addressing state legislatures would probably get live coverage in most of the states where it would take place.<P>
The Dole campaign, which is on the rocks in every way right now, could be transformed overnight into a positive force for an initiative which is supported overwhelmingly by the American people. There is little that Bill Clinton could do about it. Clinton opposed the Constitutional Amendment for a Balanced Budget when it was before the Congress. His liberal allies know that if such an amendment is in place, federal funding for many of their favorite programs becomes dubious at best.<P>
This scenario is probably too good to be true. My guess is that if Dole and Simon do come up with a Balanced Budget Amendment that satisfies the two Senators from North Dakota, a couple of other Democrats who had previously voted for the Amendment will switch to be against it on the grounds that removing Social Security from the budget will require cutting too much from domestic spending.<P>
As Peter Ferrara suggests in a column in today's Washington Times, Dole should then be commended for trying. In the off chance Dole would be able to make it happen, all bets would be off on the Presidential race. The chance to hammer home the fact that Dole favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and Bill Clinton does not, and make that case before state legislatures in very real and graphic terms, live and in person, would turn around the dour prospects for a Dole presidency.<P>

"The Real Solution to Illegal Immigration"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
"The Real Solution to Illegal Immigration"
<P>
The Senate has passed an immigration bill by a 97 to 3 margin. The bill is similar to a measure which has already passed the House. President Clinton is signaling that he will sign the bill. So our worries about immigration are over, right?<P>
Sorry, but I've heard this one before. In 1986, the same Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming who guided this bill through the Senate, assured us that immigration was going to be under control because employers would be required to verify that a prospective employee was in the country legally. The measure didn't work. It did, however, increase the number of illegal documents in circulation.<P> 
This bill does contain some provisions which have merit. The bill doubles the number of officers on boarder patrol. It also provides for enforcement of the measure, which has been on the books since 1882, regarding legal immigrants. A sponsor is supposed to guarantee that the person he brings to this country will not be on the public assistance rolls for five years after coming here. Since the 1960's that provision has never been enforced. A combination of court decisions and lenient administrations have caused the law to be ignored. This bill gives that measure some teeth if an Administration has the courage to use it.
<P>The legislation also contains a provision for a pilot program to create new documents that would be difficult to copy.  However, one of the bill's chief sponsors, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), was unable to answer how such a law would keep the new documents out of the hands of those who misrepresent themselves to authorities.
<P> All of this aside, this bill is utterly meaningless without true welfare reform. Welfare reform has been twice vetoed by this President. The reason some immigrants come here is to work. Fine. If they are taking jobs Americans won't fill, I don't have a problem with that. But many illegal immigrants come here for our welfare benefits. Unless, and until, it is clear that we as a society can deny welfare benefits to anyone who is not here legally, no beefed up boarder patrols or document controls are going to mean very much. 
<P>Pass genuine welfare reform and watch the flow of illegal immigrants dry up to manageable proportions. Don't pass welfare reform and watch this bill fail the way the immigration reform bill of 1986 failed. It is almost that simple. 
<P>

"Mayor Should Heed Friends Advice"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
It is an American tradition that local politics is always more colorful than national politics. So ordinarily the strange wanderings of a Mayor would not be suitable for a commentary with a national focus. But when it comes to the Mayor of the nation's capital, it is another matter. <P>
Marion Barry is a national, indeed, international figure. So when the Mayor suddenly leaves town for a retreat in St. Louis to reconnect with God and his spirituality, it is news. It is news, even more so, because one of Mayor Barry's closest friends, Rock Newman, who headed up the "Rock The Vote" effort for Barry to return to office in 1994, has now called on the Mayor to resign. The Mayor isn't denying that this is a consideration.<P>
Now, Marion Barry is still recovering from prostate cancer. He has had alcohol and drug problems in the past. He served six months in jail for a charge related to the use of cocaine. His subsequent election as alderman and then comeback as Mayor was called the political miracle of the century.<P>
I am not trying to pile on here. But it was Marion Barry's aides who called the news media in the middle of the night to tell them to show up at the Baltimore airport at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday for a Barry press conference.  The press arrived only to have the Mayor tell the reporters that they should leave him and his wife alone. He was headed to St. Louis to a retreat house. On the surface it is very confusing; but since just about everyone else in this town is offering an opinion about what is happening to the Mayor, I shall offer one of my own.<P>
For decades now, Marion Barry's faith has been in government. Even as a young radical agitator he was always trying to get the government to spend more on his people. He upset the city's establishment in getting elected Mayor. When he did so, he greatly expanded the city government. Marion Barry became a hero to many because he was able to put them on the payroll. His liberal friends in the Congress blessed him with every sort of experimental federal program imaginable. They gave Barry control over billions of federal dollars with which to put more people on the payroll. None of these programs was ever monitored very closely.<P>
Washington, DC, was the laboratory of liberalism. If you needed help, the Mayor had a taxpayer-supported program for you. It worked for a time. But as is the case with all solutions which are not based in reality, the fix was not permanent.<P>
Marion Barry knew the heights of power. While in prison he knew the depths of powerlessness. He vowed he would come back and indeed, five years after he was released from jail, he was back at City Hall. But what the Washington, DC, Mayor came back to was not the same place he left. The consequences of his liberal programs had come back to haunt the city. The population was down. Crime was up. The deficit was high. Private sector jobs were low. New federal programs were out. Federal control over Barry's budget was in.<P>
The politics Marion Barry had practiced so well over so many years had ground to a halt. The Mayor, who was used to solving a problem by giving someone a taxpayer supported job no matter what their skills or productivity, was now virtually powerless to act. He was presiding over a city with sharply increasing problems; a city which no longer could be run by the whims of its Mayor. It was run by tough regulators determined to bring spending under control.<P>
Marion Barry's total faith in government had brought him to this dead end. That is the making of a spiritual crisis. At such times, even people who have disregarded most of what the Bible teaches will turn to the Scriptures. I believe that what is causing at least some of the Mayor's problems is the realization that he has placed his faith in the wrong place. Bigger government did not bring salvation.<P>
Facing the ruins of what once was a well-ordered city, Marion Barry cannot come to grips with reality. Even after the Republicans took over the Congress and made it clear the city was going to have to shape up, Barry went on acting as if nothing had happened. Committee Chairmen and even the minority Democrats on Capitol Hill accused the Mayor of engaging in fantasy. He did not want to believe that the way things had been for decades was now at an end.<P>
The Mayor has come face to face with the real world and he doesn't like what he sees. It doesn't conform to the untruths he has sold himself and his followers. The world as it really exists, which Mayor Barry now confronts on a daily basis, is really an unpleasant place. The instant gratification solutions Barry has applied  all these years are no longer available. 
<P>I wish the Mayor well in reconnecting with God. I hope this time it is the true God and not the gods of liberalism who have been enshrined in Washington these many years. Meanwhile the Mayor would be well to heed the advice of  Rock Newman. The nation's capital could use new leadership that has the ability to cope with the new realities.<P>

"the Jury Did Not Believe the President"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>Last Week, President Clinton went into a tirade before the cameras, accusing Bob Dole of raising the character issue.  Over the weekend President Clinton was busy down-playing the active duty military defense his attorneys want to use against the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.  Yesterday President Clinton went before the cameras to remind the voters that he was not on trial in Arkansas.  Bob Dole need not utter a word about it. With each action, President Clintons character is becoming his own third rail.
<P>Before convicting Susan McDougal, her former husband James McDougal and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, the jury in the Whitewater trial heard taped testimony from President Clinton.  It is extraordinary for a sitting president to testify in such a trial.  That testimony was critical to the defense.  The McDougals were former partners of Bill and Hillary Clinton.  At the very least, the presidents testimony ought to have led to the acquittal of Susan McDougal.  Instead the jury returned 24 guilty verdicts against the each of the defendants.  The president testified and yet the jury did not believe him.
<P>Were told jury members even prayed before reaching their decision. With yesterdays conviction, Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker  a Democrat  said he will resign by mid July.  In doing so, he chose not to try and run the state from the "big house" but instead to surrender his post to Lt. Governor Mike Huckabee  a Republican.  That conviction and subsequent resignation alone breaths new life into an issue which has dogged this Administration since the beginning.  After all, the president testified, and the jury did not believe him.
<P>Now the voters will see Whitewater as a warning to check the White House silverware.  Now the Congress will see Whitewater as a green light to pursue its own investigations with little risk of finger pointing over partisanship.  Now reporters will see Whitewater as an opportunity to compete for the Pulitzer prize.  But more than anything else, yesterdays Whitewater convictions give instant credibility to the efforts of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Why? Because the president testified and the jury did not believe him.
<P>Now Starr will be free turn his attention to the one most vulnerable figure in this case  first lady Hillary Clinton. Already a compelling question is being asked in the minds of those familiar with this case.  It is a question establishment players may find too indelicate to ask. So Ill ask it.  Did Hillary Clinton perjure herself?  Now, mind you, that is not a question for Bob Dole to ask.  Whitewater is not an issue to mingle with a presidential race designed to run on issues.  If Whitewater does prove the undoing of President Clinton, it will happen because of Bob Doles obvious silence than were he and his campaign to attempt to force the issue. Now Dole can boldly proclaim real issues without ever mentioning Whitewater. All because the president testified and the jury did not believe him.

<h2>Faith and Global Stability</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations are happy over the result of the Russian elections this past week.  Incumbent Boris Yeltsin won.  The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations were not happy over the result of the Israeli elections last month.  The incumbent lost.<P>
This mentality speaks volumes for the modern world view of global stability.  The world leaders now put the concept of global stability above risk, higher than right and wrong, and ahead of principle.  This means that human rights, individual freedoms and even democracy now take a back seat to the new global imperative of maintaining stability, status quo, and "peace."<P>
No policy is without an overriding philosophy and global stability is no exception. Its philosophy is relativism, a mentality which holds that truth and even morality can only be defined within the context of todays events.<P>
Today, those who question the philosophy of relativism are scorned by the popular culture, in the press, on TV and in Hollywood.<P>
Ask U.S. Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.  Speaking at separate events, Scalia and Thomas recently told of the importance of faith in God.  Thomas was criticized for his religious views.  Academia laughed at Scalia for believing in angels.  The culture wants to stop jurists like Scalia, Thomas and William Rhenquist for applying Constitutional absolutes to legal cases for a society which has begun to question eternal truth and moral absolutes.<P>
I for one agree with Scalia. Let them laugh.  Angels are real.  We cant see God and we cant see the wind.  Yet God and the wind exist whether the cultural engineers like it or not.  In fact, its not what they think that matters but what God thinks that really matters.  Thats the faith perspective. Thats exactly whats missing from the new world view of the White House, the State Department and the United Nations.<P>
The faith perspective understands right from wrong.  The faith perspective realizes there is something much greater at stake than the futile pursuit of peace through stability.  A faith perspective requires leaders to take a moral stand, armed with absolutes which modern events simply cannot change.<P>
Murder and stealing are forbidden by our laws. Why?  Because life and charity are good things according to the precepts of God who does not change.<P>
Our society began with a belief in God and with faith.  Look at the words on our coins.  It doesnt say in the world we trust, in the UN we trust, or even in government we trust.  Our nation began with a cultural trust in God and a societal faith in Gods precepts.<P>
The faith of a nation is a powerful quality.  It has made the twentieth century the century of America, a nation founded on belief in God.<P>
Our nation will never end with a belief in God, but it can end without a belief in God, and we must never let that happen.  Its time to end the global stability and moral relativity lock on our future.  America doesnt need a UN to tell us where weve been or a faithless government to tell us where we can go.  What America needs today is a few good citizens, of faith and courage, to safely guide us into the next great century.<P>

<h2>Cigarettes and Aliens in Washington
</h2>
<P>

There's a new movie out this week, appropriately named "Independence Day."  In Washington, this movie is so hot, they are running a 4 a.m. showing at the Uptown Theater and even that is sold out.  "Independence Day" is about aliens who take over and eventually destroy the White House.  The world is next on their agenda.<P>
The trouble is, the movie is about three years too late.  The aliens have occupied the White House since George Bush left in 1993.  No plot from Hollywood could possibly come close to what we already have with these diabolical aliens.  There's the First Lady who doesn't remember making a call from Arkansas the night lawyer Vince Foster mysteriously died.  There's the Vice President who advocates a new world order run by environmentalists.  There's the president who tells one group he's pro-life and then supports the practice of partial birth abortions.  This is the White House that ordered FBI summary files on its political enemies.  These are the aliens who brought us Whitewater, travel-gate and "I feel your pain."<P>
Let's just say I'm glad I'm not running the President's reelection campaign.  His party has their hands full trying to contain a candidate who has begun to hemorrhage in the polls.<P>
Perhaps the Democratic party has found a way out.  They recently discovered what they are sure will be a scandal against Republican opponent Bob Dole.  The scandal they have begun to stoke is cigarettes.  It seems Bob Dole used to smoke cigarettes. Unlike the President, Mr. Dole admits that he actually inhaled.  The Democrats are so certain they have a marketable scandal against Dole, they've even hired an actor to follow the Dole campaign.  Each morning the actor dresses himself as a seven-foot cigarette.  The actor who portrays this giant cigarette calls himself "Butt Man."  The idea is that Mr. Dole is somehow villainous because his campaign has received money from cigarette conglomerates.  What's worse, Mr. Dole won't even say he's sorry.<P>
The Democratic National Committee says it is proud of "Butt Man."  What else can they talk about?  After all, Dole is about as scandalous as Socks the Cat-and we're told Socks even counts mice among his friends.<P>
"Butt Man" probably won't be coming to a town near you.  Certainly "Independence Day" will soon be playing at theater near you.  If you go to see it, remember to follow these simple rules of theater etiquette.  First, don't talk when the movie begins, that irritates other viewers. Second, don't laugh when you see the White House blow up, it really isn't funny. And finally, whatever you do, don't smoke. The real aliens just might attack you, in the press.<P>

<h2>Politicizing a Murder</h2>
<p>
Direct Line Commentary<br>
by <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>President Clinton is pretending
to be tough on crime and has taken to exploiting the murder of
12-year old Polly Klaas in order to get re-elected.  <dd>In a television
ad, narrated by Polly Klaas's father, Mark Klaas, he praises President
Clinton for forcing Congress to pass his tough crime bill.  He
goes on to say that the recent attacks on Clinton's character
are just politics and claims the President's character is evident
in his courage to protect children.  <dd>All politicians exploit tragedy
to get elected - Republicans used paroled murderer Willie Horton
as their example of how Michael Dukakis was soft on crime.  Now,
Democrats are doing it to show how Bill Clinton is tough on crime.
<dd>It is an election year, and we should expect nothing less from
any politician - if Mark Klaas were a Republican, I'm sure we'd
see him in a Bob Dole ad.  But the Clinton campaign has gone too
far in using Mark and Polly Klaas to counter Bob Dole's attack
on Clinton's character.  The truth is, Bob Dole has done nothing
that even resembles an attack - he has barely scratched the surface.
<dd>There is so much material fact on Clinton's lack of honor and
morality that this campaign has missed, that the Clinton campaign
would be better off not responding at all.  To top it off, Bill
Clinton is far enough ahead in the polls that there was no need
to even mention the word character. I have to admit that I have
a personal sadness when I see a grieving father embrace an administration
that has done nothing to prevent crime.  In fact, it has encouraged
crime by putting drug prevention on the back burner, putting lenient
judges - anti-death penalty judges - on the bench for life, and
by trying to outlaw ownership of guns by law abiding citizens.
<dd>But Mark Klass is an adult and he is free to endorse whichever
candidate he chooses.  I just don't have the faith that he is
getting all the facts.

<h2>Speaker Should Step Down Temporarily</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Oklahoma's just re-elected Congressman Steve Largent has suggested that Newt Gingrich step down as Speaker of the House temporarily until ethics charges against him are cleared up. Gingrich has rejected the idea. 
<dd>Let me say at the outset that I believe that Gingrich will be exonerated from these charges. I have said so from the beginning. I continue to believe that.
<dd>But let me tell you why I think Largent is right when he argues that Gingrich should step aside for the time being.
<dd>One of the most important issues facing this Congress is how to handle the many scandals of the Clinton Administration. If Republicans go after Clinton in what is perceived to be too partisan a manner, they will end up getting into trouble with the voters. On the other hand, the charges against Clinton, unlike those against Gingrich, are serious. Many, especially the recent questions about campaign contributions by foreigners in exchange for subtle changes in US policy, are extremely troubling and could add up to real trouble for the President and his Administration.
<dd>Gingrich has a problem. From the time he took office and defended a multi million dollar book deal to the collapse of his no exit strategy on getting President Clinton to agree to Republican proposals on the federal budget, Gingrich has not fared well image wise with the American public. Add to this the hundreds of millions spent by the unions and others to attack Gingrich, and what we have is a weakened Speaker of the House. Granted, the Democrats do not control the Congress. But the margin is very close. A tarnished Gingrich will have problems upholding the Republicans as ethically sound while he weighs in against the many problems of the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>By stepping aside temporarily as Largent suggests, Gingrich would pave the way for himself to return stronger than ever. In effect, he would wipe the slate clean of his previous problems with the American public.
<dd>I know that would be a tough decision for the Speaker to make. His position is that since he believes he is innocent, there is no reason for him to do this. 
<dd>But think about it for a moment. Gingrich steps aside with an agreement that the investigations against him will be completed by a time certain. He says he is so certain of the outcome that he is willing to take this action so that the American public will have confidence in him and the Republicans when he is vindicated. 
<dd>This action contrasts with Bill Clinton. All we have heard since the election out of the Clinton Administration are rumors about trying to remove Janet Reno as Attorney General. Trying to find  a way to get at Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Clinton himself says he wants to go after his political enemies who have made Whitewater and other matters an issue.
<dd>Bill Clinton isn't going to be willing to step aside until he is vindicated of charges against him because, as he well knows, he is not likely to be vindicated. 
<dd>This Administration has been brilliant, however, at deflecting its own problems. Their rule is to attack the attacker. So if Gingrich makes any statements, as he did toward the end of the campaign, about the many serious charges pending against Clinton and his associates, spokesmen for the President will simply say that Gingrich has no right to make such charges when his own house isn't in order. 
<dd>While Harold Volkmer is gone, David Bonior is very much alive. The Gingrich inspired campaign to defeat him failed miserably. Bonior is going to be back full tilt in the 105th Congress. 
<dd>I believe that Steve Largent has suggested a course which is actually best for Speaker Gingrich and the country as a whole. It will enable Gingrich to seize the moral high ground. Assuming I am correct that Gingrich will be vindicated, he would take a short step backward to take a much larger step forward. If cleared of these ethics charges, he would return to the Speakership then with the ability to take on the Clinton Administration without their capacity to point to Gingrich as a way of shielding themselves.
<dd>But, you say, Congressman Bonior and his ilk would just file more charges as soon as the Speaker returns. That is , of course, possible, although Gingrich in the second half of the 104th Congress hasn't gone to the bathroom without checking with the ethics committee first. Yes, Bonior might file more charges but if the Speaker was willing to step aside and was subsequently vindicated, he would show those charges for what they are: pure politics and a payback for his having gone after Democratic Speaker of the House Jim Wright. 
<dd>I am sure that that the initiative Largent took has made Gingrich either hurt or angry. The Speaker should rise above his feelings. Largent has actually suggested a way for Gingrich to restore his moral credibility with the nation.

<h2>
Strategic Control in the Hands of Liberal Senators
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>There has been a great deal of talk about how Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is leading the most conservative group of Republican Senators in at least 50 and maybe even 70 years.
<dd>True enough. And it is also true that there is only a small group of liberal Republicans left: Chafee (Rhode Island), Jeffords (Vermont), Specter (Pennsylvania), Collins and Snowe (Maine), with Warner (Virginia) and Gorton (Washington) and sometimes D'Amato (New York) falling into the moderate category.
<dd>By my count that leaves 47 votes ranging from moderate conservative to rock solid conservative in the GOP Caucus. I call that a pretty good majority, 47 - 8.
<dd>So the policies coming out of the Senate should be pretty good, right? In fact, most commentators have suggested that it will be the Senate which takes conservative initiatives now, not the House as it was in the 104th Congress.
<dd>Well, think again. Thanks to the new Senate GOP Conference Chairman Connie Mack having chosen Senator Slade Gorton (Washington) to chair the Committee on Committees, and thanks to only a two-vote margin of Republicans vs. Democrats on each committee, it is now the case that the moderate and liberal Republicans are controlling the show. They are strategically placed on each major committee so that all one of them has to do is to vote with the solid lineup of liberal Democrats and they can block anything positive from getting out of committee. In the case of the finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth (Delaware) is stuck with two such votes so this Committee Chairman, who is as solid as a rock on taxation issues, can't control his own committee.
<dd>That puts these eight Senators in control of the agenda. Either the Committee Chairman compromises with them or they vote with the Democrats and nothing happens. Of course a couple of them, Jeffords and Chafee, remain Committee Chairman themselves, thanks to a lack of fortitude on the part of any of the Conservative Senators to challenge them under the new rules of the GOP caucus. So in those cases, they can control what is even discussed in Committee. 
<dd>How a rip roaring majority of 47 can be outdone by eight is really an incredible development. Apparently Senator Mack (Florida), who had just been elected Conference Chairman, was just too naive to figure out what was happening. A good question is this: Since he is supposed to be such a solid conservative, how is it that, out of the whole group of 47, he managed to ask one of the group of eight to be in charge of the Committee selection process?
<dd>Unless the Senate leadership wants to now take the highly unusual step of initiating legislation from the floor instead of in committee, don't look for any positive, constructive pro-growth, pro-family measures coming out of the Senate. You don't have to worry about the Democrats filibustering such proposals. Heck, they'll all be killed in committee.

</h3> <h2>The Passing of True Patriot</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD>I was tempted to devote
this commentary to the triumph of the Green Bay Packers Sunday.  Unless you are from
Wisconsin, you can't possibly imagine what that team means to Green Bay and even the rest of
the state.  With the possible exception of Chicago Cubs fans, I don't know of any group of
fans who are more loyal to their team.  They have had to wait 30 years for this moment and
yet they stuck by the Packers year after year even in losing seasons.  Out of deference to
Genevieve Wood, however, and because I have a much more serious topic to cover, I shall not
say anything further about Green Bay until after New Orleans.<p>

On a more somber note, today at the Heritage Foundation, some of us who have been active in
what is loosely called the conservative movement said good bye to one of our best friends. 
It was hard to do because for most of us it is hard to believe he is gone. Among those who
paid tribute to this author, broadcaster and historian were Heritage President Ed Feulner,
Publisher Jamison Campaigne, my daughter Dawn Ceol, Father Vince Rigdon of the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, and yours truly.<p>

I first met Jeffrey St. John more than 25 years ago.  He was a syndicated columnist
operating out of New York.  I was a Senate aide.  We just hit it off and in the subsequent
years we developed an abiding friendship which is hard to put into words.<p>

Back before the op-ed pages were filled with conservative columnists of one sort or another,
Jeffrey St. John was there.  And he was fearless.  He later became business correspondent
for the "Today" show, and also reported for the CBS Morning News.  In addition he worked for
ABC radio news, and a host of local stations.  Indeed, when Senator Jesse Helms was elected
to the US Senate in 1972, it was Jeffrey St. John who took his place doing editorials.<p>

I always felt somewhat guilty because I passed on to St. John a report from an eye witness,
who happened to be a United States Senator, about disgusting behavior by the President of
the United States at a State dinner at the White House.  Fearless St. John asked President
Ford a question about this during a broadcast interview and President Ford was so outraged
he saw to it that St. John lost his network reporting job.  I felt terrible. St. John felt
it was a badge of honor.<p>

It is hard for those who have come into the general orbit of right-of-center politics since
Ronald Reagan won the Presidency in 1980 to imagine the plight of those of us who believed
in limited government, free enterprise, a strong national defense and traditional moral
values in the 1960's and 1970's.  After the defeat of Barry Goldwater, even sensible people
wouldn't use the "C" word. Retreat was evident nearly everywhere. Not with Jeffrey St. John.
He was always pushing the envelope.<p>

But the real Jeffrey St. John was a man of history.  He was, for example, among the nation's
foremost experts on John Randolph of Roanoke, one of the most interesting pioneer figures in
our Republic. St. John was at his best when he was relating history to contemporary
politics.  His three-book series on the deliberations of the founding fathers, done in the
style of a modern day reporter covering the Constitutional Convention, was so attractive to
Chief Justice Warren Burger that Burger not only wrote the introduction, but sent the books
to every high school library in the nation at the time of the Bicentennial.<p>

The difference between Jeffrey St. John and me is that he loved the battle.  I view it as
duty. Consequently he was always having to give me perspective when I would get down about
political happenings.<p>

An orphan, Jeffrey St. John was adopted at a young age and raised by a family in Canada. 
But he left home at age 14 and never saw his adoptive parents again.  He joined the military
and covered the Korean war for Stars and Stripes.  After the war, he became a reporter and
was a pioneer in the field of interactive talk radio, the format which is so celebrated
today. St. John was, as usual, decades ahead of his time.<p>

He married later in life and he and his wife Katherine had no children.  It is a pity
because he would have made a great father.  He and his wife became close friends of all of
the Weyrichs, as they frequently stayed with us when he came to Washington.<p>

It is important that we remember those brave souls who made it possible for us to stand
where we are today.  Jeffrey St. John was one such patriot.  His golden voice now stilled,
his pen now put to rest, the nation is the poorer for it all.  Thank God, before he died, he
returned to the Church of his youth.  He will be missed by all who love liberty and admire
courage.  May God have mercy upon his soul.  Jeffrey St. John, dead at age 66. <P>

<h2>Dole's Record Solid on Judges</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>I keep having people come to me asking the same question: "Give me one reason I should vote for Bob Dole for President," they ask. Okay, I'll give you a reason: The federal judiciary.
<DD>To date President Clinton has appointed 202 federal judges and 26% of the federal judiciary overall. His future appointments will even more dramatically shift the balance of the federal bench because the percentage of his activist appointees replacing more restrained Bush/Reagan appointees has steadily risen from 14% in 1993 to about 25% in 1995. That number will continue to rise because instead of activist Clinton judges replacing activist Carter judges, they will be replacing more restrained judges appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush. Whatever you may think of George Bush, by the way, his federal judge appointments were overall slightly better than those of Ronald Reagan.
<DD>13 judges have already announced that they will take "senior status."  132 district court and 42 appeals court judges will be eligible to take senior status by the end of a second Clinton term. So Bill Clinton's appointees could comprise almost 60% of the federal judiciary and a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court if he has a second term in office.
<DD>Let me give you a few examples of the judges Bill Clinton has already managed to get on the court. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, regarded as "moderates" by Clinton standards, voted against single sex education, voted to block a ban on quotas for homosexuals, voted to require discrimination against religious expression, voted to allow race preferences in government, voted to allow the creation of racially segregated congressional districts, voted to block the voters wishes to have federal term limits and have voted to empower the federal government to regulate virtually every aspect of the economic life of the country.
<DD>This is just a sample of the sort of people Clinton has put on the court. Judges Blaine Michael and Diana Motz voted against excluding homosexuals from the military. Judge Carlos Lucero voted to declare a city seal with a cross unconstitutional, Judge Theodore McKee voted to abolish student-led graduation prayers. Judge H. Lee Sarokin argued that prison inmates have a constitutional right to receive mail uninspected by prison officials. Judge Martha Daughtrey voted to throw out drug and child pornography evidence. Judge James Beaty voted to overturn a double murder conviction because a juror had driven past the house where the murder took place. And so it goes. I could go on and on but you get the picture.
<DD>The same goes for those Clinton appointees left hanging when the 104th Congress adjourned. Clarence Sundram supports the legalization of drugs. Margaret Morrow supports gun control and has an extensive record of feminist activism. Margaret McKeown helped to turn the American Bar Association toward its current pro-abortion position and was the lead counsel in homosexual rights litigation. William Fletcher believes there is a "discretionary Constitution" judges may use to legislate from the bench. And believe me it would only get worse in a second Clinton term.
<DD>But, you may protest, Bob Dole voted for most of those Clinton judges. True enough because Dole supports the right of a President to pick judges as he wishes. He expects the same treatment from the Senate if he gets the chance to pick judges. Nevertheless, an August 1996 report by the Judicial Selection Monitoring project of the Free Congress Foundation gave Dole a 100% score. The tally included votes on 20 closely-divided, controversial judicial and Justice Department nominations. Each of the nominations chosen for the report presented a genuine choice between judicial activism and restraint. On each vote, Bob Dole chose restraint.
<DD>Now does that guarantee that all of Bob Dole's judges will be judges we would approve of? No it does not. President Bush made a concerted effort to pick good judges and wound up with David Souter on the Supreme Court. But that is because he took the word of his then Chief of Staff John Sununu who insisted that Souter was a judicial conservative. The former right wing Governor of New Hampshire Meldrim Thompson agreed with Sununu and said he would stake his career on Souter being conservative. Both were wrong. 
<DD>I know from personal experience Bob Dole has always worked hard to confirm judges which the left fought hard against. Ask Dan Manion, approved by a single vote margin in the Senate for an appeals court seat. Ask Clarence Thomas, approved by only a four vote margin. Each prevailed despite overwhelming opposition from the Left, and thanks in no small part to Bob Dole.  Moreover Dole has proposed doing away with the role of the American Bar Association in the judicial selection process. The ABA is controlled by the liberals and has often shot down some of the better judicial nominees which Reagan and Bush sought to put forth.
<DD>Bob Dole has said that "the power of the courts to override the sovereign will of the people comes with a heavy responsibility, and must be used with the utmost restraint - without that restraint, judicial review becomes nothing less than judicial tyranny."
<DD>Over the next four years the president will likely decide several Supreme Court Justices and perhaps a third of all federal judges. I don't know about you, but I would rather trust someone who has Dole's philosophy than I would the current occupant of the White House to decide those appointments. Let's put it this way. We know what sort of federal judges Bill Clinton will give us. There is a fair chance that Bob Dole's picks will be a lot closer to what the founding fathers had in mind.

<h2>
"Supporting Tyranny over Freedom"
</h2>
(Delivered by Brad Keena)
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
A 58-year-old, highly educated, and soft spoken freedom fighter is, as we speak, 
conducting a hunger strike in a Belarus jail. He is the victim of a Stalinist style 
crackdown which is taking place in the former Soviet Republic. 
<p>Yuri Khadykas crime is that he dared to speak out against the repressive and dictatorial 
regime of hard line Communist Alexandr Lukashenko. Lukashenko is trying to 
reintegrate his country with Russia without a vote of the people giving him authority to 
do so. Lukashenko admires Adolph Hitler and yearns for the return of a true Russian 
leader like Josef Stalin so that at least real order can be restored. 
<p>Among all of the former Soviet Republics, Belarus has made the least progress in moving 
toward democracy and free enterprise. Even in places such as Georgia, Armenia, and the 
Central Asian Republics things are better off than in Belarus. Lukashenko has suspended 
the parliament, even though his fellow Communists have a lopsided majority there. He 
does not want to give a forum to the few Democratic voices who serve in that body and 
that is where Yuri Khadyka comes in. 
<p>Freedom fighters are given no access to the media. Their voices in elected government 
have been silenced. The only alternative for them now is to take to the streets. But for 
doing so, Khadyka and a couple hundred organizers of a 30,000 person demonstration in 
downtown Minsk were arrested on April 26th. 
<p>Khadyka has not been allowed to talk to his lawyer. He may languish in jail for up to six 
months before there is any trial, if there is one. And in Lukashenkos Belarus, the 
outcome of the trial will be a forgone conclusion, just as the trials of dissidents were 
foreordained in the former Soviet Union. 
<p>What is happening in Belarus is symbolic of what is happening in other places in the 
East. It is the prototype for what will take place if Communist candidate Gannady 
Zuganov is elected President in the upcoming elections. He has promised a similar 
crackdown on those regarded as opponents of the Communist ideology.
<p>To us, Khadyka is not just some remote figure we hear about in short- wave radio 
coverage of foreign developments. He is someone we know well. Bob Krieble and I have 
had lengthy discussions with him on several occasions. His son, 29-year-old Alexey, has 
worked for us at the Krieble Institute of the Free Congress Foundation for the past four 
years. He is one of the young, dedicated freedom fighters who have risked their lives to 
help promote freedom and democracy in the former Soviet empire. 
<p>Last Saturday night I was awakened in the middle of the night with news of the ominous 
developments in Belarus. Alexey pleaded for our help to get word of the plight of the 
Belarus freedom fighters to American officials. Well, our discussions with the State 
Department were exactly what you would expect. This Administration, while willing to 
involve itself in imposing a leftist government in Haiti, is unwilling to lift a finger to 
protest repression in Belarus. 
<p>The realities of the repression there do not square with this nations policy of the 
reconstruction of the former Soviet Union. Yes, the State Department wants to see the 
former Soviet Union re-established in some new form. Our officials think that will bring 
stability to the region. Yes, it will bring stability the stability of the graveyard. 
<p>While most of the other organizers who have been arrested in Belarus have now been 
released from jail, Khadyka remains there. He is a special problem case because he is also 
a Christian leader who has sought the return of the ancient Bylorussian language as well. 
Someone with his views is not convenient for the Lukashenko regime. 
<p>We have managed to interest some Members of Congress in what is happening in 
Belarus. Robert Novak devoted todays syndicated column to this subject. Perhaps little 
by little we will bring world attention to the plight of freedom loving people in this small 
former Soviet Republic of l2 million people. 
<p>The issue here isnt that Yuri Khadyka is a truly fine man, which he is. The issue here 
that the United States government is cooperating with pro-Communist forces in the 
reconstruction of the Evil Empire. That is not why our men and women died on the 
battlefield opposing tyranny in this long and bloody twentieth Century. This is not why 
countless more unsung heroes died during the Cold War.
<p>The time to speak up against this evil is now before it is too late. Failure to do so may 
well mean that the next Century will bring confrontation with a new evil empire all over 
again. Only this time, the outcome might not be the same.


<P>

<h2>Sacrificing Conscience to Republican Totalitarianism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p><p>

In two nations which were part of the NATO alliance, conservative political parties which were at one time dominant forces in those countries, have all but disappeared. In Canada, the Progressive Conservatives went from a solid outright majority in the Parliament to just two seats following the last Canadian election. In Italy, the Christian Democrats, long the party of the Roman Catholic Church, and nearly always the central partner in Italy's many post-war governments, has nearly vanished following recent elections there.
<p.
In the United States, the Republican party may be next. This week the party took another giant step in that direction. House Speaker Newt Gingrich inflicted ex post facto discipline on Reps. Bob Dornan (R-CA) and Chris Smith (R-NJ) for supporting former Congressman Joe DioGuardi in his primary race against the militantly pro-abortionist Rep. Sue Kelly (R-NJ). Dornan and Smith were forbidden to serve on key conference committees which are bringing forth crucial bills to be passed before this Congress becomes history. Moreover, both Congressmen have been denied travel funds even though both are chairmen of international subcommittees where travel is required as part of the responsibilities of the committee.
For Rep. Smith especially, opposing Kelly was an exercise of his conscience. Rep. Kelly is one of five Republicans to vote with Bill Clinton on the partial birth abortion issue. Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York has called the brutal murder of the baby in the partial birth abortion procedure infanticide. Mr. DioGuardi is in the race because of that issue.
<p>
Rep. Smith has introduced a freedom of conscience resolution in the House Republican Conference. It declares that any Member of Congress shall have the right to back any candidate for office according to his own conscience. Moreover, if sanctions were to be imposed on a Member for doing so, the resolution would require a vote on the issue by the entire House GOP Conference.
<p>
Smith needs 50 signatures on his resolution to have it considered. He is having trouble getting the signatures because Speaker Gingrich has so intimidated Members with his disciplinary measures that many who are sympathetic to Smith are now afraid to sign up.
<p>
The fact is there was no rule in the GOP Conference against a Member supporting a primary opponent of a sitting congressman. In a display of Soviet style justice, the sanctions were imposed after the fact.
If we have come to the point where, because he serves as a Republican Member of the House, a Member of Congress can no longer follow his conscience (and anyone who knows Smith knows that he is genuinely a man of conscience), then we have changed our form of government overnight without the consent of the governed. If these sanctions are allowed to stand, the Republican party, in due course, will surely follow the way of the Canadian Conservatives and the Italian Christian Democrats.
<p>
If to be a Republican means one has to give up his freedom of conscience, then the price, as Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI) has suggested, is much too high.

people jammed into Belgrade's main square New Year's day to continue their protest against
Yugoslavian Communist President Slobodan Milosevic's having voided opposition  victories in
23 municipal elections. <dd>

These demonstrations have been continuing on a daily basis for weeks now, and they have
begun to threaten the last Communist regime on the European continent. <dd>

The demonstrators are unarmed.  Milosevic's troops are armed to the teeth, yet betting is
with the street demonstrators.  Why?<dd>

The real weapon which the people have today in Yugoslavia which wasn't available to people
in past decades who lived under Communist regimes is underground media.  A low power FM
station in Belgrade, which can't even be heard in some parts of the city, has now formed an
alliance with other small stations throughout the country and is broadcasting the truth to
the people.  Meanwhile, the state controlled radio and television, which dominate the
country, hardly mention that anything is happening.  Thanks to the Internet, which kept the
voice of the radio station alive for a short period when the government shut it down,
information is now available to citizens which would have been unthinkable a decade ago.
<dd>

A Communist regime can exist only if the people are ignorant and isolated.  That is how the
Soviets kept power for seven decades.  I am no fan of Mikhail Gorbachev.  His own people
demonstrated what they thought of him by giving him a half of one per cent of the vote in
last year's Russian Presidential primaries.  But Gorbachev did one positive thing which
ultimately led to his downfall.  At the urging of President Ronald Reagan and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Gorbachev stopped the jamming of the BBC worldservice, the Voice
of America and eventually Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe a decade ago.  No doubt
Gorbachev did not understand the dynamic of the information age.<dd>

Yet once the people of the Soviet empire had access to alternative information, the
Communist regime there was doomed.  The Communists had the tanks and trained armies and a
huge spy network, but it could not compete with the truth.  I well recall an official
government hosted dinner I attended in Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal, in the same lodge where a
couple of months earlier Secretary of State James Baker and then Soviet Foreign Minister
Edward Shevrednaze had met.  Irkutsk is in the middle of Siberia.  Yet officials there were
more up on American politics than most Americans and more sympathetic to America than at
least a third of its own people.  This was in 1990, a full year before the flag of the
Soviet Union was lowered over the Kremlin.  The reason?  These Siberians had built
themselves tiny little crystal set type radios and pulled in information from Voice of
America which for the previous decades they could not hear.  I knew after I attended that
dinner that the Soviet empire as we knew it was doomed.<dd>

Broadcast information had created a bigger fifth column inside the Soviet Union than the KGB
could handle.<dd>

The same thing is happening in Yugoslavia a decade later.  Even some in the Milosevic
controlled army have told their commanders that they will not shoot at the opposition
demonstrators.  There may yet be much bloodshed, because dictators don't give up easily. 
But in the end the Communists will fall.<dd>

Remember Tienamen Square? Recall that for the first several days of street demonstrations
there the local soldiers were sympathetic to the students.  The reason the confrontations
dragged on for so long is that the Communist Chinese had  to call in troops from the far
provinces to suppress the democracy movement. The local troops would not shoot.  Troops from
the backwater places in China, where information is not readily available, were told that
China had been invaded by a foreign power. It took that kind of lie to crush democracy. But
as the Internet advances and more information is now available from Taiwan and elsewhere,
that sort of lie won't cut it  forever.<dd>

That is why I am betting on what has been called "the information Guerrillas" in Yugoslavia.
 The truth, ultimately, is more powerful than armies.  It is too early to tell at the
moment, but 1997 could be the last year for the Milosevic regime.  His ability to keep his
people loyal has been dependent on keeping the truth out.  But the truth is spreading.  As
with the mighty Soviet Union, the truth may prove too powerful for the remaining Communist
regimes to survive. <P>

<h2>A Gap Bigger Than Gender</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
Kellyanne Fitzpatrick of the Polling Company provided us with data on a survey taken from September 5th through the 12th on who will control the Congress. Her conclusion is that whatever happens in the Presidential race, Congress is going to remain in Republican hands. That conclusion is verified by several other recent polls which show the Republicans even or with a slight edge. The Polling Company finds Democrats with a one point edge, but traditionally Republicans perform better than the so-called generic ballot-test for Congress.<P>
We hear a great deal about the gender gap and indeed Kellyanne does find such a gap. But her research finds the gender gap at 8 points and not the 20 plus points which the so called mainstream media keeps touting. Kellyanne is the one, genuinely culturally-conservative pollster in the business and I trust her results. Meanwhile, Republicans hold a three-point advantage with Generation X voters (from 18 to 29 years of age) and a two-point advantage with Baby Boomers. But Republicans are down two points with so called pre-retirees (thats my age group) and down five points among seniors. Thats not surprising considering the amount of propaganda put forth by the unions and liberals on Medicare and Social Security.<P>
Now come the kickers. Here are the real gaps in American politics. Singles favor the Democrats for Congress by six percentage points. Those who are married but without children favor the Democrats by eight percentage points. But those married with children favor the Republicans by a whopping 10 percentage points!<P>
I mentioned this to Kellyanne at a dinner last night and she said, "Yes, Its the three Ms." Three Ms? What are the three Ms? "Marriage, Mortgage and Munchkins," she replied. If you want your children to vote for conservatives for Congress, not only do they need to be married, they also need to have children, Miss Fitzpatrick said. So the gap between those who are married and have children and those who are married without children is greater than the gap between men and women. Apparently, there is nothing like a few responsibilities to make voters understand who favors policies in their best interests.<P>
But lets talk about the truly gigantic gap in American politics. Yes, there is a gap bigger than either gender or marriage. Among those who dont listen to talk radio at all, the Democrats hold a nine-point advantage in the race for Congress. Among those who listen to talk radio five hours or more a week, the Republicans hold an incredible 16-point margin. Among those who listen to talk radio only one to four hours a week, the margin for the Republicans is just three points.<P>
So now things are clearing up nicely. If we care what kind of Congress we have, we must see to it that the young people we know get married and have children quickly. We must introduce talk radio to these young families immediately. I dont have the figures for those who are married, have children and listen to talk radio, but the gap must be gargantuan.<P>
Mrs. Weyrich and I are about to become grandparents for the first time. My wife has all sorts of plans to get a cradle for the baby and car seats for each of the cars, and heaven knows what else. Well all of that is fine. But as for me, Im buying this new little family several radios, each tuned to the best talk shows in the business. Hey, I care about my future!<P>

An Old Dog Learns New Tricks
</h2>
<P>
<P>An Old Dog Learns New Tricks
<P>Ever since Bob Dole became Senate Majority Leader in 1985 I have had a running argument with him. I often told Dole to bring measures to the floor of the Senate for a vote, regardless of whether or not you have enough Senators willing to pass the bills. By losing, you win. Those votes would reveal the liberals for what they are and help elect more conservatives to the Senate.<P>
Dole disagreed. He didnt want to vote on anything unless he thought he had the votes to pass it. That is why he and his chief of staff Sheila Burke always sought the lowest common denominator legislation. The less controversial, the better the chance to rack up a big win. Of course, the less controversial, the less chance of accomplishing anything with the legislation. Historic opportunities were lost in many fields because the legislation Dole usually got passed was so bipartisan that it demonstrated no differences between the parties. I argued that without this contrast, voters would have no incentive to add to Doles ranks. He never seemed to get it, that is, until now.<P>
There is a great irony in the way Bob Dole will finish out his last week as the Senate Republican Leader. He will bring up measures, including the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which have no chance of passage. In doing so, Dole will be trying to get across to the American voters some of the main differences between the parties. Dole has dared President Clinton to help get the last two votes needed to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment through the Senate. However, the President opposes the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. <P>
Who says you cant teach an old dog new tricks? Dole now seems to understand, albeit during the last moments of his Senate Leadership, that you can win by losing. I honestly believe, had this been done more of the time, with thorough preparation and lots of prolonged debate, the public would finally see who was on which side of the different debates and would act accordingly at the next election. The fact that meaningless bipartisan, vanilla legislation would pass the Senate by big margins only served to confuse the electorate. All sides could take credit for almost nothing. No wonder so many incumbents were re-elected. <P>
Now at the eleventh hour Dole is going to lose in the Senate in a very high profile way. But in losing he may gain points with the American voter.<P>
Although Dole has seemed to learn something new at this last moment, in some things he is sticking to the past. Chief of Staff Sheila Burke, it seems, may end up in the Dole campaign after all. <P>
Some, such as American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene, say this just proves Bob Dole is loyal to his friends. Perhaps. I think it proves that Bob Dole does not believe he can get along without Sheila Burke after having become so dependent on her over these last few years. Keene says that Sheila Burke never pursued her own agenda, but rather she served Bob Dole by doing exactly what he wanted done. If that is the case, then Dole is, indeed, a lot more liberal than his voting record suggests. <P>
At any rate, we will soon learn the truth. Since Doles announced resignation from the Senate, the Dole campaign seems to have found new life and has begun to develop a consistent message. If Sheila Burke is truly the team player her defenders claim she is, she will go along with all of it and blend right in. Then Sheila, old Senate dog that she is, will have learned new tricks too. <P>
On the other hand, if Sheila behaves as she has over the past years in Doles office, she will begin to impose herself on various aspects of the campaign. If you read news accounts about how Burke is trying to get the Republican platform liberalized, then you will understand that it is the same old Sheila at work. And if David Keene is correct, she will be doing so at Doles bidding. <P>
Im encouraged that Dole has finally caught on to how you can win in the long run by losing in the short run. Now lets see if his new found wisdom rubs off on Sheila. Hope springs eternal, as the saying goes. <P>

<h2>
Qualifying Welfare Reform
</h2>
<P>
Guest Commentary by Rep Mark Neuman<P>

<P>This week in the House, a very important issue will be debated about a welfare reform plan known as W-2 Wisconsin Works.  
<P>While this plan is certainly about welfare reform, it is also about a much bigger, perhaps much more important issue.  Its about taking power out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and giving it back to the people.  It is about whether you control what goes on in your state, or whether the Washington bureaucrats will micro-manage every facet of your lives.  When the House passes this bill this week, we take the first major step toward saying "no" to Big Government and federal bureaucrats and saying "yes" putting power back in the hands of the people.
<P>Governor Tommy Thompson of my state has written a welfare reform plan which, I believe, could easily serve as a model for all states to follow.  
<P>This plan was debated for 18 months in Wisconsin.  It was the subject of countless public hearings and meetings.  And then it was overwhelmingly endorsed and passed by both Houses of the Wisconsin legislature  with bipartisan support  both Democrats and Republicans put their stamp of approval on this welfare reform plan.  
<P>But now, many inside the beltway want Washington bureaucrats to tear it apart.  
<P>Washington bureaucrats have grabbed so much power from the states recently,  that Wisconsin needs federal approval before the plan is allowed to be implemented.  That is why I have introduced legislation in the House that allows this plan, which President Clinton himself called "one of the boldest yet," to be put into action in Wisconsin.
<P>While I believe Governor Thompsons welfare reform plan is an excellent one, my legislation doesnt force any other state to adopt it.  It simply clears the way for Wisconsin to move ahead with its own welfare reforms.  
<P>This welfare reform plan was researched, written, debated and passed into law by the citizens of Wisconsin and their elected representatives.  It underwent the scrutiny of numerous public hearings and 18 months of public debate.  And as I mentioned, it was overwhelmingly passed with bipartisan support in the Wisconsin legislature.  
<P>Each House passed it with at least a two-thirds vote.  Further, Governor Thompsons welfare reform plan was enthusiastically endorsed by President Clinton in his weekly radio address just three weeks ago.
<P>But as I said, regardless of the merits of this bill, this legislation represents a much bigger issue: and that is the issue of returning power back to you  the people.
<P>When I came to this Congress in 1995  along with 72 other freshmen  we had two very specific goals in mind: 
<ul>
<LI>balance the budget; 
<LI>and reduce the size, scope, power and influence of the federal government. 
</ul>
<P>We were given a mandate from the people to get Washington off their backs and reduce the burdens and regulations Washington routinely imposes upon them.  My constituents are tired of mandates from Washington; they are fed up with the massive tax burden; and they are sick of Washingtons wasteful spending habits that put their children and grandchildren further and further into debt.  
<P>But this freshmen class is changing the way Washington works.  As I mentioned several weeks ago on this program, we are making great strides in balancing the budget and reducing wasteful Washington spending.  And this week the Senate takes another try at passing a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget  a measure which I wholeheartedly support.
<P>And now, with the legislation I have introduced this week, this Congress is taking a very important step in taking power and  influence out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and returning it to you, the people who sent us here.  
<P>Some would have you believe that only the folks in Washington can have a monopoly on compassion.  Only they can truly see what the people out in the country really need.  Only Washington bureaucrats are fit to determine the needs of the people in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
<P>Folks, thats just silly.  Governor Thompson, along with a bipartisan effort of both Democrats and Republicans in Wisconsin approved this welfare reform plan.  They know what is best for the people they represent, not the bureaucrats in Washington who never have to face the consequences of regulations they impose.  
<P>But now the Washington bureaucrats cant stand not having their fingerprints on this welfare reform plan.  They want to review every detail.  They want to prescribe for you and for me what is best for us.
<P>This issue of welfare reform, perhaps more than any other, demonstrates the need to strip Washington of the immense power it now holds.   
<P>When we pass this welfare reform measure, it will open the door for other states to say "no" to mandates from Washington and "yes" to the wishes of the citizens. <P>

The Speaker's Profound Remarks
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who was approved by his party caucus for another term as leader of the House of Representatives, said something very important which got little coverage yesterday. The media was busy talking about the Speaker's pledge to cooperate with President Clinton and his acknowledgment that he had made some mistakes.
<P>
<DD>
Yet of far more profound significance were these words by Speaker Gingrich:
"The country will never again be healthy if we don't have the courage to confront the spiritual and cultural and moral deficit that is an even greater threat to our future than the economic deficit.
<P>
<DD>
"In the core documents of our freedoms, the Declaration of Independence, is says unequivocally, we are 'endowed by Our Creator with certain unalienable rights'. And I think we have an obligation to reassert in a calm, open way, involving people of all backgrounds, each approaching God in their own unique way, that this nation comes from God, that it is in fact only successful when it is submissive to God's will, that while all of us are sinners and all of us fall short, that does not excuse any of us forgetting where our powers and our responsibilities come [from]; and somehow reestablishing in the public square that it is legitimate, in fact it is vital, that we recognize the degree to which, in the broadest sense, if America does not get its rights from Our Creator, there is no explanation of America and there is no way of thinking of the future. 
<P>
<DD>
"I am not suggesting here in any way a state religion. I'm not suggesting in any way a theocracy. But I am suggesting to you that if you read Lincoln and you read the Founding Fathers and you read as recently as FDR, and then you look at our modern 30-second attack commercials and you look at the decay in our society, that maybe we lost a great deal when we became too timid to talk openly about the source of the American dream and the source of our rights and that we have an obligation to re-establish them."
To this I can only add "Amen and Amen." It is a mark of our time that the Speaker feels he would have to add as many qualifiers as he did in making a very valid statement. The early leaders of our nation were much more straight forward in proclaiming their belief in God.
<P>
<DD>
Important civil documents invoke the name of the "Most Holy Trinity." The argument then was between those such as Thomas Jefferson, who acknowledged a distant deity and those who proclaimed that we were a Christian nation, albeit one which was tolerant of other beliefs.
<P>
<DD>
Today the argument is between those who want only to acknowledge God in the public square, as the Speaker did in his speech, and those who insist that belief in God is at most a private matter, and any utterance or acknowledgment of God in the outside world is not only improper but should be forbidden. Unfortunately, in what the New York Times has described as the "post-Christian era in America," those who want not to separate church and state but to ban God from government, have won the day.
<P>
<DD>
Viewers know I have many differences with the Speaker. But I applaud him for raising this issue. He did so on the day on which his father, Robert Gingrich, who had adopted him at age three, died of cancer at age 71.
<P>
<DD>
The words of Speaker Gingrich were a fitting tribute to the only father he ever knew. There is something that happens to us when our fathers die. We begin to look at life more seriously. Somehow when they are still alive, we think of ourselves still as kids, no matter how old we or they may be. But when we lose our fathers, we understand that the future now is up to us. We take responsibilities more seriously.
<P>
<DD>
I believe in the Providence of God. I believe nothing happens by accident. The Speaker said with the passing of his Dad, he felt strongly that he had to bring up the issue of God in the public square, even though it might be a little controversial. I believe he was inspired to do so. The Speaker spoke the truth.
<P>
<DD>
Let us ask Almighty God to find rest for Robert Gingrich in a place where there is no pain nor grief but only everlasting life. Let us ask that same God to inspire and bless Speaker Gingrich that he might find the wisdom and strength to do exactly what he suggested needs to be done: namely to help to reestablish God's rightful place in the affairs of mankind.

<h2>
"Sacrificing Principle for Party Loyalty"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
How do I hate this town? Let me count the ways! For one thing, almost no one really puts himself on the line for what he says he believes in.<P>
Case in point. Majority Leader Dick Armey wears his conservatism on his sleeve. To hear him talk, you would think he is one of the most principled of men ever to grace the Leadership of either party. I am sure he thinks of himself as principled. But Dick Armey is a party man first and foremost. And as a party man he puts protecting incumbents ahead of principle.<P>
Congresswoman Sue Kelly is one such incumbent. She voted against many items in the "Contract with America." When the Leadership said last summer that the Labor HHS Appropriations Bill was Armageddon and twisted arms until they hurt with GOP members who were reluctant to vote for the bill, Sue Kelly defied the Leadership. Worst of all, Sue Kelly was one of five Republicans to vote with President Clinton against the partial birth abortion bill.<P>
Sue Kellys opponent in the GOP primary is former Congressman Joe DioGuardi. DioGuardi is famous for having been the candidate who retired Bella Abzug from the House of Representatives. DioGuardi, when he served in the House, was the only certified public accountant to ever to do so. It is DioGuardi who pointed to the irregularities of the House majority which Speaker Gingrich was pleased to pick up on when he took over a year and a half ago.<P>
DioGuardi would be a loyal soldier when it came to things such as the "Contract." He would never vote against the Leadership on a key appropriations bill. In New Yorks multi-party system, DioGuardi already has the Right to Life party line. He would not be a dissenter on an issue like partial birth abortions. Yet Dick Armey, to help protect Sue Kelly, has gone so far as to call potential DioGuardi contributors in New York to ask them not to give to the DioGuardi campaign. Other members of the Leadership have tried to make the case for Kelly as well on the grounds that the GOP will lose the seat if she is not the nominee.<P>
First of all, if DioGuardi wins the GOP nomination and already has the Conservative and Right to Life party nominations, he will have an excellent chance of getting elected. But even if Kelly had the better chance of holding the seat, is incumbent loyalty worth sacrificing ones principles? Is it worth helping someone who is so liberal that even partial birth abortion doesnt stir her conscience? Is incumbent loyalty worth stabbing a fine upstanding man like DioGuardi in the back?<P>
Take the case of Congressman Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania. Speaker Gingrich gives passionate speeches about how the labor unions are out to destroy his Republican majority. Indeed they are and first among them is the National Education Association, the teachers union. When push comes to shove, Congressman Goodling, a former teacher, does the NEAs biding inside the GOP caucus.<P>
Goodling, who was first elected to replace his father George Goodling in 1974, was challenged in the Republican primary by civic activist Charlie Gerow. Gerow ran because he wanted to join the likes of the eager young freshmen who have made such a difference in Congress. Goodlings cozy relationship with the NEA was one of the key issues in the campaign. Well, who made an all-embracing appearance in the district for Bill Goodling at the strategic moment when it was clear it was a horse race? Why Speaker Gingrich, of course. <P>
When the results were in, Goodling was only re-nominated with a 53% to 47% vote. Gerow contends that if Gingrich had just stayed out, he would have defeated Goodling in this heavily Republican district. Then the NEA would not have had a mole inside the GOP ranks. But incumbent loyalty is more important to the Leadership than principle, when principle means standing up for those who believe the same things that the Leadership professes to believe.<P>
Perhaps one can morally justify neutrality on the part of the Leadership in such cases.  After all, members of the Leadership are put in a difficult position when one of their members is challenged in a primary. But all out support for incumbent members who are challenged by candidates of principle is next to impossible to justify if you really believe in the causes you preach to the faithful on a daily basis. No wonder the American electorate has grown increasingly cynical.<P>
Contrast this incumbent loyalty among Republicans with the Democrats. Congressman Ralph Hall of Texas is perhaps the most conservative Democrat in Congress. His voting record is better than that of most Republicans. A couple of times since he was first elected in 1980, Hall was perceived to be in trouble. He might have been replaced with a Republican. The Democratic Leadership was nowhere to be found. Hall was on his own. That is because Hall routinely votes with the Republicans on issues and defies the Democratic Leadership even on crucial votes. Their loyalty to liberalism was greater than their loyalty to one of their incumbents who votes against them. Even though Hall is a close friend of mine and I am glad he survived those challenges, I have to admire the liberals for at least standing for something.<P>
One possible Republican exception to this sorry state of affairs is Oklahomas freshman Representative Steve Largent. Late last year Speaker Gingrich sought to punish a group of conservatives because they didnt cave in when he did on shutting down the government. Largent then stepped in and did the fund-raisers for those on whom Gingrich canceled out. It worked out well. The public would rather pay to see a star athlete like Largent any day over a Washington politician.<P>
What Largent did took real fortitude. But of course he is a freshman. Were he serving his ninth term like Gingrich or his sixth term like Armey, he might not be as eager to cross a member of the Leadership.<P>
There is a reason that many of us who used to be adamantly opposed to term limits are now among its most ardent backers. The longer I stay here and see good men like DioGuardi and Gerow stabbed in the back by supposed philosophical standard bearers such as Gingrich and Armey, the more passionate about term limits I become.<P>

<title>Phil Gramm Speech</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Speech by Phil Gramm</h2><p>
<h3><i>January 1st, 2001</i></h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Any candidate running for President ought to be able to tell you what 
they want America to look like after their programs are in effect.  It is 
particularly fitting that one of the final days of the first term of the 
next president will be January the 1st, 2001 -- the beginning of the new 
millennium.  If you choose me to be your next President, here's the 
America I will work with you to create on that day.<p>
<center><h3>BALANCED BUDGET</center></h3><p>
On January the 1st, 2001, your life will be better and your future will be 
brighter because the federal budget will be balanced.  For the first time in 
over thirty years, the government in Washington will be forced to operate 
in the black and pay its bills.  The  50 cents out of every dollar we save 
that today is siphoned off to pay for government deficit spending will be 
available to build new homes, new farms and new factories; to create new 
jobs, new growth and new opportunity.<p>
Americans will be surprised at the benefits they get when government is 
again forced to live within its means.  In the five years since 1950 when 
the federal government actually balanced the budget, prime interest rates 
averaged 3.5% and mortgage rates averaged 4%.<p>
Owning your own home will again be part of the American dream, and 
today's workers will become tomorrow's small business owners, as 
Americans will again quit their jobs and strike out on their own to start 
their own businesses.<p>
<center><h3>TAXES</center></h3><p>
On January 1, 2001, the federal government will be spending just 18 
cents out of every dollar earned in America, down from 22 cents today.  
What does that mean to you and your family?  It means $3,900 per family 
that will be spent by you rather than by Washington.  Our flat tax will be 
fully in place by January 1, 2001, and you will be able to fill out your tax 
return on a post card.  <p>
By January 1st, 2001, excessive regulations that now add as much as 33% 
to the cost of building jet engines and nearly double the price of new 
vaccines will have been lifted.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, no family farm or small business in America will 
have to be sold to pay inheritance taxes.  When you build up your 
business or farm your family will have it for keeps. <p>
<center><h3>ECONOMY</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, private investment will be at an all-time high.  
More jobs will be created and your family will earn more and keep more 
of what you earn.  With the creative genius of America once more 
unleashed, no spot on the planet will be safe from our commercial 
onslaught. <p>
By January 1st, 2001, French farmers, Japanese semi-conductor 
manufacturers, and German auto makers will be lobbying their 
governments to erect protectionist walls against American goods. And as 
President I will knock down those barriers.  <p>
<center><h3>GOVERNMENT</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, I see an America where our government will be 
doing less, but what it does it will be doing better.  Medicare will be an 
efficient health care delivery system and our seniors will know that the 
government has honored its contract with them.  Medical costs will be 
under control because we will have the right to choose the health care 
plan that best fits our needs, a plan that is competitive and efficient.  
Social Security benefits will be guaranteed and young people will be able 
to invest more in their own private retirement plans and medical savings
accounts.<p>
<center><h3>WELFARE</center></h3><p>
By January the 1st, 2001, able-bodied men and women now riding in the 
welfare wagon will have had to get out of the wagon and help the rest of 
us pull.  We will have stopped giving more and more money to 
encourage people to have more and more children on welfare.  And the 
illegitimacy rate will be falling as fast in the year 2001 as it is rising 
today.  Those who can and should help themselves will be doing it again.  
And they will be learning to love it.  And those who truly need help will 
get it in programs tailored by their own states and run in their own 
communities in partnership with their churches and charitable 
organizations.<p>
<center><h3>CRIME</center></h3><p>
It always makes me mad when I go to my mother's house and see the bars 
she has on her windows.  On January 1st, 2001, those bars will be down.  
My mother will be able to walk around her neighborhood on the darkest 
night and not be afraid, and the people she's afraid of today will have bars 
on their windows.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, your family will be safer because we will be 
grabbing violent criminals by the throat, and the 7% of criminals who 
today commit 70% of the violent crimes will be in jail where they belong.  
We won't be building federal prisons like Holiday Inns anymore.  The 
weight rooms will be gone, so will the color televisions and the air 
conditioning.  Our federal prisons will be mini-industrial parks, where 
prisoners work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.  Prisoners will be working 
during the day to pay for the cost of their incarceration and going to 
school at night. When criminals have served their full sentences they will 
leave prison with the skills they learned working, they will be able to read 
and write and they will be drug-free.  And they won't be eager to go back 
to prison.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, the sound of children playing and people chatting, 
neighbors talking to neighbors, will replace the sound of gunfire and 
sirens in America's cities.  The law will require ten years in prison 
without parole for possessing a firearm during the commission of a 
violent crime or a drug felony, twenty years for discharging it, and when 
a brutal, predatory criminal kills one of our neighbors, he will be put to 
death.  <p>
By January of 2001, we will have begun taking down the metal detectors 
in our schools, and drug dealers will know that if they sell drugs to our 
children, they are going to go to jail for ten years without parole, no 
matter who their daddy is or how society has done them wrong.
<center><h3>EDUCATION</center></h3><p>
America will not have an education President on January 1st, 2001; we 
will have something a lot better.  You will be an education parent again.  
By January 1st, 2001, there will be no federal Department of Education.  
Half of the $32 billion it now spends every year will be back in the hands 
of families in the form of an education tax credit, so that you can invest 
your own money in your own children's education. The other half will go 
back to local school districts so local parents, local teachers, and locally 
elected school board members can again set education policy. There will 
be no federal Goals 2000 -- I will repeal Goals 2000.  Education policy 
will be set by you in your home and in your schools.  <p>
With you in charge of your child's schools, the schools of America will 
for the first time in 50 years be on their way to leading the world in math 
and science, in reading and reasoning.  They will once more teach our 
heritage and our history.  Our children will graduate ready to lead 
America and the world in the high-tech, global economy.  <p>
<center><h3>VALUES</center></h3><p>
By January, 2001, America's forty year experiment with Washington 
imposing values on our people will be a bad but fading memory.  Having 
opposed Bill Clinton's efforts to impose his values on America, I will 
never try to impose my values on you.  There's only one person 
who'sever lived who I would trust to impose values on America.  And 
when He comes back, He won't need government to impose His values.  
In the meantime, we will entrust the formation of values to the American 
family.  The values of our families, refined through each family's own 
faith, will permeate up from our homes, through our neighborhoods and 
our communities to form our nation's values. <p>
And America will be a more virtuous America. When we put families 
first in America again we will love ourselves, our neighbors and our 
country better for it.  Our children will have voluntary prayer in the 
schools again, and every American will have the guaranteed right of 
religious expression.  And putting families first means respecting the 
sanctity of human life.  By January 1st, 2001 the federal government will 
have stopped funding abortion and groups that advocate it.  Federal 
judges will be appointed who will faithfully interpret the Constitution, not 
make it up as they go along.<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS</center></h3><p>
In taking the oath of office, I will place my hand on the Bible and swear 
allegiance to a Constitution that enshrines equal justice under law.  When 
my hand comes off that Bible, I will pick up a pen and by Executive 
Order end quotas and set-asides in the Executive branch of American 
government.  I will veto any bill that requires quotas or set-asides.  I will 
fight for equal and unlimited opportunity for all but there will be special 
privilege for none. <p>
With our best effort, by January, 2001, Martin Luther King's dream that 
men and women in America will be judged not by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character will have come true.  And with a 
strong economy, strong families and pervasive opportunity, we will 
rediscover in America what ordinary people with more opportunity and 
more freedom than any people who have ever lived can accomplish in 
this extraordinary land of ours.<p>
<center><h3>DEFENSE</center></h3><p>
By January of 2001, we will have rebuilt our national defenses and will 
recruit and retain the finest young men and women who have ever worn 
the uniform of this country.  We will provide them with the best training 
and the finest weapons that Americans can build.  We will guarantee that
even in a world where the lion and the lamb are lying down together, 
America will always be the lion.  On January 1st, 2001 nowhere in the 
world will Americans be in combat under U.N. command.  <p>
<center><h3>ELECTION</center></h3><p>
The election for President in 1996 is not just a contest between candidates 
and political parties, it is a choice between two very different visions for 
America's future.  Bill Clinton believes that a brighter future will be won 
with more government.  I believe it will be won with more freedom.<p>
In Bill Clinton's America on January 1, 2001, our federal government 
looks pretty much the way it's looked for the last 40 years-- except it is 
bigger, more expensive, and more powerful.  But we reject that America.  
The test results are in:  big government had 40 years to do the job and it 
failed.<p>
If we are bold enough in defining our vision of an American future 
dominated by freedom and family, Bill Clinton will be remembered as 
the last President of a liberal era when big government arrogantly thought 
it knew best.  Bill Clinton is yesterday's president wedded to yesterday's 
government.  I will be tomorrow's President.  I will lead America back to 
the future to reaffirm, as our founders did, the revolutionary idea that 
ordinary people with freedom and opportunity can decide their own 
destiny and the destiny of the world.<p>
<center><h3>NORMAN ROCKWELL</center></h3><p>
As we ask our people to look up from the crisis of the present and to 
share our vision of what America can be, some will say that our vision 
looks a lot like a Norman Rockwell painting.  And I won't deny it.  But 
should we accept anything less?  After all, Norman Rockwell's paintings 
presented America as we wanted it to be and as we knew it could be.  
And I see Norman Rockwell paintings in the making everywhere in the 
history of our families and in the history of our country.<p>
I can see a Norman Rockwell painting of my wife's family.  Her 
grandfather came to America as an indentured laborer to work in the 
sugar cane fields in Hawaii.  He had no money.  He spoke not one word 
of English.  He didn't know anybody in America.  He came with a dream, 
with a devout faith, and with willing hands.  Twenty-five years later, his 
son, my wife's father, got on a freighter leaving Hawaii to come to the 
mainland with $25 he'd won in an essay contest and the dream of going 
to college.  He came home to Hawaii as an engineer and became the first 
Asian American ever to be an officer of a sugar company in the history of 
Hawaii.  And under President Reagan and President Bush, his daughter, 
my wife, served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, where she oversaw the trading of all commodities and 
commodity futures, including the same cane sugar that her grandfather 
came to America to harvest.  I'm not sure that even Norman Rockwell 
could have captured that story in a painting.  But the only thing 
extraordinary about that story is that there is nothing extraordinary about 
that story.  It's a story of an ordinary family in an extraordinary country. <p>
Neither of my parents graduated from high school, but my mother had a 
dream before I was born that I was going to college.  I resisted.  I failed 
the third, seventh, and ninth grades, but it didn't make any difference to 
my mother. My mother prodded me every step of the way through 
collegeto a Ph.D. in economics because in the America we grew up in, 
mother's dreams did not die easily.  Too many mothers' dreams are dying 
too easily in America today.  And I want our America back.<p>
We have a right to dream great dreams because we're Americans.  If 
American history proves anything, it proves that with leadership and 
courage what we can dream we can do.  <p>
Our founders dreamed they could start the world over again and they did 
it in America.  With God's help we can make our dream, The American 
Dream, a reality.  Now and forever.<p>

<h2>Casino Gambling Reform Hits Roadblock</h2>
<p><p><p>
<blockquote>
When both sides of a highly contentious issue claim they are satisfied with the result of a compromise, it is a sure sign that very little will be accomplished. That is exactly the case with a bill, for which the House of Representatives gave final approval, which would create a federal commission to examine the $40 billion gambling industry.
<p>
That any bill was passed at all was due to a rare combination of the religious right, who believe that gambling has hurt families, and liberals who target the gambling industry as another example of the corruption of free enterprise. 
<p>
The original bill, as conceived by Congressman Frank Wolf, an evangelical Christian from Virginia, was greatly weakened. 
<p>
Originally the commission would have had broad subpoena power. But the bill which passed the Congress, now permits the commission to only subpoena documents, not people. In addition, if material is not available from public sources, the Commission must keep its information confidential. Wolf said he is satisfied with the powers the commission has. But so is Frank Fahrenkopf, the former Republican National Chairman, who represents the gambling industry in Washington. He says he welcomes a "balanced" inquiry into the industry. 
<p>
What all of this means is that Congressman Wolf got just enough out of the commission that he doesn't have to deny that his bill was gutted, while Fahrenkopf is satisfied that the commission doesn't really have enough power to do any real damage to the industry. So there you have it. Another "Washington Commission" has been born. It will spend lots of taxpayer money. It will issue reports. Most likely few will read the reports. Nothing will change. 
<p>
Congressman Henry Hyde, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the commission was needed to know the implications of the growth of the gambling industry. A couple of decades ago there was legalized gambling in only two states, Nevada and New Jersey. Now only two states, Utah and Hawaii, ban legalized gambling, and there are operating casinos in 23 states. 
<p>
The Family Research Council points out that in states where gambling is flourishing, more and more families are becoming impoverished. They contend that gambling is addictive in many cases and has led to financial ruin for many families who otherwise would be able to maintain themselves. The gambling industry, on the other hand, contends that only 5% of gamblers are addicted. And so the debate goes on and on. 
<p>
It is really a part of an age old debate about what sorts of activity, which if done in excess can lead to the destruction of human beings, should thus be legal and open for all citizens to participate. Such a debate preceded the passage of the Volstead Act, the Constitutional amendment which outlawed the sale of liquor and was in force for more than a decade. Enforcement of the Volstead Act, critics claim, was responsible for the establishment of the Mafia in the United States, as liquor sales went underground. The same question now pertains to gambling. Should it be open and above board where it can be seen and regulated? Or is society better off if gambling is underground, even if authorities have a much harder time policing it?
The new Gambling Commission may provide some data, but it is unlikely to resolve the issue. The real question, as it is with pornography on the Internet or drug usage and other such matters, is simply this: what damage is caused to society when potentially sinful activities are engaged in by a substantial percentage of its population? And if it can be proven that substantial damage is done by such activities to society as a whole, what right does society have to curb the choices which can be made by free citizens?
Libertarians contend that citizens should be free to do as they wish, because it is a matter of their choice to use their resources as they see fit. Traditionalists contend that society must protect itself against any behavior which is seen as self destructive and should therefore be free to curb such behavior. Thus far, the Supreme Court has tended to side with the Libertarians. 
<p>
But in any case, that will continue to be debated so long as we have the freedom to do so. It will be debated long after the new Gambling Commission issues its ponderous reports, which when all is said and done, are not likely to effect the outcome of the debate in this society much at all. That's all for Direct Line for tonight.

The Next American Revolution
<p></h2><p><p>
<blockquote>
This past Spring, President Clinton took the unprecedented step of praising his opponent, Bob Dole, for insisting that a disclaimer be added to the Republican Party platform.  The disclaimer calls for tolerance for opposing opinions.  For weeks, the issue was the Republican's so-called anti-abortion plank.  The establishment media feasted on the debate over whether to amend the language.  While Clinton cheered him on, Dole finally resolved to put the tolerance disclaimer in the preamble to the platform, although for awhile he seemed wrestle with a decision to put the tolerance language directly in the paragraph which addresses the issue of abortion.
<P>
Interestingly, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic Platform.  Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would have no guarantee of saving unborn lives.  The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the practice.  Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.
<p>
Ultimately the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms.  The real contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest which pits Washington against its own citizens.  Let's be honest about one thing: the Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by establishment politicians. Yet, what our culture badly needs is honesty in its political process.  Our society desperately needs elected leaders who maintain the courage of their convictions.
<p>
All of this may require a third political party.  If that is the case, then so be it.  You see, America has reached a great crossroads in its history.  Our nation faces a great dilemma  our government is in debt bordering on insolvency.  Meanwhile, increasingly, our country faces threats from unknown entities throughout the world in the form of terrorism.
<p>
What we need more than anything else is prayer; the prayer of honest citizens that our elected leaders act responsibly; prayer that our culture turns from its tailspin of depravity; prayer that God, who at one time blessed this great nation of ours, will again restore our nation to moral and fiscal health.
God has given us a wonderful gift. He has given us a nation in which its citizens are free to worship, speak, own property, and elect popular leaders. But slowly we have allowed our elected leaders and cultural elitists to squandered that gift, through debt, moral erosion, lawlessness and political deceit. I believe God can judge America or save America. It's up to us. But time is running out, both for our economic and spiritual well-being.
<p>
If we as a nation return to the faith and righteous principles upon which this country was founded, I believe God will once restore to our nation the America we once were. May God help us to pray for that to happen.

<h2>RNC TALKING POINTS:<br>
TOP TEN REASONS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As conferees from both Houses of Congress meet to reconcile 
differences between the recently passed House and Senate budget 
resolutions, it is important to remember why we must balance the budget 
and what a balanced budget will mean to all of us. We've heard the 
arguments from Bill Clinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress 
about why we can't balance the budget by 2002 and why we can't reduce 
spending. Given the doom and gloom rhetoric coming from their corner, 
many Americans may be wondering why we would want to balance 
the budget at all. Here are ten good reasons: <p>
A balanced budget will reduce the burden of debt on our children. The 
national debt is now $4.8 trillion. A child born today will pay $187,000 
in taxes over his or her lifetime -- just to pay the interest on that debt. 
That's more than $3,500 in taxes every year of their working lives to 
pay for our debt. And if we do nothing, that debt will balloon to nearly $8 
trillion in 15 years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will enable us to return to the American people more 
of their hard-earned tax dollars. Federal taxes as a share of median family 
income have steadily increased from 5% in 1950 to almost 25% today. In 
fact, if the average family today paid the same percentage of their income 
in taxes as their parents did, they would have roughly $10,000 more to 
spend at the end of the year. As we balance the budget, we can reduce the 
tax burden on families (sources: Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute). <p> 
A balanced budget will bring down interest rates. Deficit spending raises 
interest rates as government borrows more. A balanced federal budget 
will result in a drop in interest rates of approximately two percentage 
points or more. This will mean a savings of $37,440 on a $75,000, 30-
year home mortgage. It will mean a savings of $900 on a $15,000 car 
loan. Everything you borrow money for will cost less (source: Joint 
Economic Committee of Congress). <p> 
A balanced budget will increase economic growth. Time magazine 
reports (see attached article) that Roger Brinner, chief economist with the 
forecasting firm of DRI/McGraw-Hill, estimates balancing the budget 
would raise America's yearly output an extra 2.5% over the next 10 years. 
That would mean an average of an extra $1,000 a year for each American 
family. <p>
A balanced budget will create more jobs. Economic growth means more 
jobs, and a balanced budget is estimated to result in 6.1 million more jobs 
over the next ten years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will increase our standard of living. The nonpartisan 
Concord Coalition concludes that without deficit spending and debt, the 
average family income today would be $50,000 instead of $35,000.  
When asked what a balanced budget will mean for most Americans, Alan 
Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress: "I think 
their real incomes and purchasing power of their real incomes would 
significantly improve ... they would look forward to their children doing 
better than they." <p>
A balanced budget will strengthen the American dollar. Clinton's deficits 
have been driving the U.S. dollar to record lows, and the most dramatic 
drop was right after he and the Democrats in Congress defeated the 
balanced budget amendment. The devaluation of our currency ultimately 
leads to a lower standard of living. But the passage of Republican 
bills in Congress to balance the budget has caused the dollar to bounce 
back. As The Washington Post reported 5/19/95, "The U.S. dollar has 
rebounded in foreign exchange markets during the past several weeks, in 
part because of a growing belief among foreign investors that the United 
States is moving to put its economic house in order." <p> 
A balanced budget will ensure that our retirement programs are safe. 
Medicare and Social Security are programs that seniors have paid into all 
their lives, and we must be able to meet our commitments to them. 
Younger people paying into these programs now must also be assured 
that the funds will be there for them when they retire. The only way to 
preserve and protect these programs is to balance the federal budget 
once and for all, so we will always have the necessary resources 
available. As Bob Myers, long-time Chief Actuary of the Social Security 
Administration has said: "If we continue to run federal deficits year after 
year, and if interest payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, we 
will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid the trust funds to 
pay for our current profligacy, or we will print money, dishonestly 
inflating our way out of indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the 
real value of the social security trust funds." <p> 
A balanced budget will allow us to spend money on programs we need, 
rather than interest on the debt. If we do nothing, entitlements and interest 
on the debt will consume all tax revenues in just 17 years. Balancing the 
budget will ensure the federal government has the money it needs to 
defend our country, fund education, build roads and perform other 
necessary and important functions of government (source: Entitlement 
Commission). <p> 
A balanced budget will restore the American Dream. Rising interest rates, 
higher taxes, and stagnant wages are robbing us of the American Dream. 
Since the early 1970s when government spending began to balloon, 
Americans' incomes have stayed flat. In 1993, the first year of 
Clintonomics, median family income declined by $709 (source: U.S. 
Census Bureau). If we balance the federal budget, interest rates 
will drop, taxes can be lowered, and wages will increase. In short, we will 
restore the American Dream for millions of hard-working American 
families.  <p>

<b>Comments:</b><P>

<ul>
"Conservatives often get too caught up in the many proble
ith the was affirmative action is currently implemented, and forget the reason it's there at all.
It is not enough to just get rid of race-based preferences, we must create opportunities for minorities and all of society through pro-growth tax policies.
<br>A negative message of "anti-affirmative" action will get the Republican party
nowhere unless it is backed up with a positive message of hope and opportunities
created."<br><b>Charles, Washington DC</b><P>

"Racial tensions are very real and
the rights of minorities do need to be protected.  Perhaps the affirmative action programs of the past three decades have been helpful in at least weakening
 barriers that existed, especially in the better-paying professions.  We now
e a generation of senior managers, many of whom really believe that they have an
 obligation to ensure that women and minorities are given opportunities for advancement.  <br>Though these programs may have been necessary to help overcome the
barriers of tradition and expectation, they have had incidious effects as we have seen  minorities of mediocre talent promoted to levels of high responsibility.  These unmerited promotions are damaging to the esteem of our institutions
and are as debilitating to those of little merit who are promoted as they are those of great merit who are passed over.  We need to move as quickly as possile
to a color- and sex-blind system of merit.
<br><b>Judy, Vienna, VA</b>

<P>
I believe neither the Republicans nor the Democrats
are serious about ensuring fairness in hiring practices (note the Democrat-controlled Congress's long-standing
policy of exempting themselves from all the affirmative
action laws they have passed over the last 25 years as
well as the Republicans missing the opportunities they
have had over the years to demonstrate any understanding
of racial inequity).<br>
I will hold both parties responsible for the lack of pro-
gress this year and with any increase in racial tensions
or inequity in treatment of all people of any race. <br><b>John, South Charleston</b><P>
 
"I coach the Debate Team at Transylvania University, a member
 of the National Educational Debate Association, and our resolution this semester deals with Affirmative Action. From the massive amount of research my team
has done it is very clear
that Affirmative Action is a joke.  It promotes a very small group of minorities,
 while failing to address the real needs of the very people it is suppossed
help.<br>
It is typical of governmental attempts at solving problems.  It simply does not
work."<br><b>James, Lexington, KY</b><P>


"I hope the March accomplishes its stated goal of helping men
return to their families as better individuals and citizens. <br>I hope that all men who heard about the march take this as a wake up call to them. Too many people in this country are waiting for someone else to fix their problems. I wish that politicians from both parties would realize that they are simply tearing this country further apart by their constant pettiness. Instead of trying to shift the blame from one party to another, they should understand that they are a group.
That is why congress was composed. <BR>
Whether they are Republican or Democrat or Independent, they should be responsible. In a crime, there is an idea of accomplice. In politics, there is no such idea, only men trying to appear to be perfect.
Sorryy to be so winded, I am really getting sick of hearing both sides blame each
er. It makes it difficult to believe anybody.<br><b>Mark, Scottsdale, AZ</b><P> 


Affirmative Action has never affirmed anyone's worth in
 society.  The proof is that achievement of any sort by any of the eligible classes holds no validity, even in their own eyes.  The presence of the possibility that decisions are made based on such superficial standards promotes envy, malice and distrust.<Br>
The MMM, and their threat of lawsuit about the count released by the park service only illustrates the difference between races.  A difference that all the social programs in the world cannot hide.  Although blacks and hispanics now openly
exercise their right to speak about segregation (and territorial control),
only a limited license is granted to whites, and those who try to practice segregation have the fate of Randy Weaver to consider.<br><b>Patty, Chantilly, VA</b><p>

Affirmative action programs were good when they started.
<BR>
Martin Luther King woke americans up to prejudice and the
need for real equality in america. The congress then passed
laws and they were almost immediately grafted and corrupted
The Bumper sticker which says " Crime wouldn't pay if the
Government ran it" is true. We need government to set 
guidelines and make laws, but it is people who must learn
to do right and be just.<BR>
 For Black people to support Farakan
is to turn their backs on the principles that Martin Luther
King fought for. We white Americans need to do the right
thing because it is right not because some muslim demands it.
Islam is in direct opposition to what this country stands for.
Liberals scream separation of church and state and then
rush to support a cult that will divide us and tear down the
advancements we have made. I say we should look to the
real Black leaders, such as Dexter Scott King, and seek to
encourage them and stand firm with Martin Luther Kings'
principle of a truely integrated america.<br><b>Michael, West Palm Beach, FL</b><P>

<title>Budget Reform</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
Washington Watch<br>
Volume 6, Number 10<br>
September 23, 1995<br>

<h2><center>KEEPING BUDGET REFORM ON TRACK</h2></center><br>

	White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his "no new taxes" pledge. Today, they decry "a train wreck" they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. <p>
	First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996 Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.<p>
	House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period, but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. <p>
	
<h3><center>Media's False Picture</h3></center><br>
	Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal also produces $2 trillion in new federal debt.  <p>
	Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They claim the tax cuts will "explode the deficit,."  But more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief  is dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes. Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition of the tax package will be very "family friendly."<p>
	Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending is projected to increase at twice the rate of inflation even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.  The argument that tax cuts "explode the deficit" is answered by pointing out that tax revenues actually increased by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a budget surplus today. <p>
	Not a penny can be spent unless both houses of Congress approve. This gives the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers' money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal activism. Congress has an obligation to use its "power of the purse" to protect the legitimate interests of the American family.<p>
	
<h3><center>A Contest of Wills <br></h3></center>
	Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may try to get through October by passing "continuing resolutions. But, by early November, the Treasury's authority to borrow will expire.  Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling.  If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash is possible. But essential services like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social Security will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will be a great hue and cry from the liberal interest groups who see their funds disappearing.<p>       
	A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest groups.  What happens if a few weeks or months go by and the public doesn't miss the "services?"  That would provide a very powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a  liberal "train wreck" to get our country back on track, that may be a small price to pay. <p>

<h2>Racism, Sexism Revisited</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>
Bill Lind's recent series of commentaries on Political Correctness created quite a stir here at NET.  We have had a substantial internal debate about whether, particularly, his commentary of Monday, July 9 promotes or invites racism.  We've also had some discussion about his July 10 commentary on sexism.
When authentic, racism is extremely harmful because it fails to consider the worth and dignity of each person as an individual.  As Mr. Lind noted in one of his commentaries, "Wise people judge other individuals as individuals, not as members of any group."<P>
Our culture has indeed become so Politically Correct, so infected by false racism and irrational sexism, that it has become quite difficult to discuss any of these issues without being accused of committing that which one would condemn.  People today are so often told that they are victims of characteristics beyond their control that they tend to believe it.  Worse, those who have experienced real discrimination, yet whose lives are dedicated to rising above it by courageously finding ways up, over and around it, are the most seriously harmed by false discrimination.  Why?  Because false discrimination tends to become confused with authentic discrimination.  Real discrimination thus becomes harder to detect, which means that fewer citizens take action to stamp it out.<P>
The late Dr. Martin Luther King urged Americans to judge people by the content of their character.  We at NET, and at its founding organization, the Free Congress Foundation, agree with that statement.  We do not espouse or condone racism in any form.  We are committed to the fair treatment of everyone.  Consequently we condemn both real and false racism.<P>
As Mr. Lind also noted in last week's series, we recognize that men and women are different.  Complementary, but different.  Thus we believe, for example, that single-sex education, recently condemned by the Supreme Court, should be supported in this country; we endorse parental choice in education.  That does not deny that many young men and women do well in a co-educational environment; nor does it deny that most men and women are able to perform the vast majority of  jobs equally well.  However, we disagree with the feminist view that there are no differences between men and women.  That view is a delusion. It is a failure to recognize physical reality.  We are not all the same; each of us is a unique individual, deserving of respect as such.<P>
In our NET commentaries, we intend to discuss difficult, contentious issues.  Our editorial viewpoint is, for example, uncompromisingly pro-life and pro-family.  We will continue to express ourselves, and to present guest commentaries on controversial issues, because we believe you, our viewers, are well-served by discussions of issues rarely presented elsewhere with forthrightness based on a search for truth.  And when our commentaries create controversy internally, we will continue to have open, frank discussions.  Your views are important to us as well; they enrich our discussions, and they help us to know you better.  So we invite you to call, write, fax and e-email us whenever you wish to comment on an issue, or on anything else we do.<P>

<h2>Phil Gramm Speech to the Senate</h2><p>			
<h3>104th Congress 1st Session</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this week and next week, we are going to come
down to the moment of truth on two issues. One issue has to do with putting
the Federal Government on a budget like everybody else. The other issue has
to do with fulfilling the Contract With America to let working people keep
more of what they earn. I would like to briefly address both of these subjects.<p>
In the 1994 election, in one of the most remarkable political occurrences
in the postwar period, House Republicans did something that is very unusual
in the political process and that is they set out in plain English what they
promised America they would do if the American people gave them a majority
in the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years.<p>
I would add that while many people have forgotten it, Republican
candidates for the Senate put out a joint statement where virtually every
Republican challenger for the U.S. Senate in the country came to Washington
and released a ''Seven More In '94'' document, where we outlined seven
things we would do if the American people gave us a majority.<p>
   Two of those promised items had to do with balancing the budget and with
letting working people keep more of what they earned. The House of
Representatives has done something even more remarkable than making all these
promises-they have actually done it. The House of Representatives has adopted
the Contract With America. They have adopted 90 percent of the things they
promised to simply vote on. And at the best universities in the land, you
would grade that as an ''A.''<p>
   We are now down to the moment of truth in the U.S. Senate and that moment
of truth basically has to do with whether or not we are going to pass the
Contract With America and whether we can make the tough decisions necessary
in order to do that. To balance the Federal budget over a 7-year period and
at the same time to accommodate the tax cut contained in the Contract With
America will require us, over a 7-year period, to limit the growth in
Federal spending to approximately 3 percent a year.<p>
   Over the last 40 years, Federal spending has grown at 2-1/2 times the
growth of family budgets in America. Over the last 40 years, the Federal
Government has increased its spending 2-1/2 times as fast as the average
family in America has been able to increase its spending. Now what would
America look like if those trends had been reversed? Well, if the average
family in America had seen its budget grow as fast as the Government has
grown for the last 40 years, and the Government's budget had grown only as
fast as the family budget has grown over the last 40 years, the average
family in America today would be earning $ 128,000 a year and the Government
would be approximately one-third its current size.<p>
   I ask my colleagues, if you could choose between the America where the
governments budget grew faster or an America where the family's budget grew
faster-put me down as one who would favor having the average family in
America make $ 128,000 a year and have the Federal Government one-third its
size.<p>
   Here is our dilemma. We have some of our colleagues who say, ''I did not
sign any Contract With America. That was the House of Representatives.'' As
I am fond of saying in our private meetings, that is a subtlety that is lost
on the American people. They do not see this contract as having been a
contract between just the House and the American people. They see it as a
Republican contract. And, quite frankly, it is a Republican contract. It
embodies everything that our party claims to stand for.<p>
   But what I think is important for the Senate is not just that Republican
candidates signed the contract, not just that every House Republican
incumbent who signed the contract was reelected but I think what is
significant to us is that the American people signed that contract when they
gave us a majority in both Houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.<p>
   The question that we are going to have to answer in the next 3 weeks is,
are we willing to limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2 percent a
year so that we can, over a 7-year period, balance the Federal budget and so
that we can let working families keep more of what they earn? I believe that
we can and I believe that we should. I think there are many Republicans in
the Senate who sort of have a problem, in that they have one foot firmly
implanted in the dramatic changes in Government policy that we promised the
American people in 1994, and they have the other foot firmly implanted in the
status quo. And, as those two things have moved further apart, we have had
the predictable result.<p>
   I think it is time for us to choose. I believe in the next 3 weeks we are
going to basically decide whether or not we meant it in November of 1994
when we told the American people that we were going to dramatically change
the way Government does its business. I think the American people are
convinced that we can limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2
percent a year so that we can let families and businesses spend more of what
they earn.<p>
   I know if the President were here, he would say this is a debate about
how much money we are spending on our children; or how much money we are
spending on education; or how much money we are spending on housing or
nutrition.<p>
   But that is not what the debate is about. Everybody in America wants to
spend money on children, housing, education, and nutrition. The debate we
are about to have is not how much money is going to be spent on those
things, but who is going to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats
want Government to go on doing the spending. They want Government spending
to continue to grow 2-1/2 times as fast as the family budget grows.<p>
   I want to put the Federal Government on a diet. I want to slow down the
rate of growth in Government spending so that we can let working families
keep more of their own money to invest in their own children, in their own
businesses, and in their own future.<p>
   This is not a debate about how much money we spend on the things that all
Americans believe we should spend money on. It is a debate about who ought
to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats want the Government to do
the spending. We want the family to do the spending. We know the Government,
and we know the family. And we know the difference.<p>
   Since we are investing in the future of America, I want to invest the
future of America in our families and not in our Government.<p>
   I know that there is a lot of anguish in the Senate, even on our side of
the aisle. But I think it is time to choose. I wanted my colleagues to know
that I am for a budget that does two things: No. 1, over a 7-year period,
limit the growth of Federal spending to about 3 percent a year so we can
balance the budget in 7 years and let our colleagues do something that no
current Member of the Senate, save two, has ever done before; that is, vote
for a real honest-to-God balanced budget. We literally have the power, by
having a 7-year binding budget, to let Members of the Senate vote to stop
talking about balancing the budget and to start doing it.<p>
   Second, in addition to the controls on spending necessary to balance the
budget, I want to limit the growth of spending not to 3 percent a year, but
to 2-1/2 percent a year so that we can let families keep more of what they
earn, so that we can cut the capital gains tax rate, so that we can
eliminate the marriage penalty, so that we can let families have a $ 500 tax
credit per child, so that, rather than having our Government spend our money
for us, we can let working people spend their own money on their own
children and on their own future.<p>
   As we look at this in perspective, let me give you three numbers. In
1950, the average family in America with two little children sent $ 1 out of
every $ 50 it earned to Washington, DC, and thought it was too much. And it
probably was. Today, that family is sending $ 1 out of every $ 4 it earns to
Washington, DC, and if the Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
some people would applaud that prospect, but only because they do not
understand our problems. If Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
and we did not start a single new program nor repeal any existing program, to
pay for the Government that we have already committed to is going to require
that in 20 years $ 1 out of every $ 3 earned by the average family in America
with two children come to Washington, DC, to pay for the Government.<p>
   We are going to have to institute dramatic changes in spending simply to
keep things the way they are. If we are to let working families keep more of
what they earn, we are going to have to institute a dramatic change in
Government policy. Mr. President, I am in favor of a dramatic change in
Government policy. If our Budget Committee does not offer and adopt a budget
that balances the budget and that provides for tax cuts for families and for
job creation, I intend to offer a substitute for that budget. I think we
have to stop cutting deals with America's future. I think we have to stand
up and tell the American people we meant it in November 1994 when we said
you give us a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress and we will
change the policy of American Government.<p>
I think we are now down to a moment of truth. Are we going to fulfill the
commitment we made in that election, or are we basically going to defend the
status quo? The status quo means less opportunity, future jobs, and an
America that is not the America that I want my children and my grandchildren
to have. I am ready to change the status quo. I am ready to cut the growth
in Government spending, not just to balance the budget, but to cut taxes.
And what I want my colleagues to know today is I want to work with the
Budget Committee, I want to work with our leadership. I am hopeful that we
can put together as a party position a budget that balances the budget over
a 7-year period and that mandates tax cuts contained in the contract. But,
if our leadership is not ready to bring that budget forward, if they cannot
muster the courage to control Government spending to make it possible, I
will muster that courage, and will offer a substitute and give my colleagues
the opportunity to join me, and to join America in that process.<p>
   Finally, let me say, Mr. President, I simply want to remind my colleagues
that the Contract With America was in fact signed by House Members, but
there are two additional points. First, it was not distinctly different from
the ''Seven More in '94'' contract that our candidates agreed to here on the
north front of the Capitol. Second, the important part of that contract is
not the fact that the House signed it. The important part of that contract
is that America signed it. The important part of that contract is it was the
document that defined what the 1994 election was all about.<p>
   The question now, the question that will be before us for the next 3
weeks is, Did we simply want to be for dramatic changes in Government at
election time, or are we willing to put our votes where our mouth is? Are we
really more wedded to funding for programs such as public television, or are
we more wedded to letting working people keep more of what they earn? Do we
really believe that Government knows best and that we need not only a $ 1.6
trillion Federal budget but that we need it to grow by 7.5 percent a year
while the family budget is growing at less than half that rate?<p>
   I think that is the decision. I think the answer of every Republican in
the Senate ought to be clear. And that answer ought to be we can change the
status quo, we can limit the growth of Government spending, we can terminate
programs, and we can and will not only balance the budget but let working
families keep more of what they earn to invest in their own children, in
their own businesses and their own future, and that we ought to cut taxes on
American business to provide incentives for people to work, save, and
invest. That is what I am for. I believe that is what America is for.<p>
   I thank the Chair.<p>
I yield the floor.<p>

<title>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION BUDGET</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation</h2>
<i>Number of Cabinet Agencies Would Shrink from 14 to 5</i>
<hr>
<h2>HERITAGE BUDGET PLAN PROPOSES "TOP-TO-BOTTOM" 
REORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
WASHINGTON, APRIL 17, 1995 -- While almost everybody in the 
nation's capital, from President Clinton to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
continues to talk about "reinventing" or slimming down government, The 
Heritage Foundation today offered a comprehensive and detailed plan for 
actually doing so.<p>
The ambitious proposal, released today in draft form, "examines every 
nook and cranny of the $1.6 trillion federal enterprise," a spokesman for 
the prominent think tank said. Every agency and every program within 
each agency was "put to the test."<p>
The Heritage Foundation plan was characterized by Vice President Stuart 
Butler as a "federalism budget" because many responsibilities would be 
transferred to state and local government. In putting the plan together, he 
said, a team of analysts conducted a Peter Drucker-style top-to-bottom 
review of the entire federal government<p>
The plan, according to budget expert Scott Hodge, would: 1) balance the 
federal budget by the year 2000, two years earlier than would have been 
required under the balanced-budget amendment, while providing $152 
billion in tax relief to families with children, business and the elderly; 2) 
end corporate welfare; 3) close down obsolete and wasteful programs, 
strengthen core programs that are legitimate functions of government, 
and transfer functions that "are not proper federal activities" to the states 
or the private sector; and 4) create several new agencies as part of the 
consolidation process.<p>
<center><h3>Medicare, Foreign Aid, Defense</center></h3><p>
To promote economic growth, the Heritage budget plan calls for cutting 
the effective capital gains tax rate in half; allowing businesses the 
equivalent of writing off capital investments in the year in which they are 
made, rather than stretching out the deductions; and creating new 
"Individual Retirement-Plus Accounts," which would provide tax-free 
income upon retirement (though contributions to such accounts would not 
be tax-deductible).<p>
Social Security would not be touched. Medicare, however, would 
undergo major surgery, offering to retirees a variety of medical plans and 
choices, similar to those enjoyed by federal employees and members of 
Congress under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.
Changes and cuts in the foreign-aid program would result in savings of 
$10 billion to $14.6-billion over five years.<p>
In keeping with the Heritage Foundation's view that the first priority of 
the federal government is to defend the nation and secure U.S. interests 
abroad, defense spending would be maintained at current levels, adjusted 
for inflation. This is about $130 billion more than the administration has 
called for over the next five years.<p>
Heritage analysts consistently have argued that the Clinton administration 
has underfunded its own defense plan, known as the "Bottom-Up 
Review," by some $100 billion over five years. The General Accounting 
Office (GAO) has placed the shortfall even higher, at $150 billion.<p>
House and Senate leaders have more or less gone along with the 
administration's funding plans. Heritage Foundation analysts, however, 
believe this is a mistake, arguing that funding at such low levels would 
require the United States to withdraw more forces from Europe or Asia. It 
also would mean leaving the United States vulnerable to ballistic missile 
attack. To fully fund the Bottom-Up Review force, the Heritage budget 
would add the needed $100 billion to the Clinton administration's 
proposed five-year defense budget, plus $30 billion for such new 
initiatives as ballistic-missile defense. (The Heritage Foundation is 
expected to publish its own missile-defense plan next month.)<p>
<center><h3>Top-to-Bottom Structural Reorganization</center></h3><p>
Butler said the Heritage plan would allow U.S. taxpayers to spend far 
more of their own money, rather than sending it to Washington for 
bureaucrats to spend. "The public realizes that the federal government is 
too expensive, mired in debt, and does a poor job of carrying out its core 
functions, while doing many things it shouldn't do. They want this to 
stop. That was the message of both the 1992 and 1994 elections. The 
Clinton administration has proposed nothing that would change 
fundamentally the way government works -- or its cost." What is needed, 
instead, Butler said -- and what The Heritage Foundation will present to 
Congress when the House and Senate return from their recess -- is a plan 
for the kind of "top-to-bottom structural reorganization" many businesses 
have undertaken in recent years.<p>
If the Heritage plan were fully implemented, Butler said, the number of 
Cabinet level departments of government would be reduced from 14 to 
five (Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, State and the 
Treasury). The Departments of Agriculture and Interior would be 
reorganized and reduced to sub-cabinet level independent agencies. The 
Department of Energy's nuclear-weapons programs and veterans 
programs now administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs would 
be shifted to the Department of Defense. <p>
Three major independent agencies -- the Federal Communications 
Commission, Interstate Commerce Commission and Small Business 
Administration -- would disappear entirely. The Departments of 
Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Labor, 
and Transportation -- like Energy and Veterans Affairs -- would be 
closed down, though some of their functions, as part of the overall 
streamlining and consolidation process, would be shifted to the states or 
moved elsewhere within the federal government.<p>
The new agencies proposed by The Heritage Foundation would 
consolidate various functions now scattered throughout the bureaucracy. 
Government research and data-collection functions, for example, would 
be moved from the Census Bureau (part of the slated-for-extinction 
Commerce Department), Bureau of Labor Statistics (Labor Department), 
and other agencies to a new Bureau of National Statistics. According to 
Butler, "An important purpose of this change is to house these functions 
within an agency characterized by a new ethos -- dispassionate data 
collection -- rather than within departments driven by policy-making."
Similarly, various environmental and land-management functions, now 
housed at the Departments of Agriculture and Interior, would be 
consolidated within a new Bureau of Natural Resources.<p>
Total spending reductions over five years would amount to more than 
$750 billion net. There also would be a net saving of $97 billion in 
interest on the national debt by the time the deficit is eliminated in the 
year 2000. (The Heritage Foundation report calculates future spending 
levels three different ways: using l) direct year-to-year spending 
comparisons, 2) government "baseline" spending projections, and 3) 
baseline projections, plus revenue from privatization and asset sales. 
Washington has been using the second method, measuring everything 
against a projected spending baseline.)<p>
<center><h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</center></h3><p>
Unlike the Clinton administration's and other budget proposals now being 
"vetted" in Washington, most of which focus solely on budget 
"functions" and costs, The Heritage Foundation blueprint provides 
Washington with step-by-step instructions on how to make the necessary 
changes.<p>
"It is very easy to say, 'Shut down the Departments of Commerce, 
Education, Energy, Labor, and Transportation and board up their doors.' 
But the process is far more complicated than that, so lawmakers need 
realistic advice on how you actually close down a government agency." 
Butler noted, "Some functions of these departments and the other 
agencies identified for extinction are necessary and proper, and worth 
continuing. The bureaucratic edifices within which these isolated 
programs now operate, however, are totally unnecessary and should be 
eliminated." Butler added that Heritage analysts already have been 
working with congressional task forces on how to conduct "radical 
surgery" on the government.<p>
<center><h3>Federalism, Privatization, Reorganization, Elimination</center></h3><p>
The Heritage budget plan was written by a team of analysts including 
Scott Hodge, Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs, 
Ronald Utt, a visiting fellow and former director of privatization 
programs for the Office of Management and Budget, and Baker Spring, 
Heritage's senior defense policy analyst.<p>
To accomplish the objective of balancing the budget by the year 2002, 
while providing taxpayers with a "fiscal responsibility (tax-cut) 
dividend," the plan would:<p>
Limit the overall rate of increase in federal spending to just over 1 
percent per year. "Capping total spending [increases] ... does not mean 
every program must grow at that rate," Butler said. "It means that, taken 
together, programs cannot exceed that limit. If some high-priority 
programs grow faster," he added, "others must grow more slowly and 
others may have to be terminated." If Congress can't muster the political 
courage to make the cuts needed to stay within the legally binding 
ceiling, a bipartisan spending reduction commission -- similar to the 
military base-closing commission -- would be appointed, rather than 
instituting an across-the-board "sequester."<p>
Transfer to state and local governments programs more appropriately 
carried out at those levels of government. For example, more than 70 
means-tested anti-poverty programs, currently administered by the 
Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health and Human 
Services, and Housing and Urban Development, would be included in a 
new welfare block grant that would be given to the states. The Heritage 
Foundation plan also would transfer most federal lands to the states, 
except for national parks and wilderness areas that are deemed to be "of 
national significance," and end the "earmarking" of funds for local 
transportation and other projects.<p>
Butler explained: "Congress should enact a federal budget that makes 
clear that the first responsibility of the federal government is an adequate 
national defense. Congress then should examine every other program to 
determine whether it is truly national in scope and can be carried out on a 
national scale only by the federal government. Funding for all agencies 
and programs that don't meet this test, such as many education, welfare, 
health (and) transportation ... programs should be transferred to the states, 
or the money returned to the people as federal tax relief."<p>
Privatize all commercial activities of government. The proposal calls for 
the sale of the following federal assets: the $200 billion federal direct-
loan portfolio; Amtrak; the federal Power Marketing Administrations; the 
hydroelectric dams currently operated by the Army Corps of Engineers 
and Bureau of Reclamation; most of the National Weather Service; the 
Naval Petroleum Reserve, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Federal Helium 
Reserves, and U.S. Uranium Enrichment Corporation; many real-estate 
holdings; and most of the 1,200 non-defense aircraft owned by the 
government.<p>
Eliminate corporate welfare. The Heritage Foundation budget plan would 
terminate dozens of programs that directly or indirectly subsidize private 
businesses, including all agricultural subsidies and commercial 
agricultural research programs, energy research programs, NASA's 
commercial aeronautic research and development programs, export credit 
guarantee programs, and export enhancement and "market promotion" 
programs. Also headed for the chopping block: Airport Grants-in-Aid 
and Essential Air Service Program (Transportation Department), Bureau 
of Export Administration (Commerce), Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting (independent), Economic Development Administration 
(Commerce), Farmers Home Administration and Farm Credit System 
(Agriculture), International Trade Administration (Commerce), Minority 
Business Development Agency (Commerce), Next Generation High-
Speed Rail Program (Transportation), Small Business Administration 
(independent), and U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (Commerce). 
All government ties and taxpayer guarantees to the Federal Home Loan 
Bank System, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp., and Government National Mortgage Association 
would be terminated.<p>
End programs that don't work, "have become outmoded or obsolete, that 
duplicate other programs, or that do not involve legitimate government 
functions."<p>
"Because outmoded, obsolete, or inefficient programs almost never die, 
bureaus, agencies and programs that duplicate each other's function's 
have sprung up all over the government," Butler observed. Vice President 
Al Gore's National Performance Review, for example, noted that 14 
separate government departments and agencies spend $24 billion a year 
on 150 employment and training programs; 11 different federal 
departments and agencies administer 340 separate programs for families 
and children; and the Department of Commerce shares its mission with at 
least 7l federal departments, agencies and offices.<p>
The Heritage Foundation budget plan would close down many of the 
government's 1,200 "independent commissions, councils and boards," 
would sharply reduce the size and scope of the 170-year-old Army Corps 
of Engineers, and would close down, among other agencies, the 85-year-
old Bureau of Mines (Interior Department), 81-year-old Agricultural 
Extension Service (Agriculture), the 60-year-old Soil Conservation 
Service (Agriculture: now called the Natural Resource Conservation 
Service), the 60-year-old Rural Electrification Administration 
(Agriculture: now called the Rural Utilities Service); the 70-year-old 
National Fertilizer Development Center (part of the independent 
Tennessee Valley Authority: now called the TVA Environmental 
Research Center), and the 108-year-old Interstate Commerce 
Commission (independent).<p>
Butler said, "This is not the time to be timid. The federal government 
now consists of layer upon layer of bureaucratic waste, duplication and 
inefficiency. This was documented during the Reagan era by the Grace 
Commission and more recently by Vice President Gore's National 
Performance Review. "In addition, the federal bureaucracy has been 
assigned, or has assigned to itself, numerous tasks that are best left to the 
states, the private sector, or individuals.<p>
"Rather than tinkering at the margins, Washington needs to act with 
intelligence and resolve. We hope the Heritage budget plan will inspire 
the Congress and White House to accept the challenge."<p>

<H2>President Reagan's Second Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Monday, January 21st, 1985 <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker
O'Neill, Senator Dole, Reverend Clergy, members of my family and
friends, and my fellow citizens:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one
who, for a time, has been absent--Senator John Stennis.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and welcome back.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is, however, one who is not with us today: Representative
Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night. I wonder if we could
all join in a moment of silent prayer. (Moment of silent prayer.)
Amen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great
honor that you have bestowed on me. I will do my utmost to be
deserving of your trust.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we the
people have celebrated this historic occasion. When the first
President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible,
he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw,
untamed wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union
of 13 States. Today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States.
We have lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid
of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed
to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed. And yet
we stand together as we did two centuries ago.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I took this oath four years ago, I did so in a time of economic
stress. Voices were raised saying we had to look to our past for
the greatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are
not given to looking backward. In this blessed land, there is
always a better tomorrow.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Four years ago, I spoke to you of a new beginning and we have
accomplished that. But in another sense, our new beginning is
a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when,
for the first time in history, government, the people said, was
not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we
the people allow it to have.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
That system has never failed us, but, for a time, we failed the
system. We asked things of government that government was not
equipped to give. We yielded authority to the National Government
that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to
the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us
of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine
that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down
and the number of unemployed increase.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By 1980, we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with
all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent
with an orderly society.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human
progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And we were right to believe that. Tax rates have been reduced,
inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than
ever before in our history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive.
But there are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until
every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity
as our birthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great
Republic, and we'll meet this challenge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These will be years when Americans have restored their confidence
and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work,
and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy
was finally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere
efforts at meaningful arms reduction, rebuilding our defenses,
our economy, and developing new technologies, and helped preserve
peace in a troubled world; when Americans courageously supported
the struggle for liberty, self-government, and free enterprise
throughout the world, and turned the tide of history away from
totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My fellow citizens, our Nation is poised for greatness. We must
do what we know is right and do it with all our might. Let history
say of us, &quot;These were golden years--when the American Revolution
was reborn, when freedom gained new life, when America reached
for her best.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our two-party system has served us well over the years, but never
better than in those times of great challenge when we came together
not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a
common cause.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a
Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group
who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start
the world over again, left us an important lesson. They had become
political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then years
later, when both were retired, and age had softened their anger,
they began to speak to each other again through letters. A bond
was reestablished between those two who had helped create this
government of ours.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence,
they both died. They died on the same day, within a few hours
of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives,
Jefferson wrote: &quot;It carries me back to the times when, beset
with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the
same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right
to self-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some
wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless
... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, with heart and hand, let us stand as one today: One people
under God determined that our future shall be worthy of our past.
As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our
past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women,
by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling
demands of a bloated Federal Establishment. You elected us in
1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don't believe
you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight
months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the
drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress.
We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment;
reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its
interference in people's lives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair, and bring
the rates down for all who work and earn. We must think anew and
move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can
find work; so the least among us shall have an equal chance to
achieve the greatest things--to be heroes who heal our sick, feed
the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world
a better place.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The time has come for a new American emancipation--a great national
drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of
enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends,
together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more
productive, fulfilled and united people, and a stronger America--an
America that will lead the technological revolution, and also
open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature,
music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes,
will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But
an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought
us to a time of reckoning. We have come to a turning point, a
moment for hard decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff
a question, and now I put the same question to all of you: If
not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us
going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget.
We can then begin reducing the national debt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing
government program spending for the next year. Beyond that, we
must take further steps to permanently control Government's power
to tax and spend. We must act now to protect future generations
from Government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax
them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional
for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government
takes in.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have already started returning to the people and to State and
local governments responsibilities better handled by them. Now,
there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social
compassion. But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency
and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged.
And here a growing economy and support from family and community
offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way
of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and,
yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and
made self-sufficient.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And there is another area where the Federal Government can play
a part. As an older American, I remember a time when people of
different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred
and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. There
is no story more heartening in our history than the progress that
we have made toward the &quot;brotherhood of man&quot; that God
intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no turning back
or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant
with opportunity for all our citizens.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let us resolve that we the people will build an American opportunity
society in which all of us--white and black, rich and poor, young
and old--will go forward together arm in arm. Again, let us remember
that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner
of the Earth, we are all Americans pledged to carry on this last,
best hope of man on Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which
we should put on our National Government. Now let me turn to a
task which is the primary responsibility of National Government--the
safety and security of our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer
for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace will not
come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There
are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and
freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest
military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome
offensive weapons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have made progress in restoring our defense capability. But
much remains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor
any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities
to remain free, secure, and at peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost
of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And
this we are trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union.
We are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear
weapons. We seek, instead, to reduce their number. We seek the
total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of
the Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat
of mutual assured destruction; if either resorted to the use of
nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one
who had started it. Is there either logic or morality in believing
that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people,
our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security
shield that would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their
target. It wouldn't kill people, it would destroy weapons. It
wouldn't militarize space, it would help demilitarize the arsenals
of Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet
with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the
world of the threat of nuclear destruction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all
around us. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies
in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march,
and nowhere more so than our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of
the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. People,
worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those
inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is
our best ally.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And it is the world's only hope, to conquer poverty and preserve
peace. Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against
its dark allies of oppression and war. Every victory for human
freedom will be a victory for world peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and
powerful in its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with
our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion,
we look forward to a world rich in possibilities. And all this
because we have worked and acted together, not as members of political
parties, but as Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, we live in a world that is lit by lightning. So much
is changing and will change, but so much endures, and transcends
time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
History is a ribbon, always unfurling; history is a journey. And
as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before
us. We stand together again at the steps of this symbol of our
democracy--or we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't
gotten so cold. Now we are standing inside this symbol of our
democracy. Now we hear again the echoes of our past: a general
falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely
President paces the darkened halls, and ponders his struggle to
preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement
to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the
song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic,
daring, decent, and fair. That's our heritage; that is our song.
We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are
together as of old, as we raise our voices to the God who is the
Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to hold
us close as we fill the world with our sound--sound in unity,
affection, and love--one people under God, dedicated to the dream
of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon
now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and may God bless America.

<H2>President Reagan's First Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Tuesday, January 20th, 1981. <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President
Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill,
Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today,
this is a solemn and most momentous occasion; and yet, in the
history of our Nation, it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly
transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely
takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop
to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the
world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing
less than a miracle.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you
did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in
the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we
are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system
which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any
other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining
the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The business of our nation goes forward. These United States are
confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We
suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations
in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes
thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income
elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of
our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, causing human
misery and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a
fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful
achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public
spending. For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging
our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience
of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous
social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our
means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should
we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that
same limitation?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there
be no misunderstanding--we are going to begin to act, beginning
today.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.
They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will
go away. They will go away because we, as Americans, have the
capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs
to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our
problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society
has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government
by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the
people. But if no one among us is capable of governing himself,
then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All
of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.
The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled
out to pay a higher price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We hear much of special interest groups. Our concern must be for
a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It
knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions,
and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and
women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and
our factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us
when we are sick--professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers,
clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. They are, in short, &quot;We
the people,&quot; this breed called Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous,
growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans,
with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America
back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending
inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway
living costs. All must share in the productive work of this &quot;new
beginning&quot; and all must share in the bounty of a revived
economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of
our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous
America at peace with itself and the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has
a government--not the other way around. And this makes us special
among the nations of the Earth. Our Government has no power except
that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse
the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond
the consent of the governed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal
establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between
the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved
to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded
that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States
created the Federal Government.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention
to do away with government. It is, rather, to make it work--work
with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.
Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster
productivity, not stifle it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved
so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because
here, in this land, we unleashed the energy and individual genius
of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom
and the dignity of the individual have been more available and
assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this
freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling
to pay that price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are
proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that
result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It
is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit
ourselves to small dreams. We are not, as some would have us believe,
doomed to an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that
will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that
will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy
at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us
renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let
us renew our faith and our hope.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that
we are in a time when there are no heroes just don't know where
to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory
gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed
all of us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a
counter--and they are on both sides of that counter. There are
entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who
create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity. They are individuals
and families whose taxes support the Government and whose voluntary
gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their
patriotism is quiet but deep. Their values sustain our national
life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have used the words &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot; in
speaking of these heroes. I could say &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot;
because I am addressing the heroes of whom I speak--you, the citizens
of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are
going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration,
so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your
makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen,
and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when
they are sick, and provide opportunities to make them self-sufficient
so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is
an unequivocal and emphatic &quot;yes.&quot; To paraphrase Winston
Churchill, I did not take the oath I have just taken with the
intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest
economy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that
have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be
taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels
of government. Progress may be slow--measured in inches and feet,
not miles--but we will progress. Is it time to reawaken this industrial
giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten
our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities,
and on these principles, there will be no compromise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have
been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph
Warren, President of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow
Americans, &quot;Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired
of.... On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide
the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the
liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy
of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness
and liberty for ourselves, our children and our children's children.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen
as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again
be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who
do not now have freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen
our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment.
We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually
beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose
on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries,
they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of
the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it;
we will not surrender for it--now or ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance
for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When
action is required to preserve our national security, we will
act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be,
knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having
to use that strength.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the
arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral
courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries
in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans
do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism
and prey upon their neighbors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being
held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a
nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free.
It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration
Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the first time in history that this ceremony has been
held, as you have been told, on this West Front of the Capitol.
Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this
city's special beauty and history. At the end of this open mall
are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man: George
Washington, Father of our country. A man of humility who came
to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary
victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial
to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with
his eloquence.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the
Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning
of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on
the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery
with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or
Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price
that has been paid for our freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero I
spoke of earlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood,
The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno and halfway around the world
on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir,
and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under one such marker lies a young man--Martin Treptow--who left
his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with
the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was
killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy
artillery fire.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf
under the heading, &quot;My Pledge,&quot; he had written these
words: &quot;America must win this war. Therefore, I will work,
I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully
and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended
on me alone.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind
of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others
were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort,
and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in
our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that together,
with God's help, we can and will resolve the problems which now
confront us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans.
God bless you, and thank you.

<H2>Address at the U.S.-French Ceremony at Omaha Beach on the
40th Anniversary of D-Day.</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, June 6, 1984. Normandy, France. <HR>

<P>
We stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw
and felt the worst of war. Men bled and died here for a few feet
of - or inches of sand, as bullets and shellfire cut through their
ranks. About them, General Omar Bradley later said, &quot;Every
man who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero.&quot;
<P>
Some who survived the battle of June 6, 1944, are here today.
Others who hoped to return never did.
<P>
&quot;Someday, Lis, I'll go back,&quot; said Private First Class
Peter Robert Zannata, of the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion, and
first assault wave to hit Omaha Beach. &quot;I'll go back, and
I'll see it all again. I'll see the beach, the barricades, and
the graves.&quot;
<P>
Those words of Private Zanatta come to us from his daughter, Lisa
Zanatta Henn, in a heart-rending story about the event her father
spoke of so often. &quot;In his words, the Normandy invasion would
change his life forever,&quot; she said. She tells some of his
stories of World War II but says of her father, &quot;the story
to end all stories was D-Day.&quot;
<P>
&quot;He made me feel the fear of being on the boat waiting to
land. I can smell the ocean and feel the sea sickness. I can see
the looks on his fellow soldiers' faces-the fear, the anguish,
the uncertainty of what lay ahead. And when they landed, I can
feel the strength and courage of the men who took those first
steps through the tide to what must have surely looked like instant
death.&quot;
<P>
Private Zannata's daughter wrote to me, &quot;I don't know how
or why I can feel this emptiness, this fear, or this determination,
but I do. Maybe it's the bond I had with my father. All I know
is that it brings tears to my eyes to think about my father as
a 20-year old boy having to face that beach.&quot;
<P>
The anniversary of D-Day was always special to her family. And
like all the families of those who went to war, she describes
how she came to realize her own father's survival was a miracle:
&quot;So many men died. I know that my father watched many of
his friends be killed. I know that he must have died inside a
little each time. But his explanation to me was, `You did what
you had to do, and you kept on going.&quot;
<P>
When men like Private Zannata and all our Allied forces stormed
the beaches of Normandy 40 years ago they came not as conquerors,
but as liberators. When these troops swept across the French countryside
and into the forests of Belgium and Luxembourg they came not to
take, but to return what had been wrongfully seized. When our
forces marched into Germany they came not to prey on a brave and
defeated people, but to nurture the seeds of democracy among those
who yearned to bee free again.
<P>
We salute them today. But, Mr. President [Francois Mitterand of
France], we also salute those who, like yourself, were already
engaging the enemy inside your beloved country-the French Resistance.
Your valiant struggle for France did so much to cripple the enemy
and spur the advance of the armies of liberation. The French Forces
of the Interior will forever personify courage and national spirit.
They will be a timeless inspiration to all who are free and to
all who would be free.
<P>
Today, in their memory, and for all who fought here, we celebrate
the triumph of democracy. We reaffirm the unity of democratic
people who fought a war and then joined with the vanquished in
a firm resolve to keep the peace.
<P>
From a terrible war we learned that unity made us invincible;
now, in peace, that same unity makes us secure. We sought to bring
all freedom-loving nations together in a community dedicated to
the defense and preservation of our sacred values. Our alliance,
forged in the crucible of war, tempered and shaped by the realities
of the post-war world, has succeeded. In Europe, the threat has
been contained, the peace has been kept.
<P>
Today, the living here assembled-officials, veterans, citizens-are
a tribute to what was achieved here 40 years ago. This land is
secure. We are free. These things are worth fighting and dying
for.
<P>
Lisa Zannata Henn began her story by quoting her father, who promised
that he would return to Normandy. She ended with a promise to
her father, who died 8 years ago of cancer: &quot;I'm going there,
Dad, and I'll see the beaches and the barricades and the monuments.
I'll see the graves, and I'll put flowers there just like you
wanted to do. I'll never forget what you went through, Dad, nor
will I let any one else forget. And, Dad, I'll always be proud.&quot;
<P>
Through the words of his loving daughter, who is here with us
today, a D-Day veteran has shown us the meaning of this day far
better than any President can. It is enough to say about Private
Zannata and all the men of honor and courage who fought beside
him four decades ago: We will always remember. We will always
be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.
<P>
Thank you.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc142t1.gif">Table:</a> China's SU-27: Challenging U.S. Air Superiority in Asia





<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. military strength in Asia underpins deterrence and U.S. leadership in Asia. If the two Koreas were to reunify, American ground troops would likely be reduced, and American air power in Asia would become much more important in maintaining deterrence. China's recent purchase from Russia of co-production rights for the Sukhoi SU-27 <I>Flanker</I> jet fighter represents a significant step in Beijing's ambition to build a world-class air force. Currently, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is saddled with thousands of obsolete Soviet-era combat aircraft and is deficient in advanced munitions, electronic warfare systems, logistics, and training. The SU-27 will be China's first jet fighter with capabilities roughly equivalent to current U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates that China may obtain up to 300 SU-27s. If successful in absorbing the Sukhoi's technology and production know-how, China eventually could challenge American air superiority in Asia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To sustain deterrence in Asia, the U.S. must proceed with programs to build advanced fighter aircraft and munitions that will guarantee American air superiority in Asia. Specifically, the U.S. should:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b> This is the only U.S. jet fighter currently in development that promises a clear level of superiority to the SU-27.

<p><li><b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b> The Clinton defense budget puts at risk the Navy's ability to project power in Asia. Should budget pressures force a reduction in carrier battle groups, the Navy may be required to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier, now homeported in Japan, to non-Asian trouble spots for increasing periods of time, thereby reducing the U.S. deterrent in Asia.

<p><li><b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b> With the Navy's F-14 Tomcat to be phased out by 2010, the Navy will need a fighter that is clearly superior to the Russian SU-27.

<p><li><b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b> The U.S. and its allies should have such a system to counter current Russian helmet-sighted missiles sold to China.

<p><li><b>Develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b> The danger is that the U.S. could lose sales to future European or Russian aircraft.

<p><li><b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.</b> Russia and Israel should be told that they are helping to accelerate a military modernization program that could destabilize Asia.
</ul>
<p>

<b>CHINA'S SU-27 DEAL</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February, it was reported that Moscow and Beijing had reached agreement on a $2.2 billion deal for China to begin co-producing the Sukhoi SU-27.<sup>1</sup>  The Chinese designation for this aircraft will be the J-11. China had purchased an initial batch of 24 SU-27s in 1991 for about $1 billion. These aircraft were reported to have been delivered by the end of 1992 and are based at Wuhu Air Base, about 150 miles east of Shanghai.<sup>2</sup>  In May of last year, it was reported that China had purchased a second batch of 22 aircraft as a prelude to the larger co-production deal.<sup>3</sup>  Former Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said the second batch of SU-27s was delivered in April.<sup>4</sup>  These aircraft will be based at Suixi Air Base in Southern China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Estimates vary as to the final number of SU-27s that China may purchase or co-produce. According to one report, the first co-production contract would enable the Chinese to produce 40 to 60 aircraft from Russian-made components over the next three years.<sup>5</sup>  According to another source, China may obtain a total of 72 to 78 SU-27s from this deal, enough to equip three regiments of the PLAAF, followed by co-production after five years.<sup>6</sup>  Yet another source states that China will purchase 120 sets of prefabricated components for assembly in China, with indigenous production phased in later.<sup>7</sup>  Finally, a Pentagon intelligence assessment concludes that China eventually may obtain as many as 300 SU-27s.<sup>8</sup>  In any event, it is reasonable to assume that the total could exceed 100; and if China masters full co-production, the total (to include Chinese-designed variants) could exceed several hundred.
<p>

<b>COMPARING THE SU-27 WITH CURRENT U.S. FIGHTERS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because the SU-27 will play a significant role in modernizing the PLAAF, it is useful to compare it to existing U.S. fighter aircraft. Some key performance parameters are listed in Table 1. Since entering service in 1986, the SU-27 has been the best fourth-generation air-superiority fighter in service with the Russian Air Force.<sup>9</sup>

The SU-27 is roughly comparable to the F-15C, the best U.S. Air Force fighter. The F-15C is the only U.S. fighter used almost exclusively for air-superiority missions. Over 400 F-15Cs have been purchased by the United States Air Force, and 108 are deployed in U.S. Pacific Command.<sup>10</sup>  This aircraft accounted for 36 of the 39 USAF air-to-air victories in the Gulf War. The F-15C will remain the principal U.S. Air Force air-superiority fighter until replaced by the Lockheed-Martin F-22 later in the next decade.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-15C and the SU-27 have comparable ranges, though the SU-27 can carry ten missiles while the F-15C can carry eight. The F-15's ability to maneuver is about the same as the SU-27's.<sup>11</sup>  Both are capable of difficult maneuvers that stress the airframe to nine times the weight of the aircraft. The F-15C uses the AN/ANG-70 radar, which can detect targets about 100 miles away and can track and engage multiple targets. The SU-27's Phazatron N001 radar has a search range of over 62 miles with the ability to track 10 targets and engage two. However, unlike the F-15, the SU-27 is equipped with an infrared search and tracking (IRST) system with a range of from 15 to 31 miles that directs gun and missile systems.<sup>12</sup>  This system allows the <I>Flanker</I> to track and engage targets while turning off its radar, decreasing the chances of detection by opposing aircraft.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Grumman F-14, the U.S. Navy's primary air-superiority fighter, is a better all-around combat interception system than the SU-27. Were it not for the F-14's swing-wing, the SU-27 might be much more maneuverable that the F-14. The F-14 can carry six long-range or medium-range and two short-range air-to-air missiles (AAMs), but its unrefueled range is less than the SU-27's. With the added flexibility of a two-man crew, the F-14A's AN/AWG-9 weapons control system can detect targets out to 190 miles, track 24, and engage six at long range with its 100-mile-range AIM-54 <I>Phoenix</I> missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Fourteen Navy squadrons are now equipped with F-14As, including two deployed with the Japan-based Seventh Fleet. The F-14A's principal weakness has been its Pratt and Whitney TF-30 turbofan engines, which are prone to stalling during hard maneuvers. This has led to engine failures and many crashes. Consequently, certain combat maneuvers are now restricted until these aircraft are modified with updated control systems. All F-14As are due to be retired from service by 2004. Over 90 F-14Bs, which now equip five Navy squadrons, have been fitted with more powerful and responsive General Electric F110 engines. The Navy also has acquired 56 F-14Ds with the F110 engines and more powerful radar combat systems. Three squadrons are outfitted with the F-14D. The F-14B and D are expected to serve through the next decade. A program to build a successor to the F-14, the A/F-X, was canceled by the Clinton Administration in 1993.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Later in the next decade, as the F-14 is being retired from U.S. Navy inventory, the numerically most important U.S. Navy fighter will be the F/A-18E/F. The Navy expects to purchase over 1,000 of these aircraft by 2015. They are designed to replace the current C/D version of the F/A-18, the F-14, and the long-range ground-attack Grumman A-6 <I>Intruder</I>.<sup>13</sup>  Compared to both versions of the F/A-18, however, the SU-27 has an advantage in unrefueled range and may be more maneuverable due to its more powerful engines and larger wing. The F/A-18E/F is about 25 percent larger than the C/D; has more powerful engines and a longer range because of larger external fuel tanks; and is to be equipped presently with an AN/AGP-73 multi-mode radar, which also equips the most current production model of the F/A-18C. More advanced radar upgrades already are planned for the F/A-18E.<sup>14</sup>  In terms of offensive and defensive electronic systems, the F-18E/F will be superior to the SU-27.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-16 also is a multi-role fighter designed for ground-attack as well as air-defense missions. It is the most numerous combat aircraft in the U.S. Air Force, currently numbering over 1,200 aircraft. Forces with the U.S. Pacific Command possess 138 F-16Cs, the major combat aircraft for South Korea. An earlier version, the F-16A, is the most capable combat aircraft in the air forces of Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, and soon of Taiwan. Shorter in unrefueled range than the SU-27, the F-16C carries only six medium-range or short-range AAMs. The F-16 is a single-engine aircraft, while the SU-27, F-15, F-14, and F/A-18 are twin-engine aircraft with greater survivability in combat. The F-16 is roughly comparable to the SU-27 in maneuverability; both airframes can be stressed to nine times their weight.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Northrop F-5E <I>Tiger II</I> currently is the most numerous combat aircraft for Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The F-5E is no match for the SU-27 in maneuverability, range, or weapons load. Several companies offer upgrades for the F-5's radar and combat systems. These upgrades can ease pilot workload and increase search and detection capability, but they cannot alter the F-5's inferior aerodynamic performance. As a consequence, prosperous Asian countries are acquiring new, more capable aircraft like the F-16 and F-18.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>The U.S. Technology Advantage.</b> Compared to the SU-27, all current U.S. combat aircraft benefit from better cockpit design and better avionics. For example, the U.S. practice of placing most combat relevant information on a large Head-Up Display (HUD) which combines the functions of a monitor and a weapons sight, or on large, easy-to-read flat-panel displays on the instrument panel, increases combat potential by allowing pilots to spend more time watching for opposing aircraft than tending instruments. Better U.S. aircraft computers and cockpit displays enable U.S. pilots to evaluate information more quickly and accurately. By contrast, similar Russian systems used in early models of the SU-27 are less advanced. American aircraft also are equipped with better countermeasures against radar and missile threats. These include electronic jamming systems and decoys that use several methods to confuse attacking missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters have long benefited from a well-developed system of in-air refueling which extends range or combat patrol time. The U.S. also benefits from advanced airborne warning and control (AWACS) aircraft, such as the E-2C <I>Hawkeye</I> and E-3 <I>Sentry</I>. In addition, the three services employ a range of electronic intelligence aircraft that warn fighters of enemy radar and missile defenses. The Navy's EA-6B is designed to jam enemy radars, while the F-16 HTS, F/A-18, and EA-6B can use anti-radar missiles to destroy enemy air defenses.

<b>THE CHINESE AIR FORCE AND THE CHALLENGE OF THE SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The acquisition of the SU-27 and its production rights marks a major turn for the Chinese Air Force. Nevertheless, this service is beset with major weaknesses. The foremost is that the PLAAF currently is saddled with over 2,000 aircraft (including MiG-19s, MiG-21s, and TU-16s) of 1950s-era Soviet design comparable to outdated U.S. fighters like the F-100, F-8, and B-47. These aircraft are no match for current U.S. jet fighters. In addition, the Chinese Air Force lacks the capability to refuel its combat aircraft during flight, and this shortens their range. It also is bereft of AWACS aircraft that manage air battles, fire-and-forget long-range air-to-air missiles, anti-radar missiles to attack enemy air defenses, and precision-guided munitions (PGMs) like laser-guided bombs. These systems were critical to U.S. air superiority during the Persian Gulf War.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The PLAAF compares poorly to the USAF and some Asian air forces in areas of training and maintenance. A RAND Corporation study issued last year concludes that Chinese Air Force pilots do not fly as often as their U.S. counterparts.<sup>15</sup>  Chinese pilots typically fly 100 hours a year, while U.S. pilots train more than 200 hours per year. Chinese air combat tactics resemble old Soviet-style tactics that stress tight ground control of aircraft.<sup>16</sup>  PLAAF commanders place a high priority on flight safety, and this reduces pilots' initiative and inhibits the utilization of aircraft to their fullest capabilities. While the PLAAF is beginning to utilize "Aggressor" squadrons which specialize in adversarial combat tactics in an attempt to raise tactical skills proficiency, it remains to be seen whether these new training squadrons will be effective. The PLAAF also faces another severe problem:  a lack of spare parts. One of the reasons for this is that production standards vary between differing aircraft and engine manufacturers, inhibiting interchangability of parts between aircraft and engines of the same type.<sup>17</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

RAND questioned whether China can afford the SU-27 as well as indigenous aircraft programs, pointing to recent reforms that have devalued China's currency, thereby reducing PLA purchasing power.<sup>18</sup>  However, the actual size of China's defense budget is unknown. Official figures typically fail to include all military-related expenditures and earnings from PLA-controlled businesses. For example, while the official 1994 PLA defense budget figure was $6 billion, the Washington-based Defense Budget Project estimates that it could range between $92 billion and $143 billion.<sup>19</sup>  A higher budget such as this increases the possibility that the PLA could afford multiple new aircraft programs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The RAND study estimated that China would have only 70 SU-27s in the year 2005.<sup>20</sup>  The SU-27 co-production agreement suggests that China has placed a greater emphasis on acquiring higher numbers of this aircraft in addition to its production technology. The PLA appears to want a phased transition to full co-production, preceded by domestic assembly of a large number of aircraft from major components fabricated in Russia. Co-production of the SU-27 will be difficult for the Chinese because this aircraft incorporates technologies the Chinese cannot yet produce. But PLA aircraft manufacturers will benefit from advanced Russian production techniques and from the presence of Russian technicians, who will assist SU-27 assembly and eventual production.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Air Force Difficulties with the SU-27.</b> Integrating the SU-27 into its inventory will not be easy for the PLAAF. The Chinese Air Force has had difficulty maintaining the SU-27 and was not prepared for its additional cost. Moreover, some runways are not capable of handling this heavier fighter aircraft.<sup>21</sup>  However, the SU-27 is being used in exercises. In August 1995, Chinese SU-27s approached the Senkaku Islands north of Taiwan, which are claimed by China, Japan, and Taiwan. And in March 1996, the SU-27 flew in major military exercises intended to intimidate Taiwan on the eve of its presidential election. The SU-27 possibly will be seen more frequently over the South China Sea, flying from Suixi Air Base in South China. From Wuhu and Suixi Bases, the SU-27 can reach Taiwan, many disputed areas in the South China Sea, and U.S. forces based on Okinawa (see map). Despite early difficulties in tactics and training, as well as enduring PLAAF institutional constraints, it is entirely possible that as more SU-27s enter service, the PLAAF will learn how to exploit this system to its fullest capabilities some time in the next decade.

OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAY ASSIST CHINA'S AIR FORCE MODERNIZATION

	</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Advanced military technology from Russia and Israel plays a major role in China's effort to modernize its military forces. This is especially true for the PLAAF. Russia in particular is viewed by China as a potential source for many systems and technologies that comprise a modern, all-weather, multi-mission air force. Advanced air-to-air missiles, precision-guided munitions, radar aircraft, and electronic countermeasures are all on China's shopping list. For now, Russia appears to be more interested in profit than in any potential threat to its interests arising from sales to China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advantage <i>Archer</i>.</b> The SU-27 is equipped with a series of advanced Russian missiles that in some cases exceed or equal U.S. missile capabilities. The PLAAF is the only air force in Asia to possess the Russian R-73 (NATO codename:  AA-11 <i>Archer</i>) air-to-air missile. China is believed to have an early version of the <i>Archer </i>(M1) and is known to have used it against parachute flares during March 1996 exercises near Taiwan. The AA-11 is the first effective "helmet-sighted" air-to-air missile to be employed anywhere. With this missile, a pilot can aim his weapon by turning his head, and does not have to line up his plane with the target, which has been the main practice in aerial combat since World War I. The M1 version can be fired 45 degrees off the aircraft's forward line-of-direction, or off-boresight, to a range of 12.4 miles (see chart).<sup>22</sup>  The M2 version of the AA-11 can be fired up to 60 degrees off-boresight and has a range of 18.6 miles.<sup>23</sup>  In targeting aircraft beyond visual range, the AA-11 can be cued by the <i>Flanker's </i>infrared tracking system.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the hands of a capable pilot, the <i>Archer </i>conveys a decisive margin for victory. During 1994 air combat exercises between German and U.S. aircraft, MiG-29s of the German Air Force armed with the less capable version of the <i>Archer </i>had a clear advantage over U.S. F-16s armed with <i>Sidewinder</i>.<sup>24</sup>  Even though the F-16 was able to outmaneuver the MiG in 60 percent of the exercise engagements, the MiG already had "fired" its <i>Archer</i>, meaning the F-16 most likely was defeated.<sup>25</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. is not expected to field a helmet-sighted thrust-vectored AAM for at least six years. The AIM-9M <i>Sidewinder</i>, the most modern U.S. short-range air-to-air missile -- which lacks a helmet sight -- can acquire targets only 27.5 degrees off the forward line-of-sight and has a range of only 4.8 miles. American defense officials assert that the lack of a helmet-sighted missile is compensated for by the 32-mile-range Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM). This missile, called the AIM-120, is guided by its own radar, allowing the pilot to break aircraft radar contact with the target and begin evasion. This was not the case with earlier U.S. radar-guided missiles. U.S. officials argue that the AIM-120 confers much of the same tactical flexibility as the <i>Archer</i>.<sup>26</sup>  However, the U.S. still has some difficulty in exploiting the long range of the AIM-120. For one thing, it has problems with identifying targets.<sup>27</sup>  Moreover, this missile cannot be used by the F-16A or the F-5E. While U.S. fighters in Asia have the AIM-120, so far only South Korea and Thailand are approved to buy it. Equipped with AIM-120, the F-15, F-14, F-16, and F/A-18 all have a fighting chance against the SU-27. But the Russians also have their AIM-120 equivalent in the AA-12. This missile could be marketed to China in the future, and apparently has been offered for sale to the U.S.<sup>28</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China also could acquire newer, more advanced Russian missiles and precision-guided munitions. For example, the Kh-17 (NATO codename:  AS-17 <i>Krypton</i>) missile has multiple versions that are designed to attack ships and AWACS radar aircraft at long range. The U.S. Navy is evaluating this missile for possible use as a target to simulate future threats for naval missile defense systems. One version of this missile is credited with a 125-mile range, and all versions are capable of flying at almost three times the speed of sound.<sup>29</sup>  U.S. Naval Intelligence also is concerned about a new 200-mile-range AAM designed to attack AWACS and other long-range radar aircraft.<sup>30</sup>  Russia also produces a series of laser-guided and television-guided bombs that could arm future variants of the SU-27 produced by China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Russian Technology and China's SU-27s.</b> Russia now plans to market advanced versions of the SU-27 to China, as it already has to India. There are reports that a deal for China to purchase the more advanced SU-30 broke down over financing disagreements.<sup>31</sup>  The SU-30 is a two-seat dedicated attack variant of the SU-27 with more advanced attack systems that allow for delivery of precision-guided munitions.<sup>32</sup>  Moscow and Beijing also may have discussed Chinese co-production of the SU-35.<sup>33</sup>  The SU-35 features a better cockpit display, better missile fire-control systems, and forward horizontal control surfaces that boost maneuverability. According to Lt. General George Muellner, Principal Deputy to the Air Force Assistant Secretary, the SU-35's "missile fire control system is as good or better than the F-15."<sup>34</sup>  Sukhoi unveiled last year a variant of the SU-35 with thrust-vectored engines, called the SU-37, which Russian pilots claim will be "10-times" better in close-in dogfights than unmodified fighters.<sup>35</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>AWACS and Aerial Refueling.</b> A number of reports indicate China also is seeking other "force-multipliers" the U.S. has long utilized, like AWACS and air-refueling capabilities. Russian AWACS aircraft and Israel's <i>Phalcon </i>early-warning aircraft appear to be on Beijing's shopping list.<sup>36</sup>  In a reported $250 million deal with China, Israel will put its <i>Phalcon </i>200-mile-range airborne early warning radar on a Russian Il-76 transport aircraft.<sup>37</sup>  This aircraft may also carry advanced Israeli electronic sensing and intelligence systems. China is reported to have modified up to five of its H-6 bombers to refuel J-8II <i>Finback </i>fighters -- the most advanced fighter China currently produces. This extends the range of the J-8II from 430 to over 630 miles. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates China may convert up to 20 H-6 bombers into air-to-air refueling aircraft.<sup>38</sup>  China's SU-27s are not modified for air-to-air refueling, but this capability could be acquired later.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is using Russian technology to upgrade the J-8II with modern radar and engines which give the aircraft greater combat capability.<sup>39</sup>  An upgraded version of this aircraft, the J-8II M, was test-flown at the end of March.<sup>40</sup> There are about 200 J-8s in the Chinese Naval Air Force and Air Force. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is co-developing the FC-1 lightweight fighter with Pakistan which also may use a Russian engine radar and avionics, or a European radar.<sup>41</sup>This aircraft may be slightly less maneuverable than the F-16, and China initially may buy 100 copies. The FC-1 also could be marketed as a low-cost successor to aircraft such as the F-5E and Mig-21, which continue to be used widely in less-developed countries.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Israeli Assistance and China's J-10 Advanced Fighter Program.</b> Israel maintains a quiet but significant military technology relationship with China. Its largest military program with China involves the development of the J-10 advanced fighter aircraft, modeled on Israel's <i>Lavi </i>fighter that was canceled in 1987.<sup>42</sup>  Russian radar and engines also may feature prominently in the J-10 program.<sup>43</sup>  Last year, RAND Corporation analyst Mark Lorell concluded that the J-10 will benefit from the <i>Lavi's </i>"advanced airframe technology, [and] superior avionics.... "<sup>44</sup> China revealed in April a model of the J-10 that was similar to the <i>Lavi</i>. The model also showed the J-10 armed with the PL-10 short-range air-to-air missile, a copy of the Israeli <i>Python </i><i>3 </i>missile. The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimates the J-10 may be more maneuverable than the F/A-18E/F but will carry less sophisticated radar and countermeasures.<sup>45</sup>  The first prototype may fly this year, and China eventually may produce 300 J-10s.<sup>46</sup>  Washington is concerned that U.S.-originated technology from the <i>Lavi </i>has been transferred to China.<sup>47</sup>  Israel is reported to have rebuffed Clinton Administration attempts to end this program.<sup>48</sup>

<b>Could China's SU-27 Go to Sea?</b> Central Military Commission (CMC) Vice President Liu Haquing, a former top PLA Navy commander, believes China needs the ability to dominate the Pacific from Japan down to the Philippines and should be able to fight as far away as Guam.<sup>49</sup>  Acquiring an aircraft carrier to help fulfill this goal appears to be a high PLA priority, and there are reports that at a December meeting of the CMC, President Jaing Zemin endorsed construction of an aircraft carrier as part of the next five-year plan.<sup>50</sup>  However, the cost of a carrier and its attendant defensive and logistic support ships may prove prohibitive for the Chinese Navy. But should China acquire its first aircraft carrier, perhaps in the next decade, the U.S. could face a Chinese sea-borne version of the SU-27. China could follow the example of Russia, which now uses a version of the SU-27 (called the SU-33) as the principal combat aircraft for its sole aircraft carrier, the <I>Admiral Kuznetzov.</I> Unlike the basic version of the SU-27, the SU-33 is equipped for air-to-air refueling, both to receive fuel and to carry a modified fuel tank that can perform in-flight refueling. The SU-33's engines generate enough thrust to allow the use of a ski-jump to get airborne, eliminating the need for complex steam-driven catapults used on U.S. Navy carriers.
<p>

<b>MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF CHINA'S SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

American leadership in Asia rests upon several factors, including a willingness to maintain sufficient military force to deter potential adversaries. In the event Korea is reunified, the U.S. very likely will withdraw ground troops stationed there, leaving the Air Force and the Navy to function as the dominant elements of the U.S. military presence in Asia. The U.S. Pacific Command now relies on about 350 Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighter and attack aircraft deployed in South Korea, Japan, Alaska, and Hawaii. One aircraft carrier, the <I>USS Independence</I>, provides the most flexible component of American airpower in Asia. In March 1996, two carrier battle groups, led by the <i>Independence </i>and the <I>USS Nimitz</I>, were ordered to locations near Taiwan in response to China's threatening military exercises. The U.S. reportedly has decided to halt regular Middle East deployments by the <I>Independence</I> in order to respond to possible scenarios involving North Korea or China.<sup>51</sup>  Such is the importance of U.S. naval power to peace and stability in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Were it to occur, China's acquisition of large numbers of SU-27s would pose a serious challenge to U.S. air superiority. Since World War II, American military commanders have aimed to establish air superiority in order to win battles on the sea and ground. Although China may not today be able to utilize the SU-27 to its fullest extent, it cannot be assumed that this will continue indefinitely. To sustain deterrence, the U.S. needs to maintain its all-around edge in strategy, tactics, and weapons systems.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In particular, aircraft that are "good enough" or slightly superior to the SU-27 do not provide a sufficient margin of superiority to guarantee U.S. dominance in the air. The U.S. must proceed with plans to field advanced combat aircraft superior to the SU-27. Current and future aircraft must be equipped with an effective helmet-sighted missile to counter the <i>Archer</i>. Failure to do so risks allowing the Asian balance of power to shift dangerously in favor of China. To prevent this from happening, Washington should:<p>

<b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b><br>
To ensure U.S. air superiority in Asia, the U.S. should proceed with full funding for the Lockheed-Martin F-22A. This aircraft promises better uses of radar-evading stealth technology, engines that can achieve supersonic speeds without using fuel-guzzling afterburners, thrust vectoring that enhances maneuverability at high speeds, and advanced radar and electronic combat systems. It can carry four short-range air-to-air missiles and up to ten AMRAAM missiles and has a combat range comparable to the F-15C. There are suggestions from Pentagon officials that the planned purchase of 442 F-22As may be cut in half due to funding constraints.<sup>52</sup>  This would be a mistake because it would likely reduce the number of F-22As, which are needed to deter potential adversaries. The Air Force is requesting $2 billion for FY 1997 for research and development as part of an expected $70 billion program. This is indeed expensive, but the F-22A is the only U.S. fighter in development that can offer decisive air superiority for U.S. forces.
<p>
<b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b><br>
The U.S. Navy needs at least 12 aircraft carrier battle groups in order to sustain peacetime security commitments. These commitments include the maintenance of one carrier battle group with the Seventh Fleet in Japan. However, the Clinton defense budget could force a reduction to eight carrier battle groups by the year 2002. If this occurs, the U.S. may have to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier to potential crisis areas outside of Asia,<sup>53</sup> in which case carriers would not be available to respond sufficiently to some future Chinese provocation against Taiwan. This would be regarded by Washington's friends and potential adversaries in Asia as a significant reduction in the traditional U.S. commitment to preserve peace in Asia. To deter future potential conflicts in Asia that could damage U.S. economic and military security, the U.S. must have 12 carrier battle groups to sustain deterrence.
<p>
<b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b><br>
The Clinton Administration should review its 1993 decision to forgo development of a dedicated successor to the Navy's F-14 fighter aircraft. The A/F-X program, canceled in 1993, had attracted proposals from Lockheed to develop a naval variant of the F-22. If U.S. naval task forces are to be superior to all opponents, the Navy will need a fighter with at least the capability of the F-22. While the F/A-18E/F is an impressive aircraft that incorporates advances in air combat and ground-attack systems, it does not present a decisive advance in capability over the SU-27/35 family. The Navy needs the F/A-18E/F to fulfill fighter and ground attack missions. But the Navy also needs an aircraft that will guarantee naval air superiority against the SU-27 and its advanced variants. In the meantime, as the F-14A is cycled out of Navy inventory early in the next decade, it is essential that the Asia-deployed Seventh Fleet receive priority in retaining F-14B/Ds.
<p>
The only other major combat aircraft program in the Navy's future is the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is scheduled to enter service after 2010. But this aircraft also is the next major aircraft program for the Marines and the Air Force. In all, the JSF is intended to replace such diverse aircraft as the A-6, the AV-8 <i>Harrier</i>, Britain's <I>Sea Harrier</I>, the F-14, the F-16, and the F-18. The Air Force wants an F-16 replacement that is inexpensive, while the Navy seeks stealthy long-range strike aircraft. The JSF is not expected to be much larger or much more maneuverable than an F-16, but it will incorporate stealth and advanced combat systems. According to General Muellner, for the Air Force, the JSF would "not be on the leading edge of air supremacy," but would compliment the F-22.<sup>54</sup>  The Navy version of the JSF should pay greater attention to the air-superiority mission, meaning increased range and increased internal air-to-air missile carriage; if it cannot approach the air superiority capabilities of the F-22, the Navy should be directed to begin development of a fighter that provides a dedicated replacement for the F-14.
<p>
<b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b><br>
It is critical that the Pentagon be directed to accelerate the development of a helmet-sighted and highly maneuverable short-range AAM. Israel, for example, was able to field its 90-degree off-boresight-capable, helmet-sighted <I>Python 4</I> short-range AAM in about half the time it is expected to take the U.S. to field its helmet-sighted AAM.<sup>55</sup>  A former senior Joint Chiefs of Staff officer was quoted recently as saying that "For the Air Force and Navy not to have a helmet-mounted sight and off-boresight missile is absolutely criminal."<sup>56</sup>  U.S. aircraft and those of Asian allies armed only with <i>Sidewinder </i>AAMs are at a distinct disadvantage when compared with Chinese SU-27s armed with the Russian <i>Archer </i>AAM. When a helmet-sighted missile enters U.S. service, it also should be made available for sale to Asian allies and friends. In the meantime, the U.S. should sell the AIM-120 to allies and friends with compatible aircraft. Specifically, the AIM-120 should be offered to the Republic of China as its F-16s enter service next year.
<p>
<b>Develop advanced versions of the F-15, F-16, and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b><br>
Most countries in Asia, except possibly Japan, will not be able to afford the F-22. The JSF also may prove to be too expensive. Therefore, the U.S. should develop advanced, more affordable versions of the F-16 and the F/A-18E/F for Asian friends and allies. The danger is that unmodified U.S. types could lose markets to newer and very capable European combat aircraft like the French <I>Rafale</I> and the <I>Eurofighter-2000</I>.<sup>57</sup>  Maintaining commonality between U.S. and Asian air forces is an important U.S. interest.
<p>
<b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail advanced weapons sales to China.</b><br>
Sales of advanced military technology to China do more than strengthen China's military capabilities:  They also constitute a potential threat to regional peace and stability. To Russia, the U.S. should stress that a well-armed China could be less benign and more inclined, for example, to press old territorial claims. To Israel, the U.S. should stress that China might sell advanced aircraft to rogue states like Iran which pose a threat to Israel. Last June, for example, China was suspected of having shipped missile components or technology to Syria.<sup>58</sup>  The U.S. also should enlist its allies and friends in Asia to warn Russia and Israel that by arming China, they are creating a potential threat to peace.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For over 50 years, the United States has enjoyed air superiority in Asia. American industry has produced combat aircraft that have been proven superior over Korea, the Taiwan Strait, Vietnam, the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf. With the demise of the Soviet Union, delay in building a fifth-generation fighter to succeed the F-15 and F-14 was justifiable. But should it occur, China's acquisition of a large inventory of SU-27 aircraft would present a major challenge to American air superiority in Asia. This poses the first major post-Cold War challenge to U.S. strategy in Asia, as America's ability to deter conflict in Asia will rely increasingly on air power.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To preserve U.S. air superiority and sustain deterrence in Asia in the next century, the U.S. should produce the F-22A jet fighter, field a helmet-sighted air to air missile, and make the AIM-120 advanced air to air missile available to allies and friends like the Republic of China. Equally important, it also is time to re-examine whether an F-14 follow-on must be built if U.S. naval air power is to retain the superiority critical to sustaining the credibility of U.S. naval forces in Asia. Finally, the U.S. should tell Russia and Israel that their sale to China of advanced weapons and technology is helping to create a potential threat to the peace and stability of the Asia region.

  <p><li> The F-15 has slightly better thrust-to-weight ratio, though wing-loadings are even at combat weights. A greater thrust-to-weight ratio and a lower wing-loading confers better combat potential. These variables help determine acceleration and turn rate in combat, and improve as aircraft weight decreases through fuel consumption. The SU-27 is said to have an instantaneous turn rate of 20 to 22 degrees per second and a sustained turn rate of 14 to 16 degrees per second. Comparable figures for the F-15 are 14 degrees and 12 degrees; see Dennis R.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're approaching the end of a bloody century plagued by a terrible
political invention -- totalitarianism. Optimism comes less easily
today, not because democracy is less vigorous, but because democracy's
enemies have refined their instruments of repression. Yet optimism
is in order because day by day democracy is proving itself to
be a not at all fragile flower. From Stettin on the Baltic to
Varna on the Black Sea, the regimes planted by totalitarianism
have had more than thirty years to establish their legitimacy.
But none -- not one regime -- has yet been able to risk free elections.
Regimes planted by bayonets do not take root.

The strength of the Solidarity movement in Poland demonstrates
the truth told in an underground joke in the Soviet Union. It
is that the Soviet Union would remain a one-party nation even
if an opposition party were permitted because everyone would join
the opposition party....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Historians looking back at our time will note the consistent restraint
and peaceful intentions of the West. They will note that it was
the democracies who refused to use the threat of their nuclear
monopoly in the forties and early fifties for territorial or imperial
gain. Had that nuclear monopoly been in the hands of the Communist
world, the map of Europe--indeed, the world--would look very different
today. And certainly they will note it was not the democracies
that invaded Afghanistan or suppressed Polish Solidarity or used
chemical and toxin warfare in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If history teaches anything, it teaches self-delusion in the face
of unpleasant facts is folly. We see around us today the marks
of our terrible dilemma--predictions of doomsday, antinuclear
demonstrations, an arms race in which the West must, for its own
protection, be an unwilling participant. At the same time we see
totalitarian forces in the world who seek subversion and conflict
around the globe to further their barbarous assault on the human
spirit. What, then, is our course? Must civilization perish in
a hail of fiery atoms? Must freedom wither in a quiet, deadening
accommodation with totalitarian evil?

Sir Winston Churchill refused to accept the inevitability of war
or even that it was imminent. He said, &quot;I do not believe
that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits
of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines.
But what we have to consider here today while time remains is
the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of conditions
of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this is precisely our mission today: to preserve freedom
as well as peace. It may not be easy to see; but I believe we
live now at a turning point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In an ironic sense Karl Marx was right. We are witnessing today
a great revolutionary crisis, a crisis where the demands of the
economic order are conflicting directly with those of the political
order. But the crisis is happening not in the free, non-Marxist
West but in the home of Marxism- Leninism, the Soviet Union. It
is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying
human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in
deep economic difficulty. The rate of growth in the national product
has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than
half of what it was then.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The dimensions of this failure are astounding: a country which
employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to
feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny
private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might
be on the brink of famine. These private plots occupy a bare 3
percent of the arable land but account for nearly one-quarter
of Soviet farm output and nearly one-third of meat products and
vegetables. Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year
after year the Soviet system pours its best resources into the
making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of
economic growth combined with the growth of military production
is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here
is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic
base, a society where productive forced are hampered by political
ones.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The decay of the Soviet experiment should come as no surprise
to us. Wherever the comparisons have been made between free and
closed societies -- West Germany and East Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia, Malaysia and Vietnam -- it is the democratic countries
that are prosperous and responsive to the needs of their people.
And one of the simple but overwhelming facts of our time is this:
of all the millions of refugees we've seen in the modern world,
their flight is always away from, not toward the Communist world.
Today on the NATO line, our military forces face east to prevent
a possible invasion. On the other side of the line, the Soviet
forces also face east to prevent their people from leaving.

The hard evidence of totalitarian rule has caused in mankind an
uprising of the intellect and will. Whether it is the growth of
the new schools of economics in America or England or the appearance
of the so-called new philosophers in France, there is one unifying
thread running through the intellectual work of these groups --
rejection of the arbitrary power of the state, the refusal to
subordinate the rights of the individual to the superstate, the
realization that collectivism stifles all the best human impulses....

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Chairman Brezhnev repeatedly has stressed that the competition
of ideas and systems must continue and that this is entirely consistent
with relaxation of tensions and peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, we ask only that these systems begin by living up to their
own constitutions, abiding by their own laws, and complying with
the international obligations they have undertaken. We ask only
for a process, a direction, a basic code of decency, not for an
instant transformation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We cannot ignore the fact that even without our encouragement
there has been and will continue to be repeated explosion against
repression and dictatorships. The Soviet Union itself is not immune
to this reality. Any system is inherently unstable that has no
peaceful means to legitimize its leaders. In such cases, the very
repressiveness of the state ultimately drives people to resist
it, if necessary, by force.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, we
must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and to take
concrete actions to move toward them. We must be staunch in our
conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky
few but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings.
So states the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which, among other things, guarantees free elections.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The objective I propose is quite simple to state: to foster the
infrastructure of democracy, the system of a free press, unions,
political parties, universities, which allows a people to choose
their own way to develop their own culture, to reconcile their
own differences through peaceful means.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is not cultural imperialism; it is providing the means for
genuine self-determination and protection for diversity. Democracy
already flourishes in countries with very different cultures and
historical experiences. It would be cultural condescension, or
worse, to say that any people prefer dictatorship to democracy.
Who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote, decide
to purchase government propaganda handouts instead of independent
newspapers, prefer government to worker-controlled unions, opt
for land to be owned by the state instead of those who till it,
want government repression of religious liberty, a single political
party instead of a free choice, a rigid cultural orthodoxy instead
of democratic tolerance and diversity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since 1917 the Soviet Union has given covert political training
and assistance to Marxist-Leninists in many countries. Of course,
it also has promoted the use of violence and subversion by these
same forces. Over the past several decades, West European and
other social democrats, Christian democrats, and leaders have
offered open assistance to fraternal, political, and social institutions
to bring about peaceful and democratic progress. Appropriately,
for a vigorous new democracy, the Federal Republic of Germany's
political foundations have become a major force in this effort.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We in America now intend to take additional steps, as many of
our allies have already done, toward realizing this same goal.
The chairmen and other leaders of the national Republican and
Democratic party organizations are initiating a study with the
bipartisan American Political Foundation to determine how the
United States can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign
for democracy now gathering force. They will have the cooperation
of congressional leaders of both parties, along with representatives
of business, labor, and other major institutions in our society.
I look forward to receiving their recommendations and to working
with these institutions and the Congress in the common task of
strengthening democracy throughout the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is time that we committed ourselves as a nation -- in both
the public and private sectors -- to assisting democratic development....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term
-- the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism
on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which
stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.
And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO
even as we move forward with our zero-option initiative in the
negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for
a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our military strength is a prerequisite to peace, but let it be
clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be used,
for the ultimate determinant in the struggle that's now going
on in the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills
and ideas, a trial of spiritual resolve, the values we hold, the
beliefs we cherish, the ideals to which we are dedicated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The British people know that, given strong leadership, time, and
a little bit of hope, the forces of good ultimately rally and
triumph over evil. Here among you is the cradle of self-government,
the Mother of Parliaments. Here is the enduring greatness of the
British contribution to mankind, the great civilized ideas: individual
liberty, representative government, and the rule of law under
God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've often wondered about the shyness of some of us in the West
about standing for these ideals that have done so much to ease
the plight of man and the hardships of our imperfect world. This
reluctance to use those vast resources at our command reminds
me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the blitz. As
the rescuers moved about, they found a bottle of brandy she'd
stored behind the staircase, which was all that was left standing.
And since she was barely conscious, one of the workers pulled
the cork to give her a taste of it. She came around immediately
and said, &quot;Here now -- there now, put it back. That's for
emergencies.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Well, the emergency is upon us. Let us be shy no longer. Let us
go to our strength. Let us offer hope. Let us tell the world that
a new age is not only possible but probable.

During the dark days of the Second World War, when this island
was incandescent with courage, Winston Churchill exclaimed about
Britain's adversaries, &quot;What kind of people do they think
we are?&quot; Well, Britain's adversaries found out what extraordinary
people the British are. But all the democracies paid a terrible
price for allowing the dictators to underestimate us. We dare
not make that mistake again. So, let us ask ourselves, &quot;What
kind of people do we think we are?&quot; And let us answer, &quot;Free
people, worthy of freedom and determined not only to remain so
but to help others gain their freedom as well.&quot;

Sir Winston led his people to great victory in war and then lost
an election just as the fruits of victory were about to be enjoyed.
But he left office honorably and, as it turned out, temporarily,
knowing that the liberty of his people was more important than
the fate of any single leader. History recalls his greatness in
ways no dictator will ever know. And he left us a message of hope
for the future, as timely now as when he first uttered it, as
opposition leader in the Commons nearly twenty-seven years ago,
when he said, &quot;When we look back on all the perils through
which we have passed and at the mighty foes that we have laid
low and all the dark and deadly designs that we have frustrated,
why should we fear for our future? We have,&quot; he said, &quot;come
safely through the worst.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation.
But together, we too have come through the worst. Let us now begin
a major effort to secure the best -- a crusade for freedom that
will engage the faith and fortitude of the next generation. For
the sake of peace and justice, let us move toward a world in which
all people are at last free to determine their own destiny.

<a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Trend and Quarterly Real GDP Growth 1976-1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On August 1, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is scheduled to release its preliminary or "advance" gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate for the second quarter of 1996. This number, good or bad, inevitably will make front-page news and may have a significant impact on the presidential campaign. Just as inevitably, this preliminary number most likely will turn out to be wrong, for quarterly GDP data historically have been subject to substantial later revisions, sometimes so significant that the original estimate tells nothing about the course of the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A single quarter estimate of the growth in GDP usually is a poor signal of the long-term direction of economic growth. Consider the following examples:<ul>

<p><li>The GDP growth estimate for the first quarter of 1996 has been revised downward by 21 percent (from 2.8 percent to 2.2 percent).

<p><li>During the last year of the Bush Administration, the first quarter 1992 advance estimate of GDP suggested an annualized growth rate of 2.0 percent. The subsequent revision of the GDP for that quarter showed that growth in the quarter actually was at an annualized rate of 4.7 percent. This is a 135 percent revision between the preliminary and final estimates.

<p><li>As it turns out, the BEA underestimated the growth rate during the Reagan Administration in 63 percent of its advance estimates. During the Clinton Administration, the BEA so far has overestimated the growth rate on over 69 percent of the occasions on which it published advance estimates.

<p><li>The BEA concedes that in 12 percent of the quarters between 1978 and 1991, the advance GDP growth estimate failed even to indicate correctly whether growth was positive or negative.

<p><li>The average divergence between the advance estimate of GDP growth and the final GDP growth rate between 1976 and 1996 was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the final GDP growth rate.
</ul>

<p>
<b>WHY DOES QUARTERLY GDP FLUCTUATE SO MUCH?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Measuring GDP changes is a very complex task, made all the more difficult by the fact that quarterly GDP figures are very volatile.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the total value of goods and services sold for final consumption by U.S. firms and individuals. It consists of four major components: personal consumption; investment (including business inventories and both residential and nonresidential fixed investment); net exports; and government purchases of goods and services. Fluctuations in any of these individual components of GDP in a given quarter can cause large changes in the quarterly growth rate. The components which typically have the largest and most common fluctuations are changes in business inventories and in government purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A glance at the quarterly GDP growth figures for the last quarter of 1995 illustrates this point. Despite an annualized growth rate in personal consumption expenditures of 1.2 percent and a respectable annualized increase in nonresidential fixed investment of 3.1 percent, overall annualized growth in this quarter was at a recession-like low of 0.5 percent. The reason: An annualized fall in government purchases of over 12 percent during the winter shutdown of 1995-1996 drove down GDP during this quarter.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Similarly, a number of one-shot factors probably will drive a significant increase in GDP for the second quarter of 1996. One leading econometric consulting firm, the St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers,<sup>3</sup> for example, cite a number of factors to support their prediction of a 3.7 percent annualized growth rate for this quarter. These factors include the complete recovery of government purchases following the winter shutdown, the end of the UAW strike at General Motors, an increase in the number of home mortgage refinancings stimulated by lower interest rates (which put extra cash into the hands of consumers), and the economy's recovery after the harsh winter weather.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The extent to which these short-term factors can influence quarterly growth figures can be gauged by looking more closely at what is happening to business inventories. Due to the GM strike and the harsh winter, business inventories fell substantially in the first quarter of 1996 as production experienced a slowdown. Macroeconomic Advisers predicts that over 38 percent of their projected growth in GDP (1.4 percent from a total annualized growth rate of 3.7 percent) in the second quarter of 1996 will come solely from firms restocking their inventories as production gets fully back on line.
<p>


<b>WHY ADVANCE ESTIMATES OF GDP GROWTH TEND TO BE WRONG</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Measuring GDP is a massive and complicated undertaking that involves attempting to record the total sales of all goods for final consumption for the entire United States. The BEA produces its estimates based on sample sales data from a number of individuals and firms, collected during every month. Prices for thousands of individual items are estimated using sample data. Taken together, these comprise virtually millions of data points.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The problem is that when the advance estimate is published only 30 days after the close of the quarter, not all of these data have been examined -- or are even available. In 1984, for example, top BEA official Robert Parker noted that for sales of all consumer goods, other than autos and trucks, only data from the first two months of the quarter were available when advance estimates of national income were being made.<sup>4</sup>  To estimate the GDP growth in such a case, with data either missing or unexamined, BEA economists must rely on a combination of extrapolation and guesswork. But given the turbulent nature of quarterly GDP changes, this guesswork often is very inaccurate. These factors mean that large revisions need to be made as the complete dataset becomes available and is examined in full by the BEA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The revisions also tend to be large because the GDP growth rate is a rate of change. Thus, errors of a small magnitude in total GDP can lead to large errors in the growth rate. For example, if the actual GDP growth rate is 2 percent, even a small error in total GDP could translate into a large error in the actual growth rate, perhaps even 50 percent. In this context, it is not surprising that advance GDP growth estimates often vary substantially from the real figures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, despite the fact that advance GDP growth estimates are subject to frequent and large revisions, they are quickly seized upon by politicians of both parties either to support their own records or to attack those of their opponents. And unlike the publication of advance estimates, revisions of these quarterly data by the BEA hardly make the news. This process of correcting and finalizing GDP estimates can last for months -- even years -- following that initial release and can result in huge revisions which tell a completely different story about how well the economy performed.<sup>5</sup>  <a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference between the initial "advance" estimates of the real annualized growth rate of GDP and the most up-to-date revisions of these figures for the period since 1976.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference or "error" between the advance and the most up-to-date revised estimate of the GDP growth rate. The "magnitude of the initial error" refers to the amount by which the advance GDP growth rate was later revised. Thus, if the advance estimate was a 3 percent annualized growth rate and the revised rate was 2 percent, the absolute error was 1 percentage point, which represents a revision of 33 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In most cases, the error is substantial; on a number of occasions, it exceeds the real growth rate itself. Among recent examples of large errors is the first quarter of 1992, when the BEA's advance estimate of GDP growth underestimated the real annualized growth rate by a factor of 135 percent (the advance annualized real growth estimate was 2.0 percent; real annualized growth in that quarter was actually 4.7 percent, according to the latest revision). The BEA also has revised downward its estimate of the growth rate for the first quarter of 1996 by a factor of almost one-third.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

An analysis of the revisions contained in the BEA's monthly <I>Survey of Current Business</I> over the 20-year period from 1976-1996 shows that these recent examples fit a general pattern over many years. In the 80 quarters between the first quarter of 1976 and the first quarter of 1996, the average magnitude of the total revision in annualized real GDP growth amounted to 1.4 percent of GDP. The average quarterly annualized growth rate in GDP over this period was 2.8 percent. This means that the average divergence of the advance estimate of GDP growth from the actual revised figure was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the actual revised growth rate. According to BEA economist Allan Young, "advance" GDP growth figures failed even to show correctly whether GDP growth was negative or positive in 12 percent of all quarters over the period 1978-1991.<sup>6</sup>  Taking the Reagan years as an example, the BEA's advance figures underestimated the growth rate in roughly two-thirds (63 percent) of all quarters. Likewise, during the Clinton era, the BEA so far has overestimated the rate of growth in about 70 percent of all of its advance estimates.
<p>

<b>WHY IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO LOOK AT TRENDS IN GDP</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the poor accuracy of advance estimates of GDP and the extreme volatility of quarterly GDP growth rates, a far better picture of the economy emerges from looking at the underlying trends. <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows the trend<sup>7</sup> in economic growth compared with the <I>revised</I> quarterly GDP growth rates between the first quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1996.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The data in <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> show two major patterns in the rate of economic growth in recent years: an acceleration in growth rates between the first quarter of 1992 and the final quarter of 1994 and a deceleration in the growth rate beginning after the peak in 1994 and continuing through to the current period. Both the expansion and the slowdown in the economy, however, have been punctuated by misleading "spikes," or individual quarters when the GDP growth rate diverged from the trend. For example, during the first quarter of 1993, in the middle of an expansion, the growth rate of GDP fell to zero. More recently, the economy showed strong above-trend growth in the third quarter of 1995.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As can be seen from <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>, individual quarterly GDP numbers are a rough and often misleading signal of the long-term and medium-term strength of the economy. Quarterly GDP figures can fluctuate widely because of factors that are unique to that quarter and which pose no long-term implications for economic prosperity.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Americans should not be lulled into a false sense of either economic prosperity or impending economic decline by estimates of the economy's performance during a single quarter. The advance estimates that are scheduled to be released on August 1 are likely to be revised considerably in the weeks and months to come. And even if these quarterly snapshots actually were accurate, quarterly GDP numbers fluctuate considerably for reasons unconnected with the long-term economic growth rate. Americans should not allow themselves to be deceived by these numbers and the political posturing surrounding them; rather, they should pay attention to the longer term patterns in the economy.

    <li>GDP data, in addition to undergoing three reviews in the months immediately following collection, undergo large-scale periodic revisions, known as "benchmarking."  The most recent large-scale benchmarking of GDP figures came in January 1996, when the BEA revised and improved all GDP figures dating back to World War II. Among the revisions was the adoption of a chain-weight measure to adjust the figures for inflation, changes in the treatment of depreciation, and the use of new data from the IRS and the 1991 Census.

    <li>Depicted using an 8-quarter moving average. Moving averages are widely used by economists and government agencies to remove fluctuations from data. They do this by summing and then averaging the change in a variable over a set number of periods. In this case, the moving average trend estimate for a quarter is the mean of GDP growth for that quarter and the seven preceding quarters. This moving average has the effect of filtering out large fluctuations in individual quarters while capturing the long-term pattern of change. For example, a once-off upwards fluctuation in growth in one particular quarter will change this moving average by a factor of only one-eighth of the change in the point estimate, but sustained growth over a number of periods will have a larger effect on the moving average. In all cases, the latest revised GDP growth figures are used. The real growth rate is measured in Chained 1992 dollars.
    <li>The annualized real growth in GDP during the second quarter of 1996 is forecast at 3.7 percent by Macroeconomic Advisers.
    <li>It is important to emphasize that while the growth figures presented in Chart 1 represent the most up-to-date revisions, they are by no means final. All of the data, and especially the data from the most recent quarters, will continue to undergo checking

<p>
H. Con. Res. 1</b>
</center><p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and the national security of the United States.
<p><center><b>
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
May 15, 1996</b></center>
<p>
Mr. X submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to the Committee on National Security
<p><hr><p>
<center><b>CONCURRENT RESOLUTION</b></center>
<p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and national security of the United States.
<p>
Whereas the United States currently maintains a wide variety of security commitments to its friends and allies around the world, including countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration in 1993 proposed in its "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy to uphold the existing security commitments of the United States by fielding conventional military forces capable of fighting and winning two major regional conflicts, each roughly similar in size and scope to the Persian Gulf War, "nearly simultaneously;"
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of ten active divisions in the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 active aircraft carriers in the Navy, and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps;
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of a military manpower endstrength of 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas four retired military officers reported to Senator John McCain in February 1995, that the conventional forces recommended by the Bottom-Up Review, even if fully funded, are not capable of meeting the assigned mission of addressing two major regional conflicts in short succession;
<p>
Whereas there is widespread agreement among defense analysts outside the Clinton Administration, including those with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Congressional Budget Office, the Defense Budget Project (now the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments), the General Accounting Office, and The Heritage Foundation, that the Clinton Administration's defense budget is too small to pay for the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's six-year (fiscal years 1997-2002) defense funding shortfall relative to the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review likely exceeds $100 billion;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall, assuming the needs for readiness and modernization are properly addressed and strategic and nuclear forces are funded at necessary levels, will likely force the reduction of conventional forces to levels of no more than eight active Army divisions, 15 Air Force tactical fighter wings, eight active aircraft carriers, and 140,000 active duty Marine Corps troops;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall is likely to drive the military manpower endstrength down to a level of just over 2,000,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas seven active divisions from the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings from the Air Force, six aircraft carrier battle groups from the Navy, and 93,000 troops from the Marine Corps either participated in or contributed to the force fielded during the Persian Gulf War;
<p>
Whereas the conventional forces likely resulting from the levels of defense spending proposed by the Clinton Administration during the next six years would make it difficult to field an expeditionary force of the size that fought the Persian Gulf War, much less the two such conflicts envisioned by the Bottom-Up Review; and
<p>
Whereas the 1995 congressional budget resolution (House Concurrent Resolution 67) directs a total level of expenditures for defense for the six-year period covering fiscal years 1997-2002 that is roughly similar to that proposed by the Clinton Administration: Now therefore be it
<p><blockquote>
<I>Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring</I>), That it is the sense of Congress that -- 
<p><blockquote>
(1) the protection of the vital interests of the United States requires that the United States uphold its existing security commitments, including those to friendly and allied countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
(2) the conventional forces of the United States should be large and strong enough to uphold the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(3) the smaller conventional forces likely resulting from the defense budget proposed by the Clinton Administration will be too small to fulfill the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(4) the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met by fielding conventional forces capable of fighting and winning one major regional conflict, roughly the size of the Persian Gulf War, and one minor regional conflict, roughly the size of the 1989 invasion of Panama, simultaneously, as opposed to the two major regional conflicts called for by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
(5) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States requires the United States to contribute military forces to peacekeeping missions only when doing so will serve to protect the vital interests of the United States;
<p>
(6) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met with conventional military forces roughly of the size proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, which include the equivalent of 15 total divisions in the Army (10 active divisions), twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 aircraft carrier battle groups (active) in the Navy; and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps, provided these forces are both combat ready and fully modernized;
<p>
(7) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be achieved with a total military manpower endstrength similar to that proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, some 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
(8)  Congress should provide the funds required for the forces recommended by this resolution, even though they will likely be substantially more than what the Clinton Administration has budgeted for defense over the next six years. </blockquote></blockquote>

<h3>WHY COMBINING "KIDSAVE" WITH A CHILD TAX CREDIT 
MAKES GOOD SENSE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br> 
Vice President and Director of Domestic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 444<br>
February 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As congressional leaders and the 
White House continue to argue over a balanced budget plan, a proposal 
known as "KidSave" has resurfaced. First unveiled last October by Senators 
Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) and Robert Kerrey (D-NE), KidSave would enable 
parents eligible for any new child tax credit created in tax legislation to place 
that credit in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) in their child's name. 
This is a valuable and important proposal. If congressional supporters of the 
$500-per-child tax credit were to include this feature in their plan, it would 
help build Democratic support for the tax plan. And if adopted as an option 
for parents in a final compromise tax bill, this innovation would help provide 
financial security for children while significantly improving the tax code.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;KidSave would work as follows. If a 
parent was eligible for a child tax credit of $500 per year (the amount in the 
vetoed Balanced Budget Act), the parent could place that amount of money 
into an IRA in the child's name. As that account grew over the years, taxes 
would be deferred on the principal and earnings while the funds remained in 
the account -- just like a conventional IRA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The rules governing KidSave IRAs 
would be exactly the same as those for conventional IRAs, with one 
exception:  The child could take funds out of the account temporarily in the 
form of a ten-year loan (much as certain life insurance and pension plans 
allow loans against equity), without incurring taxes at the time, to help pay for 
higher education. Otherwise, as with conventional IRAs, after-tax funds could 
be withdrawn without tax penalty by the child when he or she reached age 59 
1/2, or withdrawn earlier with a penalty.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The original Lieberman-Kerrey 
proposal would have required the child tax credit to be placed in a KidSave 
IRA. Such a restriction understandably found little support among lawmakers, 
especially conservatives. Besides introducing unacceptable restrictions on the 
right of parents to decide how best to use the money for their children, the 
requirement would have had the effect of denying immediate help to children 
in many low-income families, where basic day-to-day needs are a higher 
priority than a more secure retirement. In the discussions now taking place 
over KidSave, the consensus is that placing tax credit money in a special IRA 
should be an option. Such an option would be a welcome reform of the tax 
code, since it would reduce the double-taxation bias against savings, making it 
more likely that working parents would set aside funds to help secure their 
children's future. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Allowing parents to set up IRAs for 
their children would help children in two particularly important ways.
<P>
1.) The KidSave option would give children a large financial cushion against 
the doubtful ability of Medicare and Social Security to deliver adequate 
benefits in the future. The Medicare trustees warned the nation last year that 
the Medicare hospital trust fund will run out of money by 2002. Congress 
passed reforms that would help delay the exhaustion of the fund, but President 
Clinton vetoed that legislation. Even if the congressional reforms became law, 
however, they could not guarantee solvency of the program when today's 
newborns reach retirement, only delay the eventual collapse. Similarly, the 
baby boom generation will impose such heavy burdens on the Social Security 
retirement program that the following generation will have little or no 
prospect of getting back even the money they pay into the system, let alone 
any return on their contributions.
<p>
2.) KidSave would make it easier for today's worried parents to establish a 
retirement fund for their children as a cushion against the probability that 
Medicare and Social Security will be inadequate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although $500 per year into an IRA 
may seem a trivial investment in a child's retirement, compounding would 
lead to a substantial nest egg. For example, consider the case of parents 
deciding to take advantage of the KidSave option for their newborn and 
placing $500 per year into an IRA for 18 years (the maximum under the 
vetoed congressional tax credit plan). Assume a real rate of return of five 
percent. Even if the child, as an adult, added nothing to the IRA, it would be 
worth $140,000 in today's dollars when he or she reached 65 (the Clinton-
proposed credit, which is smaller, available for only 13 years, and more 
restricted, would be worth $100,000 -- assuming the child was eligible).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;KidSave would give the child an 
additional means of financing his or her higher education. With the cost of 
college an enormous barrier to higher education for the children of many 
working families, permitting these families to invest in a KidSave IRA would 
provide a means of shouldering the burden. Under the proposal, children at 
college could borrow against their KidSave IRAs, paying back the loan (into 
their own retirement accounts) over the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Again, compounding leads to 
significant funds for such a loan. Assuming the same case described above, 
the child would have just over $14,000 in his or her account at age 18, in 
today's dollars. This compares with an average cost (tuition and required fees) 
of $10,500 for four years at a public college (by contrast, an eligible child 
would have a maximum of $10,400 under the Clinton proposal).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The KidSave proposal, combined 
with the tax credit for families with children, thus would be a significant 
savings vehicle to help families deal with the cost of college and the future 
uncertainty of Medicare and Social Security. And it is good tax policy, since it 
moves closer to a proper treatment of savings in the tax code. But placing 
their child tax credit in a KidSave IRA should be an option for families, not a 
requirement (as under the original proposal), so families can decide for 
themselves whether the credit should be used for urgent immediate needs or 
future security. As an option, KidSave would be a very welcome 
improvement to legislation to provide much-needed tax relief to families with 
children.

<title>Why A Supermajority Would Protect Taxpayers - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>WHY A SUPERMAJORITY WOULD PROTECT TAXPAYERS</h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel J. Mitchell</a><br>
McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
FYI No. 93<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="fyi93.gif">Table 1</a>: How Supermajority States Compare in Gross State Product and Per Capita Tax Revenue
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On April 15th, the House of Representatives will vote on a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.j.res.00159:">Constitutional Amendment</a> requiring a two-thirds supermajority for Congress to raise taxes. In favor of the amendment are those who believe that lawmakers will be more fiscally responsible and the economy will grow faster if it becomes more difficult for Congress to raise taxes. On the other side are those who believe restricting tax increases would interfere with the majority's ability to determine economic policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be fair, opponents are correct. The proposed amendment would restrict the rights of the majority. But that is precisely the point. Just as the First Amendment is supposed to prohibit the majority from passing laws to infringe upon the rights of free speech and the Second Amendment is supposed to prohibit the majority from passing laws to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms, the supermajority amendment is designed to place limits on the power of the majority to take money from the minority. More specifically, taxpayers are presumed to have a right to their earnings and that only tax increases with very broad support -- as measured by the ability to attract a two-thirds supermajority -- are permissible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is little doubt that a supermajority will make it harder for politicians to take more money from taxpayers. That is why lawmakers who believe taxes should be higher oppose it. Had a supermajority been in place, some major tax increases from recent years would not have become law. Consider:
<p><ul>
<li> The record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by President Clinton was approved by 51-50 in the Senate and 218-216 in the House. Since a single vote-switch in either body would have killed the legislation, a supermajority requirement easily would have saved the economy from the largest tax increase in American history.
<p>
<li> The large tax increase signed into law in 1990 by President Bush was approved by 54-45 in the Senate and 228-200 in the House. Had a supermajority been required, this ill-fated measure would have fallen 12 votes short in the Senate and 58 votes shy in the House.
<p>
<li> Other major tax increases in recent years, including the tax hikes of 1982, 1984, and 1987, also would have been blocked by a supermajority provision.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Needless to say, these tax increases might never even have come up for a vote had supermajority approval been required. Or at the very least, supporters of the tax increases would have had to reduce the size of the hikes and probably make much-needed reforms to spending programs to attract the needed votes. This helps explain why the lawmakers who oppose this in Congress are those who traditionally favor raising taxes -- they fear the supermajority would restrict them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A supermajority requirement would not, of course, block all tax increases. The 1983 Social Security bailout legislation, for instance, imposed a huge tax increase on workers and allowed incumbents at the time to avoid taking needed steps to fix a fundamentally broken system. That legislation did receive more than two-thirds support in both chambers of Congress. Likewise, it is clear that Congress would be able to increase spending, whether financed by taxes or debt, if there was a genuine national emergency. A supermajority requirement during World War II, for instance, would not have impeded the conduct of fiscal policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nonetheless, some critics say that such a requirement would be disruptive, or even disastrous, if it were imposed on Congress. But seven states worked under such a limit for at least 15 years and there is no indication that it has caused any problem. Significantly, not a single state has repealed the provision. Moreover, the seven states which have lived for quite some time under some form of supermajority -- Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Dakota -- have been joined recently by Arizona, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Nevada and Ohio may soon join the list.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ultimately, the debate over the supermajority boils down to a fight about the size of government and the effect of taxes on economic performance. Proponents of smaller government want to use the balanced budget amendment and the supermajority together to slowly shrink the size and power of the federal government. Further, they want to put a brake on higher taxes, which undermine the goals of fiscal responsibility and economic performance. For instance:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Higher taxes typically are followed by bigger deficits.</b> Tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1990, and 1993 have not balanced the budget. Indeed, current CBO projections show the deficit climbing to more than $300 billion within ten years if current policies are left in place.
<p>
<li><b>Higher taxes are associated with higher spending.</b> A 1991 study by the Joint Economic Committee showed that every dollar of higher taxes is associated with more than $1.59 of new spending.<sup>1</sup>  Tax increases are virtually guaranteed to trigger new spending if there is a balanced budget requirement since any new revenues simply allow politicians to satisfy the balanced budget requirement at a higher level of spending.
<P>
<li><b> Higher taxes hurt the economy.</b> Lower taxes in the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s helped trigger economic booms. Higher taxes in the 1930s, 1970s, and 1990s, by contrast, are associated with very mediocre economic performances. The evidence linking taxes and economic performance is powerful. Numerous studies show that nations with low taxes grow faster than countries with high taxes and also that countries can improve their performance by reducing taxes on productive economic behavior.<sup>2</sup>  Similar studies show taxes have the same effect in and among states.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Higher taxes do not collect the promised revenues.</b> Fewer jobs means fewer taxpayers. Lower profits means lower tax collections. Falling incomes mean falling tax revenues. Understanding these simple relationships helps explain why individual income tax revenues have fallen as a percent of GDP since Ronald Reagan left office even though Americans have suffered through two major tax increases.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A supermajority rule is a necessary component of any strategy to shrink the size and power of the federal government, and to limit the power of Congress to tax. High taxes hurt the economy. Not only are five supermajority states below the national average in growth of taxes, but also five are above the national average in overall economic growth (see <a href="fyi93.gif">Table 1</a>). This may be why more and more states have adopted the rule. There is every reason to believe it would have a positive effect on fiscal policy in Washington. Requiring supermajority votes to raise taxes ensures that politicians cannot continue to spend other people's money and evade fiscal responsibility by imposing a higher tax bill on the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A wide range of economic studies demonstrates that states will be better off if they keep their tax burdens low. Curbing taxes limits the growth of government and boosts economic performance. By making it harder to raise taxes, supermajority rule would have a desirable effect on the nation's fiscal policy and overall economic performance. To be sure, a supermajority does not guarantee sound economic policy. The record tax increase approved in California several years ago, for instance, happened in spite of a two-thirds supermajority requirement. And many states without supermajorities, such as Tennessee and Nevada, have scored well in most categories of economic performance (this may be due to these states not having an income tax). When all factors are examined, however, there is no escaping the logical relationship between supermajorities and superior state performance. America would be well served if this lesson were applied to the federal budget.

<H2>President Reagan's Speech on The Challenger Disaster</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ronald Reagan -- Oval Office of the White House, January 28, 1986
<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts
in a terrible accident on the ground. But, we've never lost an
astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And
perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the
shuttle; but they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers,
but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven
heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair,
Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn
their loss as a nation together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the
full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking
about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave,
and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says,
'Give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.' They had a hunger
to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to
serve, and they did. They served all of us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle
us. But for twenty-five years the United States space program
has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space,
and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still
pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who
were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know
it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this
happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.
It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.
The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the
brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and
we'll continue to follow them...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great
explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama.
In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and a historian
later said, 'He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in
it.' Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication
was, like Drake's, complete.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner
in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor
the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for
the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of
earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am going to talk of controversial things. I make no apology
for this.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's time we asked ourselves if we still know the freedoms intended
for us by the Founding Fathers. James Madison said, &quot;We base
all our experiments on the capacity of mankind for self government.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This idea? that government was beholden to the people, that it
had no other source of power is still the newest, most unique
idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This is
the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity
for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution
and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant
capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them
ourselves.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but
I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is
only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream-the maximum of individual
freedom consistent with order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.
Regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those
who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this
downward path. Plutarch warned, &quot;The real destroyer of the
liberties of the people is he who spreads among them bounties,
donations and benefits.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy
without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets
out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its
purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Public servants say, always with the best of intentions, &quot;What
greater service we could render if only we had a little more money
and a little more power.&quot; But the truth is that outside of
its legitimate function, government does nothing as well or as
economically as the private sector.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet any time you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders,
we're denounced as being opposed to their humanitarian goals.
It seems impossible to legitimately debate their solutions with
the assumption that all of us share the desire to help the less
fortunate. They tell us we're always &quot;against,&quot; never
&quot;for&quot; anything.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment
by reason of old age, and to that end we have accepted Social
Security as a step toward meeting the problem. However, we are
against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception
regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism
of the program means that we want to end payments....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for aiding our allies by sharing our material blessings
with nations which share our fundamental beliefs, but we are against
doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy,
if not socialism, all over the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We need true tax reform that will at least make a start toward
I restoring for our children the American Dream that wealth is
denied to no one, that each individual has the right to fly as
high as his strength and ability will take him.... But we can
not have such reform while our tax policy is engineered by people
who view the tax as a means of achieving changes in our social
structure....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Have we the courage and the will to face up to the immorality
and discrimination of the progressive tax, and demand a return
to traditional proportionate taxation? . . . Today in our country
the tax collector's share is 37 cents of -very dollar earned.
Freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our
grasp.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Are you willing to spend time studying the issues, making yourself
aware, and then conveying that information to family and friends?
Will you resist the temptation to get a government handout for
your community? Realize that the doctor's fight against socialized
medicine is your fight. We can't socialize the doctors without
socializing the patients. Recognize that government invasion of
public power is eventually an assault upon your own business.
If some among you fear taking a stand because you are afraid of
reprisals from customers, clients, or even government, recognize
that you are just feeding the crocodile hoping he'll eat you last.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If all of this seems like a great deal of trouble, think what's
at stake. We are faced with the most evil enemy mankind has known
in his long climb from the swamp to the stars. There can be no
security anywhere in the free world if there is no fiscal and
economic stability within the United States. Those who ask us
to trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state
are architects of a policy of accommodation.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They say the world has become too complex for simple answers.
They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there are simple
answers. We must have the courage to do what we know is morally
right. Winston Churchill said that &quot;the destiny of man is
not measured by material computation. When great forces are on
the move in the world, we learn we are spirits-not animals.&quot;
And he said, &quot;There is something going on in time and space,
and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells
duty.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for
our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will
sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of
darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's
children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did
all that could be done.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/townhall/background.jpg">
<H2>Statement on the Occasion of the Tenth Anniversary of the
Announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, March 23rd, 1993. Washington, D.C. <HR>

<P>
Good morning. It's a pleasure to be able to speak to you today
on this tenth anniversary of my announcement of the Strategic
Defense Initiative. Above all I want to thank all of you for the
hard work and perseverance you have shown through the years in
supporting and shaping this very important program. It is as true
today as it was ten years ago that this effort holds the promise
of changing the course of human history, by freeing the world
from the ominous threat of ballistic missile attack. Given the
choice, shouldn't we seek to save lives rather than avenge them?
I think we should. And indeed, now we can.
<P>
Ten years ago when I asked the scientific community to give us
the means of defending against the threat of ballistic missiles,
I said there would be risks, and that results would take time.
Well, I'm proud to say that these scientists and engineers boldly
embraced this challenge, and in only a few short years broke new
technological ground in developing innovative systems capable
of providing effective and affordable defenses against missile
attacks anywhere in the world. It is a tremendous achievement,
worthy of the great scientific accomplishments of this century.
<P>
As you know, however, critics of SDI from the very beginning have
been all too eager to denounce the program (and if it weren't
for George Lucas, maybe we would have been off to a better start).
But over the years, these critics have been disproved time and
time again. Today we know that we can defend ourselves, that the
threats have not disappeared -- many new threats, in fact, are
rapidly emerging -- and that Russia and our European allies have
expressed their desire to cooperate with us in developing a global
system of missile defenses.
<P>
This should be good news. Unfortunately, there is a stubborn contingent
of policy-makers who insist on abiding by the obsolete ABM Treaty
and support only extremely limited missile defenses, or even none
at all. Yet I believe their efforts will not stop the progress
we have made and the progress we have yet to make. The wisdom
of the program we launched a decade ago will prevail, and America
will not remain forever defenseless against ballistic missile
attack.
<P>
Now more than ever it is vital that the United States not back
down from its efforts to develop and deploy strategic defenses.
It is technologically feasible, strategically necessary and morally
imperative. For if our nation and our precious freedoms are worth
defending with the threat of annihilation, we are surely worth
defending by defensive means that ensure our survival.
<P>
Thank you again. God bless you, and may God bless America.

<H2>Reagan's Speech at the 1994 Gala</H2>

<H3>On the Occasion of His 83rd Birthday</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I can't tell you how thrilled Nancy and I are to be here with
you tonight to celebrate the &quot;forty-fourth anniversary of
my thirty-ninth birthday.&quot; Haley told me he was going to
gather a few friends for dinner tonight, but I had no idea!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Before I get started here, I want to thank my dear friend, Margaret
Thatcher, for being part of yet another important milestone in
my life and for those very kind words.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As most of you know, Margaret and I go back quite a ways. We met
at a time before she became Prime Minister and I became President.
From the moment we met, we discovered that we shared quite similar
views of government and freedom. Margaret ended our first meeting
by telling me, &quot;we must stand together,&quot; and that's
exactly wat we've done in the years since--as friends and as political
allies. Margaret Thatcher is one of the giants of our century.
Her many achievements will be appreciated more and more as time
goes on and history is written. For me, she has been a staunch
ally, my political soulmate, a great visionary and a dear, dear
friend. Thank you, Margaret, for being with us here tonight. I
would also like to convey my personal appreciation to Haley Barbour.
Haley, you and the entire Republican National Committee are doing
and excellent job keeping the heat on the Democrats at both ends
of Pennsylvania Avenue. Haley, back when I hired you to work on
my White House staff, I suspected you might amount to something
someday!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I must say that returning to Washington today really brought back
memories. As our plane headed toward the airport, I looked down
on the White House, and it was just like the good old days...the
South Lawn, the Rose Garden...David Gergen. I looked over a couple
of blocks, and there was the Internal Revenue Service--bigger
than I ever remembered it. When I looked down at the enormous
United States Post Office building I could just see the excitement
on the faces of the bureaucrats--knowing they would soon be managing
our national health care system! Up on Capital Hill, I saw that
big, white dome, bulging with new tax revenues. I instinctively
reached for my veto pen and thought to myself, &quot;Go ahead,
make my day.&quot; You may have seen President Clinton draw his
own veto pen on television just last week. The difference is that
his pen doesn't have any ink in it! Unless, of course, you're
talking about red ink. And we all know the Democrats have plenty
of that!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of you have made our day, just by being here. It's a pleasure
to see so many familiar faces and those who work so hard for the
Grand Old Party. Birthdays often serve as the rare moments when
we can pause from the bustle of our daily lives to reflect on
the years that have passed, the accomplishments and people that
have made them special. As I look around this gathering, I am
filled with countless warm and fond memories. Many of you go back
with us as far as my two terms as California Governor. Others
of you are more recent additions to the family.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Regardless of when you came, you have been a big part of our lives.
For that, we are so grateful and feel so blessed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, as most of you know, I'm not one for looking back, I figure
there will be plenty of time for that when I get old. But rather
what I take from the past, is inspiration for the future. And
what we accomplished during our years in the White House must
never be lost amid the rhetoric of political revisionists.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When we came to Washington on that bright sunny day in January
of 1981, we shared a dream for America. Back then, the reach of
government had become intolerable. It was a time of rampant inflation
and crushing interest rates--when hope was scarce. It was a time
when coldy, ugly walls divided nations and human rights were trampled
in the name of evil and corrupt ideologies. It was a time when
the nuclear arms race was spiraling out of control and a blinding
mistrust stood between East and West. We believed that for the
future of America and the free world, this could not stand. And
together, we insisted that this great nation must once again behave
as such.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In our America, most people still believed in the power of a better
tomorrow. So together we got the government off the backs of the
American people. We created millions of new jobs for Americans
at all income levels. We cut taxes and freed the people from the
shackles of too much government. And, the economy burst loose
in the longest peacetime expansion ever. We brought America back--bigger
and better than ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was a time when America was a bright beacon of hope and freedom
to oppressed people everywhere. The world looked to us--not just
because of our military might--but because of our ideas of liberty
and freedom. And, they knew we were willing to defend and promote
those ideas in every corner of the earth. We rebuilt a demoralized,
underfunded and unappreciated military. And we made it the most
modern and respected force in the world. And who can forget those
so-called &quot;experts&quot; who said our military build-up threatened
a dangerous escalation of tensions? What kind of fool, they asked,
would call the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire&quot;. But as
events have shown, there was nothing foolish in my prediction
that communism wa destined for the ash-heap of history. After
decades of struggle, and with the help of the bold leadership
of Margaret Thatcher, democracy won the Cold War and the Berlin
Wall came tumbling down.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The world watched with amazement as we put our house in order
and took our rightful place as the most dynamic country in the
world. And I firmly believe that history will record our era as
on of peace and global prosperity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, our task is far from over. Our friends in the other party
will never forgive us for our success and are doing everything
i their power to rewrite history. Listening to the liberals, you'd
think that the 1980s were the worst period since the Great Depression--filled
with greed and despair. Well you and I know better than that.
Although the political landscape has changed, the bold ideas of
the 1980s are alive and well. Republican candidates swept every
major election across the country last year. From New York to
Texas--from New Jersey to my home state of California. And as
a result, it seems that our opponents have finally realized how
unpopular liberalism really is. So now, they're trying to dress
their liberal agenda in a conservative overcoat. After watching
the State of the Union address the other night, I'm reminded of
the old adage that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Only in this case, it's not flattery, but grand larceny--the intellectual
theft of ideas that you and I recognize as our own. Speech delivery
counts for little on the world stage unless you have convictions
and, yes, the vision to see beyond the front row seats. The Democrats
may remember their lines, but how quickly they forget the lessons
of the past. I have witnessed five major wars in my lifetime,
and I know how swiftly storm clouds can gather on a peaceful horizon.
The next time a Saddam Hussein takes over a Kuwait, or North Korea
brandishes a nuclear weapon, will we be ready to respond?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the end, it all comes down to leadership. That is what this
country is looking for now. It was leadership here at home that
gave us strong American influence abroad and the collapse of imperial
communism. Great nations have responsibilities to lead and we
should always be cautious of those who would lower our profile
because they might just wind up lowering our flag.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, on a serious note, I would like to end by telling
you something Nancy and I have wanted to say to you for a long
time. During our years together here, as you know, things were
always on the move. As soon as we accomplished one objective,
we were quickly on to the next. There was rarely time to celebrate
victory or recall all the people who made it possible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, one of the benefits of retirement is you get a chance to
reflect back over the years. Since Nancy and I have returned to
California, we've spent many oaccasions looking back at what we
did here and remembering the extraordinary people who worked so
hard to make those great days possible. Ad we've wondered if we
would ever get the chance to thank them. You are those people--those
great individuals who gave so much of yourselves--who sacrificed
and supported us and helped us achieve everything we did. So,
I will conclude tonight by saying that the greatest gift I could
receive on my birthday is to be able to stand before each and
every one of you and convey in the only words I can how grateful
Nancy and I are: thank you for being there--and for being here.
And thank you for making this evening a memory I will cherish
forever. Until we meet again, God bless you, my friends.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>

<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>

is considered along with wage

<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government
<p>
<center>
<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.

<b><a name="Possibility Awaits">A GREATER POSSIBILITY AWAITS</a></b><br>

<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<i>"Any sales tax will inevitably become a<br> 
complex, pervasive, multi-rate value-added tax."</i><br>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."   
<p>

<b><a name="Tragic Irony">A TRAGIC IRONY</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.  
<p>	 
And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.  
<p>  
<center>
<b><a name="Flat-Tax">THE FLAT-TAX OPTION</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<H2>President Reagan's Speech at Pointe de Hoc</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ronald Reagan -- Pointe de Hoc, Normandy, June 6, 1984 (The 40th
anniversary of D-Day) <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied peoples
joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four
long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free
nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried
out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed
for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies
stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled
in human history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of
France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the
air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was
filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At
dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped
off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs.
Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the
invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out
the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest
of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches
to stop the Allied advance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers -- at the edge
of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns and throwing
grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope
ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves
up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one
rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb
again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon,
one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in
seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to
seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five
came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still
bear arms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that
were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the
men who put them there.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took
the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent.
These are the heroes who helped end a war.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender's
poem. You are men who in your 'lives fought for life...and left
the vivid air signed with your honor'...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here.
You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were
hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you.
Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled
you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your
lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies
that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer.
It was faith, and belief; it was loyalty and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right,
faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God
would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was
the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that
there is a profound moral difference between the use of force
for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here
to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not
doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country
is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because
it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised
by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight
tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind
you.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in this election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  If the answer is yes -- meaning that lower tax rates cause taxable income to rise -- it is reasonable to argue that a tax cut will be at least partially self-financing. The extent to which increased revenue from a bigger tax base helps offset the revenue loss from lower tax rates then becomes an empirical question. This is what "static" versus "dynamic" scoring is all about. Static analysis assumes that tax changes have no impact on economic growth, meaning no increases in revenue; dynamic analysis recognizes that taxes do affect the economy. Unfortunately, government estimators use a static approach.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The battle over revenue-estimating methodology may seem an esoteric, inside-the-Beltway issue, but it has important implications. Politicians generally favor tax cuts, but they do not relish voting for higher deficits and certainly are loathe to approve offsetting savings from the spending side of the budget. Dynamic scoring, assuming it is used properly, can facilitate sound tax policy by reducing the politically "unpleasant" side-effects of tax cuts.<sup>1</sup>  In the short term, a proper understanding of the importance of dynamic scoring would make it easier either to repeal the 1990 and 1993 tax hikes or to provide an across-the-board reduction in tax rates.<sup>2</sup>  In the long term, the move to a flat tax would be expedited if dynamic scoring were used to allow the lowest possible rate.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because dynamic scoring would make tax rate reductions more attractive, it is understandable that those who oppose tax cuts want to maintain the current system of static scoring. An objective examination of the historical evidence, however, demonstrates that dynamic scoring gives policymakers more accurate information.<sup>3</sup>  When taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating process, policymakers should consider the following points:<ul><p><li><b>Learn from history.</b> Static scoring routinely overestimates how much revenue will be generated by tax increases. The 1990 luxury tax, the income tax rate increases of 1990 and 1993, and the 1986 capital gains tax rate increase are all examples in which revenues fell far short of static predictions. By contrast, the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, the 1978 capital gains tax reduction, the Kennedy tax cuts of the 1960s, and the 1986 Tax Reform Act all demonstrate how pro-growth tax changes will generate revenue feedback.<sup>4</sup><p><li><b>Don't make the perfect the enemy of the good.</b> It is impossible to predict all the effects of any single change in government policy. The fact that dynamic scoring cannot pinpoint all the multiyear effects of a change in tax policy, however, is not an argument for maintaining a static process guaranteed to give an answer that is wrong and farther from the truth.

<P><LI><B>Not all tax cuts are created equal.</b> The higher the tax rate, the bigger the supply-side response when the rate is reduced. Likewise, reducing tax rates on capital income, which is more easily controlled by the taxpayer, will have a greater impact than similar tax reductions on labor income. And some tax cuts, such as credits, will have little or no revenue feedback effects since incentives to engage in productive behavior remain unchanged.<sup>5</sup><p><li><b>Open the process to public scrutiny.</b> Even though they are the ones who pay the bills, taxpayers today are not allowed to examine the static models and methodology used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department. Whether or not the revenue-estimating process is improved, policymakers should insist on full disclosure. If policymakers adopt dynamic scoring, an open process will keep the system honest by inhibiting those who are tempted to exaggerate the benefits of tax cuts.

<p><li><b>The goal of tax policy is to maximize growth, not tax revenues.</b> For years, budget deficits have played a big role in the political debate. As a result, some tax policy proposals, such as reductions in the capital gains tax, are judged primarily by their effect on tax collections. This myopic approach inevitably interferes with sound tax policy and should be discarded.

<p><li><b>Include estimates of private and governmental compliance costs.</b> According to the Tax Foundation, the current tax system imposes $225 billion in compliance costs on the productive sector of the economy.<sup>6</sup>  In addition to these private costs of lawyers, lobbyists, accountants, tax preparers, and lost man-hours, about $13 billion in direct government expenditures is associated with taxation.<sup>7</sup>  Yet revenue estimators confess that "staff does not estimate the administrative costs incurred by either the IRS or taxpayers that may result from proposed legislation."<sup>8</sup></ul><p><b>WHAT IS STATIC SCORING, AND WHO DOES IT?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two official sources of revenue estimates in Washington. The Administration uses the Office of Tax Analysis (OTA), which is part of the Treasury Department, and Congress uses the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). Both use static scoring, though it is important to define the term.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Static scoring does not mean there is absolutely no recognition that taxpayers might modify their behavior in response to changes in tax policy. Defenders of the status quo thus argue that dynamic effects are incorporated into revenue forecasts. To a limited extent, they are right.<sup>9</sup>  If asked to estimate the revenue impact of a change in the gasoline tax, for instance, the current process attempts to measure the degree to which the change in the tax will affect the amount of gasoline purchased. Likewise, changes in income tax rates will include some calculation of tax avoidance behavior.<sup>10</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Missing from the equation, however, is any effort to capture the revenue effects caused by changes in macroeconomic variables. Revenue estimators assume that economic growth, job creation, and income will remain unchanged, regardless of how much taxes are reduced or increased. The Treasury Department's Office of Tax Analysis, for example, in a 1995 analysis of the flat tax wrote that:
<blockquote>
	no attempt is made to estimate the tax-induced behavioral responses of either individuals or corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating conventions used by both the Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the macroeconomic aggregates, such as the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product, have been assumed to be unchanged by the proposal.<sup>11</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These assumptions effectively require the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation to ignore the real world. This may be a reasonable approach for minor alterations of the tax code,<sup>12</sup> but it certainly produces inaccurate answers when examining significant changes. Thus, if asked to predict what would happen if tax rates were doubled, for instance, revenue estimators would assume that tax collections, with some minor modifications, would double as well. Some may think this is an exaggeration, but consider the actions of the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 1988, Senator Robert Packwood (R-OR), ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, asked the JCT to estimate the revenue impact if the government confiscated all income over $200,000 annually.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue estimators at JCT responded that such a tax would raise $104 billion the first year, $204 billion the second year, $232 billion the third year, and $263 billion and $299 billion in the fourth and fifth years, respectively.<sup>13</sup>  As Senator Packwood noted, however, this view of the world is impractical because it "assumes people will work if they have to pay all their money to the Government. They will work forever and pay all of the money to the Government when clearly anyone in their right mind will not."<sup>14</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be fair, the revenue estimators are not really the ones at fault.<sup>15</sup>  The decision to modernize and improve the scoring process will have to come from the top. At the Office of Tax Analysis, presidentially appointed officials at the Treasury Department are the only ones with the power to authorize this change. On Capitol Hill, this power lies with the Members of Congress who serve on the Joint Committee on Taxation, particularly the Chairman and Vice-Chairman. Indeed, the JCT has set up a Revenue Estimating Advisory Board to explore "ways to improve the estimating process and estimating methodology."<sup>16</sup><p><b>WHAT IS DYNAMIC SCORING?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In simple terms, dynamic scoring means that estimates would be designed to capture revenue effects from changes in overall economic conditions. Instead of deliberately ignoring these variables, as is the convention today, revenue estimators would predict whether a change in policy would be likely to affect the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product (GDP). If there is an effect on one or more of these variables, they would then calculate the amount of revenue feedback or loss.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How would this work?  Take the example of the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut proposed some weeks ago by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Static revenue estimates reportedly show this proposal reducing tax revenues by about $500 billion over a six-year period.<sup>17</sup>  If such a proposal boosted the economy's rate of growth by one-half of one percentage point over the same period, however, Congressional Budget Office sensitivity tables (designed to measure the effects of selected economic changes on budget projections) indicate that $170 billion of that loss would be recouped in the form of revenue feedback and lower interest costs. Administration figures show the feedback would be more than $200 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090t1.gif">Table 1</a>, both the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) agree that faster growth helps reduce the budget deficit. These numbers work both ways, incidentally, with slower growth boosting the budget deficit. The key questions are whether a change in tax policy will promote growth and, if so, by how much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Contrary to popular wisdom, dynamic scoring does not mean that tax cuts pay for themselves. The degree of revenue feedback depends on what tax rate is being reduced and by what amount. Only in extremely rare circumstances is it believed that a tax rate reduction will generate enough economic activity to offset all of the revenue loss associated with the lower rate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c1.gif">Chart 1</a>, popularly known as the Laffer curve, illustrates this principle. A zero rate tax will stimulate considerable growth but, by definition, collects no revenue. A 100 percent tax rate also generates no revenue, however, because it eliminates all incentive to earn income -- not to mention what happens to the rest of the economy. What happens, though, if the government imposes a tax rate of, say, 10 percent?  With a low, flat rate, almost all taxpayers presumably will continue to work, so the government will collect one-tenth of the income earned. As tax rates rise, however, taxpayers gradually become discouraged and reduce their earnings. As long as tax rates are not excessive, the increase in revenue associated with the higher tax rate exceeds the revenue loss caused by lower levels of income. At some point, however, the tax rate reaches a revenue-maximizing level. Any efforts to raise tax rates beyond this level will reduce revenues because of the fall in taxable income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Tragically, there are some taxes in America that fall on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. These include:<ul>

<p><li><b>Income tax rates on the rich.</b> Wealthy taxpayers are particularly sensitive to high tax rates. Not only can they afford the best tax lawyers, accountants, and financial planners, but they also receive most of their income in the form of dividends, interest, capital gains, and other business income (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). When tax rates become too onerous, these taxpayers can shift their assets to tax-free status, move their money offshore, or take other steps to alter the timing or composition of their income.<sup>18</sup>  According to recent research by James Poterba of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, lower tax rates on the richest 0.5 percent would generate higher rather than lower tax revenues.<sup>19</sup>

<p><li><b>Estate taxes.</b> The government confiscates 55 percent of a person's assets in excess of $4 million upon death.<sup>20</sup>  Those smart enough to build up businesses and portfolios of this value, however, typically are also smart enough to protect their families' wealth from the government.<sup>21</sup>  Thus, even though the estate tax collects about $15 billion annually, it is estimated that the government loses money because of reduced income tax collections caused by aggressive estate planning (which occurs in the years prior to death when wealthy taxpayers transfer funds, cease working, set up trusts, give to charity, and take other steps to reduce the tax value of their assets).<sup>22</sup><p><li><b>Capital gains taxes.</b> Revenue estimators from both Congress and the Administration acknowledge that lower capital gains taxes will boost sales (or realizations) of stock, bonds, real estate, and other assets. This "unlocking effect," by itself, may be large enough to produce a net revenue increase.<sup>23</sup>  Unfortunately, both the JCT and the OTA fail to calculate the impact of lower capital gains taxes on economic growth. If the revenue estimates included the effects of higher growth, they almost surely would show a significant revenue gain.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tax rates that are so punitive that they actually lose revenue certainly should be reduced. The lower rate would please conservatives who favor economic growth, and should please liberals who want the government to collect more money.<sup>24</sup>  It is important to recognize, however, that there is a huge difference between the revenue-maximizing tax rate and the growth-maximizing tax rate. Largely because of hefty value-added taxes (a form of national sales tax), many countries in Europe take a much higher percentage of their citizens' money than America does.<sup>25</sup>  These nations may be near the revenue-maximizing point of the Laffer curve, but it comes at a heavy price. European countries, compared to the United States, suffer from higher unemployment, slower growth, larger budget deficits, and lower incomes.

<p>

<b>HISTORICAL EXAMPLES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The strong theoretical argument for dynamic scoring is augmented by a great deal of historical evidence. The United States has experienced significant shifts in tax policy over the years, and the historical record both demonstrates the shortcomings of static analysis and provides ample proof that the revenue-estimating process should be modernized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before looking at specific examples, however, it may be useful to look at the broad picture. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c3.gif">Chart 3</a> illustrates, tax revenues traditionally have consumed about 19 percent of America's economic output.<sup>26</sup>  This relationship has been remarkably stable even though tax rates have shifted by large amounts. At times, the top income tax rate has exceeded 90 percent, while at other times it has fallen to less than 30 percent. The chart also shows income tax collections as a percentage of GDP. As is the case with total tax revenues, income tax collections are remarkably stable, hovering between 8 percent and 9 percent. The only two times they reached 9.4 percent or more, in 1969 and 1981, the economy fell into recession.<sup>27</sup><p><b>The Tax Cuts of the 1920s.</b> Tax rates were slashed dramatically during the 1920s, falling from 73 percent to 24 percent.<sup>28</sup>  The economy boomed, growing at an average annual rate of 6 percent between 1921 and 1929.<sup>29</sup>  Personal income tax revenues increased substantially, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928.<sup>30</sup>  This 61 percent increase in revenue occurred at a time of no inflation. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows, the percentage of the tax burden borne by the rich jumped dramatically, climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. These results, not surprisingly, would not have been predicted by static analysis.<p><b>The Kennedy Tax Cuts.</b> Lower taxes on savings and investment were approved in 1962, followed by across-the-board tax rate reductions in 1964. Economic growth picked up, with GDP increasing at an average annual rate of 5 percent between 1961 and 1968.<sup>31</sup>  The Kennedy tax cuts triggered the longest expansion in America's history, and revenues grew by 62 percent over the seven-year period.<sup>32</sup>  One of the most compelling pieces of supply-side evidence is the way different income groups responded to lower tax rates. As seen in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, wealthy taxpayers wound up paying significantly more tax revenues after their tax rates were reduced -- exactly as dynamic forecasting would have predicted.
<p>
<b>The 1978 Capital Gains Tax Cut.</b> The more control a taxpayer has over a taxable activity, the more pronounced the supply-side effect. Capital gains taxes are the best example of this phenomenon since a taxpayer can avoid the tax by not selling assets. In 1968, legislation was approved raising the capital gains tax from 25 percent to 49 percent. (Effective tax rates almost always were higher--sometimes over 100 percent -- since the government did not, and still does not, allow taxpayers to adjust asset prices for inflation.) Not surprisingly, capital gains revenues were sluggish throughout the 1970s. In 1978, however, the rate was reduced to 28 percent.<sup>33</sup>  The very next year, revenues jumped 45 percent.<sup>34</sup>  Capital gains tax revenues continued to rise, climbing even more when the Reagan tax cuts lowered the rate even further, down to 20 percent in 1981.<p>
<b>Windfall Profits Tax.</b> During the Carter Administration, a heavy tax was imposed on crude oil. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 1979 that the tax would collect $184.5 billion between 1980 and 1985. But it brought in just $77.7 billion.<sup>35</sup>  To be fair, the huge revenue gap probably was due to President Reagan's decision to decontrol oil prices, something the JCT could not have predicted in 1979. At the same time, however, foreknowledge of this move may have caused the revenue estimators to make an even bigger mistake, since most liberals believed that restoring competition to the petroleum market would cause oil prices to skyrocket.<sup>36</sup><p><b>The Reagan Tax Cuts.</b> Campaigning on across-the-board tax cuts, Ronald Reagan took office at a time when the economy was in horrible shape. The economy was in the middle of a severe double-dip recession. Inflation was running at double-digit rates, unemployment was rising, and interest rates had climbed to more than 20 percent.<sup>37</sup>  Critics claimed the tax cuts would be inflationary and would do nothing to boost growth, but just the opposite happened. Americans did not receive a net tax cut until sometime between July 1982 and January 1983 because previously legislated payroll tax increases and bracket creep offset the portions of the tax cut that took effect in 1981 and 1982.<sup>38</sup>  Once the tax cuts did take effect, the longest peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history began.<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The most comprehensive analysis of the revenue effect of the Reagan tax cuts shows two things: The lower tax rates on the rich more than paid for themselves, and there were substantial feedback effects from lower tax rates on other income classes as well (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c6.gif">Chart 6</a>). Defenders of high tax rates condemn the Reagan program, noting that tax revenues in the early 1980s were well below the Administration's original projections.<sup>40</sup>  But this reasoning is seriously flawed. First, it blames the tax cuts for the second half of the double-dip recession of 1980-1982, a drop in the economy that began before the economy received a tax cut. Second, it fails to recognize the irony that two-thirds of the revenue shortfall occurred because inflation was reduced much faster than was originally thought.<sup>41</sup>  Significantly, the forecast of the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office closely matched the Administration's.<sup>42</sup><p><b>The 1986 Tax Reform Act.</b> This legislation provides one of the best examples of why dynamic forecasting is needed. The Tax Reform Act lowered tax rates on individual income and increased the tax burden on corporate income.<sup>43</sup>  According to the static estimates, the shift in taxes amounted to more than $100 billion over the five-year period. Actual tax collections, however, showed a very clear and pronounced supply-side effect. As taxpayers responded to lower rates, individual income tax revenues grew faster than expected, nearly 6 percent above projections. The higher tax burden on corporate income, meanwhile, had the opposite effect. Corporate income tax receipts were very sluggish, falling nearly 25 percent below the static estimates.<sup>44</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The divergent responses of personal and corporate income tax collections are critical. Defenders of static forecasting always try to argue that the dynamic effects are a coincidence. The booming economy and rapid revenue growth of the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s, for instance, are said to have had nothing to do with lower tax rates. Likewise, the economy's poor performance during the 1930s, 1970s, and 1990s is said to be just bad fortune completely unrelated to higher tax rates. These arguments fall apart when analyzing the Tax Reform Act, since it is impossible to blame sluggish corporate tax collections on a weak economy while at the same time claiming that strong personal tax collections are the result of a strong economy.
<p>
<b>The 1986 Capital Gains Tax Rate Increase.</b> As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, policymakers increased the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 28 percent. Two noteworthy things happened. Capital gains realizations (asset sales) and revenues soared before the tax rate increase took effect and then collapsed by more than 50 percent when the higher rate took effect.<sup>45</sup>  When the Congressional Budget Office put together its revenue baseline in 1990, however, it assumed that capital gains realizations would grow at the same rate they did during the early 1980s when the tax rate was low. This proved to be a huge error. In fact, the high capital gains tax discouraged asset sales, and realizations were stagnant, usually less than half of CBO's projections.<sup>46</sup>  Moreover, the Joint Committee on Taxation used this inflated baseline in 1990 to put together static revenue estimates suggesting that a reduction in the rate would lose money and primarily benefit the wealthy. But the 1986 increase in the capital gains tax rate actually hurt middle-income taxpayers more than the rich, since the tax rate on their gains rose from 14 percent to 28 percent.<sup>47</sup><p><b>The Luxury Tax.</b> The 1990 budget agreement included provisions imposing excise taxes on products thought to be purchased by the "rich," including luxury boats and private airplanes. These taxes backfired so badly that Congress repealed them. Actual collections from the boat tax reached $32.5 million, according to the Treasury Department, far below the $53 million originally forecast.<sup>48</sup>  The Joint Committee on Taxation, meanwhile, admitted that the airplane tax collected just 10 percent of the static estimate.<sup>49</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of the tax have tried to argue that the revenue shortfall was coincidental,<sup>50</sup> but the actual effects are even worse than these numbers indicate. When boat builders lost their jobs and boatyards shut down, the federal government lost income and payroll taxes and also had to pay out unemployment benefits.<sup>51</sup>  The static estimates recognized that some people might have lost jobs as a result of the tax but assumed that those workers would immediately get jobs someplace else paying the same wage.<sup>52</sup>  Life in the real world, unfortunately, does not operate as flawlessly as these static blackboard models.<p><b>The Bush Tax Rate Increase.</b> In 1990, President Bush reneged on his no-new-taxes promise and signed into law a major tax increase, including an increase in the top rate from 28 percent to 31 percent. Rather than bring in new revenues, however, the government began to collect less revenue than was projected before tax rates were increased.<sup>53</sup>  In 1991 alone, revenues fell by more than $6 for every $1 the tax increase was supposed to generate.<sup>54</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of static scoring admit this happened but blame the stagnant economy for the drop in revenues. Since the tax increase certainly helped throw the economy into the tank, however, this excuse rings hollow. Even if one accepts the unlikely assumption that the tax increase had nothing to do with the recession, there are other compelling numbers showing the dynamic effect. In 1991, income tax receipts from those making more than $200,000 fell by more than 6 percent.<sup>55</sup>  Yet tax collections from those making less than that rose by 1 percent. In other words, the government wound up collecting less in revenue from the taxpayers who were slapped with higher tax rates, but collecting more from those whose taxes did not go up.
<p>
<b>The 1993 Clinton Tax Rate Increase.</b> Without a vote to spare in either the House or the Senate, President Clinton during his first year in office imposed the largest tax increase in history. His increase in tax rates, from 31 percent to 39.6 percent,<sup>56</sup> was the biggest jump since Herbert Hoover boosted the rate from 25 percent to 63 percent in 1930. Harvard economist Martin Feldstein estimates that the tax rate increase raised only one-third of the promised revenue.<sup>57</sup>  The combined effect of the Bush and Clinton tax rate increases has been an utter failure. As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c7.gif">Chart 7</a>, revenues from the personal income tax actually have declined as a percentage of economic output since Reagan left office.<sup>58</sup><p><b>REVENUE ESTIMATES AND THE FLAT TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The perils and pitfalls of static forecasting are clearly evident in the flat tax debate. Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) resuscitated the idea of moving to a simple and fair one-rate tax system in 1994. Almost immediately, the proposal was attacked by the Administration. Shortly before the mid-term elections that year, the press reported a Treasury Department estimate that the flat tax would require a rate of 25.8 percent to be revenue neutral.<sup>59</sup>  Six months later, the Administration criticized the flat tax yet again, but this time charged that the rate would have to be 22.9 percent to avoid increasing the deficit.<sup>60</sup>  More recently, the Treasury Department issued its third static estimate of the flat tax, this time claiming that the revenue neutral rate would be 20.8 percent.<sup>61</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton Administration's inability to settle on a single rate is instructive for two reasons. It demonstrates that even static revenue estimates, which involve more simplistic calculations, are far from exact. Even more important, the White House inadvertently has provided compelling evidence for the flat tax. The Treasury Department's most recent estimate, predicting a revenue neutral rate of 20.8 percent, is still exaggerated.<sup>62</sup>  But it confirms that Representative Armey's 20 percent flat tax, which includes $40 billion in budgetary savings,<sup>63</sup> is deficit-neutral -- even using static analysis.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, dynamic estimates of the flat tax, using more sophisticated econometric and modeling techniques, find that growth increases significantly. This additional growth, as illustrated earlier, results in substantial revenue increases. An important question, of course, is who benefits from the economy's expansion. Representative Armey and Senate co-sponsor Richard Shelby (R-AL) believe that taxpayers should reap the benefit of faster growth. As a result, they reduce the flat rate to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Numerous studies support the contention that the economy will expand dramatically if the existing tax code is replaced by a single-rate flat tax. For example:<UL>

<p><li>Professor Dale Jorgenson, Chairman of the Economics Department at Harvard, testified before the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform that a single-rate system could boost the economy by 15 percent or more within a decade.<sup>64</sup><p><li>University of California professor Alan Auerbach, formerly an economist with the Joint Committee on Taxation, estimates that the economy would be 5.7 percent larger within five years with a flat tax.<sup>65</sup><p><li>Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, a former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has testified that a flat tax would boost growth by 10 percent within ten years.<sup>66</sup><p><li>Even without growth effects, two former Treasury Department economists estimate that a flat tax would be revenue neutral at 17 percent.<sup>67</sup><p><li>Boston University economist Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that a move to a single-rate tax that does not double-tax capital income would raise living standards by between 7 percent and 14 percent.<sup>68</sup><p><li>A study by two academic economists found that a 17 percent flat tax would boost growth so much that tax revenues would increase by 1.8 percentage points.<sup>69</sup></ul><p><b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT DYNAMIC SCORING</b><p><b><i>Q: Will lower tax rates reduce the underground economy, and will dynamic forecasting reflect this shift?</i><p>A:</b> Yes, but probably not enough to affect revenue forecasts. By definition, measuring the size of the underground economy is difficult. Those that have tried have produced estimates ranging from a low of 5 percent of GDP to a high of more than 25 percent of GDP.<sup>70</sup>  An added problem is that no one knows how much of the underground economy exists for the purpose of evading taxes. It is safe to assume that most drug dealers, bookies, and prostitutes do not pay taxes, but that will not change if tax rates are lowered. For activities that are legal, however, lower tax rates would reduce tax evasion. The American Bar Association conducted a three-year study which concluded that lower tax rates encourage greater compliance.<sup>71</sup><p><b><i>Q: What safeguards would be needed to ensure that the party in power did not abuse dynamic forecasts?</i><p>A:</b> This is a legitimate concern. Politicians often exaggerate the benefits of legislation they support, and it does not take a wild imagination to envision revenue estimators pressured to produce excessively optimistic numbers. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, was often accused of tailoring its figures to help the Democrats when they were in the majority.<sup>72</sup>  This is why public disclosure of the model and methodology is so important. If outside experts were allowed to review all decisions, the potential for mischief would shrink dramatically.<sup>73</sup><p><b><i>Q: Should there be dynamic forecasts of spending legislation?</i><p>A:</b> If the scientific evidence is clear, the answer is yes. Considerable research has been done to show that government spending, particularly for consumption items, is a drag on economic growth.<sup>74</sup><p>Incorporating this new research into budget analysis would help policymakers make proper decisions. As with dynamic scoring of tax legislation, full disclosure is critical. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, used a version of dynamic scoring during the debate over the 1995 Balanced Budget Act. Unfortunately, in predicting dramatic reductions in interest rates following enactment of legislation to reduce budget deficits,<sup>75</sup> the CBO was almost surely wrong.<sup>76</sup>  If the CBO had to publish its analyses and defend them before outside experts, estimators would be forced to refine and improve their techniques.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the post-Reagan years, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.<sup>77</sup>  The average family has lost more than $2,000 of real purchasing power,<sup>78</sup> and there is little reason for optimism about the future. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth over the next ten years will average only 2.1 percent if current tax and spending policies are maintained.<sup>79</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America can do better. From the end of World War II until the end of the Reagan years, the economy's growth rate averaged well over 3 percent -- and that includes recession years.<sup>80</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To get America growing again, tax policy will have to change. In the short term, immediate tax rate reductions are needed to boost growth; in the long term, the entire tax code should be replaced by a simple, flat tax. Unfortunately, these pro-growth changes will be harder to achieve if revenue estimators continue to use outdated and inaccurate static models. Dynamic revenue estimates, by contrast, would provide policymakers with more accurate information. Dynamic forecasting is based on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and history has shown this approach to be far more realistic.
<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><ol>

<p><li>     It is conventional wisdom that voting for lower spending is bad politics. This fear may or may not be justified, but it certainly is true that lower spending is good economics. Ideally, lawmakers would want to reduce both taxes and spending as part of an overall effort to boost growth and enhance freedom.<p><li>    Harvard Professor Martin Feldstein, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, estimates that repeal of the higher tax rates approved in 1993 would result in a revenue loss of less than $10 billion, or less than one-third of the static estimate. For further detail, see Martin Feldstein, "The Case for Dynamic Analysis," <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, December 14, 1994.
   <p><li> Somewhat startlingly, an opponent of tax rate reductions admitted recently that the revenue feedback effect of lower tax rates was 35 percent. See Lawrence Chimerine, "Return of the Supply-Siders," <i>The Washington Post</i>, July 23, 1996.

 <p><li>   When estimating the effect of higher tax rates in 1993, the JCT examined several non-macroeconomic factors, such as "shifting from investments which yield interest and dividend income, taxed at the new higher rates, into investments that provide capital appreciation, which is taxed at unchanged lower rates. Also considered were shifts from taxable to tax-exempt assets, conversion to C corporation business form, conversion of wage income into tax-deferred compensation or tax-exempt fringe benefits, and increased noncompliance and avoidance." All these factors, however, only reduced the pure static revenue loss by 7 percent over the five-year period.

When Senator Packwood made a similar request in 1994, the committee responded by reporting the amount of after-tax income over $200,000 while noting that "If the 100-percent tax rate were to be in effect for a substantial period of time, so that taxpayers would have no rational hope of avoiding or evading the 100-percent tax in the outyears by deferring income to lower rate years or using other tax avoidance or deferral plans, then in our judgment there would be a substantial reduction in income-producing activity in the economy and, thus, a significant reduction in tax receipts to the Federal government."

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
     Overtaxed American families finally have reason to cheer. There
is growing bipartisan sentiment in favor of passing tax cuts for
families with dependent children as part of next year's budget.
Congressional Republicans recently announced their commitment to
reintroducing next year the $500-per-child tax cut they proposed in
this year's Republican budget alternative. Also, reports now indicate
that there is renewed White House interest ("Clinton Still Favors
Middle-Class Tax Cut Despite Broken Vow," The Washington Times,
September 7, 1994. See also David Wessel, "For Clinton, the Politics
of a Tax Cut Are Sure to Clash With the Economics," The Wall Street
Journal, September 6, 1994; Hobart Rowen, "Economic, Political
Advisers Collide Over Clinton's Middle-Class Tax Cut," The Washington
Post, September 11, 1994.) in fulfilling Bill Clinton's campaign
promise to "grant additional tax relief to families with children."
(Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Putting People First (New York: Times
Books, 1992), p. 100.) Though skeptical voters may see such reports as
merely election year politics, there seems to be sufficient common
ground to give struggling families hope that tax cuts could move to
the top of Washington's agenda next year.<P>
     There are sound reasons why Washington should quit talking about
cutting taxes for families and take the necessary action to make it a
reality:
<P>
Families with children are overtaxed. In 1948, the average American
     family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to Uncle
     Sam. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent. (This figure
     includes federal income and Social Security payroll taxes.)
<P>
Families have been taxed out of house and home. The average family now
     loses $10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase
     in federal taxes as a share of family income. This tax loss
     exceeds the annual cost of the average family home. (For more
     information, see Robert Rector, "Reducing the Crushing Tax Burden
     on America's Families," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 981,
     March 7, 1994.)
<P>
Millions of families stand to benefit. The families of 52 million
     American children, or 60 million families, are eligible for a
     $500-per-child tax credit.
<P>
Tax cuts are good for low-income families. A $500-per-child tax credit
     would eliminate the entire federal tax burden for 4.7 million
     working families.
<P>
Most families are middle-class. Nearly 86 percent of all children live
     in families with incomes below $75,000 per year -- middle-income
     by any standard -- and some 94 percent live in families with
     incomes below $100,000.
<P>
Cutting taxes for all families -- regardless of income -- is fair. A
     $500-per-child tax credit would give a family of four earning
     $18,000 per year a 33 percent tax cut and a family earning
     $40,000 per year a 10 percent tax cut, while giving a family
     earning $200,000 per year a cut of only 1.5 percent.
<P>
Family tax relief is good politics. The typical congressional district
     has some 117,000 children eligible for a $500 tax credit. This
     means families in the typical district would receive $59 million
     per year in tax relief.
<P>
     The family is the core of American society. It is the principal
mechanism through which values, knowledge, discipline, and motivation
are passed from one generation to the next. If the family is weakened,
government programs cannot repair the damage. But government policies,
especially tax policies, are undermining the American family. The
ever-increasing tax burden on families with children must be reversed
if American society is to regain its health and vitality.
<P>
<B> BIPARTISAN TALK OF TAX CUTS </B><P>
     During the presidential campaign, candidate Clinton promised to
reduce the taxes paid by families with children. "Virtually every
industrialized nation recognizes the importance of strong families in
its tax code; we should too," declared Clinton. "We will lower the tax
burden on middle class Americans.... " ("Putting People First: A
National Economic Strategy for America," Clinton campaign document,
1992, p. 9.)<P>
     Until recently, President Clinton has ignored that pledge to
relieve Washington's tax burden on working families with children. On
the contrary, Clinton last year signed the largest tax increase in
American history. As a result, taxpayers this year will send some $35
billion in extra taxes to Washington.<P>
     Families with children could have been spared this new burden. In
March, the Democrat-controlled Congress rejected the $500-per-child
tax credit plan contained in the fiscal 1995 budget alternative
proposed by House and Senate Republicans. Had it passed, some 60
million American families could have deducted $500 per year from their
tax bill for each child.<P>
     The Republican tax cut plan was financed through cuts in
government spending and thus would have had no impact on the federal
budget deficit. Over five years, implementing a $500-per-child tax
credit would reduce federal tax revenues by some $108 billion. This
revenue loss, however, would be fully matched by reductions in federal
spending. Thus, the deficit would neither increase nor decrease.
     House Republicans recently announced that they will reintroduce
this plan in next year's budget. Coincidentally, perhaps, the White
House reportedly is considering tax cuts for families with children
"when the time is right." (Steven Pearlstein, "Election Year Has White
House Pondering Tax Cut Politics," The Washington Post, September 9,
1994.)<P>
     The time is right for families who have seen their income tax
burden grow by over 300 percent during the past 45 years. Since there
is growing bipartisan sentiment for family tax cuts, now would be the
time for the White House and Members of Congress to promise American
families that they will include, at a minimum, a $500-per-child tax
credit in next year's budget.
<P>
<B> HOW WASHINGTON HAS HIKED TAXES ON CHILDREN </B><P>
<I>(This section is derived largely from Robert Rector, "How to
Strengthen America's Crumbling Families," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 894, April 28, 1992.)
</I><P>
     Federal taxation of families with children has increased
dramatically over the past four decades. In 1948, the typical family
of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the federal government in
direct taxes. In 1992, the equivalent family paid nearly 24.5 percent
of its income to the federal government. As Chart 1 shows, when state
and local and indirect federal taxes are included, the tax burden on
that family equals 37.6 percent of its income.<P>
     Federal income taxes have risen much faster for families with
children in the last four decades than for other groups of Americans.
The root cause of this growing anti-family bias in the federal income
tax code is the eroding value of the personal exemption. The personal
exemption for children was intended to offset part of the annual costs
of raising a child by allowing families to deduct an amount of money
from their taxable income. In 1948, the personal exemption was $600.
This was equal to roughly 17 percent of the median income of a family
of four, then $3,468. This shielded 68 percent of that family's income
from federal income tax. Families could protect most of the remaining
32 percent by itemizing deductions or by taking the standard
deduction. The result: in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the average
family with children paid little or no income tax.<P>
     In the past four decades, however, increases in the personal
exemption have lagged far behind the rise in incomes and inflation. As
the value of the personal exemption has declined, the income tax paid
by families with children has increased. For the personal exemption
today to have the same value relative to family income that it had in
1948, it would have to had been $7,000 in 1992 and would have to rise
to $8,000 in 1996.<P>
     The second tax blow to family finances has been the increase in
Social Security taxes, technically known as "payroll taxes." In 1948,
workers paid a two percent Social Security tax on annual wages of up
to $3,000; one percent was paid directly by the employee and one
percent indirectly by the employer through the so-called employer
share. (Liberal and conservative economists agree that both shares of
the Social Security tax are in fact taxes on workers' wages. See
Joseph A. Pechman and Benjamin A. Okner, Who Bears the Tax Burden?
(Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, 1974), pp. 25-43.)<P>
     By 1992, combined Social Security taxes had risen to 15 percent
of wages on incomes up to $55,500. While all workers have suffered
from skyrocketing payroll taxes, the burden has been most severe for
working families with children. The reason for this is that Social
Security taxes, unlike regular income taxes, are not adjusted for the
number of dependents in the family. So a working parent trying to
support a family of four feels the sting of this tax far more sharply
than a single person at the same wage level. The effect of Social
Security taxation is particularly severe on lower-income parents; a
family with an income of $25,000 per year, for instance, pays $3,750
in payroll taxes.<P>
     The Government Assault on Family Income. Chart 2 shows the growth
in direct federal taxes as a share of median family income. In 1948,
effective tax rates equaled 3 percent of income for the average family
of four. By 1970, they had risen to 16 percent; by 1992, to 24.5
percent.<P>
     The income loss due to increased taxation has seriously strained
American family finances and profoundly affected American family life.
Chart 3 shows the effects of increases in federal income and Social
Security taxes since 1948 on the finances of the average family. Total
pre-tax income for the median family of four in 1992 was $47,787.
(Data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Total pre-tax income
includes the employer share of Social Security tax deduction from the
worker's wages.) After taxes, this family's income fell to $36,915. If
federal taxes as a percentage of family income were restored to 1948
levels, the family's post-tax income would have been $10,060 higher,
or $46,975. In other words, the loss of income in 1992 because of the
increase in federal taxes as a share of family income, due to the
falling value of the personal exemption and the rise in Social
Security taxes since the late 1940s, was $10,060.<P>
     This income loss severely affects the ability of families to
support themselves. The median price of a single-family home purchased
in 1992, for instance, was $103,700. The average annual mortgage
payment on such a home (including principal and interest) was $7,380.
Thus, the annual family income loss due to increased federal tax rates
for the average family in the last four decades actually exceeds the
annual cost of an average home mortgage by 36 percent.
<P>
<B> THE SOLUTION: TAX CREDITS FOR CHILDREN</B>
 <P>    There are two practical ways to reduce the tax burden on families
with children: first, by increasing the value of the personal
exemption and, second, through the use of tax credits. Although many
positive arguments can be made for increasing the personal exemption,
the tax credit is better policy in the long run because it is less
complex and because it can be used more effectively to reduce the tax
burden on lower-income working families.
  <P>   With an income tax exemption, income equal to the amount of the
exemption is excluded from tax. Thus, for a family in the 15 percent
income tax bracket, a $500 increase in the personal exemption
decreases income taxes owed by $75. A $1,000 increase in the
exemption, as some have proposed, decreases a family's tax burden by
$150. 
   <P>  By contrast, under a tax credit, the amount of the credit is
deducted from taxes paid, directly reducing tax liability. Thus, for
the same family in the 15 percent income tax bracket, a $500 credit
decreases net taxes by $500. Another important difference between the
credit and the increased exemption is that a tax credit can be applied
to both income and Social Security taxes (both the employer's and
employee's share). Because the current personal exemption, now set at
$2,350, is already sufficient to eliminate most or all of the income
tax liability for many low-income families, increasing its value will
protect no more of their income from the IRS. A credit, though, could
relieve this family's income tax liability and offset a portion of its
Social Security taxes.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four with a gross earned income of $20,000 has a
     total federal tax liability of $3,615: $555 in income taxes and
     $3,060 in payroll taxes (both shares). A $1,000 increase in the
     personal exemption for children would reduce this family's tax
     burden by only $300 ($150 for each child), a tax cut of less than
     10 percent. However, a $500-per-child tax credit would reduce the
     family's total tax bill by $1,000, enough to eliminate their
     income tax burden and reduce their Social Security taxes by an
     additional $445. Overall, they would see their total federal tax
     burden reduced by over 27 percent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> The $500-per-child Tax Credit is Not Refundable</B>
  <P>   When Republicans proposed the $500-per-child tax credit during
this spring's budget debate, the White House and congressional
Democrats argued that such a credit was not needed because they had
expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the 1993 tax bill.
This expanded EITC, they said, delivered tax cuts to millions of
working families with children. Such a claim is misleading and ignores
the difference between a wage subsidy and a tax cut.
  <P>   The EITC is a wage supplement for working families with children
with incomes up to $26,000 per year. It is intended to offset the
Social Security tax burden on these families and increase their wages
through a cash subsidy. As shown in Chart 4, the amount of cash
returned to some families through the EITC can exceed their entire tax
burden. Technically, this means the EITC is "refundable."
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four earning $14,000 (slightly below the official
     poverty level) will pay no income taxes but will bear a Social
     Security tax burden of roughly $2,140. This family is eligible to
     receive, however, some $2,400 from the EITC, nearly $260 more
     than their entire tax burden. For some working families, the cash
     value of the EITC can exceed their entire federal tax liability
     by as much as 60 percent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
     By contrast, the $500-per-child tax credit is not refundable.
This means that the value of a family's tax relief may not exceed
their tax burden. However, as Chart 4 shows, low - and modest-income
families still would have a large share of their total tax burden
eased by such a credit.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four earning $17,000 per year may still have a
     total tax burden of roughly $840 after deductions and after
     receiving the EITC wage subsidy. Though a $500-per-child tax
     credit might otherwise give them $1,000 in total tax relief
     because of their two children, the fact that this credit is not
     refundable allows them to deduct only what they owe -- $840 --
     from their tax bill.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> Millions of Families Shielded from the IRS</B>
<P>     Some Democrats argued during last spring's budget debate that the
$500-per-child tax credit was not "fair" because families earning
below $16,000 per year would not get a tax cut. This argument is
ridiculous, as the preceding examples demonstrate. It is clearly
impossible to give a tax cut to families who not only do not pay in
federal taxes, but also stand to receive a substantial cash wage
subsidy from the federal government.
    <P> But for many low-income working families who do pay taxes, a $500
per-child tax credit would bring badly needed relief. Indeed,
according to The Heritage Foundation's tax simulation model, based
upon the U.S. Bureau of the Census 1992 Current Population Survey,
some 4.7 million working families would have their entire federal tax
liability eliminated if Congress enacted a $500-per-child tax credit.
  <P>   Millions of other low - or modest-income families might not have
their entire tax burden eliminated by such a credit, but they
certainly would see a dramatic decline in their tax bill, and thus a
dramatic increase in their take-home pay.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family earning $28,000 per year -- and not eligible for the
     EITC -- would have 57 percent of their income tax bill and 17
     percent of their total federal tax bill (income and payroll taxes
     totaling over $6,000) erased by a $500-per-child tax credit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> Tax Cuts for 60 Million Families</B>
  <P>   Nationwide, the families of some 52 million American children,
some 60 million families in all, would be eligible for such a $500-
per-child tax credit. Most of the families affected by such a tax cut
fall within what can be considered the middle class. Indeed, nearly 86
percent of all children in America live in families with gross annual
incomes below $75,000 per year -- middle-class by any standard. In
fact, some 94 percent of all children live in families with gross
annual incomes below $100,000. 
   <P>  Tax cuts would bring badly needed stability to many families'
finances. As Chart 5 shows, for the typical family of four earning
$40,000 per year, a $500-per-child tax cut would cut their $9,500
total tax bill by some 10.4 percent, enough to pay one month's
mortgage on the average home.
  <P>   Upper-middle-class families will receive more modest relief. A
family earning $75,000 per year loses nearly $20,000 (approximately 27
percent of their income) to the IRS each year. A $500 tax credit for
each child would mean only a 5 percent tax cut for this family.
<P>
<B> Family Tax Relief Should Not Be Means-Tested</B>
  <P>   Every working family raising the next generation of Americans is
overtaxed. Thus, every working family, regardless of income, should be
eligible for the $500-per-child tax credit. Many Democrat Members of
Congress have argued that giving the same amount of tax relief to
middle-income families as upper-income families is not "fair." They
argue that such a credit should be "means-tested," meaning that
eligibility for the credit should be limited to families within
specified income levels, such as families earning below $75,000 per
year.
 <P>    Means-testing the family tax credit would be a serious mistake.
The tax code should not penalize children simply because of the income
of their parents. (The Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) is not means-
tested. The credit is used by working families -- many of whom are
dual-income and prosperous -- who place their children in day care.)
Because of the nature of most working careers, very few children live
in upper-income families. In fact, fewer than 83,000 live in families
with annual incomes above $200,000 per year, just 0.17 percent of all
American families. (U. S. Bureau of the Census 1992 Current Population
Survey.) Most upper-income parents hit their full earning potential
well after their children become adults themselves.
  <P>   Because of this country's progressive tax system, in which
wealthier taxpayers face higher income tax rates and stingier
deductions, the IRS punishes upper-income families far more severely
than middle-income families. Chart 5 shows, for example, that a family
of four earning $200,000 per year loses 33 percent of its income to
Uncle Sam, almost 10 percent more than is paid by the typical American
family. 
  <P>   Even within this country's progressive tax structure, these
families should still be allowed to take a $500-per-child tax credit.
The reason: the credit is a progressive tax cut by definition. The
value of a $500 credit is greater for low-income families than for
upper-income families. As Chart 5 shows, such a credit for the typical
family of four amounts to a 10.4 percent cut in taxes. But the same
credit for a family earning $200,000 per year amounts to a cut of only
1.5 percent. Members of Congress who believe in a progressive tax
system, should agree that this is "fair."
<P>
<B> Use Spending Cuts to Finance Tax Cuts</B>
  <P>   Washington's budget rules require that revenues lost to the
Treasury from tax cuts must be matched or offset by some combination
of reductions in spending or by increases in other tax revenues.
Recent reports indicate that if the White House does introduce a
family tax cut plan, those cuts would be financed primarily through
higher taxes on other taxpayers. Such a strategy would be wrong.
   <P> There are two important reasons why tax cuts should be financed
by cuts in spending. First, federal spending has grown massively over
the past 45 years, resulting in a greater share of family income lost
to federal taxes. The federal government now spends about $1.5
trillion per year, six times as much as it did in 1948, after
adjusting for inflation. Indeed, in 1993, Washington consumed 22.4
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) compared to just 12.1
percent in 1948, an 85 percent increase. Over the next five years,
this trend will continue.
 <P>    According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending
will grow by nearly $400 billion by fiscal 1999, far outpacing the
projected $367 billion growth in tax revenues. (Congressional Budget
Office, An Economic and Budget Outlook, August 1994, p. 31.) This
means that the federal deficit, after dipping slightly next year to
$162 billion, will again begin to climb. By fiscal 1999, projects CBO,
the deficit will hit $231 billion and reach nearly $400 billion by
fiscal 2004. If last year's deficit reduction plan -- which contained
the largest tax increase in history -- worked as its supporters have
claimed, this should not be happening. This upward trend certainly
makes it likely that politicians once again will have to ask taxpayers
to bear higher taxes in order to meet Washington's insatiable appetite
for spending.
   <P>  The persistent growth of government should be reversed by using
the savings achieved by substantial cuts in government spending to
finance tax cuts for families with children. Such a strategy would
shift resources away from government and back to taxpayers, not from
one group of taxpayers to another.
 <P>    Second, linking cuts in spending directly to cuts in family taxes
gives taxpayers a financial stake in the budget process and, thus, an
incentive to counter the advocates of government programs. Such a
strategy can sugar-coat the political "pain" of spending cuts,
lessening the opposition of special interests who benefit from federal
largess. Absent the reward of a $500-per-child tax cut, few taxpayers
would bother to lobby for spending cuts because, under normal
circumstances, few perceive any tangible benefit from cuts in federal
spending. However, the advocates of, say, a $1 billion federal program
do have a serious financial interest in maintaining that spending and
are willing to invest considerable resources in lobbying to convince
Members of Congress not to cut the program.
  <P>   But these political dynamics change when spending cuts are linked
to tax cuts. Politicians who are accustomed to viewing spending cuts
only in terms of the pain they inflict on certain interest groups can
now see them in terms of the large number of families helped by those
cuts. For example, the savings achieved by eliminating a $1 billion
federal program are sufficient to finance a $500-per-child tax cut for
2 million American families. Thus, the constituency that stands to
benefit from elimination of the program is far larger than the number
of those who stand to lose. If Members of Congress enacted a $500-per-
child tax cut for every working family in America, they would empower
60 million advocates of spending cuts to stand up to Washington's
special interests.
<P>
<B> All Tax Cuts Are Local</B>
 <P>    Even the most pro-family Member of Congress may be reluctant to
cut spending in order to finance tax cuts. This is because Members
like to take political credit for "bringing home the bacon,"
demonstrating to voters back home how effective they are in looking
out for the interests of their congressional districts. With every
federal road project, research grant, and construction contract,
Members issue press releases announcing how many jobs will be created
or how many constituents will benefit from this infusion of federal
funds. For many Members of Congress, cutting taxes for families may
not appear to lend itself to such credit-taking.
   <P>  This impression is mistaken. Based on Census Bureau data,
Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated the total dollar value of
a $500-per-child tax credit for every state and congressional
district. These figures are contained in the Appendix to this paper
(county data are available upon request). While the number in each
congressional district varies greatly, the average district has
117,000 children. At $500 per child, this means the average district
will receive nearly $59 million in family tax relief each year.
   <P>  It is difficult to imagine that any single federal spending
project of similar magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the
same time. Thus, the political advantages of family tax relief would
more than seem to outweigh the political disadvantages of cutting
federal spending.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION</B>
 <P>    The good news for millions of hard-working American families is
that there is growing bipartisan talk of cutting taxes for families
with dependent children. The bad news for the same families is that
this talk may not turn into action. Congress and the White House
should commit themselves now to enacting a $500-per-child tax credit
in next year's budget. 
 <P>    Such a measure would bring financial stability to the parents of
52 million American children, eliminating the entire federal tax
burden for 4.7 million working families. Nearly 86 percent of the
children eligible for this credit live in families with gross annual
incomes below $75,000, middle-class by any standard. For the typical
family of four, a $500-per-child tax credit would mean a 10 percent
cut in the overall federal tax burden. Finally, family tax relief is
good politics. Families in the typical congressional district would
receive roughly $59 million per year in tax relief, effectively
creating a powerful constituency for cutting wasteful government
spending. 
   <P>  Embattled American families do not need "investment" spending or
new social programs to improve their well-being. Such government
assistance has done little or nothing to help families, and paying for
more government programs only increases their tax burden. The best way
for the federal government to strengthen families and assist parents
in their vital role of raising the next generation of Americans is to
reduce their tax burden.

     Based on Census Bureau data, Heritage Foundation scholars have
calculated the total value of a $500-per-child tax credit for each
state and congressional district.
<P>     Nationally, there are nearly 51 million children eligible for
such a credit. Thus, in the first year of the plan, nearly $25.5
billion would be returned to American families. These results are
summarized in the first table in this appendix.
  <P>   While the number of children in each congressional district
varies greatly, the average district has 117,000 children. At $500 per
child, this means the average district will receive some $58.7 million
in family tax relief each year. The second table lists the
congressional districts by state. Included in the table are: the
number of eligible children in the district, the total amount of money
the district will receive in family tax relief, and the name of the
member representing the district.

Since the end of the last recession in March 1991, the total number of payroll jobs has grown by 11.4 million to a total of 119.7 million, and the unemployment rate has declined from 6.8 to 5.4 percent. Despite this good news, many workers continue to be apprehensive about their economic future.

A look at the data behind the total number of jobs created and overall unemployment rates reveals why Americans are concerned.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs continue at a rapid pace, with layoffs at near record levels for the 1990s. Displaced workers who did find new jobs did so at an average of 8.2 percent lower wages.

<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high. The percentage of long-term unemployed is at record levels for this stage of an economic expansion.

<p><li>Overall real earnings growth is stagnating, and men's real earnings continue to decline.

<p><li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs continues to decline -- down 282,000 since March 1995 -- and weak economic growth is limiting job opportunities for many Americans.
Focusing on just the total number of new jobs and the low overall unemployment rate without taking these sobering facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.<sup>2</sup>  The economy is still failing to perform as well as similar expansions.


</ul><p>
<b>ANNOUNCED LAYOFFS CONTINUE AT RAPID PACE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After a flurry of press attention last winter, the continued pace of corporate downsizing has gone largely unnoticed. Despite this, many workers remain concerned about their job security. One-half of all Americans believe that jobs are not very plentiful,<sup>3</sup> and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse.<sup>4</sup>  New jobs may be available, but they usually pay substantially less and may not have the same benefits.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs for the first six months of 1996 were the second-highest this decade (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Layoffs were 28 percent higher than the first half of 1995 and 6.0 percent ahead of 1993, the largest downsizing year of the decade.

<p><li>So far this year, the telecommunications industry has announced layoffs totaling almost 43,000; the food industry, over 25,000; the computer industry, over 22,000; the retail industry, over 21,000; and the automobile industry, almost 18,000.

<p><li>The median weekly earnings of displaced workers who found new jobs were 8.2 percent less than for their old jobs.<sup>6</sup>  They were over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old. One of every five displaced workers who found new jobs was no longer covered by group health insurance.
</ul>

<p>
<b>LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS HIGH</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How long Americans are unemployed (duration) is just as important as the level of unemployment. An unemployment rate of 7.5 percent with most workers out of work for only a week as they change jobs or are recalled from layoff is significantly better than an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent with many workers still struggling to find work six months after losing their last job. Because of weak economic growth, long-term joblessness has not declined as rapidly as it normally does after recessions.<sup>7</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high.<sup>8</sup>  <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows that the proportion of Americans unemployed for at least six months remains unusually high after five years of modest economic growth. Since the end of the last recession, the proportion of unemployed who have been out of work for six or more months has not dropped significantly for youths (ages 16 to 24), black Americans, and service workers.

<p><li>After six months of looking for work, almost one of every five unemployed managers and professionals still has not found a job.<sup>9</sup>

<p><li>The overall unemployment rate also does not reveal significant problems facing workers in various age groups, industries, or occupations. While the total unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in July 1996, the rate for all teenagers was 16.4 percent, and the rate for black teenagers was 33.1 percent.
</ul>

<p><b>EARNINGS GROWTH STAGNATES, MEN'S EARNINGS STILL DECLINE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past five years of modest economic recovery and expansion, the real median usual weekly earnings for all full-time wage and salary workers has stagnated.<sup>10</sup>  For men, real median weekly earnings have declined 5.1 percent. For black and Hispanic Americans, the decline has been even worse: 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively.
<ul>
<p><li>After increasing 2.5 percent from the first quarter of 1991 to the first quarter of 1993, the index of real hourly compensation has not increased.

<p><li>Over the past five years, only workers in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries have seen their real average hourly earnings improve substantially.
</ul><p><b>

WEAK ECONOMIC GROWTH LIMITS JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICANS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although total employment and unemployment numbers are significant, they often do not convey important information about problems various age groups, industries, or occupations may be having. There actually are fewer manufacturing jobs now than when the economic recovery began five years ago, and the dismal pace of economic growth has meant no substantial improvement in job opportunities for men and minorities. Workers in some occupations have not yet regained the ground they lost in the last recession. For example:
<ul>
<p><li>Since March 1991, the percentage of the population employed has increased 1.4 percentage points to 63.2 percent.<sup>11</sup>  The percentage of men employed, however, has increased only 0.5 percentage points and still remains well below its 1989 peak of 72.8 percent.

<p><li>The employment-population ratio for white teenagers has increased 0.7 percentage points to 48.0 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the rate of 53.4 percent reached in August 1989.<sup>12</sup>  Likewise, the employment-population ratio for black teenagers has increased 2.0 percentage points to a disappointing 25.8 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the pre-recession rate of 32.4 percent reached in July 1989.

<p><li>The number of manufacturing jobs has declined 282,000 to 18.3 million since March 1995, and is down almost 1.2 million since its peak in 1989 (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).<sup>13</sup>  Durable goods manufacturing employment has increased only 55,000 over the past five years and remains below its 1989 peak by 794,000 jobs. Manufacturing workers have regained only 1 of every 5 jobs lost between 1989 and 1993.

<p><li>The number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related occupations has declined 478,000 since July 1992, and the number of workers in administrative support and clerical occupations has declined by 298,000.<sup>14</sup>

<p><li>The number of Americans working in precision production, craft, and repair occupations has declined 13,000 to 13.4 million from March 1991 to July 1996 and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14.0 million reached in March 1990.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the creation of 11.4 million additional jobs since the end of the last recession, workers continue to be concerned about their economic future. The average annual growth rate of the past seven years has been the worst economic performance since the end of World War II.<sup>15</sup>  Layoff announcements for the first half of this year were the second-highest this decade, long-term unemployment remains high, and real earnings growth has stagnated for the past five years. Focusing only on total job growth and the low unemployment rate without taking these facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.

May 14, 1996 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Even assuming the Clinton Administration's forecast for this year is accurate, the United States economy's performance since 1989 will have been the worst seven-year period since the end of World War II. Adjusted for inflation, median household income has declined by 6.6 percent since Ronald Reagan left office.<sup>1</sup>  And while the unemployment rate is reasonably low, many Americans are worried about the future and fear their children will be the first generation to have a lower standard of living than its parents. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The economy's sub-par performance has triggered a debate on how best to stimulate economic growth and boost income. The good news is that all sides of the debate agree that the key to economic growth is capital formation -- increasing the levels of savings and investment (including investments in human capital). The bad news, however, is that there is a significant disagreement over the policy changes that will best meet that goal. On one side are those who argue that high tax rates dampen incentives and believe that correcting the anti-savings, anti-investment bias of the current income tax code will improve the economy's performance. The flat tax, they would argue, offers the best opportunity to generate a substantial and positive impact on job creation and income growth. The other side of the debate is dominated by those who believe the most important variable is the budget deficit. They argue that a lower budget deficit will lead to significant reductions in interest rates and that lower interest rates will spur higher levels of investment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, no discussion of economic growth would be complete without addressing the size of government. Regardless of whether it is financed through taxes or borrowing, government spending represents a transfer of resources from the private sector to the public sector. If government spends that money in a way that generates a sufficiently high rate of return, the economy will benefit. If the rate of return is below that of the private sector, however, then the rate of growth will be slower than it otherwise would have been.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Needless to say, the debate over growth has important policy implications. Should taxes be increased or decreased?  Should the budget be balanced and, if so, how quickly?  Is the deficit the real problem, or is it a symptom of an underlying problem of too much government?  What is the impact of tax reform?  What types of government spending count as investment?  If certain policies increase growth, should that higher growth be included in government economic and revenue estimates?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Careful analysis of the historical and theoretical evidence yields three important conclusions that can help guide policymakers as they focus on the nation's economic problems:<ol>

	
<p><li>The tax system is taking too much money out of the productive sector of the economy. Perhaps even more important, the structure of the tax system is grossly flawed and imposes a particularly steep penalty on the very behaviors -- saving and investing -- that are needed to promote growth.

<p><li>Government borrowing is morally wrong because it imposes bills on future generations,<sup>2</sup> but the deficit should not drive economic policy. Contrary to what both political parties argue, there does not seem to be a strong relationship between the budget deficit and interest rates. Nor is there much reason to believe that lower interest rates, by themselves, will have a pronounced effect on investment. Moreover, focusing on the deficit can undermine sound economic policy by leading some to view higher taxes as an appropriate policy option.

<p><li>Government spending is too high. Many programs fail to generate an adequate rate of return (and many, such as welfare programs, almost certainly have a negative return and have made things worse). Not all government spending, needless to say, is dependent on "rates of return," but legislators should fully understand that funding programs with money that could be more productively used by the private sector will result in less economic growth. Finally, for those who do view the deficit as the key variable, there is ample evidence that slowing the growth of spending -- not higher taxes -- is the only way to achieve a balanced budget.
</ol>

<p>
<b>Why Capital Matters</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As stated above, there is very little controversy about what causes growth. There is near-unanimous agreement that salaries and wages are linked closely to productivity. The only way to raise the income of workers permanently -- assuming no change in their skills -- is through savings and investment. Simply put, workers are paid on the basis of what they produce, and giving them better tools allows them to produce more. The level of capital formation, for instance, largely explains why workers in the United States, Germany, and Japan earn more than workers in Brazil, India, and Nigeria. Similarly, workers in America today earn more than their parents because of net investment (increases in the capital stock). As a result, they are more productive, generating more output per hour of labor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Economists of all persuasions recognize this relationship between investment and wages. Paul Samuelson, for example, a Nobel Laureate economist who endorsed Bill Clinton for President, has written:<blockquote>

	What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Another example is taken from a 1991 report on economic growth prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, then controlled by the Democrats:
<blockquote>
	When an economy's rate of net investment (gross investment less depreciation)<sup>4</sup> increases, the economy's stock of capital increases. A larger capital stock permits a fixed amount of labor to produce more goods and services. The larger a country's capital stock, the more productive its workers and, generally, the higher its real wages and salaries. Thus, increases in investment tend to cause future increases in a nation's standard of living.<sup>5</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; According to a 1989 report on economic growth published by the Congressional Research Service:
<blockquote>
	Capital deepening has been and will likely continue to be a central force for accelerating growth and potential output over the medium term. But as we have seen, a permanent increase in the long-term rate of growth will hinge on the United States' ability to increase the pace of technical advance and innovation. However, both of these routes to faster growth will be contingent upon the ability to increase the level of investment spending -- more spending for capital equipment and more spending for research and development. To finance higher investment will, in turn, require that Americans raise the national rate of savings.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Or consider the views of the White House. In the 1994 Economic Report of the President, the Administration noted that:
<blockquote>
	The reasons for wanting to raise the investment share of the GDP [gross domestic product] are straightforward: Workers are more productive when they are equipped with more and better capital, more productive workers earn higher real wages, and higher real wages are the mainspring of higher living standards. Few economic propositions are better supported than these -- or more important.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Competing Theories of Growth</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Every economic school of thought -- even Marxism -- agrees that capital formation is the key to rising living standards. This happy consensus, however, does not translate into agreement about how to spur more savings and investment. In the political economic debate, at least in America, there are basically three (actually two and one-half) views on how to promote economic growth. These are:<ul>

<p><li><b>Old-Fashioned Keynesianism.</b> This is the half-theory because it has so few adherents in America. In periods of economic sluggishness, Keynesians believe the government should increase spending, financed by borrowing, to give the economy a shot in the arm. This spending is supposed to stimulate aggregate demand, which causes private sector behavior to perk up. With a handful of exceptions, such as the failed 1993 stimulus bill, this approach does not receive much attention in Washington.

<p><li><b>1950s Republican/1990s Democrat Balanced Budget Orthodoxy.</b> The title is made up because this school of thought does not really have a name. Proponents of this approach, which is dominant in Washington, believe that the economy hinges on changes in the budget deficit. Contrary to old-fashioned Keynesianism, however, this orthodox approach argues that reducing the budget deficit is the key to economic growth. The theory works as follows: A lower budget deficit leads to lower interest rates, lower interest rates lead to more investment, more investment leads to higher productivity, and higher productivity means more growth. Although some of the proponents favor smaller government as a philosophical goal, the balanced budget crowd does not think taxes have a major effect on incentives to engage in productive behavior. As a result, they are skeptical of tax cuts and instead are willing to raise taxes.

<p><li><b>The Free Market.</b> Another made-up title because other options -- supply-side, conservative, classical liberal -- do not capture the central tenet, the free-market approach believes that the keys to economic growth, at least in terms of fiscal policy, are the size of government and the structure of the tax system. In short, the free-market approach believes that total spending, regardless of whether it is financed by taxes or borrowing, hinders the economy's performance by transferring scarce resources from those in the private sector who have incentives to use them wisely to politicians and bureaucrats who oftentimes respond to political incentives. Because the size of government matters, free market advocates would prefer a government with a $1 trillion budget and a $200 billion deficit to a government with a $2 trillion budget that was balanced. On the tax side of the ledger, free market supporters believe taxes affect incentives to work, save, and invest. A major goal of these folks, therefore, is radical tax reform designed to minimize tax rates and eliminate multiple taxation of capital. These reforms, it is believed, will boost capital formation, which will increase productivity, which means faster economic growth.
</ul><p>


<b>Who Is Right?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The policy debate in Washington largely revolves between Options 2 and 3 (though there is also a fight amongst supporters of Option 2 over the size of government -- Should the budget be balanced at level "X" or level "X+Y?"). Stripping away much of the rhetoric, the victor in this struggle depends on which set of relationships is more robust:
<ol>
<p><li>Are balanced budget proponents right that interest rates will fall significantly once deficit spending comes to an end?  And are they correct in believing that investment is very sensitive to interest rates?

<p><li>Are free market supporters correct in believing that there is an inverse relationship between economic growth and the size of government?  Even more important, are they accurate in stating that decisions to work, save, and invest are significantly altered by the tax code?
</ul>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In some sense, both sides are right. Unless economists want to repeal the laws of supply and demand, there can be no doubt that lower budget deficits will lower interest rates. And, all other things being equal, lower interest rates should mean more investment. It is also unambiguously true that lower taxes will reduce the price of providing labor and capital to the economy. And it is certainly accurate to note that a large government, by reducing the cost of not working, will adversely affect the economy's performance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The real question is the magnitude of these effects. Would balancing the budget really reduce interest rates by two percentage points?  Is the level of investment primarily driven by the interest rate?  Just how sensitive are decisions to work, save, and invest to the rate of taxation?  To what extent do government spending programs actually undermine work effort?
<p>

<b>Doubts Regarding Balanced Budget Orthodoxy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is ample reason to question the robustness of the interest rate argument. According to the theory, lower budget deficits should result in lower interest rates. Yet there is little evidence to suggest that interest rates are significantly affected by changes in the U.S. budget deficit. This does not mean that the laws of supply and demand have been repealed. It simply means that in world capital markets, a shift of $30 billion, $40 billion, or $50 billion is unlikely to have a dramatic effect and can easily be overwhelmed by other factors such as monetary policy and demand for credit. <sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even if interest rates fall by a significant amount, the second link in the balanced budget chain of reasoning is very weak. Yes, interest rates must affect investment choices, but it appears that this variable is dwarfed by other influences.<sup>8</sup>  Why invest, for instance, if there is no hope of making a profit?  Real interest rates were negative during the 1930s in America, yet investment was moribund because investors did not see many opportunities to earn an adequate rate of return. Likewise, real interest rates were high in America during much of the 1980s, yet investment rose because people saw ways to make money. Moreover, since a large portion of investment is self-financed on the part of business, it is difficult to see how interest rates would have a dramatic impact.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All things being equal, it is a good idea to balance the budget. And, yes, lower interest rates will promote investment. Balancing the budget, however, is not a silver bullet for the economy. This approach is especially short-sighted if it is used as a reason to raise taxes or block pro-growth tax cuts. As the following section illustrates, changes in tax policy can have a pronounced effect on the economy's performance.

<p>
<b>Why Free Market Supporters Are Right About Taxes and Capital Formation</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The attached appendices provide a sampling of empirical work on the impact of taxes. To put that work in context, however, it is useful to walk through an example illustrating just how heavy the tax burden is on savings and investment. Between personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate taxes, a single dollar of investment income can be subject to as many as four layers of tax in America. Added to that burden are provisions of the law, such as depreciation and the alternative minimum tax, which force taxpayers to overstate their income. Adding insult to injury is the heavy compliance cost of the current system. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The following example illustrates why savings and investment suffer in the current tax climate. A taxpayer has $100 of income and must decide what to do with it. He can consume the $100, spending it on food, vacations, clothing, haircuts, or some other product or service, in which case (with the exception of possible sales taxes) he will receive close to $100 in goods and services for his money. Or he can invest in the stock of a start-up company with the potential to provide new jobs to the community and produce goods that consumers desire. If the company succeeds, the investor most likely will profit. If it fails, he will lose his $100.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In this case, the investment bears fruit and yields a 10 percent rate of return, enabling the company to produce $10 of annual income for every $100 invested. Under the current tax code, 35 percent is skimmed off to pay the corporate income tax, leaving only $6.50 out of the original $10. This $6.50 then goes to the investor as a dividend. But there are other taxes. Depending on the investor's income, the personal income tax will take as much as 39.6 percent of his $6.50, leaving him with less than $4.00 of annual income from a "successful" $100 investment. In addition, he may face applicable state and local income taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, if the investor ever decides to sell the stock, he will be hit by one of the highest capital gains taxes in the industrialized world. To make a bad situation even worse, he will be taxed on the nominal gains, often meaning that taxes are paid on assets that have lost value in real terms (and do not forget that the person who sold him the stock originally may have been subject to capital gains taxes on that sale). The final insult is the estate and gift tax. Successful entrepreneurs who try to accumulate an estate to pass on to their children are penalized by inheritance taxes which can confiscate 55 percent of a deceased's assets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thanks to the tax code, a fortunate investor -- one who actually earns money on his investments -- may have to send more than 80 percent of his earnings to the government, not to mention having already paid taxes on the money used for the investment in the first place. Thus, government tax policy has created a very tilted playing field. By punishing saving and investment, the tax code encourages both individuals and businesses to consume rather than to build for America's future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since taxes have such a dramatic impact on incentives to work, save, and invest, it should come as no surprise that major tax changes almost always have a significant impact on the economy. Herbert Hoover's decision in 1930 to increase the top tax rate from 25 percent to 63 percent certainly contributed to the Depression. Lyndon Johnson's surtax on income tax liabilities, enacted in 1968, together with an increase in the capital gains tax helped end the 1960s expansion. Large tax increases, including inflation-induced bracket creep, contributed to the economy's dismal performance under Jimmy Carter. George Bush's record tax increase in 1990 was a principal cause of the recent recession and subsequent anemic recovery. And the sub-par performance of today's economy, particularly the decline in median household income, almost certainly is attributable in part to the record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by Bill Clinton.
<p>


<b>The Answer: The Flat Tax</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Each of the tax code's many shortcomings can be addressed by targeted legislation, but a far better approach is simply to replace the existing system with a flat tax. There have been many flat tax proposals over the years, but they all share certain key features. These are:
<ul><p><li><b>One low tax rate.</b> All flat tax proposals have a single tax rate that applies to all income subject to tax. The actual rate imposed varies, but the upper limit would be about 20 percent. The Armey-Shelby flat tax legislation, for instance, begins with a 20 percent rate which phases down to 17 percent after a couple of years.

<p><li><b>Tax income only once.</b> Flat tax proposals are designed to eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by ending the double- (and sometimes triple- and quadruple-) taxation of income generated through savings and investment. The key principle is that the tax code not discriminate against income that is used for savings and investment as opposed to income that is consumed. 

<p><li><b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions.</b> All pure flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the tax code that bestow preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities. Included in this would be special tax breaks for businesses and corporations and, for individual taxpayers, the home mortgage interest deduction, the charitable contributions deduction, and the state and local mortgage interest deduction. Eliminating these "loopholes" solves the problem of complexity, allowing taxpayers to file their tax returns on a postcard-sized form.

<p>
</ul>
<b>Benefits of a Flat Tax</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By addressing the many problems of the existing tax code in one fell swoop, the flat tax would have an immediate and dramatic positive impact. Included among the benefits are:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Faster economic growth.</b> A flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment. According to many economists, the rise in productive behavior would likely add one percentage point to the annual rate of economic growth. How significant is this?  An increase in the growth rate of just one-half of one percentage point would boost an average family of four's yearly income by more than $5,000 after ten years.

<p><li><b>Instant wealth creation.</b> Eliminating the second, third, and fourth layers of taxation on capital income would significantly boost the value of all income-producing assets. According to Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, enactment of a flat tax would immediately boost wealth by some $1 trillion.

<p><li><b>Simplicity.</b> The 600-plus tax forms of the current system would be swept into the trash and replaced by two simple postcard-sized forms. Wage, salary, and pension income would be reported on the individual form and business and capital income would be reported on the business form. Neither form would require more than a few minutes to complete, substantially reducing the 5.4 billion-hour yearly burden of today's tax code.

<p><li><b>Fairness. All taxpayers and all income would be treated equally.</b> A taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his neighbor would pay ten times as much in taxes. Successful entrepreneurs no longer would be penalized by discriminatory tax rates, and no longer would the politically well-connected by able to benefit from special loopholes and preferences.

<p><li><b>An end to micromanagement and political favoritism.</b> All deductions, credits, exemptions, loopholes, and preferences would be eliminated under a flat tax. Politicians would lose their ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, use the tax code to impose their values on the economy. Investment decisions would be guided by economic forces rather than tax considerations.

<p><li><b>Increased civil liberties.</b> The complexity of the tax code makes it nearly impossible for either taxpayers or IRS agents to follow the law. A greatly simplified tax code would eliminate virtually all of the conflicts and controversies that make the IRS one of the most feared agencies of the federal government.
</ul><p>

<b>The Spending Problem</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While current tax policy represents a huge impediment to economic growth, policymakers also must focus on the size of government. To the extent that politicians and bureaucrats do not spend money as wisely or efficiently as it would be spent in the private sector, economic growth will lag as government increases in size. More specifically, many government programs do not generate benefits (or minimize costs) to the economy that  exceed those which would have occurred had the money remained in private hands. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The appropriate approach for policymakers is to determine whether spending for a given program will yield enough benefits to offset the loss of the money to the private sector (including the incentive and compliance costs of collecting taxes). A certain level of transportation spending, for instance, will facilitate economic growth by permitting the efficient flow of goods and services. Policymakers should debate, of course, whether the spending could be privatized or conducted at the state and local level. And to the extent they believe it has to be conducted by Washington, they should do their best to ensure that funding is allocated according to sound guidelines rather than pork-barrel politics. Other types of spending, such as crime prevention, also may help the economy by reducing the cost of crime.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In too many cases, however, there is strong reason to believe that the federal government is spending money in ways that do not produce good results for the economy. Some programs, such as welfare, reduce the cost of not working and inevitably undermine productive economic behavior. Other types of spending, such as the budgets for regulatory agencies, can have significantly negative rates of return because of the heavy costs they impose on the private sector. Unfortunately, policy makers usually do not subject government programs to this type of cost/benefit analysis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Note that one important conclusion from using this approach is that the deficit is not the critical variable. The key is the size of government, not how it is financed. Taxes and deficits are both harmful, but the real problem is that government is taking money from the private sector and spending it in ways that often are counter-productive. As a result, fiscal policy should focus on reducing the level of government spending, with particular emphasis on those programs that yield the lowest benefits and/or impose the highest costs. The importance of reducing spending, it should be noted, exists regardless of whether the budget happens to be balanced and is not contingent on changes in the tax system (just as reforming the tax system and adopting other pro-growth tax changes should not be contingent on what happens to the spending side of the ledger).
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There is no magic formula to boost growth. The economy can only grow if people work more or work better. Unfortunately, much of the world has adopted policies that impose increasingly steep tax penalties on those who add to the economy's wealth. Compounding the damage of these policies are spending programs that shield people from taking responsibility for their own lives. The combination has been an unmitigated failure. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This raises a particularly important issue for those on the left. They must decide what is more important: keeping a tax system that may satisfy an ideological impulse to punish success, or adopting a system that helps boost the living standards of the less fortunate. It is certainly true that modest reforms like reducing the tax rate on capital gains or big reforms like the flat tax will boost after-tax income of the rich. The empirical evidence, however, shows that other income classes will benefit as well -- and may benefit even more.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Critics of tax reform complain that it is nothing more than "trickle-down" economics that relies on tax cuts for the "rich" to boost wages. Such rhetoric may be useful politically, but it cannot change economic reality. Economist John Shoven has explained:<blockquote>

	The mechanism of raising real wages by stimulating investment is sometimes derisively referred to as "trickle-down" economics. But regardless of the label used, no one doubts that the primary mechanism for raising the return to work is providing each worker with better and more numerous tools. One can wonder about the length of time it takes for such a policy of increasing saving and investments to have a pronounced effect on wages, but I know of no one who doubts the correctness of the underlying mechanism. In fact, most economists would state the <I>only</I> way to increase real wages in the long run is through extra investments per worker.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For a profession usually chided for its lack of agreement, economists are nearly unanimous in their recognition that capital formation is the key to economic growth. Policymakers seeking to boost living standards and take-home pay face two competing options for how best to achieve the goal of more savings and investment: Should they focus on the deficit or should they shrink the size of government and reform the tax system?  While these goals need not conflict, to the extent there is a division, there should be little doubt that a myopic fixation on the deficit will not necessarily produce the right policy results. Adopting a flat tax, by contrast, combined with long-overdue reductions in the level of government spending, will generate the desired outcome of a more prosperous economy.

<hr><p><b>APPENDIX 1:<br> Taxes Affect Decisions to Work</b></center> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Joint research by economists from Princeton University and Brigham Young University, based on a random survey of physicians, found that a one percentage point increase in marginal tax rates is associated with a reduction of as much as 1.11 percent in hours worked.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A University of California economist found that because of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (which lowered tax rates), the work effort of high-income married women rose by 0.8 percent for every one percent their after-tax wages increased.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another economist found that "Husbands of retirement age, 60 and over, show substantial variation in hours of work, related systematically to wages and income in the expected way."  Moreover, "Wives in all age groups are quite sensitive to wages and income."<sup>13</sup>  In other words, as after-tax income falls, so does the incentive to work.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other economists estimated that "wives' labor supply will increase by 3.8 percent" in response to a reduction in the marriage penalty.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A comprehensive study in <I>The Journal of Human Resources</I> found that taxes reduce married males' hours of work by 2.6 percent and married females' by between 10 percent and 30 percent.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a statistical study in <I>Econometrica</I>, yearly hours of work for white married women increase by 2.3 percent for every one percent increase in after-tax earnings.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While husbands are not as sensitive to taxes as wives, the impact of taxes on their behavior is nonetheless dramatic. One study found that they work eight percent less than they would in the absence of taxes.<sup>17</sup>  This indicates a loss in economic output of at least $1,000 per person.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All studies acknowledge that higher after-tax incomes increase incentives to work by increasing the "price" of leisure, but some assume this effect is offset because lower taxes allow workers to achieve a certain level of income by working fewer hours. While this trade-off is relevant when looking at individual choices, two economists note that "the generalization of the individual analysis to the economy as a whole is invalid" because "It will be impossible for all individuals to consume both more goods and more leisure as the individual work-leisure analysis implies."<sup>19</sup>  The actual economy-wide response to changes in tax rates will be higher than almost all studies indicate.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	One econometric model found that a one percent reduction in tax rates increased work effort for lower-income workers by 0.1 percent, for middle and upper-middle-income workers by 0.25 percent, and for upper-income workers by more than 2.0 percent.<sup>21</sup>

<p>
<center><b>APPENDIX 2:<br> Taxes Reduce Savings and Investment</b><p>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In a book on taxes and capital formation, Norman B. Ture and B. Kenneth Sanden noted, "The bias against saving in the present tax system results from the fact that, with few exceptions, taxes are imposed both on the amount of current saving and on the future returns to such saving, whereas the tax falls only once on income used for consumption."<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Economist John Shoven estimates that a reduction of 20 percent in the top rate for capital gains would cause the stock market to rise by 3 percent.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Undersecretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has written that "increases in the real after-tax rate of return received by savers would lead to substantial increases in long-run capital accumulation."  Further, "bequests may account for a large fraction of national capital formation," which strengthens the argument that taxes influence savings.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study in <I>The American Political Science Review</I> noted that "Nations... where the extractive [tax] capacity of government did not significantly increase, relative to the economic product, have, in a sense, opted for... an increasing rate of private capital accumulation."<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Analyzing the decline in savings, a study by three experts concluded that Social Security and other transfer programs have led to a "decline in U.S. saving."<sup>26</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other economists also concluded that Social Security reduces savings because workers no longer worry as much about retirement.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Econometric results, according to a study published in the <I>Journal of Public Economics</I>, "suggest that dividend taxes have important effects on investment decisions" and that "an increase of 10 percent in the stock market would raise the investment rate by about 15 percent."<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Writing in the <I>National Tax Journal</I>, three economists found "significant effects for the after-tax return on saving, after-tax cost of borrowing, or both."  The Reagan tax cuts "had a major impact on U.S. economic growth."<sup>29</sup>


<p>
<center><b>APPENDIX 3:<br> Growth Is Weaker When Government Penalizes Economic Behavior</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A 1983 World Bank study of 20 countries found that low-tax nations experience faster growth, generate more investment, and enjoy more rapid increases in productivity and standards of living than high-tax nations.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The tax system imposes between 22 cents and 54 cents of losses for every dollar raised, according to a labor-supply economist. For working wives, the losses are even higher: more than 58 cents for very dollar of tax revenue.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another study found that each 1.0 percent increase in the federal tax burden reduces economic growth by 1.8 percent and lowers national employment by 1.14 percent.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a statistical study published in the <I>American Economic Review</I>, for every dollar paid to the federal government in taxes, 33.2 cents is lost to the economy.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The increased tax burden between 1965 and 1980 drove an estimated 1.9 million people out of the U.S. labor force.<sup>34</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Statistical research published in <I>Lloyd's Bank Review</I> has found that in the U.K. each one percent rise in payroll taxes causes hiring to fall by approximately 1.4 percent. The same study estimated that each $1 of additional tax revenue costs $3 in lost economic output.<sup>35</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study printed in the <I>American Sociological Review</I> concluded that "Increases of one percent in the tax burden relative to household income are directly associated with a 2.8 percent decline in economic growth over three years, or just under one percent annually."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An <I>American Economic Review</I> study found that every dollar of taxes could impose as much as $4 of lost output on the economy, with the probable harm ranging between $1.32 and $1.47.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1981 analysis of the Swedish economy in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I> found "The estimated long-run effects [of high marginal tax rates] are sufficient to explain up to 75 percent of the recent decline in the measured growth of the Swedish GNP."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a former Treasury Department official, between 75 percent and 80 percent of the additional wealth generated by increased savings and investment goes to workers.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another study in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I> estimated that the corporate income tax costs more in lost output than it raises for the government. The "excess burden" is "123 percent of revenue."<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1984 study in the <I>American Economic Review</I> estimated "20.7 cents of welfare loss per additional dollar of tax revenue."<sup>41</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study of U.S. taxes at the state level found that low-tax states grew 35 percent faster than high-tax states between 1970 and 1980.<sup>42</sup>  The relationship between growth and taxes among the states has been shown in literally dozens of studies.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another economist was able to illustrate a very strong inverse relation between average per capita growth rates and average tax rates on income and profits in developed countries.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to an article in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I>, based on worldwide data, increasing the tax burden by ten percentage points will reduce annual growth by two percentage points.<sup>45</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a paper presented at the World Bank, two economists uncovered an "impressive negative relation between the rate of growth and the ratio of tax revenue to GDP" as well as a "negative association between growth and... the 'marginal' income tax rate."<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of the explosive growth of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea, Hoover economist Alvin Rabushka has written that 
<blockquote>
	The four Asian tigers adopted supply-side tax policies decades before the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions. Finance ministers oversaw systems of taxation that featured low rates and/or low levels of direct taxation of individuals and businesses, the absence of or very light charges on capital income (interest, dividends, capital gains), and a smorgasbord of inducements for domestic and foreign enterprises to invest and reinvest in each economy.<sup>47</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other studies have found that the economy is harmed when government spends tax revenue:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A National Bureau of Economic Research study, using worldwide data, found that an increase "in government spending and taxation of 10 percentage points was predicted to decrease long-term growth rates by 1.4 percentage points."<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to Daniel Landau, "The results of this study [published in the <I>Southern Economic Journal</I>] suggest a negative relationship exists between the share of government consumption expenditure in GDP and the rate of growth of per capita GDP."<sup>49</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two economists found that increases in U.S. government outlays for social programs "are associated with reductions in the growth rate."<sup>50</sup>

April 8, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>WALTER WILLIAMS:</b> I'm going to talk about the morality of taxation and, of course, the flat tax. While we're talking about taxation, I am going to spend most of my time raising some moral issues involved with taxation in general. Whether we like to think of it as such, our fiscal problems, as well as many other problems in our country, are rooted in immoral government conduct.
<p>

Let me start by referring to the United States Constitution, what I prefer to call the "citizen's rule book."  To say something meaningful about taxation, one must also say something about expenditures, and Article 1, Section 8 of our Constitution is very relevant to today's discussion. Article 1, Section 8 begins by granting Congress authority to lay and collect taxes. In the passages that follow, if you read carefully, Article 1, Section 8 enumerates a broad range of about 19 activities for which Congress can use its taxing authority. These 19 activities, for those of us who have not bothered to read the Constitution lately, include a common defense, the coining of money, and the establishment of post offices and courts, among other things.
<p>
I have not done the numbers on this, but I am guessing that the amount of money necessary for Congress to pay for these constitutionally authorized functions of the federal government would come to no more than $400 billion or so at the most. Obviously, that amount differs significantly from today's expenditure level of $1.6 trillion, and even that $1.6 trillion does not capture the total spending because we have the underground federal government, the so-called off-budget expenditures, as well as government-mandated spending by citizens, such as Americans with Disabilities Act, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency dictates.
<p>

I do not believe that we can restore government to its proper role in a free society by focusing our energies only on the taxation part of the equation. In saying this, I in no way wish to demean the yeoman-like efforts of all those who have worked to come up with a better method of taxation. But I see much of the debate between the flat tax and the national sales tax or our current tax code as boiling down to a question of which is the best way for government to subjugate its citizens (although this is not a meaningless question, because if we have to accept subjugation, I suppose some forms are better than others).
<p>

The debate over what form of taxation we should have somewhat legitimates the level of government spending; and I have always argued, as a number of colleagues have, that it is spending, not taxation, that is the true measure of the burden of government. You see this by recognizing that there is no necessary reason why government has to tax in the first place. At one extreme, Congress could raise all the resources it needed simply by printing currency, or could borrow and require its citizens and other entities to hold a portion of their holdings in government securities, as is done in some countries. Of course, there would be severe problems associated with either one of these methods of taxation, but the bottom-line point is that government spending, not taxation, is the proper measure of government activity, and that is the major problem that needs to be addressed.
<p>

Throughout most of our nation's history, up to the beginning of the 20th century, the federal government spent no more than 3 or 4 percent of GNP, except during wartime. It did not make much difference what form of taxation supported federal government activity. In fact, excise taxes carried the burden. But even during this interval, and even if we had had today's income tax code, there would not have been much of a problem raising 3 or 4 percent of GNP. Almost any kind of tax system would not have much of a problem raising 3 or 4 percent of GNP. I am sure that if that were still the case, we would not be gathered here today to discuss substituting a flat tax for the current code.
<p>

Some people might ask, and some Congressmen might ask, what forms of congressional spending should be cut so that we would not have to worry about the form of taxation. A French philosopher, Frederic Bastiat, gave us the best guide in a little book called <I>The Law</I>, wherein he suggested a way of identifying legal plunder. Bastiat said -- and you can think about our government while I am reading this quote -- "See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what that citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime."
<p>

Clearly, at least two-thirds of federal spending fits Bastiat's description of legal plunder, what I prefer to call legalized theft. If we eliminated legal plunder from the scope of congressional activity, the form of taxation could easily be a non-issue; that is, getting us back to 3 or 4 percent of the GNP. Some may wish to quarrel with my description of Congress's business as being that of legal plunder, but just ask yourself: How does Congress get the money for farm subsidy programs, the savings and loan bailout, food stamps, and the like?  Clearly, it uses intimidation, threats, and coercion to take what rightfully belongs to one citizen and give it to another to whom it does not belong.
<p>

If you think I'm being too loose with terminology about intimidation, threats, and coercion, think about April 15. The mission of virtually every Cabinet department in this city is to distribute the loot that Congress collects. There is neither moral nor constitutional authority for Congress to commit plunder. That is the moral issue that we need to address.
<p>

Turning to the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal, notwithstanding what I have argued so far, there are some benefits to its enactment. First, it would reduce Congress's ability to grant one group of Americans special tax privileges that are denied to another group of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee are two of the most powerful committees in Congress. Their members have the largest political war chest, and the reason is that they are the focus of Washington's lobbying groups, who pay handsomely and work diligently to have favors bestowed upon them. The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan would go a long way toward eliminating privilege-granting by the United States Congress, and that may explain some of the political resistance to having a flat tax.
<p>

Another benefit of the Armey-Shelby flat tax is lower compliance costs. According to various estimates, the compliance costs of our current code include the 5.5 billion to 6 billion hours Americans spend on such activity as recordkeeping, filling out tax forms, going to court, and seeking ways to avoid taxes. The Armey-Shelby flat tax would create a GNP windfall because if Americans were spending those tax compliance hours in productive activity, the country would be considerably richer. Current tax compliance costs are estimated to be equal to the entire annual output of the automobile and truck and aircraft industries combined.
<p>

As evidenced by my remarks, I am a purist -- what the news media, and maybe even some of you, might call an extremist. But I am not such a purist that I cannot see that a flat tax is a major improvement over the status quo.
<p>

If a flat tax is enacted, however, there should be an additional paragraph in the law requiring a supermajority, say four-fifths, to raise it and a simple majority to decrease it. Like the Framers of our Constitution, I do not trust the Congress of the United States. With the current complex tax code, there are numerous legal ways to hide our money from the revenuers. With a simple flat tax, those hideaways would be eliminated. Then, if Congress raised taxes, we would be up that proverbial creek without a paddle.
<p>

<b>J. KENNETH BLACKWELL:</b> <I>The New York Times</I>, in a 1909 editorial opposing the very first income tax, predicted that when men get in the habit of helping themselves to the property of others, they cannot easily be cured of it. The history of our tax code, in economic terms, mirrors the course of most addictions: first, advancing dependence; second, diminished returns; and third, deteriorating health of the afflicted. <p>

The 1.9 percent rate of economic growth experienced by the U.S. economy is not an accident. It is caused in large measure by a tax code that is impossibly complex, overly intrusive, manifestly unfair, and economically destructive. While some people oppose tax increases or favor tax reductions simply because they want to maintain or enhance their disposable income, I favor constraining government taxation because of the negative impact it has on economic growth.
<p>

Higher taxes mean lower rates of growth in income and jobs over time. This has been amply demonstrated in dozens of scholarly studies. Perhaps the most exhaustive recent study was performed by Dr. Richard Vedder of Ohio University for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Looking at the tax history and economic performance of 50 American states for the period 1960 to 1993, Professor Vedder concluded that relatively low-tax states grew nearly one-third faster than high-tax states.
<p>

Income taxes have a particularly adverse impact on income growth. Flat rate income taxes are significantly more favorable to economic growth than progressive taxes. Perhaps income in flat rate income tax states grew about 25 percent faster than did personal income in states with progressive tax structures. Professor Vedder lists over 50 other studies that similarly conclude that taxes adversely impact economic performance, whether measured by income growth, job creation, new business startups, or population change. These studies look at areas within the U.S. during a given period of time or, in many cases, at other countries. <p>


For example, one study of 107 nations by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded, "We find that a balanced budget increase in government spending and taxation is predicted to reduce output growth rates."  Given that, it is desirable to provide a legal framework for fiscal policymaking in Washington that removes the bias that exists in the current system in favor of relatively large government and, thus, high taxation. Special-interest groups can and do use their concentrated financial and political power to overcome the general interest on a continuous basis, leading to spending in excess of desirable levels, as Walter has just demonstrated. By making it more difficult to tax the populace, we can reduce the fiscal drag on our long-term economic performance that high federal taxation imposes. This is a strong argument for a supermajority requirement for legislative approval of tax increases.
<p>

The current federal tax system provides perverse economic incentives to states and local governments. Because state and local income tax payments are deductible against federal adjusted income, state governments are encouraged to levy income rather than other forms of taxes or no taxes at all. Consider two otherwise identical families, both making $75,000 in income, one living in New York and the other living in Texas or Florida. The New York family probably pays $4,000 or more in state and local income taxes, while the Florida or Texas counterpart pays nothing. Because of federal tax deductibility, the New York family probably will pay close to $1,000 less in federal income taxes.
<p>

This is terribly unfair. It violates the concept of horizontal equity, a concept that says that people of similar economic circumstances should pay similar taxes. Beyond that, however, the federal government is subsidizing the citizens of states that engage in very high-tax policies, shown by Professor Vedder and many others to be so destructive of economic growth. The elimination or reduction of that federal deductibility, such as would occur with a pure flat tax, would increase pressures on high-tax states to reduce their income taxes, which would spur economic growth, something that most states in this union desperately need and desire. This, in addition to the economic stimulus that would come from lowering the federal marginal income tax rates, would be a tremendous boon to our nation's economy.
<p>

Moreover, the move to a lower, flat rate federal income tax fits with another theme that virtually everyone in both political parties is supporting, at least rhetorically: the devolution of power back to the states. The current tax code says, in effect, that Washington knows best. States that have high income taxes are considered good, progressive jurisdictions, so Washington rewards their citizens with lower taxes. States that raise revenues more by sales taxes, excise taxes, or user fees are punished relative to states that use high income or property levies. Rather than being neutral on state fiscal policy, Washington is trying to use financial incentives to dictate the nature of taxation.
<p>

What is particularly perverse about this is that the form of taxation Washington is trying to dictate has a particularly adverse impact on growth. Washington is telling the states to tax the production of goods, or the resources used to produce goods, rather than the consumption of income. That is economically wrong; it is inconsistent with empowering states and local governments to do what they feel is best for their citizens. We have an opportunity in this public policy-defining year to set the record straight: to junk the present tax code and replace it with a tax code that positions us for the 21st century.
<p>

When I was 14, I thought I was God's gift to amateur boxing. I won my first four bouts with relative ease. The fifth bout, I got hit so hard in the nose that I had to go home and tell my father that I was going to find a more scholarly career to pursue. I stayed away from the boxing arena until I was a freshman at Xavier University, where Father E. J. O'Connor, a 72-year-old Jesuit, would ask me and a friend of mine, Benji, if we would go to the amateur bouts with him at the old Cincinnati Gardens. We went out and watched 10 bouts. The 11th bout, a young boy from the western side of Cincinnati, also of Irish-Catholic heritage, came out and, before his fight, made the sign of the cross. Benji leaned over and said, "Father, what's the significance of that?"  Father said, "Tiger, it ain't enough if you can't fight."
<p>

I would suggest to you that it is time for us, as the revolutionaries at the grass roots, to move beyond lip service and get into action, put some muscle behind our rhetoric, and make sure that the Congress of the United States creates a tax code and a tax structure that spur economic growth, create jobs, and promote hope and opportunity.
<p>

<b>JOHN FUND:</b> Two dates are very significant to Americans every spring. One, of course, is April 15, when Americans have to wade through all of their tax forms and fill them out. The other one is May 6, which is Tax Freedom Day. That is the day when the average American family will have earned enough to pay its federal, state, and local taxes and begin keeping money for food, clothing, shelter, and all of the things that keep body and soul together.
<p>

The two dates are linked because we have the tax system that we have, because it is overly complex, and because it raises far too much money. Right now, only 29 percent of Americans fill out the tax form that requires itemization; 52 percent of Americans actually have to go and pay someone, a professional, to fill out those forms for them. If you fill out the form 1040, 66 percent of Americans have to pay a professional. There is something wrong with a tax system which requires people to get somebody with an accountant's training to fill out a tax form for them.
<p>

If you go further and look at its intrusiveness, the IRS employs 111,000 people. That is more people than work for the FBI; that is more people than work for the Border Patrol; that is more people than work for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, and the National Security Agency all combined. It is an enormous apparatus. It is said that perhaps the least believable thing you can say in this country is "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help you."  Well, perhaps the most believable thing someone can say in this country is "I'm from the IRS, and I'm here to hurt you."
<p>

Everyone across both political parties recognizes that this system is broken, cannot be fixed, and is irredeemable. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt put it, I think, better than anyone: The tax system has become a test of legal brainpower and the ability of accountants to conduct a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives.
<p>

The IRS has become the very symbol of what is wrong with the American government. In order to clean it up, proposals are laid on the table like the flat tax. The flat tax is a way to shrink the IRS from the monolithic and intractable bureau it is today to a simple clearinghouse of information.
<p>

The flat tax as a concept, of course, is enormously popular. The flat tax was attacked mercilessly by almost every candidate in the Republican Party because it was the proposal by Steve Forbes that was most identified with his candidacy. In order to attack Steve Forbes and slow his momentum, you had to attack the flat tax. But the exit polls which were taken as Republican primary voters left the polling booth found that in 18 out of 22 primary states, the flat tax was still supported by a majority or plurality of people voting in those primaries. It received the equivalent of a political mugging, but it is still standing and walking around.
<p>

There are a lot of people who say the flat tax is a far distant goal. Well, not if you look in contemporary political terms. The flat tax was introduced to the American people on the editorial page of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> on March 25, 1981, just over 15 years ago, in a famous essay by Bob Hall and Alvin Rabushka called "The Attraction of a Flat Rate System."  It has picked up adherents ever since. There are now two books on the bestseller list that discuss the flat tax, one by House Majority Leader Dick Armey. It is gathering momentum.
<p>

It is not surprising that it has taken us 15 years to get this far. I think Mr. Blackwell mentioned the first income tax. That was not really the first income tax; that was the first income tax that actually stuck. The first income tax was a peacetime income tax that came about in 1894. It was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, which said that you had to have a constitutional amendment to have such a tax. That effort took from 1894 to 1913, when we passed the Sixteenth Amendment -- 19 years; that is about how long it takes an idea that has irresistible political support behind it to come to realization in America. So I'm not surprised it has taken us 15 years to get this far. At the same time, I also would not be surprised if it takes us only four or five more years to achieve something like the flat tax, because this system is broken and is reaching a critical state of collapse.
<p>

There is another proposal on the table which I think is as significant as the flat tax, and which will be voted on in the House of Representatives on April 15. It has been referred to as the supermajority for raising taxes. This would mean that, as 10 or 11 states now do, you would require two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate to pass a general tax increase. This is an insurance policy to make certain that, once again, the Constitution will have shape and form and will carry with it the force of law. As it is right now, the Constitution has been interpreted virtually into nothingness, as I think Walter Williams indicates.
<p>

We need something more dramatic than what the Founding Fathers envisioned. We need the supermajority, the two-thirds, to raise taxes. Couple that with a simple flat rate system and I think you will have a powerful engine for economic growth, a powerful engine for simplifying people's lives, and a powerful blow for civil liberties in this country. If we achieve either or both of these goals, the supermajority or the flat tax, I think there will come a day when the American people can say that April 15, more or less, is just like any other day -- and wouldn't that be a blessed relief?
<p>

<b>STEVE FORBES:</b> It is good to be here today, to see the flat tax discussed in an environment where you are seeking after truth rather than sound bites.
 I hope it is a theme that others will be picking up in the fall.

Everything we proposed in this year's presidential campaign, particularly the flat tax, had as its purpose -- it sounds like a clich, but it's the truth -- to help realize the American dream, which in its essence allows all of us the chance to discover and develop to the fullest our God-given talents. Anything that stands in the way of that, we resisted. Anything that promotes it, we supported. The flat tax is the first of many critical issues that came out of the campaign that will make it possible for America to realize its full potential -- as a people and as a nation.
<p>

One of the things that pundits occasionally do, and historians will do forever, is discuss why Americans were in a sour mood in the 1990s. After all, the standard of living, by any objective measure, is a bit higher than it was in the 1970s or even parts of the 1980s; we did win the 40-year Cold War; we are living longer; the world is looking to the U.S. for leadership. So why are we in a sour mood?
<p>

The answer is simple: We are not fulfilling our potential as a people and as a nation. One of the dangers of this era is that it will be known as the era of missed opportunities. Never in history, and certainly in the 20th century for this country, has a nation had a chance to do more things of a positive nature at home and to be an example of good overseas. Even in 1914, before the first World War, we were simply one of a number of powers in the world. People did look to us, but they looked to other nations and empires as well.
<p>

When the 20th century began, people felt that in spite of all of the problems in the world, this would be an age of material abundance. The rule of law would advance. Even autocratic Russia was beginning to lumber -- haltingly, fitfully, but in the right direction -- toward a constitutional monarchy. Then came the First World War. The devastation of that seemingly senseless loss of life undermined, in the minds of many, the foundations of Western civilization. The rise of communism in Russia, fascism in Italy, and Nazism in Germany following the First World War helped plant the seeds of the Great Depression and, of course, the Second World War. Now, with the Cold War over, we once again have a chance, at least in spirit, to go back to the optimism that began this century.
<p>

In America today is this mindset that we can't grow economically more than 2 percent or 2.5 percent, which is absolutely preposterous. Overseas, countries are looking to us. They want to know: How do we make the transition to a free-market economy?  How do we make it possible for liberty to sink real roots and not be uprooted as happened in the aftermath of World War I?
<p>

We should keep in mind, for example, that in the 1920s and early 1930s democracy was the prevalent form of government in much of the world. Yet, without external aggression, simply because of internal weakness and because the world did not create an environment to make it possible for democracy to sink real roots, democracy in Europe collapsed almost everywhere -- Central Europe, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Greece, Turkey, and Italy. Everywhere you looked, most ominously in Germany and then in Asia because of Japan, democracy quickly collapsed.
<p>

Today we have an opportunity, not for a New World Order where we have direction from above, but to liberate the imagination and energies of people around the world. They are looking for guidance on how to do it, and we have so far failed abysmally in being an example of good -- not only at home but also overseas.
<p>

So the flat tax is a means to an end. This is something that I think our brethren on Capitol Hill have to get used to: that when they explain the issues, such as balancing the budget, they must never forget that the balanced budget is not simply a goal unto itself. It is a means to an end. Otherwise, we sound like accountants looking at numbers as numbers and not as representing real people dealing with real-life problems. That is why the Republicans lost the moral high ground last fall in the confrontation with the White House, and now we have to get that moral high ground back again.
<p>

The flat tax is the first means to revitalizing the American dream. It is no secret to most of you in this room that the tax code today is a monstrous deadweight on American life. It is the principal reason why two incomes in the family can't do the job that one income did in previous generations. As many of you know, a typical family today pays eight times as much in federal income tax on each dollar of income as a typical family did 40 years ago.
<p>

You see the effects of this deadweight in our slow-growth economy. It's not just because the Federal Reserve believes in the crazy Phillips curve that we can't grow more than 2.5 percent without triggering inflation. It is because taxes are not only a means of collecting revenue; taxes are also a price we pay: A tax on income, a tax on profit, a tax on capital gains is a price we pay for working; a price we pay for being innovative, imaginative, and successful. And as we know, when the price of those good things is too high, we are going to get less of them; when the price is lower, we get more of them.
<p>

Yet that seemingly simple insight is lost in policymaking circles in this town. When the Republicans took control of Congress a little over a year ago, they had a chance to get a dynamic model in place in the Congressional Budget Office, but instead they let the opportunity pass by. I remember before I got into the race, when I was with Empower America, I asked one of my opponents, "Why aren't you going for some form of dynamic model?"  "Well, Steve," he said in a tone that only a professor could adopt with a wayward student, "if we keep this old model, that means in order to get tax cuts, we're gonna have to cut spending even more."  He didn't realize that without a dynamic model, you'll get the tax cuts, but at the end of the day you won't get the spending changes as well.
<p>

What the Republicans must remember -- if they ever knew it -- is that if you are going to get long-term changes in Washington, if you're ever going to get serious cuts in spending, serious downsizing and reorganization of government, you must have an environment where fear is not prevalent, where people see that their lives are dramatically improving, that opportunities are there. Then voters will give you the political capital if you wish to use that capital to make those difficult long-term changes. That simple insight is seemingly lost in too many quarters of our party: You will not get economic growth unless you get rid of these high tax rates, and the most effective, dramatic way to get rid of them is with the flat tax.
<p>

But the tax code is also the principal source of power in Washington. For a couple of generations now the favorite activity has been trading loopholes, trading favors for political support and contributions. All you have to do is look at those graphs in Dan Mitchell's book to see what members of tax-writing committees get in contributions versus what their brethren on other committees in Congress get.<sup>1</sup>  The same thing is true of the state legislatures. The current tax code is the principal source of political pollution and corruption in Washington.
<p>

Today, as we all know, even the tax collector doesn't understand what's in the tax code. Half the time, if you call the IRS, even the IRS doesn't know what's in there; but if you take the IRS's advice and it's wrong, you're held responsible for it.
<p>

I liked to point out in my campaign that the Gettysburg Address is a little over 200 words; the American Declaration of Independence, 1,300 words; the Holy Bible, 773,000 words: the federal income tax code, 7 million words and rising. That puts the tax code in perspective. There's no way to "ER" this thing. You can't reform it. You really can't cut around the edges. The only thing you can do with this monstrosity is to scrap it, drive a stake through it, bury it, and hope it never rises again to terrorize the American taxpayer. There is no other way.
<p>

Let me briefly outline what my flat tax plan is. One of the most astonishing things that came out of this campaign was what people thought my plan was or what it was reported to be -- not what it actually was. <p>


The great virtue of the flat tax, in addition to its simplicity, is that it has generous exemptions for adults and children. An adult, for example, would get a $13,000 tax deduction; each child, $5,000. Also, the flat tax is a tax cut; I'll state that up front. When you're on the campaign trail, reporters expect you to say this isn't revenue neutral. No, my plan is not revenue neutral. And they ask with horror, "Why isn't it revenue neutral?"
<p>

"Revenue neutral" gets to the heart of the problem: the attitude that the nation exists to feed the appetite of Washington. What I tried to make clear on the campaign trail was that there are occasions when Washington should have to adjust to the needs of the nation, and under my flat tax plan, it would do just that. With generous exemptions -- $13,000 for an adult, $5,000 for each child -- for the first time since withholding was invented in 1942, millions of Americans would be removed from the federal income tax rolls.
<p>

With those exemptions, for example, a couple would pay no tax on their first $26,000 of income. For a family of four with two kids, it would be the first $36,000. With three kids, it would be $41,000. There are not many families of four in America, outside of a few major centers, that would have $36,000 of tax deductions under the current system. So the flat tax would remove millions of people.
<p>

Any income above those exemptions would be taxed at a simple flat rate of 17 percent. There would be no tax on the personal level -- on your pension, Social Security, personal savings, capital gains, or inheritance. For business, it would be equally simple. Obviously, the transition issues are much more complicated; it would take several years to phase in, especially on the business side. But once it was phased in, you would have a 17 percent rate on the net, and then investments would be written off, expensed in year one: no more ever-changing, complicated depreciation schedules. It makes no sense in this high-tech, information, micro-chip age for Congress, the IRS, the tax courts, or the government as a whole to dictate to entrepreneurs and executives the life of an asset -- to put an arbitrary life on an asset. That should be a business decision, not the government's.
<p>

That is, in essence, the flat tax, or my version of it. The good points of it I thought were self-evident. With that 17 percent rate, we'd get a true boom in the economy -- one that would dwarf even that of the early 1960s when we had growth rates that people today would say are impossible to achieve. In the early 1960s through the mid-1960s up to the Vietnam War, the economy grew almost 5 percent in real terms. That is the kind of growth rate, given the fundamentals of America today, that I think we can achieve again, not forever, but for several years as we begin to bring our new technologies on-line.
<p>

The flat tax is also a fair system because if you make more, you pay more. It is also postcard simple, which was, I thought, a very attractive feature. It is also honest; it rips away the principal source of political pollution and corruption in the nation's capital; and if we can do that in D.C., I guarantee you, you'll quickly do it in most of the 50 states.
<p>

What, then, were the arguments against something that would do so much good for America?  I hate to repeat them here, because many of you know that they are not really valid, but we will be hit with these arguments as this debate heats up.
<p>

First, critics said the flat tax would hurt or clobber housing. Only in Washington would people believe that a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code would somehow be a disaster for housing. After all, you get to keep more of what you earn, you don't have your personal savings taxed, so it's easier to put together a downpayment for a house. Even the Clinton Treasury Department acknowledges that the flat tax would mean lower interest rates, which would translate into lower mortgage rates. And realtors know that the principal determinant of a person's or couple's buying a house is the monthly payment. That is the key factor, and with lower interest rates you would have even lower monthly payments.
<p>

Put these three factors together -- more money in the pocket (not to mention the opportunity for better-paying jobs in the future), an easier-to-put-together downpayment, and lower monthly mortgage payments. How is that a disaster for housing?  No one ever explained it to me, certainly not the realtors. The bogus study they drew on came from one of Forbes magazine's competitors. I will admit I have a vested interest in downgrading DRI/McGraw-Hill, but, in the study they assumed a flat tax rate of 22 percent to 25 percent, not the 17 percent I was talking about.
<p>

Critics said it would be bad for charities. The blunt fact of the matter is that in America, when people have more, they give more. With a flat tax, we'd have more and would be persuaded to give more. The United States is known as a charitable, generous nation; Alexis de Tocqueville talked about it 160 years ago, long before we had a federal income tax.
<p>

Nay-sayers said it would be bad for municipal bond holders because other forms of debt would not be taxed directly to individuals and this would be bad for municipal bonds. No, it would not hurt the price of municipal bonds. When the general level of interest rates goes down, it does not hurt the principle value of municipal bonds.
<p>

What it would mean -- and this is what the issuers of municipal bonds hated -- is more accountability. You know and I know that when you buy a munibond, the only thing you want to know about is does it have a good rating, does it have insurance. Then you buy it. You don't look very hard at what's behind that bond. Well, the issuers of munibonds would not have that advantage anymore, and those products would get the same kind of examination that other forms of debt get -- not a bad thing in terms of political accountability. But in terms of hurting the principle value of the bonds, it wouldn't. If anything, once the flat tax was in place, the price of municipal bonds would probably go up a little bit. What's wrong with that?
<p>

Then the carpers said it would hurt the middle class. Somebody just showed me an item from Sunday's <I>Washington Times.</I> Dick Gephardt is flogging that crazy notion again. He says Dick Armey's plan, which is not much different from mine, will hurt the middle class, raise its taxes several thousand dollars. You know how they can make that statement?  They assume that it will be a flat 17 percent rate on all your income. No exemptions; they leave out the $36,000 of exemptions (in Armey's case, the first $31,000 or $33,000 of exemptions). They leave that out. So a family of four making $45,000 a year, according to Dick Gephardt, would owe a tax of $7,000. You know what the real tax would be under my variation of the flat tax?  About $1,600. Under Dick Armey's, $2,000. Millions of people would be removed from the tax rolls, but that fact also got lost in the shuffle during the campaign.
<p>

Critics said the flat tax would give advantages to rich people, because investment income would not be taxed. As you know, investment income would be taxed, only it would be taxed at the source, at the corporate level. Now, why it was considered populist to say that businesses should not write the checks to the government, that individuals should write the checks to the government, I have not been able to figure out. To give business the tax break, but not the individual, somehow was seen as liberal. Even Pat Buchanan was talking about lounge lizards in Miami getting these breaks.
<p>

For those of you not familiar with the arguments, let me reassure you: Investment income is taxed, only it's taxed at the business level. Businesses write the checks to the IRS, which means the IRS gets the money sooner. Because it's taxed at the source, it also means you get it more efficiently and faster. 
<p>

It's like withholding on your paycheck. When you get a paycheck, your employer takes out, or withholds, all of your taxes, all your payroll taxes, and you get the remainder. The rest is siphoned off, sent to the IRS. The same thing is true for investment income, only in this case the business withholds the 17 percent and writes the check to the IRS. Whatever the company decides to give its shareholders, the taxes on that amount already have been paid. It's taxed at the source, taxed once, taxed more efficiently.
<p>

During the campaign, this was made to sound as if it were going to be a giveaway to the rich, a disaster that would destroy the middle class. Actually, it would revive the so-called middle class, which, thankfully, in America is not static; its members are changing all the time.
<p>

The final argument has great resonance within my party, the Republican Party: that a flat tax would hurt the deficit. Again, you have to remember that the flat tax is a means to an end, just as deficit reduction is a means to an end. My own view is that the flat tax is the only way we're ever going to get Washington's finances reformed, because only if you have a vibrant, growing economy, as I said earlier, will you have the political capital to make those difficult changes.
<p>

The deficit would be eliminated, even by the way Washington keeps its books -- which is a disaster -- because you would have great growth. I think we could get 5 percent growth for several years. You would have more compliance. Even with the convoluted tax code today, whenever tax rates are reduced, compliance goes up.
<p>

There would be the efficiency factor: We spend, depending on whose numbers you use, $100 billion to $103 billion a year just complying with the tax code. We spend up to 6 billion hours a year just filling out tax forms. Already, at least in quality of life, our lives would improve. We would have a couple of extra billion hours a year for doing other things. You would have that efficiency factor in the economy as well, with people able to do more productive things -- at least more satisfying things -- than coping with tax forms.
<p>

And finally, with lower interest rates, you would pay less on the national debt. Not only would people have lower mortgage payments, but also there would be less owed on the national debt, which would also take some pressure off the federal deficit.
<p>

So whatever the arguments are -- whether it's housing, charities, munibonds, the middle class, deficits, or something else -- there are good answers to them. It was remarkable during the campaign that, despite the drumbeat of criticism, exit polls showed that in the primaries a plurality or majority of the voters were still in favor of the flat tax. That shows that information can get through some very distorted or polluted filters.
<p>

Let me close by quickly touching on how we got this tax monstrosity and what a unique opportunity we have to fundamentally overhaul the tax code. The background is very simple. Today's government is primarily a result of the wars that we had to fight in this century. Warfare is a centralizing force. In order to face the external threat, a country has to mobilize the resources of its society. And, with very few exceptions, for the last 80 years, America has faced a major external threat of one sort or another.
<p>

When the income tax was introduced in 1913, what was the top rate?  Six percent?  When did you hit the first 1 percent bracket?  I think you had to earn the equivalent of today's six-figure income before you became even eligible for the income tax. Yet five to six years later, because of World War I, what was the top rate?   Over 70 percent. After World War I lawmakers said, "We can't reduce these rates because it would hurt the budget deficit."
<p>

Fortunately, in the 1920s we got Republican Presidents, Harding and Coolidge and a Treasury Secretary, all vilified by the history books, who reduced tax rates to a top rate of 25 percent. But we got a piece of economic warfare: The Smoot-Hawley tariff. It and other policies waged trade and currency war against the rest of the world, and that led to the massive tax increases of 1932.
<p>

No sooner did the New Deal wind down than we had the Second World War, which, of course, was a great centralizing event in this nation's history. And along came tax withholding. And no sooner was World War II over than we found ourselves in a 40-year Cold War.
<p>

By the early 1960s, even though John Kennedy was reducing tax rates, it was accepted economic thinking that you needed high tax rates because if you didn't have them, the government could not spend money, and people might save too much. They really thought saving was a problem in the 1930s, and even in the 1950s: If we saved too much, the economy would stagnate. Without high tax rates, people would keep their money and might not invest it, might not spend it. And the economy would stagnate. In other words, if people won't use their money, the government will take it away and spend it for them.
<p>

That part of things was true: The government has spent it, and then some. By the early 1960s -- and this is important to understand -- a lot of people in America believed that if a government could win two World Wars, alleviate the distress of the Great Depression, put a man on the Moon, and be in the forefront of the civil rights movement, it could be used as an instrument to solve all of the nation's other problems, at home and overseas. 
<p>

 We have learned some very painful lessons in the last 30 years. We have learned the limitations of government in real-life experiences. Now, with the end of the Cold War, we don't have a centralizing trend. We have learned that at home, government is no more successful than it has ever been in creating utopias here on Earth. We do have a situation overseas, at least for a while, of relative peace. I say relative peace: This administration seems to be doing its best to revive bad forces in the world. We still have a window of opportunity, though.
<p>

We are in the midst of a technology age that is pro-individual, machines recentralizing events in and of themselves, big cities, big corporations, big unions, big government. Personal computers are almost Jeffersonian in their characteristics -- anti-hierarchy, anti-authoritarian; they let anyone roam around the world at will. You have the new age of the economy; you have the end of the Cold War. This is a good time to make fundamental reforms and get away from the debris that grew from the travesties, the errors, and the tragedies of the 20th century.
<p>

Why, then, is there so much opposition?  Why did it take this campaign for people to begin discussing making changes in Social Security, to push medical savings accounts?  And why is it that something so basic as the flat tax -- whether it's my version, Dick Armey's version, or somebody else's version, the concept is the same -- why is there so much opposition to it?
<p>

I think the reason is a basic one: A flat tax strikes at the heart of the power and culture of Washington, even as much as term limits does. That's why it will be furiously resisted. But public opinion -- if you nurture it, if you get out there and explain the flat tax, come out with books like Dan's or Dick Armey's books, go on the talk shows, do some little agitprops, as they used to say -- it can triumph.
<p>

And if that kind of tax reform triumphs, then all of our other reforms will be able to triumph as well. We're not talking about devolving power from Washington to the state municipalities; we're taking a more direct route, directly back to "We the people."  Whether it's parental control of education, term limits, a new Social Security system for younger people, medical savings accounts, and especially the flat tax, it's giving power back to us. If you allow people to keep more of the resources they create, they create more resources. It's that simple, as another would-be businessman-politician likes to say. It is that simple.
<p>

So the flat tax is more than an economic argument. It's more than a pressure-on-two-income-families argument. It gets to the essence of the wonderful potential and opportunities we have in America today. And if we take positive advantage of these opportunities, then the basic thrust of American civilization -- which is inclusive, glued together by a shared set of ideas and ideals; not by race, religion, or common ancestry, but by people sharing a set of ideas and ideals -- can triumph and revive, not only here but overseas as well.
<p>

Will this be an age of realized opportunities?  From my experience on the campaign trail -- even though I didn't go as far as I would have liked -- the answer is a resounding "yes."  You here today are proof of it, and as more people understand the possibilities, it is going to happen.
<p>

The history of ideas is never a smooth one, as some of the textbooks would suggest, and it is never one of inevitability. We have to make ideas happen; but in this new age, with the new tools available, and with people ripe for this kind of reform, we can make ideas become reality.
<p>

I hope that we can work together and can get others to work with us to make these reforms happen. When we do, this generation will be seen as doing what previous generations of Americans have done: as having faced opportunities, faced challenges, and risen to the occasion so that future generations can build on what we bequeath them.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

<H2> June/July Insider -- Flat Tax Fever </H2>
<HR>
<P>Although
it was a largely unknown academic concept just one year ago, the
flat tax today is one of the most talked about policy reforms
in Washington, in large part due to the efforts of House Majority
Leader Richard Armey of Texas. It now looks increasingly possible
that the current income tax system will be junked in favor of
this simple, fair, pro-growth plan. The present system suffers
from three major problems, each of which would be solved by the
flat tax:<P>
<ul>
<li>Problem #1: High tax rates that discourage work, savings,
and investment.Flat Tax Solution: The Armey flat tax replaces
the current discriminatory system of tax rates with a simple,
low rate that treats all taxpayers equally.<P>
<li>Problem #2: Needless
complexity that imposes $200 billion of compliance costs.Flat
Tax Solution: The Armey flat tax allows all taxpayers to fill
out their taxes on a postcardsized form.<P>
<li>Problem #3: Multiple taxation
of capital income that penalizes economic growth.Flat Tax Solution:
Not only are all individuals treated equally, so is all income.
No longer would some income escape taxation while other types
of income are subject to as many as four levels of taxation.
</ul><P>
The
flat tax solves all these problems by creating a tax system that
treats all citizens equally, rewards productive behavior, and
gets the government out of the business of using tax law to micromanage
the economy. The key benefits of the flat tax are:
<ul>
<li>Faster economic
growth: By reducing tax penalties against savings and investment,
a flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment.
If enactment of a flat tax boosted longterm annual growth by as
little as 0.5 percent, the income of an average family of four
after 10 years would be as much as $5,000 higher than if current
tax laws remained in place.<p>
<li>Instant wealth creation: According to
Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, adoption of the flat tax would
boost national wealth by some $1 trillion. All incomeproducing
assets would rise in value since the flat tax would increase the
aftertax stream of income they generate.<p>
<li>Simplicity: One business
in 1992 had a tax return 21,000 pages long requiring 30 volumes.
Individual taxpayers are slightly better off, but the system still
imposes needless costs. Under a flat tax, all taxpayers, from
General Motors to John Doe, would be able to fill out their tax
return on a postcardsized form. Current compliance costs would
drop by tens of billions of dollars. <p>
<li>Fairness:  A flat tax would
treat people equally. A very wealthy taxpayer with 1,000 times
the income of another taxpayer would pay 1,000 times more in taxes.
No longer would the tax code penalize success and discriminate
on the basis of income.<p>
<li>End to micromanaging and political favoritism:
 The flat tax gets rid of all deductions, loopholes, credits,
and exemptions. Politicians would lose all ability to pick winners
and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax
code to impose their values on the economy. According to Professor
Alvin Rabushka of Stanford, $100 billion of uneconomical investments
are made for tax purposes, funds that would be used to boost economic
growth under a flat tax.<p>
<li> Increased civil liberties: Under current
laws, those charged with murder have more rights than taxpayers
dealing with the IRS. With a simpler, fairer tax code, however,
infringements on freedoms and privacy would fall dramatically. <P>
<li>Political
feasibility: Unlike the national sales tax or value added tax, the
flat tax does not require either repealing the 16th amendment
or running the risk of creating an entirely new revenue source
for tax hungry politicians.The Heritage Foundation has published
two papers on the flat tax: Jobs, Growth, Freedom, and
Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax (Backgrounder #1035) and
A Brief Guide to the Flat Tax (Talking Points). Heritage
is also leading a flat tax working group comprised of more than
100 representatives of think tanks, congressional offices, trade
associations, citizens groups, and businesses. In addition to
broad discussions about status and strategy, the working group
has subcommittees designed to address key issues involving the
media, public awareness, transition problems, and Capitol Hill.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
have founded a "Tax Reform and Economic Growth" commission
charged with developing a fair and simple tax system. Heritage
President <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> will serve as one of 13 appointees, as well
as the vice-chairman of the commission.<p>

A Special Report to the House Banking and Financial Services Committee
<P>


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 requires a number of government agencies--the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)--to report on the feasibility and effects of privatizing the two largest housing-related government sponsored enterprises (GSEs): the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).
<p>

As these reports are being submitted to Congress,<sup>1</sup> the House subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities and Government Sponsored Enterprises is holding oversight hearings to study the issue of privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The hearings have highlighted the diverse opinions of the federal agencies on the advantages and disadvantages of privatization. Several of the academic studies and the Congressional Budget Office report indicate that federal sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provides stockholders with a significant subsidy that may indicate government sponsorship is unnecessary. On the other hand, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development both conclude that government sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continues to be necessary to preserve the mission and ensure the success of these GSEs.


<p>
Because of the divergent views among government agencies and outside experts on privatization, some observers are arguing that, even if the GSEs are not privatized, congressional oversight is inappropriate because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are legally private corporations and not government agencies. Thus, Congress now finds itself defending its oversight role as well as considering the option of privatization.
<p>

Although Congress will hear many different views on these issues, it must keep in mind  two important facts to help guide its decisions:
<ol>

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers.</b> Congressional oversight of government sponsored enterprises is not only appropriate but indeed critical as long as GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac receive government subsidies, undertake a public mission, and place taxpayers at risk.

<p><li><b>The original mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary mortgage market, has been fulfilled.</b> Thus, Congress should take steps to end the relationship between these organizations and the federal government.
</ol><p>
<b>Congressional Oversight of GSEs Is Critical As Long As 
Taxpayers Are At Risk</b>
<p>

The structure and mission of government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) makes their relationship to the federal government and role in the economy ambiguous and at times risky. GSEs typically are stockholder-owned corporations, and therefore private, but chartered and overseen by the federal government, and therefore public. This dual personality can create a conflict between a GSE executive who is responsible for maximizing profit for the corporation's stockholders and the federal official whose duty is to ensure that the public mission of the corporation is met.
<p>

Because GSEs are private organizations responsible to their stockholders, they may view congressional oversight and investigations as intrusions into the internal affairs of their private business. At the same time, none of the GSEs want to lose the special privileges afforded them by federal charter and implicit government guarantees. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are active across the country and easily can mobilize broad-based support within Congress for favorable treatment. This is especially true when the topic of discussion is privatization.
<p>

However, there are several reasons why congressional oversight and investigation is important and necessary as long as GSEs remain under the umbrella of taxpayer support and protection. These include: 
<ul>
<p><li><b>The GSEs were chartered by Congress to fulfill a specific public policy goal.</b> In exchange for the government support enjoyed by GSEs--such as exemption from state and local taxes, the ability to borrow money from the federal treasury, and participation in Federal Reserve Open Market transactions--these private organizations are expected to fulfill a specific public policy goal. In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, this goal is to make home mortgages more readily available by creating an efficient and fluid secondary mortgage market. Although this mission has been met, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to receive significant benefits from the federal government. It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that the GSEs do not use these benefits to stray from their original charters.

<p><li><b>The federal oversight agency can have conflicting roles as regulator and advocate, putting taxpayers at risk.</b>The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 created the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) to oversee the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Specifically, the OFHEO is required to establish minimal risk-based capital standards to be met by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These requirements limit the potential risk faced by taxpayers in the case of a serious failure. However, the risk-based capital requirements also have the effect of limiting the profitability of the GSEs by restricting the amount of productive investments that can be made at any one time. Therefore, the goals of advocacy and regulation can be in direct conflict. If the OFHEO chooses to lean toward advocacy rather than regulation, then taxpayer risk could increase.<sup>2</sup>  The Congressional Budget Office reports that "OFHEO's objective of minimizing risk is inconsistent with the current objective of using the GSEs to finance the achievement of social goals."<sup>3</sup> Thus, Congress also must oversee the activities of the OFHEO.

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for avoiding a GSE failure that potentially could cost taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Congress is responsible for protecting the interests of the American taxpayers. Taxpayers have a large vested interest in government sponsored enterprises and it is incumbent upon Congress to ensure that this interest is carefully protected.
</ul><p>
<b>Privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</b>
<p>

Privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have a number of important economic benefits. In the short-term, the loss of an implicit government guarantee would increase the cost of business for GSEs, and it is likely that part of this increase would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher mortgage interest costs. In the long-run, however, the end of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's implicit government guarantee would create a more competitive secondary mortgage market. Increased competition would counter the loss of federal subsidies and help to keep mortgage costs down. Competition also would lead to greater innovation and hence more consumer choice. In addition, privatization would mean an end to taxpayer support and the mandate to achieve certain public policy objectives. Thus, the federal government's oversight role would end, and the GSEs would be free to exit existing lines of business and enter more profitable ones. 
<p>

Several important factors make privatization a viable and attractive option. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have fulfilled their original mission; secondary mortgage markets are established and fluid.</b> There is a consensus that the secondary mortgage market in America is well established and fluid. In fact, each of the four studies mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 concludes that an efficient secondary mortgage market exists today (see box). Along with other private firms, they would able to take advantage of the established market without posing a threat to taxpayers. </ul>

<tr><td><b>BY ALL ACCOUNTS, TODAY'S SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET IS ESTABLISHED AND FLUID</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>"The secondary market now provides an efficient, stable, and dependable source of liquidity for mortgage credit markets."<sup>4</sup> - <I>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</I><p>

"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have succeeded in developing a liquid secondary mortgage market for conforming, conventional mortgages. ... There seems little doubt that securitization and the secondary mortgage activities pioneered by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are now well-established and that the secondary market for conforming, conventional mortgages could operate efficiently and effectively even if Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's government sponsorship were altered."<sup>5</sup> -  <I>U.S. Department of the Treasury</I>
<p>
 "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have played critical roles in establishing and maintaining a nationwide secondary mortgage market, enhancing the affordability and availability of housing finance, and increasing efficiency through greater standardization of mortgage products and processes."<sup>6</sup> - <I>General Accounting Office</I>
<p>
"From a perspective of financing mortgages, the good news is that access to mortgage funds has increased."<sup>7</sup> - <I>Congressional Budget Office</I>
</td></tr></table>
<ul><p>

<p><li><b>There is no rationale for further government intervention in the mortgage credit markets.</b> Fannie Mae was created in 1938 in an attempt to increase the availability of affordable home mortgages. At that time, technological shortcomings and a Depression-era private economy prevented the widespread availability of home mortgages. Even in 1970, when Freddie Mac was chartered, an efficient secondary market was an illusive goal. However, today technology and more fluid capital markets have increased the availability of mortgages to all potential home buyers. 
<p>
Indeed, the development and efficiency of the home mortgage markets in America is, at least in part, a credit to the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After having met their original goals, however, these GSEs are now involved in activities that relate only tangentially to their original missions. The Congressional Budget Office reports, "Having achieved their original purpose, the housing GSEs can now cite the authority to undertake a large number of tasks whose precise nature is not always clearly defined."<sup>8</sup>  The expansion of activities undertaken by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac indicates that they have fulfilled their original public policy mission. These expanded activities also pose new risks to the taxpayers.
<p>

<li><b>The tremendous size of the housing GSEs, which is made possible only by implicit federal guarantee,  presents a dangerous presence in the capital markets.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together have more than $1.4 trillion in debt and mortgage-backed securities. This is equivalent to nearly two-fifths of the publicly held federal government debt.<sup>9</sup>  Together the two housing GSEs purchase more than 50 percent of all conforming mortgages.<sup>10</sup>  By any measure, then, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are "800-pound gorillas" in the capital markets. This tremendous size is made possible only by the distinct advantages enjoyed by the organizations as government sponsored enterprises.
<p>
The advantages enjoyed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their enormous size present several dangers to the credit markets in general and the mortgage markets specifically. Private firms cannot compete with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.<sup>11</sup> The federal government, in essence, has created a duopoly that hinders innovation and prevents consumers from obtaining the most efficient delivery of home mortgages. Moreover, in the case of a GSE failure, the mortgage credit market would be severely crippled because of the lack of participants able to fill the void left by such a primary participant.
<p>
In addition, the large number of transactions carried out by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have significant effects on other credit markets. Demand for mortgages is abnormally high because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are able to borrow money in the credit markets at a subsidized rate. This subsidy is partially passed on to consumers, who will forego other investment activities when faced with a lower mortgage price. In fact, residential structures today represent nearly 30 percent of total tangible wealth in the United States. This figure has slowly been rising over the past two decades. Government distortion of the capital markets means that natural demands within other sectors--such as small business loans, consumer loans, and farm loans--are not being fully met. This distortion may have a long-term impact on the strength of the American economy as more capital is diverted away from productive business activities and into home ownership.
<p>
<p><li><b>The mixed private/public nature of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a conflict of interest.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder-owned companies. As such, they are responsible for earning the highest possible profits for their shareholders. In the private market this would be completely acceptable. However, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are accountable for meeting several public goals that may conflict with their private incentive to earn a maximum profit. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac vigorously pursue their private goals, then the public mission is lost and taxpayers are placed in jeopardy. On the other hand, stockholders are denied a maximum rate of return if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pursue their public missions too vigorously. This conflict between public and private interests will continue as long as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain government sponsored, but structurally private, enterprises.
<p>
Fannie Mae admits that the value of its stock depends largely on federal government subsidies. Responding to one of the five academic studies prepared for Congress, Fannie Mae writes, "[I]f shareholders are not compensated fully, they will likely claim that privatization constitutes an appropriation of private property without just compensation in violation of the Due Process or the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment."<sup>12</sup> Thus, even Fannie Mae recognizes that the current structure of the housing GSEs constitutes a transfer of wealth from the entire pool of taxpayers to the relatively small number of GSE stockholders. As in all areas of government, such a transfer is highly suspect.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The reports mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act and the current congressional hearings represent a positive step in addressing the need for and appropriateness of federal interference in the financial markets. Congress has a responsibility to oversee the ongoing activities of all GSEs, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as long as American taxpayers provide support and assume risk for GSE activities.
<p>

With their original goal of a comprehensive and fluid secondary mortgage market fulfilled, however, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac no longer require government support. Increasingly, housing GSEs are venturing into new areas of operation that pose a significant threat to taxpayers. With the job done, Congress should break the links between Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal government and completely turn these profitable operations over to the private sector.

<b>ENDNOTES</b>
<ol>
<p><li> CBO and GAO have submitted their reports and testified before Congress on their findings. In addition, five academic studies also have been submitted to various agencies and Congress. The Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development are expected to report their findings later this month.
<p><li> In fact, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac already enjoy a lower mandated capital to asset ratio (a prime indicator of financial institution stability) than commercial banks and thrift institutions. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac typically maintain a capital to asset ratio of 3.5 percent and 4.9 percent respectively. The average commercial bank ratio is 7.8 percent and the average private thrift maintains a ratio of 7.9 percent. Several analysts have pointed out that these relatively low capital to asset ratios pose a potential threat to the solvency of the GSEs.

<p><li> A "conforming" mortgage is one with a principal below an amount set by statute and based on the median value of owner-occupied homes. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are only able to purchase conforming mortgages. Mortgages above the conforming limit are known as jumbo mortgages and are securitized only by completely private firms.
