<P>U.S. defense policy is undergoing its most sweeping  reappraisal since World
War II. The defense budget has dropped every  year for ten years, and from the
end of FY 1988 through FY 1995,  the Pentagon has eliminated well over one
million military  personnel. Nevertheless, despite the shrinking of America's
military might,  it is not yet clear how weak America can afford to become, or 
indeed what the major mission of the U.S. armed forces will be in the  21st
century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most dangerous threat to America today is the proliferation  of
long-range nuclear missiles that could reach American soil  from Iran, Iraq,
North Korea, or some other hostile nation.  Intelligence officials state that at
least 20 countries already have or may  be developing both weapons of mass
destruction (including  nuclear weapons) and ballistic missile delivery 
systems.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#1">1</A>  While no Third World
countries yet have ballistic missiles with sufficient range  to reach the United
States, it is a virtual certainty that some will  have them by the next decade.
Yet America has no defense against  these weapons. Strategic anti-missile
defenses are more important  than ever and could be deployed by the early part
of the coming  century. To do otherwise -- to leave America undefended against such a clear physical threat -- would be a dereliction of duty with  tragic
potential consequences.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other possible near-term threats to U.S. vital national interests  are the
potential re-establishment of an expansionist dictatorship  in Russia, military
expansionism by Iran or Iraq, attacks by  North Korea against South Korea, or
militarily threatening moves  by China against Taiwan. A defense posture capable
of  countering these threats can be maintained at far less cost than the Cold 
War demanded. However, the Clinton Administration is not  maintaining these
necessary defenses. Instead, it has presided over a  period of decline and
confusion in America's military capabilities.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are many national security issues and questions  dividing liberals
from conservatives, but not all are familiar. What, for  example, is the right
amount to spend on defense now that the  Soviet threat has ended?  There is no
consensus on the Left or the  Right; much of the old Left-Right division on
defense strategy and  spending ended with the fall of the Soviet Union. Many 
conservatives want to focus entirely on domestic problems and cut all  federal
spending, including defense. Many liberals (including the  Clinton
Administration), while not supporting higher defense  spending, want to use
American military forces in humanitarian,  peacekeeping, and non-traditional
missions which put enormous pressure  on the shrinking defense budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are many other issues and questions facing the  candidates this year:
What is the proper use of American military force in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  post-Cold War world, and what kind
of forces are needed?   Should the U.S. military be converted to a kind of
global  peacekeeping constabulary?  Or should the armed services continue to
focus  on their traditional role of deterring threats to America's vital 
interests, the central element of which is preparing to fight and  win wars?  If
the U.S. military is to maintain its focus on this  traditional warfighting
role, what level of personnel is needed, and  how should the armed forces be
organized, trained, and equipped  for the future?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The post-Cold War world can be characterized as an &quot;Age  of Chaos.&quot;
 While the Soviet Union has fallen and no longer  threatens the free world with
nuclear annihilation, new conflicts have  been spawned  ethnic, tribal, and
religious  between emerging  nations and at the sub-national level. Some of
these conflicts  may threaten U.S. interests; most will not. But they certainly 
disturb peace and order in the world. Under what circumstances should  the U.S.
intervene?  What are sound and politically supportable  criteria for the use of
American military force abroad?  These are  two key questions facing the U.S.
today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. armed forces are not merely subordinate to civilian  leadership,
starting with the Commander in Chief, but highly  responsive, precisely because
of their command hierarchy. How  should the military respond to the social and
political agenda of the  President and his Administration?  Should the
Administration use  this highly responsive institution to foster revolutionary
social  change or as a laboratory for social experimentation?  What is the 
impact on combat readiness when radical social changes are forced on  the armed
forces?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the most contentious unresolved defense issue is  this: Should the
American homeland be defended against the  growing threat of long-range
ballistic missiles and the proliferation   especially among potentially hostile
nations  of weapons of mass  destruction?  Five years after the Gulf War, in
which the  largest single loss of American lives came from an Iraqi Scud missile
 attack, the U.S. still has no better defense against regional or  theater
missile threats than the <U>Patriot</U> missile, which was designed  primarily
not as a missile defense, but as an anti-aircraft missile.  The question is:
Should the U.S. move aggressively to deploy  more effective theater missile
defenses for U.S. forces and allies abroad?   Or should America continue to rely
on arms control treaties  like the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to protect
its security?

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The budget (in spending authority) for the
Defense  Department reached its peak in FY 1985. Today, it is being cut sharply 
despite instability and threats to America's security around the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In constant, inflation-adjusted dollars, there was a decline
of  35 percent in defense spending from FY 1986 to FY 1995. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     President Clinton proposes to slash budget authority for the 
Department of Defense from $282 billion to $276.6 billion by  the year 2002. In
constant, inflation-adjusted dollars, this would  represent another cut of about
24 percent in defense spending from  the FY 1992 baseline.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     President Clinton's defense budget fails to fund his own 
defense program. The Heritage Foundation calculates that projected  spend
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  ing in the President's five-year
defense plan (FY 1996 - FY  2000) will fall short by $110 billion. Other
organizations, including  the Congressional Budget Office, the Center for
Strategic and  International Studies, the Defense Budget Project, and the
General  Accounting Office, concur that the Clinton Administration  is
underfunding its own defense program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Reagan defense buildup in the 1980s increased active  Army
divisions from 16 to 18 and reserve divisions from 8 to 10 by  FY 1986.
Clinton's defense plan would cut these forces roughly  in half, reducing active
Army divisions to 10 and reserve  division equivalents to somewhat more than 5.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Air Force reached a high during the Reagan years of 26 
active tactical wings and 13 reserve wings. Clinton would cut  these forces by
about half, to 13 active and 7 reserve wings.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Marine Corps during the Reagan years reached a high  of
199,000 active-duty Marines and 42,000 reservists. Clinton  proposes
approximately 174,000 active-duty and 42,000 reserve  personnel.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In addition, Ronald Reagan increased total Navy ships from 479
 to a high of 569 and the number of aircraft carrier battle groups to  15.
Clinton would reduce these levels by about 40 percent, to  346 ships and 11
aircraft carrier battle groups.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Clinton Administration proposed a budget for missile 
defense that is less than half of what the Bush Administration proposed  for the
five-year period covering FY 1995-FY 1999.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A general readiness crisis precipitated by the Clinton defense
 budget was highlighted in two separate congressional  reports.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#2">2</A>  These reports noted that many
front-line American combat units  were understrength and forced to cancel
critical training, strip  other units for spare parts, and deploy on missions at
80-90  percent strength. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A General Accounting Office report on the effect of 
peacekeeping operations on combat capability concluded that it could take up  to
18 months to retrain a division on peacekeeping duty for  combat.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#3">3</A>  This means that the U.S. Army in
Europe, most of which is  deployed in support of the Bosnian peace
implementation mission,  is effectively out of the warfighting business for from
two to  three years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A March 1995 report by the CIA's Nonproliferation Center 
entitled <I>The Weapons Proliferation</I><U>

developing or already have  ballistic missiles.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has all but abandoned strategic  ballistic
missile defense (BMD). What is left of the nation's BMD  program is both
misdirected and underfunded. The  Administration's current plan directs the bulk
of funds toward defenses  against short-range ballistic missiles, ignoring the
need to defend  U.S. territory against long-range ballistic missiles. It reduces
the  budget for missile defense by almost $23 billion  more than 50 percent  
from FY 1995 through FY 1999. Even the plan's  high-priority &quot;theater&quot;
defenses against short-range missiles are cut by $4.5  bil
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  lion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration is providing neither the resources  nor the
proper direction in maintaining strong conventional  forces. Instead of
identifying specific national interests and the threats  to them, the
Administration has formulated a vague strategy of  &quot;engagement and
enlargement&quot; that confuses the purposes of  national security policy. In
its national security planning, the  Administration has placed far too much
emphasis on tangential issues  like domestic economic policy, environmental
policy, and foreign  economic development.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#4">4</A>  The result has been a national
security  planning process out of control  one disconnected not only from  the
Administration's decision-making process, but also from the  hard realities of
the threats America faces.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The current National Security Strategy developed by the  Clinton
Administration fails to make clear where and under what  circumstances U.S.
forces may be asked to fight. While the Clinton  Administration has established
some guidelines for military  intervention, for example, it ignored many of them
in its decision to  send troops to Bosnia. In Bosnia, the Administration made
the  mistake of creating a vital American interest where there otherwise  would
not be one. By promising U.S. troops in a yet-to-be-defined  mission and putting
American credibility on the line during the  Dayton peace talks, the Clinton
Administration presented  Congress with the choice of supporting the
Administration or damaging  U.S. credibility by breaking its word. The risks of
the Bosnian  intervention clearly are out of proportion to the costs, and the
exit  strategy is essentially an exit date of a year or less after the 
intervention began. Most controversial of all, however, was President  Clinton's
decision to deploy American forces without congressional  ap
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  proval or public support. Public
opinion supporting the  intervention crested at 40 percent in December 1995,
when the House  of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the Bosnia 
mission. At the same time, the Senate expressed only lukewarm  support  support
directed at American forces, but not the  Clinton policies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another example of poor defense leadership by the  Administration was its
1993 &quot;Bottom-Up Review&quot; of U.S. military forces.  The purpose of the
BUR was to devise a new military force to  implement U.S. strategy in the
post-Cold War era. In meeting this  goal, however, the BUR failed. The Clinton
Administration promised  to maintain sufficient military forces to fight and win
two  medium regional conflicts, but the forces provided for by the 
Administration strategy are clearly inadequate for a two-war scenario. 
President Clinton's proposed defense budgets for the period  covering FY 1996 to
FY 2000 are not enough to pay for the BUR  force, according to numerous defense
analyses, including those of  The Heritage Foundation and the General Accounting
 Office.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#5">5</A>  The Pentagon will be
around $110 billion short over five years if  it pursues the current Clinton
Administration defense spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Deploying the forces proposed for a single major conflict from  the other
services would leave virtually nothing in reserve if a  second major conflict
began. Of the total active force of 11 aircraft  carrier battle groups proposed
for the Navy, for example, the Clinton  Administration would assign four to five
carriers to each of the  two major regional conflicts, leaving perilously little
room for error.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even worse, because &quot;peace operations&quot; will draw from the  &quot;same
collection of general purpose forces&quot; already obligated for  major 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  regional contingencies, the
Administration intends to support  them by committing up to two Army divisions,
one Marine brigade,  two aircraft carrier battle groups, and two Air Force wings
from  an already overcommitted force.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#6">6</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The bottom line: At the same time the Clinton Administration  has been
cutting the size and readiness of U.S. forces, it has been  increasing the
commitments they are supposed to cover. In  other words, the President is
developing a military &quot;strategy&quot;  whose reach exceeds its grasp and
which inevitably will leave some  vital U.S. interests undefended.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because of Clinton's mismanagement of U.S. defense policy,  the U.S. could
not repeat the<B> </B>sweeping victory of the Persian Gulf  War today<B>.</B>
The Persian Gulf War epitomizes U.S. military  prowess. The forces that won
Desert Storm were largely the product of  the Reagan Administration's military
buildup during the early  1980s. But the Clinton Administration is sacrificing
the combat  readiness of the force of tomorrow to preserve operational readiness
 today. Had Ronald Reagan and Congress done this in the 1980s,  George Bush
could not have won such a decisive and relatively  low-casualty victory in the
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton and Congress owe the same careful  stewardship to the next
President. Not only has Clinton reduced the  armed forces to the point where
they lack the means to fight and win  a Gulf War (while maintaining a minimum of
other defense  commitments), but his budget cuts have severely affected the 
combat readiness of this reduced force. For instance, some Marine  divisions are
operating at 80-90 percent of their assigned  combat strength, Army combat
battalions assigned to be the first forces  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  the Persian Gulf have been forced
to cancel annual gunnery  training, and Navy fighter squadrons have been forced
to  cannibalize some units in order to keep others  flying.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#7">7</A>  These types of readiness crises
threaten to make the U.S. military a hollow  fighting force.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To avoid further critical weakening of America's combat  capability, there
are several actions that the next Administration and  Congress must take.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Devise a coherent national military strategy.</B> In addition to 
providing adequate resources, Congress and the next Administration  need to
devise a new military strategy for the U.S.; for all intents  and purposes,
America now has none. U.S. defense policy should  be built on four fundamental
strategies:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Strategy #1:</B> Selective Engagement. The United States
has  global interests. In fact, it has economic and political interests in 
practically all regions of the world. But it does not have security  interests
in all parts of the world. When it comes to employing  U.S. military power,
America has to make choices. It should choose  to engage its armed forces
primarily in ways that affect the  global balance of power. The main purpose of
American military  power should be to establish a balance of power favorable to 
American and Western interests in key regions of the world  Europe,  Asia, and
the Persian Gulf. According to this strategy, the U.S.  would bear the principal
responsibility for the collective defense of  these regions, while U.S. allies
in the regions affected would  become responsible primarily for collective
security, peacekeeping,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  settling lesser conflicts that
are essentially regional in nature.  It must be emphasized that selective
engagement is a military  strategy, not a national strategy encompassing all
aspects  (economic, political, and diplomatic) of U.S. policy. Moreover,
selective  engagement implies that America needs a military force capable  of
handling core missions in different regions of the world.  These forces should
not be customized for specific regions when  undertaking peacekeeping and other
missions short of war.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #2:</B> Dissuasion. The U.S. armed forces should be  strong
enough to dissuade other nations from attempting to threaten  the U.S., its
interests, and its allies. By forcing them to recognize  the futility of
aggression, such power even may discourage  potential enemy nations from
substantially arming themselves. To have  the desired deterrent effect, this
power must be global in reach  and capable, when necessary, of achieving
decisive military  victory over most potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #3:</B> Strategic Defense. With many potentially  unstable
regimes acquiring both nuclear weapons and long-range  ballistic missile
delivery systems, anti-ballistic missile defenses are  absolutely essential to
defense of the U.S. homeland.  Threatening nuclear retaliation to deter an
attack using these weapons may  fail with any one of these regimes. The ability
to knock out single  or multiple missile launches could save tens of millions of
 American lives and spare the country unimaginable devastation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #4:</B> Force Projection. With many potential trouble  spots
around the globe, U.S. forces need to be redesigned so they can  be deployed
quickly around the globe. With U.S. bases  overseas shrinking in number, America
increasingly will have to be able  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  project force overseas from its
own territory. Thus, the U.S.  needs a strong navy, flexible expeditionary
forces, and an army  capable of decisively defeating a large and modern force on
the battlefield.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to reflecting these four fundamental strategies, a  sound and
credible U.S. defense policy must:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Acknowledge that the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up  Review
force is not adequate to fight and win two medium-size  regional conflicts
simultaneously,</B> but should be postured to  fight and win simultaneously one
major regional conflict and  one smaller contingency. If the Administration's
objective is to  win two major regional conflicts simultaneously, it must
provide  a larger force  and the budget and other resources to sustain  that
force.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Budget approximately $285 billion per year</B> (with annual 
adjustments as needed for inflation) for defense from FY 1997  through FY 2001.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Devote adequate funds to research and development</B> so  that
tomorrow's force will have the advanced weaponry needed to  win with as few
casualties as possible. The research and  development account should be
increased to $38 billion (1995 dollars) by  the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Increase military pay to keep pace with inflation.</B> This will 
ensure that high-quality personnel continue to serve in the  all-volunteer
military.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain spending for operations, maintenance, and training</B> 
at 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  1995 levels, adjusted for
inflation. This funding is essential to  keep the U.S. armed forces fully
trained and combat ready.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restore adequate funds to crippled ballistic missile defense 
programs.</B> In FY 1997 the Pentagon should spend about $1.2  billion more on
missile defenses than the $3 billion the Clinton  Administration is likely to
request. Thus, the total, which includes funds  for the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization (BMDO) and a  few select programs under the Air Force
budget, should be about  $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion in FY 1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Develop a cheaper but more effective approach to missile  defense.</B>
Sea-based and space-based systems, rather than relatively  ineffective and
costly ground-based ones, would fill the bill. The  best architecture would be
one based on accelerating the Navy's  &quot;Upper Tier&quot; missile defense
system and then moving to deploy  a combination of space-based interceptors and
space-based  lasers early in the next decade.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Keep an eye on the future.</B> The computer chip and 
microelectronics revolutions are bringing about a corresponding revolution  in
military affairs. As its forces shrink, the U.S. must maintain  the most
technologically advanced military in the world, paying  close attention to new
operational concepts made possible by new  technologies  in particular,
information warfare capabilities,  improvements in surveillance and
precision-strike weapons, and  advanced &quot;situational awareness&quot; of
battlefield commanders.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Don't we spend enough on defense?  The Cold War is  over; 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  why can't we get by with
dramatically smaller military forces?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> American forces already are smaller than during the Cold  War,
and they continue to shrink in size. The Pentagon has cut  more than one million
personnel during the drawdown after the end  of the Cold War. But though the
Cold War threat has ended,  the world is entering an era of new threats and
conflicts, some  of which are very dangerous. America's security and prosperity 
still depend upon a military large enough and capable enough to  defend vital
U.S. interests around the globe. For that force to remain  sufficiently combat
ready and technologically advanced to deter or  defeat future threats, the
nation must invest in adequate resources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Critics of missile defense say that no rogue state can threaten  us
with missiles today. Why do you insist on hyping the threat  from ballistic
missiles?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Ballistic missile technology is now 50 years old and is  no
longer high technology. More countries are acquiring ballistic  missiles and
missile technology and using these destructive  weapons once they obtain them.
Ballistic missiles have been used in the  war in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq War,
the civil war in Yemen, and  the Persian Gulf War. In the Gulf War, more
Americans (28)  died from missile attack than from any other enemy action when 
an Iraqi Scud fell on a U.S. barracks in Dharan. Inevitably,  these rogue states
will acquire missiles with greater ranges and  increased accuracy. Fielding
comprehensive defenses against the  emerging missile threat will take some 10
years; if the U.S. waits until  rogue states actually deploy missiles with
ranges sufficient to reach  U.S. territory, it will be too late. Finally, U.S.
territory is at risk  today because of intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs) and  subma
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  rine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBMs) deployed by China  and Russia. At a minimum, the U.S. should deploy
defenses to  address the possibility of unauthorized or accidental missile
launches  by these two countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Some critics say there is no readiness crisis in the military.  Is
there a crisis in readiness or not? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence J. Korb,  a
scholar at the Brookings Institution, argues that there is no  readiness crisis.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#9">9</A>  However, two separate reports
based on the  evidence from field units themselves paint a dramatically
different  picture. Senator John McCain's <I>Going Hollow: The Warnings of the 
Chiefs of Staff</I> and Representative Floyd Spence's 
<I>Military Readiness: The View from the Field</I> document how funding
shortfalls  have forced understrength first-line combat units to cancel
training,  curtail missions, and cease flying in preparation for eventual 
military missions. At the same time, Clinton has sent the military on 
humanitarian missions to Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and  elsewhere at the
expense of combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be done about the inability of the Bottom-Up  Review
Force to fight and win two simultaneous major conflicts?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Create a &quot;one-and-a-half-war&quot; fighting force. The size
of  the U.S. forces needed depends on the magnitude of the  commitments made to
meet possible threats. It is unlikely that the U.S. will  face more than one
large-scale regional conflict similar to the  Persian Gulf War at any one time
over the next five years.  Conceivably, however, the nation may have to deal
with one small-scale  regional conflict roughly the size of the 1989 Panama
operation  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  currently with a large-scale
conflict. The U.S. should maintain  a one-and-a-half-war force capable of
engaging in such  conflicts simultaneously.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#10">10</A>  While this strategy accepts a
higher level of  risk than the Clinton Administration's &quot;two war&quot;
strategy,  the Administration's defense budget puts the nation in a  position
where it will have barely enough forces to fight one major  regional conflict by
itself. The important thing is to stop the  demobilization process now. If the
nation later finds it necessary, it should  re-examine the two-war strategy and
increase the defense budget  accordingly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How many and what kinds of conventional forces and  equipment does
the nation need?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. needs a Navy of about 400 ships, with 12 active 
aircraft carriers. The Marine Corps should retain three Marine  Expeditionary
Forces (MEFs), which would require 177,000  active-duty Marines; the Marine
Corps Reserve should number 42,000.  The Navy and Marine Corps Reserve,
therefore, should be reduced  by a smaller proportion than the other services.
Also needed are  fast sealift ships and new heavy airlifters, like the C-17, to
replace  the nation's rapidly aging airlift fleet and maintain the ability to 
get heavy forces into a theater of conflict in a hurry. Finally,  adequate
pre-positioned stocks of heavy equipment, either ashore near  likely trouble
spots or on maritime pre-positioned ships, are essential  to sustain a conflict
for more than a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't building strategic defenses kill arms control?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should carry out the strategic nuclear weapons 
reductions agreed upon with Moscow. This would lessen the  Russian 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  nuclear threat while leaving the
U.S. with the forces it needs  both to protect itself should a political
reversal take place in  Moscow and to deter such lesser nuclear powers as China.
At the  same time, however, a policy of nuclear deterrence will be inadequate 
in a world where many nations possess both weapons of mass  destruction and
long-range delivery systems. With many  potentially unstable, even irrational,
regimes capable of delivering  nuclear weapons, strategic anti-missile defenses
are more essential  than ever. The Cold War policy of deliberate vulnerability
to  missile attack is unthinkable in this new international climate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Building missile defenses will not kill arms control.  Ronald Reagan signed
numerous arms reduction deals with the  Soviets while pursuing the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). It would  be no different in the future. The Russians'
bluster against U.S.  strategic defense comes simply from their desire to keep
America  vulnerable to their strategic missiles, in which they have made such  a
huge investment, and which constitute their one surviving  qualification as a
global power. The U.S. should offer to discuss a  transition from an
offense-only posture to missile defenses by  both sides, but Russia should not
be permitted a veto over the  deployment of U.S. missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be done about the ABM Treaty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should terminate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic  Missile (ABM)
Treaty. The treaty effectively bars the deployment of  effective,
non-threatening defenses. A new multilateral  agreement with all relevant
parties to provide for the mutual deployment  of such defenses should be
pursued.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#11">11</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the U.S. military be reorganized to deal mainly  with
peacekeeping operations and not large wars, which are things  of the past?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. military exists for one principal reason: to fight  and
win America's wars. Under no circumstances can it fail in  that most profound
task. Given the many American security  commitments around the globe, the U.S.
military must train  continuously and arduously towards this goal. During the
Cold War, the  U.S. military concentrated almost exclusively on decisive 
battlefield engagements against the forces of the Soviet Union and the  Warsaw
Pact. It was this training and focus that gave America the  military prowess to
defeat Iraq so completely in the Persian Gulf  War. Such a commitment to winning
in combat must not be  squandered through continuous commitment to peacekeeping
operations or  a restructuring of vital combat units for such missions. The 
deployments to Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia already have greatly  reduced the
combat capabilities of the military. Any further dilution of  this fundamental
mission stands to put the U.S. military in a  position similar to the one it
faced in Korea in 1950. At that time,  American occupation forces were untrained
for combat and nearly  wiped out by the North Korean invasion. America cannot
afford to  lose on the battlefield, and history conclusively proves that 
concentrating on military missions other than war increases the possibility  of
such a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> Q. When should the U.S. support or participate in U.N.  peacekeeping
operations?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Only when it serves U.S. national interests. There are  many
humanitarian crises in the world, but neither the U.S. nor the  U.N. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  has the resources to deal with
every one. When America does  participate, U.S. troops must remain under U.S. or
allied, rather  than U.N., command. A peacekeeping mission must have clear 
command and control arrangements, adequate force, appropriate  criteria for
success, a definite endpoint, and a plan for  disengagement once success is
achieved. As a rule, U.S. military forces  should engage in allied combat
operations when their employment is  decisive, unique, and make the difference
between success and failure.

<P>

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES2">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. military exists for one principal reason: to fight and  win the
nation's wars. But an effective military force depends on  more than weapons,
equipment, and adequate defense budgets.  Such intangible human factors as
leadership, esprit de corps,  morale, mutual trust, and unit cohesion are as
vital to an effective  combat force as the material factors. These intangible
elements make  up the &quot;warrior ethos&quot; that is needed if U.S. armed
forces are to  win America's wars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This ethos is under siege. The Clinton Administration has tried  to put
homosexuals in the military and women in combat  positions. This agenda of
political correctness will undermine the  combat effectiveness of U.S. forces if
allowed to continue unchecked. It  is eroding morale and corroding the mutual
trust that must exist in  an effective fighting organization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of this agenda is to re-create the military services in  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  fashionable, liberal image.
Liberal social activists who exercise  an inordinate influence on the Clinton
Administration view the  military as a federally sponsored vehicle for social 
experimentation. Because they see it as the last bastion of &quot;male
domination,&quot;  liberals want to de-masculinize the military regardless of
the effect  on its capacity to do its only job, which is to fight and win 
America's wars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because the military is a command hierarchy, liberal social  activists
believe they can impose their agenda from the top down.  Most service members
oppose social engineering of this kind  because they know it saps the fighting
power of the services, and thus  exposes them to greater danger. But they are
intimidated from  speaking out, and often find their careers in jeopardy if they
do not  embrace the &quot;diversity&quot; agenda imposed on them from above.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS2">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Colin
Powell,  all serving Chiefs of Staff, and most former members of the  Joint
Chiefs have stated unequivocally that acknowledged  homosexuals in the
military's ranks are harmful to the good order and  discipline of the services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      Women currently make up approximately 12 percent of the  U.S.
armed forces, more than any other nation's military. While  women do not serve
in so-called direct combat positions in the  infantry, armored, or field
artillery units, many are being assigned to  combat support units, combatant
ships, and pilot billets which put  them in harm's way. These assignments
inevitably would put women  in combat during a war.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     During the Persian Gulf War, American women soldiers  were
taken prisoner for the first time in U.S. history. These women  were sexually
abused by Iraqi captors. The possibility that women  prisoners will be raped and
tortured, or that large numbers of  women will be killed and wounded in action,
could have a  dramatically negative effect on American public opinion and on the
 nation's ability to prosecute a war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     No other nation places women in combat posts, not even 
Israel, despite a common misconception to the contrary and even  though Israel
has a manpower shortage. Israel used women in combat  for a short time during
its war of independence and made it  policy never to do so again except in the
most dire national  emergencies. In the Israel Defense Force, women do receive
basic combat  training and may be attached to combat units in support roles, but
 they do not take part in combat operations. (Recently, the Israeli  Supreme
Court directed the Israeli armed forces to permit a  woman to train as a combat
pilot; she has since dropped out of flight  training.) Other nations, such as
Denmark, allow women to serve  in combat units but also note that they are not
likely to see combat.  In any event, Denmark concedes that its policy was
undertaken  to satisfy contemporary social mores and could hurt unit  cohesion
and combat readiness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Introducing women into all combat specialties means creating 
two different standards in order to account for the physiological  differences
between women and men. A combat unit's effectiveness  is predicated on unit
cohesion, which is based in turn on the bonds  of trust among soldiers in a
unit. Training to two different  standards is the surest way to wreck unit
morale, raising problems of  favorit
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  ism and of training that does not
meet the standard required by  the mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Putting women in combat units degrades combat readiness.  For instance,
pregnant women are not able to deploy on military  missions with their units,
causing further problems of morale,  unit cohesion, and readiness. The aircraft
carrier USS Eisenhower  is the first U.S. naval ship to try to integrate men and
women. In  the first six months of a recent deployment, 14 women on  the
Eisenhower became pregnant while on cruise, and were freed  from their duties.
The message sent to sailors is that there are  different standards for men and
women, standards that are based not on  the capability of the individual to help
the team win in combat, but  on one's sex.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD2">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has instituted policies that would put women  in combat
and homosexuals in the military. Because the  President comes from an
aggressively anti-military background, these  decisions as Commander in Chief
have been resisted by the  American military establishment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, on April 28, 1993, the Clinton Administration  announced that
the Department of Defense would open certain  combat aviation positions to
women. This change in policy affected  all three services and made women
available for duty in all  aviation units, including air cavalry units in the
Army. Women  currently are barred only from direct participation in infantry,
armor,  and some artillery units.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, early in his Administration, the President revoked  the
long-standing military ban on homosexuals, establishing instead  a fuzzy &quot;don't
ask, don't tell&quot; policy that simply prohibits open  displays of
homosexuality. This policy is a poor compromise  between the President and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, who were  concerned about the adverse impact of lifting
the ban. It makes it  technically legal for homosexuals to serve in the armed
forces, but also  allows them to be discharged for openly displaying homosexual 
behavior. As might be expected from such an ambiguous compromise,  the policy
has been challenged in several court cases but with  unclear results, being
upheld in some decisions and struck down in  others. Congress has hidden behind
the compromise language, refusing  to hold hearings or conduct proper oversight
of Defense  Department regulations implementing the law prohibiting open 
homosexuals from serving, as passed in the FY 1995 Defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> President Clinton also objected to provisions in the 1996  Defense
authorization bill that allow the military to  discharge servicemembers
diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes  AIDS. This ban was imposed because
HIV-positive  servicemembers could infect other members in combat operations.
This is in  keeping with existing military policy that prevents the deployment 
of servicemembers with other contagious or debilitating  diseases. President
Clinton maintains that this discriminates against  HIV-positive personnel; the
Department of Defense maintains that  because HIV-positive servicemembers cannot
serve on  deployments, they should not continue to serve while others must
deploy in  their place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To ensure that the U.S. military continues to do its job of  fighting and
winning America's wars, the Administration and  Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Return to the Chiefs of Staff the power to determine social 
policies based on the requirement to fight and win in combat.</B> The  service
Chiefs are charged by law to provide the best military advice to  the President
and Secretary of Defense, and the best command  guidance to their respective
services. They have a heavy  responsibility and must be allowed to put the
nation's defense needs and  the combat capabilities of the services ahead of the
political  pressures or passing social agendas of the moment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Eliminate the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the  Service.</B>
This committee was set up after the Korean War to advise  the Chiefs of Staff on
women's issues in the service. Over the  years, however, it has become a vehicle
for promoting the  legislative agendas of militant homosexual lobbies, feminist 
organizations, and other liberal pressure groups. In addition, similar 
organizations in the services should be focused on the challenge of  maintaining
equality and professionalism in the military while promoting  the warrior ethos
and military ethic among all members of the  service. They should not advance
the radical agendas of groups who  view the military as &quot;just another job&quot;
and believe it needs to be  restructured so its values and ethics are in line
with those of  contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Ensure that the military oversight committees of Congress  protect
the careers of loyal service officers who properly advise  against the social
engineering agenda.</B> For instance, congressional  oversight  which includes
final approval of military promotion lists   
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  must ensure that exemplary
officers like Commander  Robert Stumpf, U.S. Navy, are not ridden out of the
service as the  result of a political correctness witch hunt. Commander Stumpf,
a  Naval aviator and former commander of the Navy's precision  combat flying
team, was denied promotion because he attended the  notorious Tailhook
convention in 1991. Even though a Navy  investigation completely exonerated him
of any connection with the  events of Tailhook, Commander Stumpf was denied
promotion by a  Senate Armed Services Committee policy that the Navy notify  the
committee of all officers who attended the Tailhook  convention. Such egregious
bows to political correctness are nonsensical,  unjust, and damaging to morale.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Abandon the confusing &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy 
regarding homosexuals in the military.</B> This policy is a clear example of  a
President who wants to have his cake and eat it too. As a result,  the policy is
under legal challenge in two different courts and  most likely will need to be
settled by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A2">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the services ban women from combat and  homosexuals from
military service?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Advocates of women in combat and homosexuals in the  military
view military service as similar to any other job and  assume that gender or
sexual orientation are insignificant in the  military environment. They are
wrong. Combat is a team endeavor and  the most demanding environment 
physically, mentally, and  morally  that one can endure. It is not a &quot;job&quot;
but a life-and-death  under
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  taking. The primary criterion for
inclusion must be the ability  of the individual to enhance  not to detract from
 the  effectiveness of the unit. A military organization functions best when 
differences among individuals in a unit are minimized. That is why  soldiers are
required to look, act, dress, and train alike. It makes  no sense to break down
all of these differences only to inject  the greatest difference of all 
individual sexual identity  into a unit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Professional military judgment and experience indicate that  mixing known
homosexuals with heterosexuals undermines  cohesion and combat effectiveness.
Common sense suggests that men  and women distract each other even when trying
not to do so. In  combat, such distractions can be the difference between life
and  death. The purpose of the military is to build the most effective  fighting
force to defeat an enemy as quickly, and with as few  American casualties, as
possible. Differences in sexual identity will  weaken discipline and
effectiveness, thus making it more difficult to  prevail in combat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Access to the military has never been based on what is &quot;fair.&quot;  
Military service is a privilege and sometimes a duty, but never  a right.
Because victories in combat are achieved by cohesive  units, the armed forces
routinely sacrifice individual interests to  ensure unit cohesion. Military
service is legally restricted or denied  to patriotic Americans who are too
tall, too short, too fat,  color-blind, flat-footed, or mentally or physically
handicapped. This is no  reflection on the inherent worth of these individuals;
they simply  do not meet the military's needs.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#12">12</A>  For the same reason,  women
should be barred from combat and known homosexuals should  be excluded entirely
from military service.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Before the military was desegregated in 1948, many of  the same
arguments used today to oppose gays in the military  were used to oppose blacks
in the service. Can't America's GIs learn  to live and work with homosexuals in
the same way they learned  to live and work with black Americans?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As General Powell  himself a black man  has explained,  being
black is a benign condition, a matter of birth. On the  other hand, homosexual
activity is not. It is a gross fallacy to equate  the two. Moreover, black
Americans have proven themselves on  the field of battle and in every other
military function. They  have made remarkable contributions to the military and
to the  nation's security, and are recognized universally among the best 
soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen in the world. On the other hand,  the
open acceptance of homosexuality in the ranks almost  always causes problems of
morale and discipline.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If a woman can perform the same job as a man, why  can't women hold
combat jobs?  To limit women to support roles  also limits their career
opportunities for advancement in the military.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The fundamental purpose of military service is to  defend
America, not to advance careers. There can be only one  standard for a warrior,
and that is determined by what it takes to fight  and win in combat. The great
majority of women in the military,  and even some men, cannot meet the physical
standards required  for service in combat units. Having different standards for
men  and women would ruin morale and unit cohesion. Putting women  in combat
also would raise a host of thorny questions, among  them: How will the
inevitable formation of male-female special  relationships affect discipline and
unit cohesion, which are essential  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  success in combat?  How can a
woman's privacy be respected  adequately in combat conditions?  What would be
the effect  on troops and the impact on public support for a combat mission if 
a number of females were taken prisoner and abused by their  captors or
exploited for psychological warfare or propaganda advantage?   How would
official and legal efforts to prevent sexual  harassment of women prevent the
rise of double standards and the  inevitable breakdown of morale and unit
cohesion?

<h2>Japan's Parole Models</h2><br>
by <b>Leslie Gardner</b>
</center><p>
	To bring America's crime explosion under control, new prisons and longer sentences will not 
be enough. Most criminals are eventually released, and most return to a life of crime. In addition 
to tougher law enforcement, we need to find ways to turn former criminals into law-abiding 
citizens. Perhaps here, Americans can learn from the success of volunteer probation and parole 
officers in Japan.
<P>
	America's current system of probation and parole is a joke. On average, each of the nation's 
35,000 probation and parole officers must supervise 100 convicts. With so many charges, the 
typical officer is lucky if he can find his parolees or probationers, let alone monitor their 
movements. "Most state probation and parole systems have a serious problem with case 
overload," says Steve Varnum, the executive director of Justice Fellowship at Prison Fellowship 
Ministries. "This leads to a high percentage of parole and probation violations, with many 
offenders returning to prison." 
<p>
	Japan, by contrast, has fewer than 1,000 full-time professional probation and parole officers. 
These officers are recruited and trained as professionals in counseling, but with an average of 
100,000 new qualifying convicts each year, they are too few to counsel clients individually. 
Their real work is to assign cases to approximately 48,000 volunteer parole officers throughout 
the country.

<p>	Each volunteer on average supervises only two convicts, and his primary responsibility is 
to help them rejoin their families and neighborhoods as well as to monitor their movements. 
These volunteers-cum-social workers are clearly getting the job done: Fewer than 4 percent of 
Japanese criminals who have been assigned to a volunteer officer will commit another crime 
within a year of their release on parole or probation.
<P>
	What is the Japanese secret in dealing so effectively with criminal offenders? Part of the 
answer is the selection process for parole and probation. To qualify for probation or parole in 
Japan, an offender must show remorse  for his crime and meet certain criteria that prevent the 
release of serious or habitual criminals.
<p>
	In Japan, acceptance by one's family is often the most important factor in an offender's 
rehabilitation, for the concept of shame is still alive and well in this society. A volunteer officer 
visits the offender's home to help his family overcome the shame of having a relative convicted 
of a crime. If family reunification is deemed impossible, the volunteer finds the offender a place 
at a halfway house or with friends.

<p>
	The next step is to help the offender find stable employment, so he may again become a 
functional member of his community. This is also considered essential to rehabilitation, as the 
importance of societal acceptance is second only to that of acceptance by one's family. After a 
residence and a job have been secured, the volunteer officer continues to meet with his charge 
once or twice a month to provide counsel and to monitor his progress.
<p>
	An appointment as a volunteer probation or parole officer requires no special  training or 
background; candidates must simply be respected and financially stable. Volunteers come from a 
range of occupations, but more than half are fishermen or farmers, religious leaders, housewives, 
and retired people. Ninety percent of the volunteers are at least 50 years old and 80 percent are 
men.
<p>
	Once appointed by the Ministry of Justice, a volunteer's term of service is two years, but most 
are reappointed several times. Almost half serve at least 10 years.
<p>
	Japan formally authorized its system of suspended prosecution in 1924, and codified the 
network of volunteers upon which it depended in 1950. Research conducted by Japan's Ministry 
of Justice shows that the success of volunteer probation officers lies in the individual attention 
they are able to give each offender; they are often seen as friends or mentors rather than authority 
figures. Many convicts, moved by the fact that someone has taken an interest in their well-being, 
feel an obligation to work toward rehabilitation.
<p>
	Could such a system work in the United States? America would need more than 1.75 million 
volunteers to achieve the same 2:1 ratio as Japan. Still, small caseload ratios are key to the 
successful supervision of offenders. "Most criminal activity is preceded by a progression of 
inappropriate behaviors," Varnum says. "If an agent spends time with an offender and sees the 
environment the offender lives in, it will be much easier for the agent to recognize the 
inappropriate behaviors that may lead to the offender's participation in further criminal activity. 
The Japanese parole model serves that purpose of real time supervision."
<p>
	It's true that Japanese society, particularly the role of the family, is quite different. Sharing in 
the public control of behavior, of course, is not unique to Japan. Many U.S. cities have volunteer 
organizations whose members patrol their communities or teach conflict resolution and job skills. 
Churches and mosques have begun to welcome and find employment for former criminals. It's 
time to go further, and experiment with the Japanese volunteer model.

<title>Tougher U.S. Action Needed to Punish Saddam Hussein - Heritage</title>

<h3>TOUGHER U.S. ACTION NEEDED TO PUNISH SADDAM HUSSEIN</h3>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's cruise missile strikes against Iraq this week in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's military offensive against the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq are too little too late. The U.S. needs to take firm, consistent, and systematic action if it is to rebuff Saddam's latest aggression, undermine his brutal regime, and undercut his ability to threaten his neighbors and repress his own people. In responding to the immediate crisis, the U.S. needs to keep sight of its long-term goals -- forcing Saddam's downfall and diminishing Iraq's threats to regional stability and the flow of oil.
<p>

<b>WHAT IS AT STAKE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam's invasion of the Kurdish enclave is not just a blow aimed at Kurdish and other Iraqi opposition forces; it is a clear test of the U.S.-led coalition's determination to contain Iraq. Saddam knows that the Kurdish cause is unpopular in Turkey, which is fighting its own Kurdish separatists, and among America's Arab allies, who wish to preserve Iraq as a counterweight to Iran. Saddam hopes to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other members of the anti-Iraq coalition by portraying his aggression as a defensive move against Iranian-supported Kurdish separatists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Iraq's latest provocation also is an inevitable consequence of an aggressive dictator's perception of U.S. weakness. For three-and-a-half years, the Clinton Administration has conveyed an image of weakness and indecision in defense and foreign policy, particularly regarding Iraq. Clinton came into office severely underestimating the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. One week before his inauguration, Clinton offered Saddam the chance to let bygones be bygones in a <i>New York Times</i> interview: "I'm a Baptist; I believe in deathbed conversions."  Clinton proclaimed that he was "not obsessed with Iraq," as if bilateral tensions were a product of George Bush's personal pique toward Saddam. The Clinton Administration softened U.S. policy toward Iraq and dropped the Bush Administration's insistence that Saddam be ousted before the U.S. would agree to lift the United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Iraq launched a failed attempt to assassinate former President Bush in Kuwait in April 1993, the Administration equivocated before launching cruise missile attacks against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's foreign intelligence agency on June 27, 1993. This attack was a mere slap on the wrist for such a brazen terrorist plot against a former American President. The limited size and symbolic nature of the U.S. reprisal -- 24 cruise  missiles fired at an empty building in the middle of the night -- probably did little to strengthen U.S. deterrence against Saddam's aggression.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More recently, the Clinton Administration has failed to respond to other Iraqi provocations. Since April, Baghdad repeatedly has blocked the efforts of U.N. arms inspectors to monitor compliance with Iraq's obligations to dismantle its nuclear, chemical, biological, and long-range missile programs. Yet the Administration has done little except to pass the problem off to a listless U.N. Security Council. In May, Iraqi opposition leaders reportedly warned U.S. officials that the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan was deteriorating and required urgent American attention. But the Administration was asleep at the switch and failed to resolve diplomatically the growing tensions between Kurdish factions that erupted in open warfare last month. One faction, the Kurdish Democratic Party, then went so far as to ally itself with Saddam, who has ordered the deaths of thousands of Kurds, in despair over its failure to receive significant material or diplomatic support from Washington.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam has probed aggressively for U.S. weakness, again and again. What is at stake in the current crisis is not just the future of Iraq's Kurds, but the ability of the U.S. and its allies to deter future Iraqi aggression.
<p>
<b>THE U.S. RESPONSE: WHAT NEXT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration has responded correctly with military force, the only language Saddam Hussein seems to understand. But the limited cruise missile strikes launched so far make sense only as the opening phase of a robust and systematic air campaign to punish Saddam's aggression, weaken his military threat to his neighbors, and deter future Iraqi aggression. Incremental pinprick reprisals are unlikely to make Saddam blink. Such attacks more likely will encourage him to escalate the crisis even further.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To drive home to Saddam the heavy price that he must pay for aggression, the Clinton Administration should hit the Iraqi dictator where he will feel it most. The U.S. should launch cruise missile and air strikes against the security forces that prop up Saddam's dictatorship -- the Republican Guard and secret police -- as well as against Iraq's military assets and military industries. The U.S. goal should be to punish Saddam and his closest supporters while undermining his ability to maintain himself in power, repress the opposition, and threaten Iraq's neighbors. The Administration also should seize the opportunity to destroy suspected Iraqi weapons manufacturing and storage facilities that were barred to U.N. arms inspectors. This will make the Iraqis think twice before illegally interfering with such inspections in the future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Administration's decision to expand the southern "no fly" zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd is wise because it tightens the constraints on Iraq's air force and diminishes Iraq's military threat to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, it drives home to Saddam and the Iraqi military that the U.S. has the will to impose significant costs for aggression on a broad range of fronts, including imposing humiliating restrictions on Iraq's military operations. This will increase the incentives for a military coup against Saddam by disgruntled army officers concerned with rebuilding Iraq's military strength, especially if U.S. air attacks weaken the Republican Guard, which is an elite military force that is loyal to Saddam.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington must insist on the immediate and total withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the Kurdish areas. But the U.S. should not focus exclusively on compelling an Iraqi withdrawal. Saddam could pull back his troops a few miles and still use his feared secret police to maintain control of the areas he has occupied. He also could easily move his troops back into the area in the future. Moreover, focusing primarily on the Kurdish issue will only help Saddam split the already weakened anti-Iraq coalition. The issue for the U.S. is not so much protecting the Kurds from Iraqi aggression as diminishing Saddam's ability to engage in <i>any</i> act of military aggression with impunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Saddam continues his aggression in Kurdistan or engages in new provocations elsewhere, the Clinton Administration should mount a methodical and sustained air campaign against military, military industry, and secret police targets throughout Iraq as long as Saddam's troops remain in the Kurdish enclave. The Administration also should mount a high-priority diplomatic offensive to end the factional fighting between the rival Kurdish groups. But the U.S. should avoid basing its policy exclusively on the narrow issues of protecting the Kurds or enforcing U.N. resolutions. This would only play into Saddam's hands by allowing him to retain the initiative. U.S. policy should be focused on punishing Saddam, deterring future aggression, and destroying his ability to threaten more important U.S. interests in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Israel long has sought a comprehensive peace with its Arab neighbors, and has made great progress since the landmark 1991 peace conference in Madrid. It signed a peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993 and concluded a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. But negotiations with Syria have proceeded at a glacial pace. One of the major obstacles in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations has been Syrian insistence on recovering the strategic Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, without ironclad security guarantees that Syria would not use the Golan as a staging area for aggression against Israel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has tried to bridge the negotiating gap by offering U.S. peacekeeping forces to monitor compliance with any agreement, but it has resisted congressional calls to examine the wisdom of such a commitment, claiming that a public debate would be premature. Administration officials contend that the details of a peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights have not been worked out and a final commitment has not been made. However, Defense Secretary William Perry, after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on January 8, confirmed the Clinton Administration's long-standing offer to provide U.S. peacekeeping forces to monitor the Golan Heights. Although Perry had said last September that the U.S. "should be willing" to contribute forces that would facilitate a peace accord, he recently firmed up the U.S. offer by proclaiming, "we are prepared to do that."<sup>1 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Congress Should Hold Hearings.</b> Now that Secretary Perry has explicitly made this offer, Congress should hold hearings to examine the potential costs and benefits of this commitment. It also should press the Administration to reconsider its risky plans to enter such an open-ended peacekeeping operation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Administration has resisted congressional scrutiny of the Golan peacekeeping question, arguing that it could complicate efforts to negotiate a peace agreement. While this may be true, the Administration would be wise to gauge congressional support for a possible Golan peacekeeping operation now, rather than risk having an agreement unravel later due to congressional disapproval.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has its own reasons for debating a Golan peacekeeping commitment sooner rather than later, as underscored by the recent experience in Bosnia. The rapid pace of developments in the Bosnian peace negotiations greatly limited congressional debate, with U.S. troops being deployed to Bosnia only 11 days after the November 21, 1995, signing of the Dayton peace accords. While the pace of Syrian-Israeli negotiations is likely to be slower, Congress must address the Golan peacekeeping issue before, not after, the Israelis and Syrians negotiate a deal if it wants to avoid being presented with another diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i> by the Clinton Administration.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Israel is a sovereign state, and it is Israel's prerogative to negotiate whatever diplomatic arrangements it finds necessary to assure its security and promote peace. Washington should actively support efforts to build a just and lasting Arab-Israeli peace.<sup>2</sup>  But when America is asked to ensure the implementation of an agreement which entails obvious risks to American peacekeepers, the U.S. Congress has a right and duty to examine the risks and benefits of such a commitment, as it would do with any other peacekeeping commitment.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Congress examines the Golan Heights peacekeeping issue, it should bear in mind that American troops should not be involved in such a mission. There are five reasons for this conclusion.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #1:</b>  The Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping challenge than the existing U.S. peacekeeping mission on the Sinai Peninsula. Unlike the American troops assigned to the multinational peacekeeping force on the Egyptian-Israeli border in the Sinai since 1982, peacekeeping forces in the Golan will be sandwiched between two large armored forces in a much smaller area. Moreover, Syria historically has been much more hostile to the U.S. than has Egypt, which is now a U.S. ally. Thus, a Golan peacekeeping operation would be much riskier.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #2:</b>  Terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops. U.S. peacekeeping forces in the Golan will be close to southern Lebanon, which is a major staging area for numerous terrorist groups that oppose Arab-Israeli peace.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #3:</b>  It could adversely affect U.S.-Israel relations. An American presence on the Golan will constrain Israel's military options more than Syria's and will sap Israel's self-reliance. In the long run, this could strain U.S.-Israel relations.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #4:</b>  It could be too costly and too much of a drain on U.S. forces. A small force will be unable to defend itself against possible terrorist or Syrian military attacks, while a large force will be a major drain on active U.S. Army forces.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #5:</b>  Americans are not needed. Other countries can play the same peacekeeping role. The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, comprised of troops from Austria, Canada, Finland, and Poland, has been deployed on the Golan for almost 22 years to monitor the 1974 Syrian-Israeli Disengagement Agreement.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under no circumstances should the U.S. promise foreign aid to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement. The prospective recovery of the Golan Heights and peace itself are Syria's peace dividends. Moreover, the U.S. should remember that it has important national interests to advance regarding Syria that go beyond brokering a Syrian-Israeli peace agreement. Congress must prevent the Administration's preoccupation with the peace process from obscuring American interests in halting Syrian support of terrorism, promoting Lebanon's independence from Syrian domination, ending Syrian subversion of Turkey, halting drug smuggling in Syrian-controlled Lebanon, and isolating Syria's ally Iran.
<p>

<b>THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE GOLAN HEIGHTS</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Golan Heights comprise some of the most strategically significant terrain in the world. Occupying its high forward slopes gives Israel line-of-sight surveillance of Syrian military movements and electronic communications. Electronic intelligence-gathering facilities in the Golan provide early warning of threatening developments in the plains southwest of the Syrian capital of Damascus, or in south Lebanon. Control of the Golan also provides Israel, a small country, with something it badly needs:  a buffer zone to give it strategic depth. Before losing the Heights in 1967, Syria used its commanding position on the Golan to bombard the Israeli settlements in the nearby Galilee region. Highly lucrative agricultural and tourist sites around the shores of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) now are safe. Finally, the Golan highlands form a watershed that supplies approximately 30 percent of Israel's water. Dominating the Golan watershed means potential control of this vital freshwater resource. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For these strategic reasons, most past Israeli governments, whether led by the Labor or Likud parties, have not been willing to withdraw from the Golan, which the Israel Defense Force (IDF) captured in a bold and courageous operation in 1967. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin began direct negotiations with Syria under American auspices after his June 1992 election, but declined to specify how far Israel would withdraw on the Golan until Damascus made clear what kind of peace and security arrangements it was willing to make. Syria's Hafez al-Assad broke off the talks in July 1995, insisting on the unconditional return of the Golan Heights. After Rabin's November 4 assassination, his successor, former Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, dropped Rabin's insistence that security arrangements be dealt with first.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Peres used his December 12, 1995, speech before a joint session of the U.S. Congress to appeal to Assad to resume the talks. Assad agreed and the talks were revived on December 27. Two rounds of Syrian-Israeli talks already have been held at the Wye Plantation in eastern Maryland, and a third round began on January 23. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has offered to undertake open-ended shuttle diplomacy between the two countries to bridge the still-wide gaps. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though Israel is eager to make peace and maintain the momentum generated by the diplomatic breakthrough with the Palestinians reached in Oslo in 1993, many Israelis are deeply concerned about the potential threat to their security if the IDF withdraws and the Syrian army moves back onto the Golan. The position of the Peres government is that the benefits of a deal with Syria outweigh the risks and that Israel must deal now, while the opportunity exists, and while Israel is in a position of strength. But most Israelis nevertheless believe that only extraordinary security guarantees can make the return of the Golan to Syria acceptable. 

<p>
<b>FIVE REASONS TO REJECT U.S. PEACEKEEPING IN THE GOLAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One possible guarantee is the deployment of U.S. troops on the Golan, either as part of a multinational operation or alone, and either in a pure "peacekeeping" role or as a kind of tripwire to hedge against renewed hostilities from Syria. This possibility has been a matter of speculation in Washington for over two years. The Clinton Administration has aggressively discouraged congressional consideration of the issue, maintaining that it is premature to address the issue of an American peacekeeping force on the Golan.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Secretary Perry's January 8 statement indicating that the U.S. is prepared to deploy a Golan peacekeeping force has considerably undermined this argument. Congress soon must consider the implications of a U.S. peacekeeping deployment on the Golan, or it will find itself reacting to a diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i>, as in Bosnia. While examining the Golan peacekeeping issue, Congress should bear in mind five reasons that the U.S. should reject a U.S. peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #1:</b>  The Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping challenge than the existing mission on the Sinai Peninsula. U.S. and Israeli officials often cite the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), which monitors compliance with the security arrangements in the Sinai peninsula, as a model for an American peacekeeping presence on the Golan. The MFO, created in 1982 to monitor compliance with the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, is composed of three battalions of troops from Colombia, Fiji, and the U.S. and a Civilian Observer Unit staffed with American personnel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights, however, would operate in a markedly different geographic, military, and political environment. Rather than being deployed in a vast, empty desert far from the main bodies of the opposing military forces, Golan peacekeepers would be stationed in a constricted area, sandwiched between large armored forces in positions that would quickly become important military objectives if fighting were to break out. Unlike the remote, sparsely populated Sinai, the Golan also would be a more hospitable operating theater for terrorists based in neighboring Lebanon or among civilians living in the Golan Heights. Finally, Hafez al-Assad's Syria today is a far cry from Anwar Sadat's Egypt. Not only has Syria supported terrorists that have killed Americans and provoked military clashes with the U.S. in Lebanon in 1983, but Assad is extremely unlikely to become a reliable U.S. ally in the future, unlike Sadat's Egypt.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much depends on the details of an Israel-Syrian treaty. If an agreement leads to the removal of a standing Syrian mechanized army within 40 kilometers of the Golan, then U.S. troops, as in the Sinai MFO, might play a useful role in monitoring or verifying compliance with the treaty. But if large Syrian forces remain deployed close by and a significant potential security threat remains, then a mere monitoring mission makes little sense. In essence, the U.S. force would be serving as a deterrent or tripwire to prevent Syria reverting to the use of arms.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There also are major questions about size, composition, mission, and command and control of the Golan force. An MFO-like monitoring force would be small and lightly armed. But a small, light force would have difficulty protecting itself from terror attacks emanating from Lebanon, let alone a Syrian military offensive. Therefore, a U.S. peacekeeping force in the Golan would have to be large enough to deter attacks from any source and defend itself. In other words, it must be a large combat formation, configured for possible combat, with appropriate rules of engagement. But a large force, such as an armored or mechanized infantry brigade, would be costly and a drain on the U.S. military presence in more important regions such as Europe or South Korea.<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #2:</b>  Terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops. Unlike the Sinai MFO, Golan peacekeepers would be vulnerable to significant terrorist threats. They would be stationed close to southern and eastern Lebanon, the staging area for some of the world's most dangerous terrorists, including Hezbollah, the militant pro-Iranian terrorist group responsible for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. Hezbollah and other terrorist groups operating in Lebanon have a history of attacking Americans. They will have even more reason to use terrorism to disrupt an American-brokered peace agreement that they violently oppose.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Syria itself is one of the chief exporters of international terrorism.<sup>3</sup>  Assad repeatedly has used terrorism as an adjunct of foreign policy in inter-Arab politics, in Lebanon, and against Israel. He also supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon in 1983-1984. Given his success in helping Hezbollah to drive U.S. peacekeepers out of Lebanon in 1984, Assad may try a similar strategy in the Golan if he decides to seek their removal. Even if Syria cooperates in restraining terrorism, however, Iran, Iraq, and Libya could support Lebanon-based terrorist proxies against U.S. forces in the Golan. Since U.S. troops will be a lightning rod for terrorism, particularly due to American brokering of a Syrian-Israel peace accord, a Golan peacekeeping operation should not be manned by Americans.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #3:</b>  It could adversely affect U.S.-Israel relations. A peacekeeping force is supposed to be a neutral, honest broker, but maintaining a neutral stance is likely to have a negative political, military, and psychological impact on U.S.-Israeli relations. This would be particularly true if the U.S. maintains strict neutrality with respect to Israel and Syria in the implementation of any agreement. At a minimum, sharp differences of opinion are likely to arise concerning compliance issues and the interpretation of Syrian activities along the border. Deeper strains in the bilateral relationship could occur if Israel concluded that the peacekeeping forces were turning a blind eye to Syrian violations of the peace treaty or if Washington concluded that Israel was overreacting to minor or ambiguous Syrian violations. It should be remembered that American participation in the 1982-1984 multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon led to considerable friction with Israel and at one point an American Marine officer brandished a pistol to halt the advance of an Israeli tank.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A U.S. presence on the Golan also will sap Israeli self-reliance. Because Syria adamantly rejects allowing Israel to maintain early warning facilities in the Golan as an infringement on its sovereignty, Israel is likely to become more dependent on U.S. spy satellites and aircraft. The U.S. presence also will put a brake on Israeli military operations in the event of conflict with Syria or terrorists in Lebanon. Their presence will constrain Israel's military options, possibly depriving Israel of the opportunity to launch a preemptive military strike if a Syrian attack was imminent. Ironically, the U.S. presence could prove to be more of a deterrent to Israel than to Syria.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;American forces on the Golan will be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked. They are likely to constitute only a marginal military deterrent to Syria and they will be unable to provide adequate early warning to Israel.<sup>4</sup>  The real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political -- to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the U.S. will be in no position to remedy if conflict erupts. This is dangerous because it could engender a false sense of security that could lead Israelis to take more risks in peace negotiations with Syria than they otherwise would take.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #4:</b>  It could be too costly and too much of a drain on U.S. forces. The U.S. cannot afford to commit an ever-larger proportion of its declining active duty forces to worldwide peacekeeping operations. Sending U.S. troops to Haiti and Bosnia already has depleted America's strategic reserve and could jeopardize American interests by stretching U.S. forces thin around the world. It should be remembered that the peacekeeping commitments to Haiti and Bosnia, and now possibly on the Golan as well, were made in addition to the existing military alliance commitments in Europe and Asia -- and even as the Clinton Administration is trying to cut the defense budget even further.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For a Golan peacekeeping mission to be credible, it would require the commitment of a large force consisting of at least a heavy brigade, roughly 5,000 troops. To maintain a long term deployment of this force, three brigades would have to be dedicated to the mission:  one on deployment, one recovering and retraining after returning from the mission, and one training and preparing to deploy on the mission. This is roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active duty combat strength, a prohibitively high burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission. If the U.S. is suddenly faced with conflict in other regions of the world, such as the Persian Gulf or the Korean peninsula, the forces on the Golan could be sorely needed to protect vital U.S. national interests.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to diverting troops from other, more important missions, an open-ended peacekeeping mission on the Golan will reduce the military effectiveness of troops available for other missions. Troops returning from the Golan will need many months of retraining to regain the warfighting skills that atrophied during their peacekeeping deployment.<sup>5</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American Golan peacekeeping commitment also would entail considerable financial costs, and could drain away hundreds of millions of dollars from the defense budget. Congress already has scaled back the U.S. contribution to the Sinai MFO budget, cutting it from $80 million to $74 million in fiscal year 1988. Similar budgetary pressures could undercut a Golan MFO, even if other nations contribute to the costs of the operation.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #5:</b>  Americans are not needed. If peacekeepers are needed to monitor a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty, they should not be Americans. An American peacekeeping presence would be a lightning rod for terrorism, would drain the U.S. defense budget unnecessarily, and would strain Israeli-American relations. Other countries are willing and fully able to contribute neutral peacekeeping forces. After all, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force has deployed peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland, and Poland on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to blocking an American peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights, Congress should press the Clinton Administration to:
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Rule out foreign aid to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement. To make it clear that no U.S. aid will be forthcoming to sweeten a Syrian-Israeli deal, Congress should pass a resolution opposing U.S. foreign aid to Syria. The reward for peace is peace, not billions of dollars of bribery. America's aid to Egypt, a country which did not launch terrorist attacks against Americans, came after the 1978 Camp David accords and in the context of the Cold War. Egypt switched sides and left the Soviet orbit to become a reliable American ally. Syria has no Soviet card to play. The U.S. must allocate its increasingly scarce foreign aid resources to long-term friends and not use foreign aid as a reward to Syria, a long-standing adversary. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Maintain pressure on Syria to halt its support of terrorism. Damascus supports over one dozen terrorist groups, including many Palestinian groups opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The U.S. should push Syria relentlessly to expel these Palestinians from Syrian territory and Syrian-controlled Lebanese territory, crack down on Hezbollah in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon, and cooperate with the U.S. in breaking the back of international terrorist groups. There can be no genuine peace as long as Syria maintains ties with terrorists. Congress should ensure that the war against terrorism remains a high priority of U.S. foreign policy. Therefore, Syria should not be removed from the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism unless Damascus halts its support for terrorism. Syria should not be removed from the list merely as a reward for signing a peace treaty with Israel.
<p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights is not needed. It would not significantly reduce the military risks that Israel would run in returning the Golan to Syrian control. The U.S. cannot afford an open-ended deployment of first echelon combat troops in support of what is essentially a diplomatic gambit. Nor should it seek to downplay the significant military risks attendant on returning the Golan Heights to Syria. If Israel decides to do so, that is its prerogative, but it should do so without the implied commitment represented by a U.S. tripwire on the Golan. There are many other nations that would be willing to provide peacekeeping forces, if that is necessary.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress must open debate on the Golan peacekeeping issue before it is presented with another <i>fait accompli</i> like Haiti or Bosnia. Now that Secretary of Defense Perry has confirmed that a U.S. commitment of some sort exists, it can no longer be deemed "premature" for Congress to discuss the issue.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The bottom line:  Syria gets more out of a peace agreement with Israel than does the U.S. and therefore should be willing to pay more for it. Washington should push Assad to acquiesce to America's agenda and not get bogged down in more narrow peace negotiating issues. The U.S. must not jeopardize important national interests by committing U.S. troops to seal an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement that is potentially fragile and cosmetic.

Small Business Group Documents Superfund as Highly Toxic For Entrepreneurs and Business</h2>

<blockquote>
<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  released a report today highly
critical of the federal government Superfund program.  &quot;Highly
Toxic: The Superfund Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship&quot;
was written by SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating. 
<P>
U.S. Representative Bill Zeliff (RNH), a leader in Superfund reform
efforts and Chairman of the Small Business Survival Caucus, wrote
the foreword to the report.
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; documents some of the history, the massive
costs and egregious inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which
was designed to help clean up hazardous waste sites across the
country.  Instead, according to the report, a mere 18 percent
of the worst waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/privatesector
cost of approximately $90 billion.
<P>
Keating declares: &quot;Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy
and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often unsuspecting
individual and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most,
state problems into national woes; set arbitrary and unattainable
criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced
many businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available
for investment in certain industries; restrained job growth; and
damaged U.S. international competitiveness.&quot;  &quot;Highly
Toxic&quot; fully explains and offers examples of each of these
Superfund consequences.
<P>
&quot;Superfund is riddled with problems,&quot; Keating notes,
&quot;but worst of all is its liability scheme.  Under Superfund's
strict, retroactive, and joint and  several liability, if a business
disposed of waste  toxic or nontoxic, large or insignificant amounts
 in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, it
can still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal
site if it later became a Superfund site.  Notions of responsibility
and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; suggests phasing in a threestep reform
process for Superfund: 
<P>
1) repeal retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987
 eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund
sites, use sciencebased risk assessment and costbenefit analysis
to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the number of
Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; 
<P>
2) in the name of fairness and common sense, repeal the strict,
retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether,
and only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke
the law, who were negligent, fraudulent, deceptive, etc.; and

<P>
3) eventually put an end to Superfund  waste sites are local or,
at most, state issues, not federal.
<P>
Keating concludes:  &quot;At the very least, Superfund must be
completely overhauled. 
<P>
As things currently stand, no one wins under the Superfund scenario
of high costs and few clean ups.&quot;

<blockquote>
I would like to thank Ray Keating and the Small Business Survival Committee, and commend them for the 
hard work they have put into this important booklet.  I unfortunately have been very involved with 
Superfund for several years now.  I am glad, however, that we have this opportunity to address the 
problems with the program and fix it the way it should be fixed.  
<P>
Soon after being elected in 1990, I learned that I had 14 National Priority List (NPL) sites in my district.  
After hearing dozens of real-life horror stories of what these sites were doing to small businesses and 
municipalities, I formed the NH Superfund Task Force.
<P>
We worked for about a year to study the problems and make some suggested solutions.  We came up with a 
series of recommendations which I turned into H.R. 4161, the "Comprehensive Superfund Improvement 
Act," and introduced it in the 103rd Congress.
<P>
While that bill addressed many different areas, the most important part addressed liability.  Specifically, the 
elimination of retroactive liability and the replacement of joint and several liability with a fair share 
allocation system.
<P>
This year I've introduced H.R. 2256.  This is significant legislation because it presents a road map for what 
I believe is the best way to make Superfund work in the fairest and quickest way possible.  My legislation 
will repeal Superfund's unfair, unjust, and un-American retroactive and joint and several liability system 
for actions that were legal at the time.  They will be replaced with a fair share liability system that will only 
hold people responsible for what they actually contributed to a Superfund site.
<P>
Despite the billions of taxpayer dollars that have been spent on Superfund, we now see that a mere 18 
percent of Superfund sites have been cleaned up.  This raises the obvious question of whether or not we are 
getting our money's worth?  These facts -- especially when combined with a GAO report released recently 
which says that only one-third of all Superfund sites pose an actual risk to human health -- make it obvious 
to me that we are not getting our money's worth.
<P>
So what is costing Americans so much money while causing these sites to sit idle for years with no clean 
up?  It is Superfund's misguided liability system.  We can make all the reforms and changes we want to the 
Superfund program, but if we do not fundamentally reform the liability system, we will be back here again 
having the same conversation in a few years.  Taxpayers are spending billions on lawyers while very few 
of these sites are getting cleaned up.
<P>
Recently the House Small Business Committee held a hearing on the impact of Superfund liability on small 
businesses.  What we heard were stories of small businessmen and women from all over the nation about 
how they have been brought to the brink of bankruptcy by this program -- all brought about by the current 
liability system.
<P>
We also learned that the Department of Justice spends over $30 million  per year on Superfund 
enforcement.  That's more than they spend on Clean Water, Clean Air, and RCRA enforcement combined!
<P>
In addition to this feeding frenzy for lawyers, the Superfund liability system has created an atmosphere in 
which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acts like prosecutor, judge, and jury.  They 
assume you are guilty until you can prove yourself innocent, and threaten you with huge fines and criminal 
action if you do not do what they say.
<P>
Once you have been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) by the EPA, your journey is just 
beginning.  You will have to withstand endless EPA inquiries, endure hours of tedious work looking for 
old records from decades ago which may no longer exist, and pay lawyers to represent you and help prove 
your innocence.  Even then you are faced with third-party suits or insurance litigation to recover some or 
all of your costs.  
<P>
EPA and the Department of Justice have taken a program designed to clean up the nation's most toxic sites 
and turned it into a program that feeds the legal system and creates an atmosphere of where they have 
complete and total control over the fate of thousands of small businesses.
<P>
There is such a thing as too much government control, as we all know too well.  Superfund's liability 
system -- in addition to all its other failures -- has led to an out-of-control federal bureaucracy at EPA and 
the Department of Justice at the expense of hard-working Americans.
<P>
Another gentleman who testified before the Small Business Committee told us about how he had been a 
PRP for 8 years, and spent over $10,000 defending himself against a false charge.  Then, moments before a 
Congressional hearing on Superfund reform earlier this year, he was told by EPA Administrator Browner 
that he was no longer a PRP at that site.
<P>
While he was happy to have been let off, the gentleman was livid at the fact that he had spent nearly a 
decade and thousands of dollars fighting, only to be told before a Congressional hearing that he was free -- 
just so Administrator Browner could use it for political points and say "see how cooperative we are?"  Why 
was this man put through the expense and years of personal terror by EPA?  Why are tens of thousands of 
others similarly persecuted by EPA?  It is the liability system -- that's why.
<P>
In summary, the retroactive liability system in current law costs us billions of dollars ... delays clean ups 
for over 10 years ... gives government entirely too much control ... and creates an atmosphere in which 
there is absolutely no effort made to cooperate and in which the constitutional right of "innocent until 
proven guilty" is thrown right out the window.
<P>
The people of the United States deserve nothing less than a full repeal -- they deserve a clean environment 
and they deserve to be assured that their hard-earned tax dollars are going to clean up these sites rather than 
pay for endless armies of lawyers.
<P>
I urge my colleagues to examine every possible method to repeal retroactive liability before they take the 
final vote on Superfund legislation.  Holding people responsible for things they did that were perfectly 
legal is un-American, unfair, unjust, and must be changed.  Superfund is the most flawed law on our books 
and it is unconscionable for us, as legislators, to ignore a process which has destroyed so many people and 
so many businesses.  I urge small businessmen and women around the nation to take action now -- we must 
do what's right.  Let's not use a band-aid for a problem that requires a tourniquet.  Write and call your 
Congressmen and Senators now, and tell them you want fundamental liability reform in any Superfund 
reform package.
<P>
Best wishes.

After years of watching billions of taxpayers dollars wasted, and thousands of small businesses legally and 
economically terrorized, the United States Congress has finally recognized that it is time to overhaul the 
federal law named "Superfund."
<P>
Since its inception fifteen years ago, Superfund has principally served not as a means to cleaning up 
hazardous materials, but rather as a feeding trough for lawyers and bureaucrats alike.  These individuals 
seem to care little about the environment, being more concerned with enriching themselves at the expense 
of innocent parties and unsuspecting taxpayers.  Through this booklet, "Highly Toxic: The Superfund 
Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee 
(SBSC) reveals Superfund's misguided beginnings and how it has turned into a surreal nightmare for those 
caught in its web.
<P>
Regardless of "good" intentions, Superfund has cleaned up only a fraction of the so-called waste sites 
designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), despite the fact that the federal government 
and the private sector together have spent at least $90 billion on clean up costs.  With future expenditure 
estimates as high as $1.25 trillion, Superfund indeed should be closely scrutinized.
<P>
Practically every aspect of Superfund is a mess -- a prime candidate for the "dysfunctional-government 
poster program."  The EPA's criteria for selecting Superfund sites, its designation of "potentially 
responsible parties," and the allocation of clean up costs are all grossly misguided.
<P>
Over 17,000 pages of regulations have been issued in the Federal Register on Superfund.  Most 
disturbingly, the hand of Superfund extends retroactively -- unfairly dragging businesses, cities and other 
innocent parties into legal battles.  Estimates place up to half of the resources exhausted on clean up going 
to legal and administrative fees.  In particular, small businesses and entrepreneurs simply cannot absorb the 
large, inflated costs of clean up.  Nor can they afford to engage in legal squabbles that involve being 
targeted by the EPA as a "polluter."
<P>
Superfund certainly is more hazardous to small businesses, taxpayers and local governments than the waste 
materials it was supposed to clean up.  When the new Congress talks of reining in the unbridled regulatory 
monster, clearly Superfund must be at the top of the list.  "Highly Toxic" examines the history, costs and 
effects of Superfund in order to educate the public, media and lawmakers about a program careening out of 
control.  This booklet also offers common-sense reform measures to clean up a government program 
proven to be toxic for businesses and taxpayers alike.

Can you imagine the federal government getting involved in an issue for all the wrong reasons and 
eventually making matters worse rather than better?  Of course you can.  Indeed, many of us see this as the 
case with numerous federal government endeavors -- from various taxes, rules and regulations to welfare, 
education and health care.
<P>
In 1980, the federal government injected itself deeply into the process of cleaning up hazardous and not-so-
hazardous waste sites across the nation with the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act -- better known as "Superfund."  Undertaken for the wrong reasons, 
Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often 
unsuspecting individuals and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most, state problems into national 
woes;  set arbitrary and unattainable criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced many 
businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available for investment in certain industries; restrained job 
growth; and damaged U.S. international competitiveness.
<P>
Small businesses -- seeking out additional capital for growth or often just fighting to stay alive -- are 
particularly vulnerable to a Superfund gone awry.  Legal costs, expenditures for cleaning up sites to which 
they contributed little, groping through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucracy, and a 
thick fog obscuring future costs and risks, can stop a small business in its tracks and even kill it.
<P>
Perhaps the most glaring problem with Superfund, though, is its mechanism for assigning liability to 
perfectly innocent parties.  Under this perverse federal legislation, if you disposed of waste -- toxic or non-
toxic, large or insignificant amounts -- in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, you 
could still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal site if it later became a Superfund site.  
Notions of responsibility and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.
<P>
Despite massive amounts of both private and public expenditures, few of the waste sites targeted for clean 
up by the EPA under Superfund actually have been cleaned up.
<P>
Indeed, individuals from across the economic and political spectrums believe that Superfund has been an 
abysmal failure.  Differences arise, however, as to whether the program merely needs some fine tuning, a 
complete overhaul, or outright termination.
<P>
The following pages will provide an overview of Superfund's history, examine its impact on business,  
entrepreneurship and the economy, and offer much-needed reform measures.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="four">The Origin of Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
As children, many of us read comic books that told tales of our favorite superheros.  Seemingly without 
failure, our hero gained super powers due to the fallout -- usually of the radiation variety --  from some 
industrial accident or government experiment gone awry.  The fictional hero would then go on to a long 
career of fighting crime, righting wrongs,  and battling various evil-doers.
<P>
In similar fashion, Superfund gained its powers due to the political fallout from a particular waste site.  
Unfortunately, in this case, fiction became part of reality.  Love Canal gave birth to Superfund.
<P>
Most of us have heard, at least casually, the story of how a private company's waste dump created an 
environmental catastrophe affecting families and children in Love Canal, New York -- leading to an 
evacuation.  Thankfully, in a recent article, CATO Institute economist Jerry Taylor reminded us of the true 
story behind Love Canal.1  
<P>
The company in question -- the Hooker Electrochemical Company -- "legally disposed of 21,800 tons of its 
wastes in the abandoned canal trenches of the area from 1942 to 1953."  The company chose this particular 
area due to the impermeable clay soil, which would protect groundwater, and its rural nature, limiting 
potential exposure.  However, the expanding suburbs of Niagara Falls started to encroach on the site, and 
the local school board sought the land for an elementary school.  Hooker initially refused to sell, but the 
board threatened to use its power of eminent domain.  Hooker fully informed the school board of all the 
risks -- including having them present at on-site tests.  Nonetheless, the board "bought" the land from 
Hooker for $1.2  
<P>
Taylor explains the subsequent damage wrought by the school board:
<P>
  "Hooker Electrochemical's careful attempts to contain the waste and warn of the site's dangers were 
immediately undone by the school board.  Thousands of cubic yards of the clay cap [laid by Hooker] were 
scraped away in the course of constructing the school and later during the landscaping of a housing 
development that was built on the site.  The board's attempted sale of the land in 1957 for residential 
purposes was vigorously opposed by Hooker."3  
<P>
Alas, Hooker pleaded to no avail.  The land was sold to developers, and the construction of city sewer lines 
breached the site.  Taylor observes: "What we have, then, is not a parable of rapacious, shortsighted 
capitalists putting profit above public health, but the story of a conscientious company whose best efforts 
were undone by shortsighted public officials who put immediate political return above the general 
welfare."4  
<P>
By largely riding public outcry over this misunderstood incident, the federal government passed the 
Superfund legislation in 1980.  As the reader will quickly see, Superfund is no super program.  Heroes 
cannot be found in this story, only villains and victims.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="five">The Superfund Prescription</a></CENTER></H3>

Superfund was built on the dubious assumption that the federal government should trump states and 
localities in terms of dealing with waste sites across the nation.  
<P>
Initially, Superfund was intended to force companies to clean up their hazardous wastes and to deal with 
"orphan" sites -- sites abandoned where responsible parties could not be found.  Congress originally 
authorized a trust fund of $1.6 billion for orphan-site clean ups -- thought more than adequate at the time.  
With the 1990 budget deal, the fund ballooned to more than $15 billion.5   The EPA -- with no objection 
from our federal elected officials -- greatly expanded the scope of Superfund.
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the National Priority List (NPL).  The EPA then 
tracks down "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) and assigns responsibility and costs for waste site 
clean ups.  Increasingly, though, the EPA forces PRPs to undertake the clean up from the very start.  Non-
compliance without "sufficient cause" results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.6   
<P>
In determining liability, the EPA utilizes highly questionable criteria:<ul>

<li> Superfund allows for strict liability -- regardless of intent or negligence.

<li> Superfund liability is retroactive, meaning that actions taken before the law was enacted still apply.  So 
even if firms were in full compliance of the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.

<li> Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore, the EPA can require that one business 
pay for the clean up irrespective of the degree of its own contribution to the waste site and without 
consideration to the total number of contributors.  No concept of "fair share" exists under Superfund.  
Seeking relief, this unfortunate EPA selectee files contribution suits against other businesses connected to 
the waste site.  All parties tend to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.

<li> Indeed, current or past owners of a Superfund site who contributed absolutely nothing to the waste 
problem can be held liable.

<li> The burden of proof lies with the accused to prove their innocence rather than the EPA proving guilt 
under Superfund.</ul>
<P>
The EPA's main criteria for assigning liability for a Superfund site often seems to merely be "deep pockets" 
-- whoever is able to pay will pay for a site clean up.  Of course, this is not an ironclad rule.  After all, 
sometimes deep pockets cannot be found, in which case anyone will do -- including small businesses with 
the most distant relationship to the site.  And even if the EPA finds "deep pockets," these same "deep 
pockets" seek to recover their own costs by bringing contribution suits against these same small enterprises.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of at a site by a firm is far too often not factored into this liability 
scheme.  So a firm depositing fairly innocuous materials may still be held liable.  Indeed, the actual degree 
of risk for damaging exposure to hazardous wastes hardly plays into the determination process for a 
Superfund site at all.  James Bovard notes, "A study by the Congressional Office of Technology 
Assessment concluded that half of all Superfund cleanups 'address hypothetical risks rather than actual 
ones.'"7 
<P>
Also, the degree of cleanliness required by the EPA often falls far beyond the realm of common sense.  For 
example, waste sites need to be cleaned to "background conditions," far in excess of human safety 
requirements and beyond prevailing conditions prior to contamination; groundwater under a site must be 
made clean enough to drink (often technologically impossible); and dirt is required to be so clean that a 
person could eat (!) half a teaspoon every month for 76 years and not get cancer.8  
<P>
If you think such a system possesses enormous potential to develop into a costly, legal quagmire, you are 
absolutely correct.

<H3><CENTER><a name="six">Superfund's Toxic Effects -- 
Dismal Results at Staggering Costs</a></CENTER> </H3>

As is the case with so many federal government endeavors, Superfund has fallen far short of its original 
goals while generating a host of new ills.  And these ills are felt by individuals and enterprises caught in the 
Superfund web, taxpayers, entire industries, and the economy in general.  
<P>
The overall costs are weighty:
<ul><p>
<li> Of the 1,292 "worst" waste sites on the NPL, only 237 have been cleaned up -- about 18 percent -- 
according to Heritage Foundation analyst John Shanahan.9  One should note that this is a most optimistic 
accounting of cleaned up sites.  On February 14, 1994, for example, Business Week reported that out of 
1,270 sites on the Superfund list just 49 "have been completely cleaned up."

<li> Yet, the federal government has spent almost $10 billion on Superfund and forced private parties to kick 
in another $80 billion.10  The average NPL site takes 10 years to clean up at an average cost of $30 
million, according to economist James Bovard.11  However, on September 29, 1995, The Washington 
Times reported it generally takes 8 years for clean up to actually begin, and then another 12 to 15 years to 
clean up the site.

<li> On average, transaction costs account for 32 percent of total private-sector Superfund costs, with 
litigation making up 65 percent of this amount or 21 percent of total costs.12  As reported in a recent 
Investor's Business Daily article (September 29, 1995), U.S. Representatives Mike Oxley (R-OH) and 
Sherwood Boelhert (R-NY) claim that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for legal fees alone.

<li> Once caught in the Superfund liability morass, it becomes much more difficult for a firm to attract 
capital, make investments, and therefore, grow and create jobs.  Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint 
and several liabilities create considerable uncertainties for firms.  Such unknown costs chase away 
investors and make expansion plans quite dubious.
<P></ul>
Small businesses suffer most under these added costs and risks.  Without the Superfund cloud hanging over 
it, investing in, starting up, and expanding a small venture is already a risky undertaking.  Superfund 
liabilities only raise the hurdles faced by small business even higher.
<P>
A survey of small businesses conducted by the American Council for Capital Formation confirmed these 
facts.  In a January 1994 report, it was noted that 39.1 percent of small business respondents reduced or 
delayed investment in plant and equipment due to being named a PRP.  Almost half of respondents with 0-
19 employees canceled or postponed investment.
<P>
The blow to the economy and job creation from this reduced investment are manifest.
<ul><p>
<li> Superfund also creates disincentives for investment in industrialized urban areas.  The threat of enormous 
liability discourages firms from buying land in and renewing long-time or formerly industrialized areas.  
Instead, it's safer to build new facilities elsewhere.  So many U.S. cities already impose large burdens on 
the private sector -- including high taxes, heavy regulations, bloated government budgets, and more -- and 
Superfund adds to these costs.

<li> Incentives are skewed for local governments and communities as well.  With the federal government and 
private parties picking up the tab for a Superfund site clean up, localities possess every incentive to push 
for clean ups to go well beyond reasonable levels.  They are not restrained by cost concerns, as someone 
else foots the bill. Economist Robert Hahn has noted that local communities often seek "gold-plated" clean 
ups as they reap nearly all the benefits while the costs are swallowed by a large number of taxpayers and 
consumers.13  Only when localities are named as PRPs does one witness restraint.

<li> Finally, according to a study by the Center for the Study of American Business, "Superfund imposes 
much more stringent regulations on manufacturing and other firms doing business in the United States than 
these companies would be required to meet in other countries."14  Most notably, in nations like Canada, 
Mexico, Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and others, liability rarely reaches entities that legally disposed of 
their waste; instead, liability is linked to fault.15  
<p></ul>
Individual Superfund horror stories abound, and the most horrific tend to pertain to small businesses -- 
those least able to afford or survive a governmental assault of the Superfund magnitude.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li> A small camera and film-developing store reportedly was held liable for the massive clean-up costs of a 
Superfund site in Glenwood Landing, New York.16 

<li> Hundreds of businesses and nonprofit groups, including a hospital, several public schools, and a pizza 
parlor, have been forced to pay large costs for cleaning up the Ludlow Sanitary Landfill in New York.17  
Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork over $11,000, originally destined for store 
improvements, because the glue from cardboard boxes he shipped to Ludlow was deemed hazardous.18  

<li> Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Oklahoma was notified by the EPA that it would be held 
responsible for the clean up of a local Superfund site.  Why?  Apparently for nothing more than paying 
someone $14 in 1972 to haul trash to the site.19

<li> Robert M. Cox Jr. lost his business because the Superfund liability scheme forced him to pay for the 
neglect of others.  He had to sell his furniture coating business -- Gilbert Spruance Co. of Oreland, 
Pennsylvania -- due to excessive legal fees and liability costs.  His waste had been disposed of at 11 
different sites despite an agreement with a waste hauler for disposal in one landfill.20  

<li>Kaplan's Careful Cleaners of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania was held liable for waste deposited according to 
the "letter of the law" 10 years ago at a site now on the Superfund list.21  

<li> H. Petert Nerger, president of Marisol Inc. of Middlesex, New Jersey, reported recently that even though 
his solvent recycling operations have not generated any wastes since the 1984 land ban under the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act, and despite the fact that previously the state told him where to deposit his 
waste, "our existence is threatened by retroactive liability."22  

<li> Automobile dealers in the Fresno, California area have become victims of what can be termed "drive by 
liability."  EPA bureaucrats reportedly put a former truck driver behind the wheel of a car and asked him to 
select establishments where he picked up used oil in the past and how much.23  

<li> In 1987, Eugene Ardelt bought the Mesa Fiberglass Products Company and soon after became a PRP at 
the Lowery Landfill Superfund site in Denver.  It did not matter that Ardelt had never dumped toxic waste 
at the landfill, nor that the previous owner's dumping was perfectly legal.  Ardelt spent $25,000 in legal 
fees and eventually settled with the EPA for $2,000.24  

<li> A small chemical company in Massachusetts -- Nyacol Products Inc. -- is being held as a PRP at the 
Nyanza Chemical Waste Dump Superfund Site because it currently owns the property.  This despite the 
fact that the EPA acknowledges that Nyacol had nothing at all to do with the site's contamination.25 
</ul><p>
These few examples fail to even scratch the surface.  Stories of Superfund atrocities seem endless.  And 
one should remember that while the costs are high for individuals and the economy, the safety benefits 
derived by individuals and improvements to the environment remain in question.  No one wins under the 
Superfund scenario of high costs and few clean ups.

<H3><CENTER><a name="seven">Department of Justice Defends 
Superfund Injustice</a></CENTER>
</H3>
It is worth examining the arguments made by Superfund's supporters.  These were most recently 
encapsulated on October 19, 1995, when Assistant Attorney General Lois J. Schiffer from the 
Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice testified regarding 
Superfund before the House of Representatives Committee on Small Business.  In general, Ms. Schiffer 
found little fault with Superfund.  
<P>
Indeed, Schiffer declared: "We believe that the Superfund liability and enforcement scheme has been very 
effective in carrying out the 'polluter pays' principle. "  As with all supporters of Superfund, Schiffer 
throws around the term "polluter" in a reckless manner.  No consideration is given to the intent of 
individuals and the legality of their actions.  If a small business owner disposed of a small amount of waste 
in a completely legal and ethical manner, for example, he becomes a "polluter" when Superfund is invoked.
<P>
Later in her testimony, Ms. Schiffer paints a picture of a government agency working with the private 
sector in full cooperation: "During the 15 years of its existence, the enforcement program has evolved from 
a litigation focus into a program in which most responsible parties enter into settlements or voluntarily 
comply with administrative orders, rather than litigating with the government."  Of course, mention of 
harsh EPA fines and threats of holding particular parties responsible for the entire clean up of a waste site 
go unmentioned.
<P>
Schiffer also praised a 1986 change in Superfund legislation which according to the Assistant Attorney 
General "prevents responsible parties from delaying cleanups by seeking judicial review and stays of EPA's 
remedies or orders before the government seeks judicial enforcement."  Of course, if one is on the 
receiving end of such "remedies or orders" the story can be quite different.  In testimony also given on 
October 19, John B. DeVinck, a car dealer from Superior Wisconsin, offered a slightly different assessment 
of restrictions on PRPs:
<P>
"My dealership arranged to transport used oil to [the Arrowhead Refining Company site] during a single 
nine-month period in 1976 when my regular used oil company was on strike.  I did not send used oil to 
Arrowhead during any other period of time, and have witnesses and sworn affidavits attesting to that fact.  
Regrettably, EPA and the PRP group who sued me refused to accept my supporting evidence and the 
testimony of witnesses.  With no jury or other fact finding on the EPA's part and no documentary records 
or evidence, they calculated the maximum amount of oil each dealership generated and assumed it was sent 
to Arrowhead during its 1944-77 operating life, assessing liability based on that maximum amount."
<P>
It was decided that DeVinck sent 31,855 gallons over the period 1960 to 1976.  Based on his own samples 
from various years, DeVinck calculated that over the actual nine months he sent his used oil to Arrowhead, 
he was responsible for about 1,000 gallons.  He has been involved in the PRP process for over five years 
now.  His costs include more than $100,000 in attorney and consultant fees, liability finally set at $70,000 
(down from an original "guess-timate" of $460,000 and then $230,000), plus $8,000 in interest.
<P>
In closing his testimony, DeVinck noted: "In my case, the $78,000 of cleanup liability I was assessed is an 
absolute travesty of justice.  The problem was that I couldn't prove a negative.  It was impossible to prove 
that I didn't contribute the huge amounts of used oil alleged."
<P>
Assistant Attorney General Schiffer also praised the fact that the 1986 Superfund amendments directed the 
EPA to select more "permanent" clean up remedies.  Of course, in many instances, this increases the cost of 
clean ups.  Federal lawmakers and bureaucrats clearly should not be dictating how far a clean up must go; 
this should be left to localities and the states who have a better understanding of local communities.
<P>
Some Superfund proponents have argued that Superfund was needed to establish a liability structure for 
cleaning up waste sites.  In fact, in her testimony, Schiffer inadvertently shows that no such need existed: 
"Before 1980, there was liability for contamination caused by hazardous waste disposal under the common 
law of public nuisance" and even strict liability "for harm caused by ultrahazardous activities."  She 
asserted that Superfund "was needed to provide response authority and funding for cleaning up hazardous 
waste sites, and to make rules of liability consistent and clear on a national basis."  With common law 
precedence and state or local government action possible, however, the need for federal action did not, and 
does not, exist.
<P>
Ms. Schiffer justified each aspect of Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability scheme, 
as noted below.  Any true defender of justice should be disturbed by these justifications.  A response is 
supplied to each major justification for Superfund's liability regime offered by the Assistant Attorney 
General: 
<P><ul>
<li> Schiffer went so far as to justify strict liability under Superfund because, "Litigating 'fault,' as in tort 
cases, is extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive."  
Response.  According to the Assistant Attorney General's testimony, under strict and joint and several 
liabilities, justice seems to be sacrificed for governmental expediency.  This would be bad enough, 
however, in reality under Superfund, justice is sacrificed for absolutely no expediency whatsoever.  Clean 
ups take more than 10 years on average to be completed, while litigation costs skyrocket. 

<li> Retroactive liability rests, to say the least, on quite precarious grounds based on Schiffer's justifications: 
<p><ol><li> "it is perfectly fair to ask the parties who make a mess to clean it up;" <li> "the companies who created 
problems caused by Superfund sites benefitted economically from the manufacturing and other activities 
that generated these hazardous wastes;" and <li>"at least some of the companies who disposed of hazardous 
wastes were well aware of the dangers the wastes posed long before the public was."  <p></ol>
Response.  Schiffer's arguments supporting retroactive liability ignore the facts that entities not responsible, 
in any significant meaning of the word, are paying for cleaning up messes across the nation.  If economic 
benefit is a justification for retroactivity, then the retroactive liability net has to be cast much wider to 
capture consumers, various levels of government and taxpayers, other related businesses, etc.  And  if a 
handful of companies may have been aware of dangers the public was not, that is certainly no justification 
for punishing all businesses involved.  
<P>
<li> Finally, Schiffer argues that "joint and several liability is a longstanding common law rule that has been 
applied by the courts in CERCLA cases brought by the government, at sites where there is more than one 
responsible party and the harm is divisible."  She also asserted that joint and several liability is an efficient 
course of action, and if repealed would increase litigation costs.<P>
Response.  As for joint and several liability, Schiffer cites a supporting case -- Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 
80 (Sup. Ct. Cal. 1948).  However, she notes that the defendants in this case actually "acted wrongfully."  
To say that a small business disposing waste according to the letter of the law and in good conscience is in 
any way acting wrongfully is a clear perversion of the law.
<P></ul>
When these shaky arguments are the best that can be mustered in defense of Superfund, serious questions 
should arise in everyone's minds -- especially our federal elected officials.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eight">What To Do?</a></CENTER></H3>

As we have seen, Superfund's problems are numerous and substantial.  In this booklet's introduction, it was 
noted that disagreement exists as to whether Superfund was in need of merely some fine tuning, a complete 
overhaul, or outright termination.
<p>
The long and costly list of problems identified here safely rules out mere fine tuning.  Economics and 
common sense dictate termination of Superfund, but politics may require something short of that -- a 
complete overhaul.  The following reform measures are offered as a three-step process:<p><ol><li> short-term 
reforms, <li> a major overhaul of Superfund, and <li> Superfund's termination.</ol><p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="nine">1) Short-term Superfund Reform Measures</a></CENTER>
</H3>
In order to get the Superfund reform process moving, several steps can be taken immediately that create a 
somewhat saner environment.  These include repealing retroactive liability for all actions taken before 
1987 -- eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund sites; from 1987 on, basing liability 
on the proportion of waste a party contributed to a site; using science-based risk assessment and cost-
benefit analysis to determine required clean up remedies; and capping the number of Superfund NPL sites 
to gain some control over potential costs.

<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="ten">2) Completely Overhauling Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
The following reforms would go far in overhauling the Superfund program:<ul>

<li> Completely repeal strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes.  Fairness and common sense 
dictate that no one should be held liable for exercising good judgment and following the law, and certainly 
not for actions taken before a law was passed.

<li> Superfund should only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke the law, who were 
negligent, fraudulent, deceptive , etc.  This is the only true "polluter pays" scenario.  To reiterate, parties 
that simply sent waste to a site in an honest manner, in full compliance with the law, should have 
absolutely no liability whatsoever.  In essence, they are not polluters.  So even proportional liability 
reforms -- where liability is determined by the amount and type of waste an enterprise contributed to the 
site -- while improvements over the current system, still remain fundamentally unfair and must eventually 
give way.
</ul>
If the federal government insists on operating a Superfund program, based on the dubious belief that 
individual waste sites amount to a federal issue, then funding should be attained from true polluters, and 
where no real polluters can be found, unfortunately, through federal taxes.  However, in the end, more 
needs to be done than a complete overhaul of Superfund.  Federal taxpayers should not have to pay for 
local waste sites.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eleven">3. The Case for Terminating Superfund</a></CENTER></H3>

In fact, a waste site clean up is not a federal issue, unless, of course,  operated by the federal government or 
undertaken due to a new federal law or mandate.  In these two instances, federal responsibility is clear.  
Otherwise, waste site clean ups should be left as local, or at most,  state issues.  Localities are in a better 
position to judge the costs and benefits of clean ups.  If completely unable to carry the costs of a necessary 
clean up, then state government should be turned to for assistance.    
<P>
In fact, state and local clean-up efforts have proved to be far more efficient, timely, and less costly.  Local 
individuals possess a better understanding of their community's circumstances and needs than do EPA 
bureaucrats.
<P>
Indeed, the proper order of responsibility -- again,  barring federal operation, mandates or laws --  should 
be:
<P><ol>
<li>Private parties guilty of breaking the law, negligence, fraud, etc.;
<li>Local government action;
<li>State government action.
</ol><p>
The case for terminating the federal Superfund program is strong, especially at a time when Congress is 
seeking to re-establish a proper relationship between federal, state, and local governments.  True federalism 
dictates that those issues that can be dealt with at the state or local level should be left at the state or local 
level.  Not that these particular governmental layers are necessarily any more efficient than the federal 
government, but state or local officials should possess some better understanding of a community's needs, 
including the area of a waste-site clean up.
<p>
In the end, Superfund should be discontinued and the several taxes supporting it terminated.  This is the 
most responsible step the federal government can take when it comes to waste sites across the nation.

<h3>President Clinton's Proposal To Increase the Minimum Wage</h3>
Testimony of Grant Maloy<br>
 Owner Gabriella Growers Oviedo, Florida<p>
Before Joint Economic Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
February 22, 1995<p>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. My name is Grant Maloy, owner and operator of Gabriella Growers, a wholesale foliage nursery located near Orlando, Florida. I grow houseplants which are sold throughout the country. I thank the Joint Economic Committee for the opportunity to appear before you today. I think it is vitally important that the United States Congress hear from small business owners and entrepreneurs such as myself, about the impact of proposed government policies on small business. Business owners, like me, are the ones who have to deal with the aftermath of our lawmaker's actions, and I appreciate the Committee giving the small business voice, a voice in this process.<p>

I started my own small business -- it began as a 2,700 square foot greenhouse and today totals 19,000 square feet. One thing that I did not learn in college, was that if you decide to take the plunge into entrepreneurship, the government -will be a roadblock at each stage. The first hurdle starts at the county level, with the last at the federal level. As a small business owner, you face zoning, license, code enforcement, sign restrictions, and fire inspectors from local government. As you move to the state level, worker's compensation, business inspectors, more regulations, fees and taxes. Then, at the federal level there are social security taxes, unemployment taxes, income taxes, OSHA and the list goes on and on.<p>

If it were not for family to help and guide me through the tax and regulatory mazes and hurdles that exist, I probably would have never tried to start a business. And, if I did start one without their help and assistance, there is a good possibility I would have failed. Not because of marketing, sales, or employee problems -- but due to government-imposed barriers.<p>

My business defines what the "small" in small business means. My annual sales totaled $60,000 last year. I began my business from scratch, working parttime at it in 1987, and full-time in 1990. I believe that I represent many ofthe struggling, start-up businesses throughout America.<p>

I oppose an increase in the minimum wage, because it creates just another roadblock for new or expanding small businesses. The market place works, and the academics and bureaucrats in government should stop imposing some artificial wage rate on business, especially when it has been proven that wage tinkering creates additional job loss and hurts those it purportedly is supposed to help.<p>
<h3> <i>The Market Place Works</i></h3>
In my industry, many low-skilled workers are hired. The entry level positions currently pay an average of $5.24 an hour. Competition is strong in the greenhouse industry with wholesale prices remaining nearly the same for over a decade. Yet, wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.<p>

Employees should be paid based on their productivity and worth, not on some theoretic number selected by politicians for political reasons. I remember two years ago when even President Clinton said that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earnings." Now because of political pressure from organized labor, and new attempts to inflict class warfare into his political strategy, the President has flip-flopped on another key issue of his 1992 campaign.<p>

The laws of economics are as strong as the laws of physics. If you try to bend the rules, you will end up with distortions, and often a disaster. If an employee is not going to produce $4.25 or $5.15 per hour, a business can't afford to pay them that. Persons trying to get their start, and jump onto the economic ladder suffer because they will be unemployed and unskilled. If you take a look at the enormous unemployment rate amongst teenagers and inner-city residents, you will see how the setting of arbitrary wage-rates bears this claim out.<p>

Unfortunately, the real losers of a minimum wage hike will be the individuals whose skills do not allow them to compete successfully for the entry level job.<p>

<h3><i>Hypocrisy of Government Policies</i></h3>

Another reason I am opposed to the minimum wage is due to the fact that it is a hypocritical policy. The government expects a business owner to pay a minimum wage, when the business owner themselves may not make minimum wage.<p>

When I started my business, I was making about $2.00 per hour. I am not complaining because I was sacrificing to pay off a business loan and I was investing in my future. I enjoyed, and still do, the challenge of creating a business and future for myself.<p>

In essence, the minimum wage is just another unfunded mandate from Washington. The President or Congress sets the policy, and then passes the buck. In this case, hard-working small business owner are left to handle the problem.<p>

<h3><i>Government Micro-management</i></h3>

How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay? Economic decisions and business productivity varies from region to region, city to city, etc. It is ludicrous for the government to think it knows what is best for everyone. If this system did work, Congress should raise the minimum wage to $50 per hour, and poverty, presumably,
 would be solved.<p>

Already, government taxes and regulations at all levels cost my business plenty. If I want to expand my business, which I intend to do, and need the help to do it -- I will find less expensive ways to get the work done since I may not be able to afford a new employee at the new wage rate. Increasingly the government is setting up more hurdles to create jobs in this country. On the one hand small businesses have been lamented by the Administration for not doing enough (paying enough, providing health care, etc.) for our employees. At the same time, they are discouraging us, because of proposed policies like the minimum wage hike, to actually employ people.<p>

<h3><i>The Real Problem and Real Solutions</i></h3>

The government's goal should be to protect free enterprise and entrepreneurship. Rather than punish business and success, the government should ask..."How do we increase economic prosperity for all businesses and all workers?"<p>

Prosperity will only increase if Congress removes government-imposed hurdles that are strangling small business and entrepreneurship. If you really want to help small business owners like me the answers are simple: cut taxes, reduce regulations and praise entrepreneurship. Don't bash business.
 Finally, the government can encourage strong families. When I think backto what helped me the most on the road to entrepreneurship, it was not the government or school. It was the experience I received working for my dad's small business, and the encouragement and support
 that my parents gave me.<p>

I do not need more government-imposed rules or regulations on my small business. The government's role should be to protect, preserve and enhance small business. The proposed minimum wage hike flies in the face of these three principles, as well as the message that all Americans are sending government -that it spends, taxes, regulates and meddles too much.<p>

I urge the U.S. Congress to let the minimum wage proposal just remain that -- a proposal. The minimum wage's days have long been numbered, and breathing life into this misguided proposal would not only be bad for small businesses like Gabriella Growers, but bad for the current and future workers of America as well.<p>

Once again I thank the Committee and look forward to answering any questions you may have.<p>

<I><B>According to Congressional Ratings of Small Business

<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Pundits in the media continue to speculate
about Democrats regaining control of the Congress.  The Small
Business Survival Committee (SBSC) also toyed with the idea to
determine how small business issues would fare under the specter
of what could be ultra-liberal leadership in Congress if the House
and Senate change hands this November.<BR>

<P>
&quot;We're toast,&quot; said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan. 
&quot;I shudder when I think about the possibility of certain
ranking committee chairman taking control of the key tax writing
and regulatory committees.  The 105th Congress would be an unabashed
adversary of business and taxpayer interests,&quot; she said.
<BR>

<P>
According to <I>SBSC's Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>, the
leadership and ranking members slated for committee chairmanship
if the Democrats take control in the House are classified in the
hostile category.  The average score of these possible chairmen
and the party's leadership is an abysmal 2.3% out of 100%.  A
list of those members and their respective SBSC rating are as
follows:<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Average SBSC Rating        2.3%<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
The average rating of current committee chairmen in the House
is 86.4%.  In the Senate, where long-time foes of small business
like Senator Ted Kennedy would chair the Labor and Human Resource
Committee if Democrats took control, the current SBSC average
is 80%.<BR>
<P>
According to SBSC, the ratings of committee chairmen are very
important because individuals in these powerful positions determine
the legislative agenda of the committee.  They can advance proposals
that either hurt or help small businesses and entrepreneurs.<BR>
<P>
&quot;If Democrats take control they will owe, big time, the special
interests groups that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to
buy back the majority,&quot; said Kerrigan.  These groups -- big
labor, radical environmentalists, and other members of the more
spending/ big government coalition -- would expect the Democrats
to implement their far left agenda.  That agenda, consisting of
higher taxes, government-run health care and a massive expansion
of the regulatory state, would disproportionately fall on small
businesses according to SBSC.<BR>

<center><h2>News Release<P>
Small Business Advocate Supports Return to Citizen Congress</h2>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> - The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000 member small business advocacy organization,
announced support for an effort to historically change Congress.
 SBSC president Karen Kerrigan voiced support for the Citizen
Congress Act and its sponsors - Representatives Mark Sanford and
Wayne Allard and Senator Bill Frist.
<P>
&quot;The American people are tired of business as usual in Washington,
D.C.  The failure to enact congressional term limits adds to the
importance of implementing a bold initiative such as the Citizen
Congress Act, which we hope will change the face of Washington,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.
<P>
If enacted, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act will
help restore the faith of the American people in their elected
officials.  For too long, voters have been made promises while
important measures such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment
have not materialized.  By eliminating perks and wasteful practices
from within, Congress can begin to reverse the empty rhetoric
of the past several years.
<P>
According to SBSC, Abolishment of the federal pension system,
banning franked mass mailings, no automatic pay increases, and
limited military aircraft travel are significant reforms which
reduce government spending.  At a time when the country's fiscal
condition is instable, there is little reason not to tighten Congress'
belt.
<P>
Because federal lawmakers have failed to implement the wishes
of the public in regards to term limits, the Citizen Congress
Act will remind Members of their responsibility to the public.
 Voters, particularly small business owners, want the Congress
to be more accountable in every regard.
<P>
&quot;The Citizen Congress Act symbolizes a time-honored American
virtue - self-sacrifice.  We encourage all Members of Congress
to support this important initiative,&quot; Kerrigan added.

<title> America To Receive Six Times The Sex and Violence From Broadcasters </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
For Immediate Release<br>
July 31, 1995<br>
<p>
<center>

<h2> AMERICA TO RECEIVE SIX TIMES THE SEX AND VIOLENCE FROM
        BROADCASTERS, COMPLIMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>Washington, DC --</b>  The networks and broadcasters are looking to double their pleasure.  And if
given twice the airwaves, we will all be subjected to six times the violence and six times the sex
already provided on network television.
<p>
     "As early as next week, HR 1555, a telecommunications bill that would give broadcasters
spectrum valued at up to $100 billion free of charge, may come to the House floor.  Broadcasters,
in this sweetheart deal with Congress, would receive spectrum initially allocated to them for
transition to High Definition Television (HDTV).  Recently, however, they have revealed that
they intend to use the airwaves for whatever is most profitable for them, such as the addition of
up to six new television channels, paging, cellular, or similar services,"said Small Business
Survival Committee president Karen Kerrigan.
<p>
     Last week, Kerrigan announced the formation of the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to spawn debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
tremendous loss of taxpayer funds to wealthy broadcast networks.
<p>
     "Instead of promoting the growth of new telecommunications industry by auctioning the
airwaves on the free market, we can expect the broadcasters to air six times the violence, sex and
immoral content already provided in order to sell advertising and increase their ever-expansive
profits," said Kerrigan.
<p>
     And, in a National Press Club Speech, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called for a "Contract
for Kids and Community," in an attempt to clean up the airwaves.  Yet, with HR 1555,
broadcasters may double their spectrum giving them free reign, in all aspects, to insult the
sensibilities of middle America with scenes of deviance and violence.
<p>
     "The broadcasters say they deserve these airwaves because they are providing a public
service.  Let's examine the public service accessible to us now:  According to a 1994 study
conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, during an 18 hour period, an average
viewer can expect to see 1,217 violent scenes on network shows and 388 violent scenes in
commercials and promotions.  According to the American Psychological Association, the
average child watches 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of simulated violence before finishing
elementary school," Kerrigan added.

<title> $100 BILLION GOVERNMENT GIFT </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
For Immediate Release<br>
July 25, 1995<br>

<h2> AND THE WINNERS OF THE $100 BILLION GOVERNMENT GIFT ARE
          ROSEANNE, AL BUNDY, RUPERT AND THE TV MOGULS</h2>
<p>
                            
 --- SBSC'S KERRIGAN ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN FOR BROADCAST COMPETITION ---
</center>
<p>


<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> The already rich and powerful television networks and
broadcasters, who have made billions on the free television licenses given to them by the
government, are abut to get even more, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers.  Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission, in a bill which has passed the Senate and will soon be considered
by the House, will bestow on broadcasters -- for free -- new spectrum valued at up to $100
billion, according to Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC).  The plan will double the airwaves controlled by each television broadcaster.
<p>
     Kerrigan today announced that SBSC is creating the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to facilitate a debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
television broadcasters' plan to shortchange the U.S. taxpayers.  The Campaign will be joined by
individuals and public policy groups around the country to enhance public awareness and
understanding of this issue.
<p>
     "The broadcasters were initially supposed to receive this valuable spectrum as a way to
shift their current analog service to High Definition Television (HDTV) but have recently
admitted their intention to use the spectrum, not just for HDTV, but for whatever is most
profitable for them such as the addition of up to six new television channels, or paging, cellular,
or similar services.  And Congress is going along with this plan!  Do the promoters of shows
under attack by this very same Congress for their violent sexual content deserve this multi-billion
dollar gift?," Kerrigan said.
<p>
     "The Campaign is asking only that the television broadcasters be treated the same as
every other entity that wants new rights to the airwaves.  The spectrum should be auctioned off,
creating a competitive broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and
generating up to $100 billion to reduce the federal deficit.  In an era when spectrum auctions are
welcomed by government for new wireless services, it is incomprehensible that they continue
corporate welfare to benefit America's wealthiest interests."
<p>
     "The marketplace is the only place to pick winners and losers.  Competition makes the
best technological decisions for the consumer, not government," added Kerrigan.

Possesses the Home Field Advantage in Health

<P>
Washington, D.C. &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a small business advocacy group with more than 40,000
members across the nation, questioned the validity of Blue Cross
and Blue Shield's assertions in Michigan and across the country
that they operate under a clear disadvantage compared with other
insurance firms.<BR>

<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Blue Cross and Blue
Shield is excluded from the one of the biggest hurdles to success
that any for&#173;profit enterprise faces: taxes.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
SBSC noted that according to reports from the Michigan State Treasurer's
Office, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) possessed
an $83 million tax advantage in 1995 by not having to pay state
property and single business taxes.<BR>

<P>
BCBSM has turned up the volume on its &quot;level playing field&quot;
offensive as groups opposed to the extreme pre&#173;existing condition
language in H.B. 5572, the Patient Bill of Rights, have cried
foul.  Specifically, the provision would require that no group
health insurance plan can ever exclude for a pre&#173;existing
condition, not even if no prior coverage existed.  According to
SBSC, this will drive up costs, push insurers out of the state,
and government would step in further.<BR>

<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added: &quot;As baseball's
New York Yankees have shown thus far by losing two home games
and winning one on its opponents turf in the World Series, it's
often quite difficult to detect who, if anyone, clearly benefits
from the home field advantage.  The same can be said of the health
insurance field.  Clearly, Blue Cross and Blue Shield gains from
its tax status."

Reconciliation Bill's Capital Gains Tax Cuts Are Essential
to Entrepreneurship and Small Business Growth, Says Small Business
Advocacy Group</h3>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>

<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000-member small business advocacy organization,
today praised the capital gains tax cutting measures recently
announced by the House and Senate budget conferees.
<P>
The tax package will cut capital gains taxes on individuals and
corporations $35.7 billion. This cut would be retroactive to January
1, 1995. Additionally, individuals and corporations would have
reduced capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small
business stock. Although the package fails to index capital gains
taxes to inflation immediately, SBSC President Karen Kerrigan
stated that the country's weak to moderate growth would receive
a firm boost from the capital gains tax cutting measures.
<P>
&quot;Taxes on capital gains are perhaps the most regressive for
small businesses and entrepreneurs. High capital gains taxes prevent
many entrepreneurs from overcoming their number one obstacle to
start-up and growth -- access to capital,&quot; said Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan, however, added &quot;In no way should Congress fail
to realize the importance of indexing capital gains for inflation.
The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment
-- restraining small business growth and job creation -- we hope
indexation is addressed before 2001.&quot;
<P>
According to SBSC, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gains. These <I>real rates</I>
of capital gains taxation are severe impediments to keeping America's
economy vibrant and growing.
<P>
Kerrigan added that opponents who try to attempt to classify the
issue as one of rich vs. poor do not have a firm grasp of economics
and are ignoring the facts of who benefits from capital gains
reduction. According to 1992 IRS tax returns, 83% of those claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $100,000 -- 53% claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $50,000.
<P>
Most importantly, a capital gains tax reduction will strongly
benefit America's budding entrepreneurs and small businesses.
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond Keating adds, &quot;an inability
to stand by a cut in capital gains taxes would be a most damaging
blow to entrepreneurship, investment, and the economy.&quot;

<center><h2>Media Release<P>
Small Business Group Applauds 
General Tax Principle & Policies Offered By Kemp Commission
</h2>
<i>January 17, 1996		</i></center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, DC</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) voiced its support 
today for the general guiding principles and policies for tax reform outlined by the<A href ="/taxcom"> National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform,</a> or the Kemp Commission.  SBSC is a 
40,000-member small business organization advocating a free-market, pro-entrepreneur policy 
agenda.
<p>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed: "Overhauling our nation's tax code stands as a 
top issue for the small business community.  The Kemp Commission has outlined what we 
believe are the basics of a flat tax that will serve to significantly boost the nation's economy."
<p>
SBSC saw particular merit in several of the Commission's suggestions: to impose just a 
single, low tax rate on income; to end double taxation of businesses and their owners; to permit 
expensing of investment outlays; to exclude the returns on saving from taxation; to require a 
two-thirds majority vote in Congress to raise the tax rate; and most importantly, to abolish the 
capital gains tax.  While the Commission recognized that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," 
SBSC would have liked a much clearer declaration for the elimination of all "death" taxes that 
prove particularly burdensome for family-owned businesses.
<p>
Raymond J. Keating -- chief economist for the SBSC and author of a booklet entitled 
"The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans" (published by SBS Foundation) 
-- was enthused by the fact that the Commission's principles and policies lined up closely to 
those outlined in "The Great Tax Debate."  A side-by-side comparison is provided below.
<p>
Keating declared: "We're very pleased to see that the Commission recognizes the critical 
role that entrepreneurship plays in the economy -- as the engine of growth and job creation -- and 
the enormous obstacle our current tax code is to investment and risk taking."
<p>
"The Kemp Commission's report is not long on details, however.  Now comes the heavy 
lifting of making detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality," concluded Kerrigan.
<p>
<P>
<P>
<h4>Kemp Commission</h4>

<ul><i>Six Points of Principle:</i>
<p>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to 
work save and invest.
<br>
<li>Fairness to all taxpayers.
<br>
  <li>Simplicity so that anyone can figure it out.
<br>
<li>Neutrality that lets people and not 
government make choices.
<br>
<li>Visibility to let people know the cost of 
government.
<br>
<li>Stability so people can plan for the future.</ul>
<p>
<UL><i>Six Points of Policy:</i>
<p>
<li>A single tax rate.
<br>
<li>A generous personal exemption to remove 
the burden on those least able to pay.
<br>
<li>Lower tax rates for American families.
<br>
<li>Ending biases against work, saving, and 
investment.
<br>
<li>Making the new tax system hard to 
change.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>The Great Tax Debate</h4>
<p>
<ul><i>Eight Principles of Sound Taxation:</i>
<P>
<li>Low Flat Tax to Promote Economic 
Growth -- the lower and more proportional, 
or flatter, the tax rate system the better.

<br>
<li>No Taxation of Capital -- taxing returns on 
investment and savings makes absolutely no 
economic sense.

<br>
<li>Inflation Factor -- the detrimental effects 
of inflation should be factored into any tax 
system's design.

<br>
<li>Clarity -- the clearer the tax system the 
better.  Taxes should be as obvious as 
possible.

<br>
<li>Simplicity -- tax payments should be made 
as easy and as simple as possible without 
any loss of clarity.

<br>
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness  -- 
the fewer tax collectors and the more limited 
their powers the better.

<br>
<li>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance  -- 
taxes should be low enough so as to not 
provide significant incentives for tax 
avoidance.

<br>
<li>No Additional Boost to Government 
Spending -- a tax system's design should not 
make it any easier for government to 
increase expenditures.
</ul>

<h2> DO MEGA CORPORATIONS LIKE WESTINGHOUSE AND DISNEY
                    NEED CORPORATE WELFARE?</h2>
</center>
<p>

<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Who is more in need of financial help -- the American taxpayer or Mickey Mouse?  The two high-profile buyouts of ABC and CBS this week paint a clear example of how ludicrous it is for Congress to be giving billion dollar handouts to the networks.
<p>
Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee last week announced that SBSC has created the Campaign for Broadcast Competition (CBC).  The Campaign opposes legislation now before the House which gives wealthy broadcasters - at no cost - public airwaves valued at $100 billion.
<p>
Kerrigan said, "Corporations like Disney and Westinghouse are paying top dollar for networks, while the networks are looking for a handout from Uncle Sam.  They plead that only government gifts will save them from technical advances.  But, the facts are clear."
<p>
"On August 1st, Westinghouse Electric Company agreed to buy CBS for $5.4 billion.  In 1994 alone, CBS's total revenue amounted to $3.7 billion, and their profit was $426 million. Westinghouse showed a revenue of $8.8 billion with a profit of $619 million."
<p>
"On July 31, 1995 Disney announced its intent to purchase CapCities/ABC for $19 billion.  CapCities reported a profit in 1994 of $638 million, while Disney reported a profit of $1.1 billion."
<p>
"With profits like these, why is Congress giving the networks six new digital channels? As the television industry consolidates, does it really make sense for the U.S. government to enrich these companies further?"
<p>
Kerrigan and the CBC advocate auctioning the air waves, as the FCC did recently for wireless communications.  "Auctioning off the airwaves would foster competition, generate billion in revenues to reduce the deficit, and end an insidious form of corporate welfare," continued Kerrigan.

<B>Small Business Group Blasts Minimum Wage Hike Proposal</B><P>

<i>December 8, 1995</i>		</center>

<HR>
<P>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000 member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  declared their disgust today
with President Clinton's efforts to further derail current budget
negotiations, and hurt small businesses and lowskilled and young
workers as well, by proposing a minimum wage increase in his latest
budget proposal.
<P>
The President's proposal would raise the current $4.25 rate to
$4.70 on July 1, 1996 and to $5.15 on July 1, 1997.
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed:  &quot;The minimum wage
is not a budget issue and should not be included in budget proposals
and negotiations.  More important, however, is the fact that the
President is offering, once again, a proposal that will hurt small
businesses by raising their costs.  The President seems intent
on not only delaying the completion of the federal government
budget, but on damaging the budgetary well-being of many small
enterprises.&quot;
<P>
Kerrigan added, &quot;It is obvious that the President added the
minimum wage hike -- a critical objective of labor unions -- into
the budget plan.  It represents his big payoff to big labor. 
He desperately needs their reelection support next year.&quot;
<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added:  &quot;Increasing
the minimum wage makes no sense from an economics standpoint as
well.  Indeed, no selfrespecting economist would argue that a
minimum wage hike helps lowskilled, lowincome, young workers.
 In fact, study after study shows that these individuals are hurt
most by a minimum wage increase as their unemployment levels climb.&quot;
<P>
Keating continued, &quot;Work experience is crucial so that individuals
can gain marketable skills, learn the disciplines of the marketplace,
and advance in life.  Increasing the minimum wage denies these
experiences as young and lowskilled worker s are priced out of
the labor market. As government artificially boosts wages with
a minimum wage hike, employers seek out alternatives to hiring
young, lowskilled individuals.  The likelihood of falling prey
to the welfare state then naturally increases.
<P>
While a minimum wage increase might sound compassionate, in reality
it is another cruel blow by government leveled at the disadvantaged.&quot;
<P>
&quot;No one will gain from President Clinton's proposed increase
in the minimum wage,&quot; concludes Keating.  &quot;The budget
process will slow; small business costs will rise; and young and
lowskilled workers will suffer.&quot;

<title>Repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act</title>

<h3>Repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act</h3>
Testimony of Karen Kerrigan, President<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>

Before the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections <br>
Committee on 
Economic and Educational Opportunities <br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
February 15, 1995
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) a 40,000-member nonprofit, nonpartisan small business, grassroots advocacy organization SBSC is also a member of the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, a diverse coalition of national business associations, state and local governments and citizens groups who share the belief that the Davis-Bacon Act is long overdue for repeal.<p>

SBSC, as well as the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act thank you, Chairman Ballenger, and the Committee for your leadership in holding hearings on this most important issue. For years, hard-working small business owners and lower-income Americans searching for opportunities to jump on the economic ladder have been denied that access in the construction industry due to government-sponsored special interest protectionism. The Davis-Bacon Act fosters the most egregious of distortions, and we appreciate being a part of this forum today to discuss how to alleviate the economic and fiscal damage promoted by the Act, while giving more Americans -- especially within our inner-cities -- a greater chance to take that initial step on the economic ladder.<p>

Imagine for a moment, the following question on a national voter referendum, especially during the past campaign cycle:<p>

Should the United States Congress and President Clinton repeal a regulatory act that denies opportunity to lower-income workers; panders to special interests; claims racist origins; increases cost to taxpayers and the economy; and hurts small business?<p>

The answer, of course, would be a resounding "yes." The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 does all of the above, and therefore should be repealed.<p>

Passing the Davis-Bacon Act was wrong in 1931 , and keeping it as law is wrong today. New York Representative Robert L. Bacon and Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis introduced the bill, and President Herbert Hoover signed it -- limiting the benefits of competition, while pandering to organized labor and racism.<p>

By now, most politicians cannot claim ignorance of the racist origins of the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act. The law was introduced and passed to block wage
 competition from black construction workers following an Alabama contractor's successful bid on a federal construction project on New York's Long Island in 1927. The southern contractor employed black construction workers and successfully underbid the local union contractor.<p>

Congressional supporters of the legislation at the time eagerly supported the Act's racial leanings. A through the <i>Congressional Record</i> of 1931 makes this clear. For example, Rep. Clayton Allgood spoke of "cheap colored labor" that is in "competition with white labor throughout the country." Another DavisBacon supporter Rep. John J. Cochran of Missouri said: "I have received numerous cornplaints in recent months about southern contractors employing lowpaid colored mechanics getting work and bringing the employees from the south." Similar references were made by other lawmakers as well.<p>

Just as was the case in 1931, low income earners, especially inner-city minorities, continue to be hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act. Less-skilled, generally non-union workers are denied economic opportunity, as Davis-Bacon inflates wages beyond the point where it makes economic sense for contractors to employ such individuals. In particular, small businesses in inner-cities which are willing to provide critical experience to less-skilled workers are denied that opportunity due to government wage rates that do not reflect economic reality.<p>

The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that a "prevailing wage," usually the union rate, be paid on all federally-funded construction projects. Governmentdetermined "prevailing wages" often well exceed the actual prevailing wages in an area. Many small contractors cannot afford to pay these government-imposed higher wage rates, and are thus shut out of federally-funded 
construction projects.<p>

In an effort that even central planners in the former Soviet Union might have shied away from, the Department of Labor makes tens of thousands of wage determinations annually to guide Davis-Bacon contracts. The "prevailing wage" determination relies heavily on union collective bargaining agreements within a locality. Surveys are rarely conducted, and a "locality" can often mean an enormous geographic region. University of Chicago economist Yale Brozen found the "prevailing wage" for the Appalachian region of Western Pennsylvania set at the same level as Pittsburgh, a city known for its high concentration of union workers.<p>

 Inflated wage rates and rigid job classifications, along with complex and voluminous paperwork requirements demand that firms become less-efficient in order to compete
 for Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

The paperwork requirements associated with Davis-Bacon take a particularly heavy toll on small contractors. In 1934, the Copeland Act was passed, requiring employers on Davis-Bacon contracts to submit payroll records to the Department of Labor or the contracting agency on a <u>weeklv</u> basis. These weekly certified payroll reports alone cost employers on Davis-Bacon contracts in excess of $100 million per year. The Copeland Act requirement forces many contractors to hire additional clerical employees, invest in additional equipment, and/or alter their payroll schedules. The result: higher costs that discourage or exclude small contractors from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

As these higher costs exclude many small businesses from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts, costs to taxpayers are pushed even higher due to limited competition.<p>

Minority and women-owned businesses, which predominate among small construction firms, are especially hurt. This is seen most clearly in the innercities, where a large proportion of federal construction dollars is concentrated. In addition, large non-local construction firms that specialize in Davis-Bacon projects undercut small local contractors. Minority and independent contractors cannot compete, due to the inherent inefficiencies and regulatory burdens associated with Davis-Bacon.<p>

Part of the original intent of Davis-Bacon was to protect local workers from contractors outside the region. But the actual effect is often to protect outside union labor from competition from local, but non-union, workers. On Davis-Bacon projects you will often find out-of-town union journeymen performing work that could easily be done by local non-union workers.<p>

With small and minority contractors shut out from bidding on federal construction projects, minorities in the inner-cities are shut out from job opportunities as well. If contractors are forced to pay one "prevailing wage" they will always chose the already skilled worker, restricting availability for job opportunities. Often, many unemployed individuals are prevented from working on projects in their own neighborhood.<p>

 Wages are best determined in a competitive marketplace, not according to the unrealistic estimates from government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. The market allows wages and costs to adjust according to a host of criteria, including competition, skill levels and productivity, demand, supply, capital investment, et al. The Davis-Bacon Act's wage criteria distort the marketplace, artificially favoring large businesses over small, entrepreneurial firms; and higher-skilled and higher-paid workers over less-experienced, lower-skilled workers, regardless of job criteria.<p>

Lack of competition, increased paperwork, and inflated wages mean higher costs for taxpayers and the economy. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1994, if Davis-Bacon were repealed federal taxpayers would conservatively save $3.1 billion over the following five years. Allowing the use of helpers, or semi-skilled workers would save an additional $500 million a year, bringing total savings from repeal to nearly $6 billion over five years. The Davis-Bacon Act inflates the cost of federal construction by an average of 5 percent to 15 percent. And, the GAO and CBO estimates do not include the costs of foregone competition -- raising the total cost of Davis-Bacon even higher.<p>

Local officials have estimated that Davis-Bacon increased the cost of various community development projects by 20 percent to 50 percent. Also, an Oregon State University study estimated cost inflation on federally-funded construction contracts in rural areas of 26 percent to 38 percent due to the Davis-Bacon Act.<p>

From a fiscal accountability perspective, as well as a moral one, there remains no sound reason to hold onto this legislative relic from the past. At a time when American taxpayers are demanding less and more efficient government, nothing more fully symbolizes a wasteful, meddling Washington than the Davis-Bacon Act. Symbolically and substantively, Davis-Bacon represents the distorted outcome of special interest protectionism. And, most pathetically, its original intent of preventing those who wish to jump on the economic ladder continues to this day.<p>

From a small business perspective, Davis-Bacon makes it impossible for union-free, efficient contractors to bid on federally-funded construction projects. We urge all members of Congress to further unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in every corner of America by repealing the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act.<p>

Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today.<p>

<h3>REVIEWING <br>
the<br>
REVOLUTION<br>
Conservative Successes in the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress</h3><br><hr></center><br>
<table border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5><tr><td>
Conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and  presidential vetos, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.
<p>
	It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over." The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<title>   Testimony of Karen Kerrigan on Spectrum Allocation

<center><h3>Testimony of Karen Kerrigan<BR>
President<BR>
Small Business Survival Committee</h3>

<h4>Before
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation<BR>
United States Senate<BR>
September 12, 1995
<P>
On Spectrum Allocation</h4></center>
<hr>



Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,
<P>
I am here today representing the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 
member nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization which fights against the growing burden 
of taxes and regulations on America's small businesses and entrepreneurs -- SBSC supports free 
markets over government industrial policy.  SBSC also spearheads the Campaign for Broadcast 
Competition, a coalition of advocacy organizations opposing the proposed giveaway of the 
spectrum to the nation's broadcasters.   
<P>
I am especially pleased to be here today.  It is not often that one has the opportunity to 
publicly oppose what many have said will be the most expensive case of corporate welfare in the 
history of our Nation.
<P>
I am speaking, of course, about the proposed giveaway of the nation's airwaves to the 
broadcasting industry.  This is the expensive residue of a failed industrial policy, and it can, and 
should be reversed.
<P>
The story starts innocently enough with an "America first" technology program.  It turned 
into an unprecedented government giveaway of taxpayer-owned airwaves.  And, absent 
Congressional action, it will conclude by rewarding an industry which has time and again turned 
its back on its public service obligations.
<P>
As you know, Mr. Chairman, the Federal Communications Commission seven years ago 
pursued a plan to make High Definition Television (HDTV) the broadcasting standard for the 
United States.  As part of that plan, the FCC proposed giving the broadcasters new spectrum to 
allow them to move from analog television to HDTV.  Once HDTV was in place, the theory was, 
the analog spectrum would be returned to the government.<P>
<P>
As is often the case with bureaucrats playing venture capitalists, the market outsmarted 
and surpassed the government's chosen industrial "winner."  In this case, digital technology far 
outstripped the ability of bureaucrats to see into the future, rendering all of this planning for 
HDTV, for all intensive purposes, obsolete.
<P>
With the new digital technology each new digital TV channel can be used for one HDTV 
signal.  Or, it can be split into 6 very high quality digital TV signals.  (In other words  the 
spectrum gift combined with new digital technology now transforms CBS into 6 CBS's; ABC 
into 6 ABC's and so on).
<P>
This free new spectrum need not be used just for television; it will unlock an unlimited 
number of new lucrative businesses for the broadcasters.  The spectrum could be used to provide 
72 digital radio channels, computer data delivery, wireless telephone service, pay TV -- or any 
combination of each of them -- as well as other profitable uses.
<P>
In the face of the new technology, the broadcasters profess a continued commitment to
HDTV and the use of the new Advanced Television (ATV) channels for HDTV. 
<P>                                                                                                    
...Or maybe not.  This year the broadcasters have insisted on receiving the "flexibility" to 
use the spectrum as they see fit.   Broadcasters are actively exploring the opportunities for 
potential new services -- as they should be.  The questions today are:  why are the broadcasters 
the chosen few for the privilege of "spectrum flexibility," and why should they get it for free!
<P>
Now, as the broadcasters freely admit, HDTV is a technological and economic dinosaur.  
They don't want to be shackled to it, nor should they.  There is no market for it, and other digital 
technologies would use the airwaves far more efficiently.
<P>
The broadcasters correctly realize that new digital technology will transform communications as we know it.  And what they want is the valuable distribution pipeline -- the 
spectrum -- with no strings attached.  They clearly do not want it for the purpose for which it was 
intended -- providing HDTV.  They may want it to provide digital television.  But, no one really 
knows, since the technology is changing almost daily.
<P>
But while the broadcasters don't want to be held to the HDTV implementation, they still 
want the additional spectrum -- free of charge.  Why?  Because it is valuable.  If this spectrum 
were auctioned as the PCS spectrum was last year, it could raise between $10 billion and $100 
billion.
<P>
Even in Washington, that's a lot of money.  These market value estimates are not just 
random numbers picked out of  a hat.  Even the FCC conservatively estimates that the spectrum 
is worth between $11 billion and $70 billion.1  <P>In response to questions from the Senate, the FCC has attempted to calculate the potential value of the spectrum.  Within the past few weeks, ITT and Dow Jones paid a whopping $207 million to buy WNYC, New York City's local public UHF station.  The station has few hard assets, no programming appeal -- its new owners are going to switch to commercial programming, with a limited viewership . . . In short, the 26 companies who bid for WNYC wanted to pay big bucks for one thing, its spectrum.
<P>
Based solely on the $207 million paid for WNYC, the FCC valued the spectrum 
potentially at $37 billion.
<P>
"Even" at $37 billion, the figure is more than double the amount this committee needs to 
raise to reach its target in the massive effort to balance the federal budget.  And, the FCC says 
this a conservative estimate.  Some experts estimate that the market value of the digitized spectrum in the not too distant future will reach nearly a half-trillion dollars.
<P>
And the FCC doesn't disagree.2   In a May 5th letter, the FCC said that private market valuation of the spectrum in the future might approach $500 billion.<P>Why this special gift of largesse to the broadcasters?  The proposed giveaway not only flys in the face of efforts to balance the budget but also bucks a profound message that voters sent to Washington last November -- no more coddling of special interests at the expense of other Americans.<P>The giveaway to the broadcasters can't be a reward for the great job they've done serving 
the public good --  as they claim, and as required by their current licenses.  As everyone who has 
a TV knows, and as numerous Congressional hearings this year have shown, the broadcasters 
have done a good job at packing the airwaves with programming that the majority of American 
households find troubling and offensive.
<P>
One media reviewer said that the broadcasters' motto for the upcoming fall lineup must 
be:  "To hell with kids.  Many of the wholesome sitcoms that once ruled the 8:00-9:00 pm hour 
have gone to the graveyard, replaced by racier fair. . ."3<P>The news coverage is no better.  The president of NBC's News Division, Andrew Lack, admitted that "too often we now choose, without a moment's hesitation, to report the story that makes you fell repulsion over the story that makes you think -- which in television means usually boring."  Mr. Lack went on to ask his peers:  "And why do we keep pushing it?  Are we all just whores in search of another share point or a better November book?"4 <P>While the broadcasters hide behind their "unique public service" responsibilities as an argument to shield them from a prospective auction of the valuable spectrum; the public, media critiques and now industry insiders question their competency in this regard.<P>Of course, competition in the form of cable, direct broadcast satellite, on-line computer services and more has given consumers added viewing choices.  Broadcasters have not gone the wayside because of this competition.  Their bottom-lines and profits continue to increase.
<P>
The broadcasters plead that to pay for spectrum will kill "free" TV.  But the recent 
purchase prices and bids for the networks prove that investment money is available for those who 
want to have the privilege of providing "free" TV.  Walt Disney, which paid $19.3 billion for 
ABC/Cap Cities obviously sees investment pay-offs.  Westinghouse which offered $5.4 billion 
for CBS appears to view the business as profitable as well.
<P>
In the past year alone, the networks combined revenues were $21.42 billion.  Their 
combined profits were $2.82 billion.   Clearly, broadcasting is more profitable than ever.
<P>
Robert Wright, [president] of NBC, recently told the National Press Club that "right now 
broadcast television -- and NBC -- are both having banner years.  And even more important, the 
fundamentals of the industry are looking strong as well."  Congratulations Mr. Wright.  Keep up 
the good work.  Apparently advertising-supported TV is doing fine, and will continue to profit 
handsomely -- without a big government handout.
<P>
The FCC agrees with Mr. Wright:  over-the-air broadcasting is and will continue to 
thrive.5     In a September letter, the FCC pointed to the ABC, CBS and WNYC deals, and concluded that:  "free over-the-air television is such a lucrative business, there is no reason to believe that either analog or digital broadcasters will cease providing this service."<P>Finally, advertising-supported broadcasting will only go away if its viewership goes 
away.  If the audience is there, advertisers will continue to subsidize what the broadcasters 
modestly call "free" TV by paying for the right to reach viewers.
<P>
The broadcasters also claim that "they" shouldn't be singled our for auctions, and that the 
Commerce Committee should auction the government spectrum first.
<P>
However, as Faye Anderson one of my close colleagues has recently stated, comparing 
the broadcast spectrum to government spectrum is like comparing "pork loin to pig's feet."
<P>
According to Dale Hatfield, a noted spectrum expert and Reagan Administration 
technology official, this is the cleanest spectrum available.  It is beachfront property.  Mr. 
Chairman, to paraphrase Willie Sutton, if you are going to raise money through auctions, you 
must go where the value is.
<P>
More importantly, the broadcasters are not the only users who have been asked to pay for 
the public airwaves.  As the Committee well knows, Congress in 1993 mandated that the FCC  
auction all licenses for new spectrum.  For example, the FCC already has sold only a part of the 
PCS spectrum for $8 billion.  That's $8 billion that went to the US Treasury.
<P>
If they want to play, let's have them pay.  If it is good enough for PCS, it is good enough 
for all the new businesses the broadcasters hope to pursue.
<P>
Now, the broadcasters have two other arguments.  First, they argue that such a large 
auction of spectrum will depress values and thus won't raise much money.  Then, they argue that 
broadcasters couldn't possibly afford the spectrum, and thus couldn't provide digital television.  
Our question is, which one is it?
<P>
Either way, the public wins.  We tend to believe that there will be buyers for this 
spectrum.  The FCC agrees.  With all the possible benefits of digital broadcasting, the FCC 
expects that numerous companies, <u>including the broadcasters</U>, will compete for and likely win many digital licenses.6   In other words, somewhere between here and the auction block, the broadcasters will figure out ways to participate in the bidding process.
<P>
This, of course, begs the question:  is the government and the U.S. taxpayer responsible 
for guaranteeing NBC's long-term success, or any other broadcaster's?  I don't think so.
<P>
One last question:  under the current broadcaster proposal, the broadcasters will retain 
their analog signal for anywhere between 10 and 15 years, when digital TV becomes the 
standard.  What happens after 15 years and digital TV has only penetrated 80 percent of the 
market or 90 percent or even 95 percent?  Is Congress going to turn off the analog signal just like 
that?  Even if millions upon millions of their constituents are still watching analog televisions?  
In short, the broadcasters will continue to own their analog licenses for the foreseeable future and 
beyond, even while they get to exploit the myriad new digital technologies.  This is unfair no 
matter how you slice it.
<P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Commerce Committee, I realize that the broadcasters 
have been an extremely powerful lobby in Washington.  Given the upsurge in interest we have 
seen on this issue, I think that their political dominance, as with this deal, is largely a thing of the 
past.
<P>
What you have today is an opportunity  -- perhaps the last opportunity in the foreseeable 
future -- to encourage the development of an innovative, competitive, profitable broadcasting 
future, instead of tying the future to the history of the past fifty years.
<P>
You have the opportunity to raise tens of billions of dollars and in so doing demonstrate a 
careful stewardship of one of our nation's most valuable assets.
<P>
And you have the chance to encourage competition while destroying the most egregious 
of set-asides.
<P>
In his June speech, Mr. Wright spoke of the need to encourage change and competition in the communications marketplace.
<P>
Technological change is already upon us:  new digital technologies will soon allow the 
new spectrum to be used to transmit multiple digital TV signals; additional subscription services 
-- like HBO; newspapers; local news and data; computer/video games. . .the options are nearly 
endless.
<P>
The problem is that the broadcasters now ask that Congress give them a free ride in this 
technological carnival.  Mr. Wright recently estimated that this market generates $100 billion in 
annual revenues.7  And NBC and CBS and ABC and FOX and all the other broadcasters want in. . . the easy, cheap way.<P>Of course, they're already all already part way there.  NBC alone: owns two 24-hour cable 
networks, has interests in 19 other cable networks, has multiple international broadcasting 
properties; and has entered the new computer-media market with NBC Desktop Video, NBC 
Digital Publishing and NBC Data Network.

<P>
Clearly, the broadcasters are financially capable and market savvy enough to identify and exploit new markets.  They don't need the government's help.  They already control a majority of 
the TV market.  We don't need to give them a head start in the race to win the digital 
marketplace.
<P>
I look forward to discussing this issue with you and answering any questions you have.
<P>
Thank you.           <P>

Dear Senator:

I encourage you to act in favor of the self-employed and 
small business owners by embracing reform of the status of 
independent contractors. I urge you to support and 
co-sponsor H.R. 1972, the "Independent Contractor Tax 
Simplification Act," introduced by Congressman Jon 
Cristensen (R-NE). 

H.R. 1972 simplifies the tax relationship between the 
business and the independent contractor by defining who is 
not an employee. 

This bill outlines clear, distinct criteria for those 
seeking to perform services as an independent contractor. 
As you are probably aware, independent contractors and small
business owners are presently forced to comply with the 
infamous 20-factor test - an ambiguous tool of the IRS which
lures independent contractors into a spiral of unnecessary 
legalese and expense. 

Many entrepreneurs and small business owners do not have the
time or resources to fight the 20-factor test, some of these 
job producers are forced to close their doors. One recent 
estimate that the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent 
contractors and collected $678 million in fines and back 
taxes over the past several years. 

Clearly there is an institutional bias for the IRS to 
reclassify independent contractors as employees. It would 
be intolerable if Congress failed to pursue reform of the 
20-factor test. 

Small businesses and entrepreneurs, the largest job creators
of our economy, should not be forced to comply with an 
unending string of arbitrary and outdated IRS rules. The 
20-factor test is a prime example of bad tax policy. I 
strongly support Congressman Christensen's bill and I ask 
you to do the same. 

Sincerely,

<title>losing the drug war without a fight</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<img src="/empower/easmall.gif">
<p>
<center><h2>Losing the Drug War Without a Fight</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
During the past 15 years, American society experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.  But during this period, there was one area against which we made significant progress: drug use.  Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug-taking.<p>

The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural shift.  During the  late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun or as mere self-indulgence.  But beginning at the end of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use was all but impossible to deny, it became Increasingly -- and far more accurately -- seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.<p>

Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.  Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies.  As a result, overall drug use went down.  From the late 1970s to the early lS90s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by almost one half.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost 80%. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.<p>

But earlier this year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.  Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise.  Survey results for 1993 indicate a sharp increase in marijuana use for eighth- 10th- and 12th-grade students, as well as an increase in the use of stimulants, ISD and Inhalants.  And hospitals reported a record number of drug-related emergency-room visits in 1992, suggesting that heavy drug use is also on the rise.<p>

These findings should have mobilized the federal government to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens.  Instead, the Clinton administration has said little to encourage those fighting the good fight and has proposed fundamentally misguided policies.  Consider the record:<p>
<ul>
<li>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80%. 

<li>Soon after assuming office, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and related federal crimes.  Her focus? She is engaged in a never-ending search for the "root causes" of crime and drug use.

<li>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other federal agencies.

<li>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100 drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment strategy that will do little to target hard-core users.
</ul>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy. The Clinton administration suffers from moral torpor on the  issue.  Policy follows attitude.<p>

In 1991, when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never "broken any drug law."  A year later, he admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented with marijuana but "I didn't like it.  I didn't Inhale it, and never tried it again."  Later, when asked whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he answered, to laughter: "Sure, if I could.  I tried before."<p>

And then there is Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, the administration's loudest voice on drugs.  While President Clinton dissociated himself once from Dr. Elders's favorable words about drug legalization, she has continued to make such statements --and the president has done nothing effective to stop her.<p>

These statements are significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals they send.  One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic to occur in the first place was the collapse of institutional authority.  Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who early on served as President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that "cocaine is probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use."<p>

Government officials, through legislation and public discourse, can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts.  In a free society, few things matter more than speaking about- the right things in the right way -- and making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.<p>

During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her "Just Say No" campaign.  But it turns out that "Just Say No" is far more effective than "I didn't inhale."<p>

Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first 14 months of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations.  But today, on one of the Issues that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many of the children of the poor -- he and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  One would think that a little more concern and serious thought would come from a president who claims to "feel the pain" of those who suffer.<p>

<I>[Mr. Bennett, a co-director of Empower America, was President Bush's director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.]<I>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>New technologies will continue to be powerful agents of growth
and progress in the next century, opening up traditional fields to a surge
of entrepreneurial activity that can help revive our culture and economy.<BR>
<BR>
Led by Senior Fellow <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, the program
examines how new technologies are transforming business, education, government,
and society. Among other issues the program explores government telecommunications
policy and the role of technology in reforming institutions such as the
legal profession. Other Discovery Fellows working in the program include
Frank Gregorsky, <A HREF="gidari.html">Albert Gidari</A>, <A HREF="katz.html">Roberta
Katz</A>, <A HREF="brownleebio.html">Lisa Brownlee</A>, and Adjunct Fellow
<A HREF="perelman.html">Lewis Perelman</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Properly enabled, new technology is a still unimagined boon. In books such
as <I><A HREF="books.html">MICROCOSM</A>, <A HREF="schlsout.html">SCHOOL'S
OUT</A>, <A HREF="life-tv.html">LIFE AFTER TELEVISION</A></I>, and, soon,
<I>TELECOSM</I>, Gilder and other Discovery Fellows are defining the issues,
as well as the opportunities, arising in this increasingly influential field.

</H4>
<B>George Gilder is a Senior Fellow at Discovery Institute</B> where he
directs Discovery's program on <A HREF="hightech.html">high technology and
public policy</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Born in 1939 in New York City, Mr. Gilder attended Exeter Academy and Harvard
University. At Harvard he studied under Henry Kissinger and helped found
Advance, a journal of political thought, which he edited and helped to re-establish
in Washington, D.C. after his graduation in 1962. During this period he
co-authored (with Bruce Chapman) a political history, <I>The Party That
Lost its Head.</I> He later returned to Harvard as a fellow at the Kennedy
Institute of Politics and editor of the Ripon Forum. In the 1960's Mr. Gilder
also served a speech writer for several prominent officials and candidates,
including Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Richard Nixon. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1970's, as an independent researcher and writer, Mr. Gilder began
an excursion into the causes of poverty, which resulted in his books <I>Men
and Marriage</I> (original version, 1972) and <I>Visible Man </I>(1978);
and, hence, of wealth, which led to <B><I>his bestselling Wealth and Poverty
</I></B>(1981). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mr. Gilder pioneered the formulation of supply-side economics</B> when
he served as Chairman of the Lehrman Institute's Economics Roundtable, as
Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a frequent contributor
to A.B. Laffer's economic reports and the editorial page of the <I>Wall
Street Journal</I>. In the 1980's he also consulted leaders of America's
high technology businesses. <B>According to a recent study of speeches,
Mr. Gilder was President Reagan's most frequently quoted living author.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The investigation into wealth creation led Mr. Gilder into deeper examination
of the lives of present-day entrepreneurs, culminating in many articles
and a book, <I>The Spirit of Enterprise </I>(1986). The book was recently
revised and expanded for publication in 1992. That many of the most interesting
current entrepreneurs were to be found in high technology fields also led
Mr. Gilder, over several years, to examine these fields in depth. In his
bestselling work, <I>Microcosm</I> (1989), he explored the quantum roots
of the new electronic technologies. A subsequent best selling book, <I>Life
After Television</I>, published first as a Whittle Communications monograph
and then republished by W.W. Norton (1992), is a prophecy of the future
of computers and telecommunications. <B><I>Life After Television</I> was
recently updated and a new forward included when it was republished in 1994</B>.
This book, in turn, is a prelude to his forthcoming book on the future of
telecommunications, <I>Telecosm</I> (expected in early 1996). <BR>
<BR>
<B>In 1986, President Reagan gave George Gilder the White House Award for
Entrepreneurial Excellence</B>. Mr. Gilder participates in national and
international conferences and is<A HREF="ggindex.html"> a contributing editor
of Forbes ASAP, and a writer of articles on high technology for Forbes magazine</A>
and other journals and newspapers. In addition, he is often requested to
testify before the U.S. Senate and U.S. House on various telecommunications
issues. <BR>
<BR>
He operates jointly from the Seattle headquarters of Discovery Institute
and his home at Tyringham, Massachusetts, in the Berkshire Mountains where
he is an active churchman, sometime runner, and, with his wife, Nini, parent
of four children. <BR>

Perelman is the author of the best-selling book <I>School's Out</I> (William
Morrow &amp; Co., 1992; Avon Books, 1993) a study of restructuring education
and training sponsored by twelve U.S. corporations and foundations. He has
produced several other publications on training and education, including
the widely discussed Briefing Papers, <I>&quot;Closing Education's Technology
Gap&quot;</I> (November 1989) and <I>The Acanemia' Deception</I> (April
1990). His report for Hudson Institute's Workforce 2000 project, <I>The
American Learning Enterprise in Transition</I>, was published by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (1990). <BR>
<BR>
Perelman coined the phrase <B>The Learning Enterprise</B> to describe the
total universe of education and training in a report with that title published
by the Council of State Planning Agencies in 1985. And his study for the
Western Governors' Association, Human Capital Investment for State Economic
Development (1989), was the first attempt to chart the entire &quot;portfolio&quot;
of a state's many investments in human resource development. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's work in education, training, technology, and economic policy
has been widely discussed in the national press, cited in legislative testimony,
and used in university courses. He has made speeches and presentations of
his work before numerous audiences throughout the United States and in Europe
and Pacific Asia, both live and on radio and television broadcasts. He also
has testified before Congressional, state, and local legislative committees
as well as executive boards and commissions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Currently an adjunct fellow of the Discovery Institute, from 1981 to 1983
Perelman was a director in the corporate planning department of Holiday
Corp. in Memphis. From 1979 to 1981, he was a senior scientist in the Social
Systems Group at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In 1980 he was a visiting
scientist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Previously
he held positions at the federal Solar Energy Research Institute, and at
the Colorado Highway Department. He taught physics and mathematics in public
schools in New York and California, and has taught graduate courses at the
Harvard Graduate School of Education and the George Mason University School
of Business Administration. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's first book, <I>The Global Mind</I> (Mason/Charter, 1976), was
cited one of the year's best scientific-technical books by the Library Journal.
Perelman's writing has appeared in such major publications as <I>Business
Week, Forbes ASAP, WIRED, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The
Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, Success, Insight, </I>and
the <I>French magazine ACTUEL, a</I>s well as professional journals such
as <I>TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, New Management, Strategic
Planning Management, Planning Review, Human Capital, and Ethics</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman earned his doctorate in administration, planning, and social policy
at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He graduated cum laude with
a B.S. in mathematics from the City College of New York, where he was elected
to Phi Beta Kappa. He did graduate study in space and atmospheric physics
and applied mathematics at the Goddard Institute and at the Harvard Division
of Engineering and Applied Physics. Perelman resides and works in Washington,
DC. <BR>

<I>December, 1996</I><BR>
<h2>Coporate Philanthropy: A Reexamination</h2>
<hr>

<I>Corporations and corporate foundations gave an estimated $6.11 billion to nonprofit organizations in 1994. 
 This represented 4.7 percent of total charitable giving ($129.88 billion).  Of this $6.11 billion, the 
largest corporations gave at least $35.78 million to public-affairs organizationsgroups that seek to influence 
public policy in such areas as the environment, taxes, and regulation.
<P>While $35.78 million is a relatively minor amount, public-affairs groups operating with small budgets 
have successfully lobbied government to reallocate billions of dollars in private-sector resources.  This is a 
central contention of Capital Research Center's 
</I>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy<I>, an annual study of 
corporate public-affairs giving.  CRC research associate 
<B>Austin Fulk</B> summarizes findings from this year's 
tenth anniversary edition, which examines corporate giving in 1994.
<P>This issue also features an essay on corporate giving by 
<B>William E. Simon</B>, a CRC trustee and president 
of the John M. Olin Foundation who served as Secretary of the Treasury to Presidents Nixon and Ford.
<P>Six observers of corporate philanthropy respond: 
<B>Kristen A. Avansino</B>, President of the E.L. 
Wiegand Foundation; <B>Albert Dunlap</B>, Chairman of Sunbeam Corporation; economist 
<B>Milton Friedman</B>; <B>Heather R. Higgins</B>, Director of the Randolph Foundation; 
<B>Henry Manne</B>, Professor of Law at George Mason 
University; and <B>Dorothy S. Ridings</B>, President of the Council on Foundations.
<P>Finally, CRC Visiting Fellow <B>Martin Morse 
Wooster</B> reviews <B>John Hood</B>'s new book, 
</I>The Heroic Enterprise: Business and the Common Good<BR>
<B>Taking Philanthropy Seriously:
<P>Giving as Though Our Future
<P>Depended on It
<P>by William E. Simon</B>
<P>
<P>It is a sad commentary, but I see many American 
business leaders financing the destruction of freedom.  They 
have been doing so for decades.  I don't mean that they 
give enormous amounts of money to political candidates 
who regularly vote against the interests of a competitive 
free economy (they do, but that is another matter).
<P>I am referring to their support of nonprofit 
organizations that are controlled by what Irving Kristol has called 
the &quot;new class.&quot;  This elite, hostile to the fundamental 
principles of our society, happily devours the fruits of 
capitalism while working to poison the tree that bears them.

<B>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy,
<P>Tenth Edition:
<P>Funding the Clinton Agenda
<P>by Austin Fulk</B>
<P>
<P>1994 marked a pivotal point in the history of 
American politics.  After two years of the Clinton presidency and 
forty years of Democratic control of the House of 
Representatives, voters turned out to elect Republican majorities 
in both Houses of Congress.
<P>Anger at Clinton Administration plans to expand the 
size of government fueled voter upheaval: a failed attempt 
to nationalize the health-care system, tax increases despite 
a Clinton campaign promise for &quot;middle-class tax cuts,&quot; 
and continued assaults on private property rights 
alienated many voters and led to the Democrats' reversal of fortune.

be viewed as &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;socially responsible,&quot; no matter to what asinine end 
this leads them.  They are in mortal terror of being 
branded &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;rapacious&quot; or &quot;insensitive&quot; or 
&quot;exploiters&quot; and of losing their seats at the annual dinners 
of organizations dedicated to their destruction.
<P>
<P><B>The Entrepreneurial Spirit</B>
<P>This was not the attitude of the great entrepreneurs 
who built American enterprise.  Andrew Carnegie did not 
yearn to be the guest of honor at a dinner of the Industrial 
Workers of the World.  He had faith in the system of 
private enterprise and worked to produce, as cheaply as 
possible, the steel to build the railroads, bridges, and skyscrapers 
of a rising America.
<P>John D. Rockefeller wanted to make transportat<BR>
&quot;Business leaders . . . have provided much of the driving energy of 
the anti-capitalist movement today.  They have done it not only by avoiding 
the struggle, but, worse yet, by financing their opponents.&quot;<BR>
ion and illumination available to every family.  Henry Ford 
wanted to give millions of Americans a chance at low-cost 
transportation.  Jim Hill envisioned a northern empire across 
the great plains, built a great railroad without 
government subsidies, and brought settlers to produce wheat 
for America's bread.
<P>These were tough-minded men, and some of the 
things they did invited legitimate criticism; but they never 
wavered in their faith that freedom of enterprise would 
build a great and powerful and prosperous America.
<P>By contrast, a distressing number of today's 
non-owning managers of industry act like bureaucrats in 
three-piece suits whose goal is to get along without making waves.  
If Carnegie had had that mentality, he would have retired 
as the chief telegrapher of the Pennsylvania Railroad, 
and somebody elseI hopewould have forged the rails 
to cross our prairies and made the steel plate for our 
Great White Fleet.
<P>Business leaders who lack commitment to the virtues 
of our system are almost as guilty as those whose goal is 
to destroy that system.  They urge business to keep a 
&quot;low profile&quot; and scoff at the free-market ideal as an 
obsolete notion in this modern age.  They have an obsession 
with being accepted and toasted by the most vocal of 
their <BR>
<B>Fueling the War on Freedom</B>
<P>The keenest and most prophetic analysis of this 
problem was offered half a century ago by Joseph Schumpeter in 
his landmark work <I>Capitalism, Socialism, and 
Democracy</I>.  It was he who first pointed out that capitalism, by its 
very success in raising the standard of living to 
unprecedented heights, would weaken the institutions necessary for 
its survival, giving way to a centralized socialist 
bureaucracy that would exploit the productive capacity created by 
private enterprise.
<P>Schumpeter gloomily concluded that the leaders of 
capitalism would likely absorb the slogans of radicalism and 
let themselves be converted &quot;to a creed hostile to [their] 
very existence&quot; because they were &quot;rapidly losing faith in 
[their] own creed.&quot;  &quot;This is verified,&quot; he wrote, &quot;by the 
characteristic manner in which particular capitalist interests 
and bourgeoisie as a whole behave when facing direct attack. 
 They talk and plead or hire people to do it for them.  
They snatch at every chance of compromise.  They are ever 
ready to give in.  They never put up a fight under the flag of 
their own ideals and their interests.&quot;
<P>There are, in my view, several different reasons 
why business leaders act this way.  One is simply lack 
of awareness.  They are too busy running their businesses 
to know what is going on in the intellectual world about 
them, unless their companies are specifically attacked.  
Such ignorance can well be economically fatal.
<P>Others, while perhaps aware of the drumbeat of 
attacks on capitalism, are simply unable to understand why 
those attacks are invalid.  Perhaps it sounds reasonable to them 
to believe that capitalism is some kind of scourge and 
affliction which has beset much of the world while ignoring 
the fact that people in non-Western countries yearn for 
the same chance at freedom and prosperity.
<P>Some may be aware of the merits of our system but 
have no inkling of how to fight back.  After all, they are 
in business, not in battles over public opinion, and they 
are usually less confident with the written word than is 
the intellectual class from which the attack springs.  So 
they flee the field of battle.
<P>Still others simply may not want to get involved.  
They simply assume that, somehow, the system of which they 
are a part will survive the attacks of its enemies without 
their participation.  Only when the attack hits home do they 
wake upand then it may be too late.  Edmund Burke's 
famous maxim is particularly apt: &quot;All that is necessary for 
the forces of evil to win in the world is for good men to 
do nothing.&quot;
<P>The worst are those who yield before the assaults of 
their enemies.  They long to 
<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 3 -->

critics.
<P>Two decades ago, at the American Enterprise 
Institute, Robert Bork observed that &quot;These are the people thought 
of by the general public and by critics of the corporate 
system as bold, rapacious, cunning leaders, the Machiavellis of 
our society.&quot;  In reality, however, &quot;one finds many of them to 
be docile, apprehensive, defensive, and unsure of how 
to respond to sharp unrelenting attacks. . . .  It is as though 
a large fraction of the [business] community . . . wants 
to make preemptive concessions, as if they meet not to plan 
a fight against a wrongheaded movement but to discuss 
how best to negotiate the terms of surrender.&quot;
<P>Bork went on to concludeand it is a conclusion I 
very much sharethat business can never regain its moral 
legitimacy until business leaders can convince the rest of 
the country that they believe in that legitimacy themselves. 
 Their defensive posture &quot;will earn only the contempt of 
the enemies of corporations and capitalism, while leading 
the large, relatively indifferent majority to suppose that 
the <BR>
&quot;Every corporation should spend every dollar of every contribution 
with the same care it devotes to employee pay and new equipment.  
Decisions about corporate contributions should be made on the same level, and 
by many of the same people, as decisions about corporate strategy 
and investment.&quot;<BR>
essage.
<P>A second step is for business leaders themselves to 
play an active role on the boards of foundations that 
their businesses have made possible.  The most fatal of errors 
is for men and women who have proven themselves in 
the profit-making sector to accept a foundation board seat 
and then sit back while professional foundation managers 
tell them the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.
<P>There are many able and conscientious foundation 
executives like Michael Joyce of the Bradley Foundation 
and Jim Piereson of Olin; but for every Joyce and 
Piereson, there seem to be dozens who practice the foundation 
equivalent of &quot;pack journalism&quot;managers who, with aims 
far different from those of their foundations' creators, make 
a career of trying to awe their directors with their 
superior wisdom and grander vision of the &quot;public interest.&quot;  
These people are very good at manipulating words and symbols 
so that the business director or trustee feels almost ashamed 
to <BR>
critics must be right: if capitalism were a positive good 
and worth defending, business leaders would not be so ready 
to compromise and, if need be, to capitulate.&quot;
<P>Alas, it is these same business leaders who have 
provided much of the driving energy of the anti-capitalist 
movement today.  They have done it not only by avoiding the 
struggle, but, worse yet, by financing their opponents.
<P>In 1995, American corporations gave out more than 
$7 billion in charitable contributions, much of it for 
very worthwhile charities like hospitals, the Red Cross, 
and religious institutions; but millions upon millions of 
dollars also are handed out to politically activist nonprofit 
organizations.  This money is lavished on groups whose 
actions show them to be contemptuous of democratic 
capitalism and enthusiastic about the squalor of collectivism.
<P>In 1977, the late Henry Ford II, grandson of the man 
who pioneered the low-cost car and the $5 daily wage, 
resigned from the board of the Ford Foundation, writing that 
&quot;The Foundation is a creature of capitalism&quot; but that &quot;it is 
hard to discern recognition of this fact in anything the 
Foundation does.  It is even more difficult to find an 
understanding of this in many of the institutions, particularly the 
universities, that are the beneficiaries of the Foundation's 
grant programs.&quot;  He urged his fellow trustees to &quot;examine 
the question of our obligations to our economic system and 
to consider how the foundation, as one of the system's 
most prominent offspring, might act most wisely to 
strengthen and improve its progenitor.&quot;  Asked why this had 
happened, he replied, &quot;I tried for thirty years to change it from 
within, to no avail.&quot;
<P>This is an all too familiar pattern in our largest 
foundations and corporations.  What a tragedy it would be 
if capitalism should prove to be the engine of its own 
destruction through its mindless support of those who would 
tear it down.
<P>
<P><B>What Can Be Done?</B>
<P>Fortunately, much can be done.  The first step is 
to awaken business leaders to the nature and magnitude of 
the threat and stiffen their backbones for the battle.
<P>There are many ways to do this, but there is no 
substitute for the determined leadership of those who are respected 
in the world of business.  My model here is the late John 
M. Olin, whose foundation I have the honor to head.  John 
Olin built a great industrial enterprise but never lost sight of 
the fundamentals of a free society.  When he endowed a 
foundation, he made it clear that its mission was to preserve 
our freedoms and strengthen our resolve in the unending 
battle we face.  When he spoke to businessmen, he 
unhesitatingly came down hard on the vital importance of preserving 
this system.  Others must come forward to repeat that m<BR>

question the destination and use of grant money.
<P>Foundation trustees must, in a sense, become 
philosophical detectives, cutting through jargon and rhetoric to 
understand what is really being proposed.  Business 
people, whether they serve on foundation boards and 
corporate contributions committees or make contributions on 
their own, must take their obligations seriously.  They must 
learn to be as careful in their contributions as they are in 
their personal investments.
<P>Third, those of us who believe in the great principles 
of liberty upon which our society was founded must take 
pains to see that corporate and foundation gifts are directed to 
the support of institutions and individuals who are working 
to maintain freedom.  When I was Treasury Secretary, 
I offered this thought in a speech to corporate public 
affairs officers: Counsel your principals not to support 
organizations whose aim is to destroy our freedoms.  Unless 
corporations and business leaders steer their corporate gifts 
to institutions that are helping to maintain freedom, the 
largesse of the free enterprise system will continue to 
finance its own destruction.
<P>
<P><B>A Reaffirmation</B>
<P>The task of business is to ensure that voices are 
raised effectively from philanthropic institutions to support a 
free society.  The American people will always choose 
freedom once they understand the implications of the 
collectivist alternatives.
<P>Capitalism has no duty to subsidize its enemies.  It 
does have a duty to support the efforts of those individuals 
and institutions which cherish our freedoms and the values 
of Western civilization.  Every corporation should 
spend every dollar of every contribution with the same care 
it devotes to employee pay and new equipment.  
Decisions about corporate contributions should be made on the 
same level, and by many of the same people, as decisions 
about corporate strategy and investment.
<P>Corporations and foundations ought to apply 
zero-based budgeting to their contributions.  Instead of having 
an assistant treasurer just write the annual check, 
business leaders should look closely to see whether their 
donations are still serving a useful purpose or whether they could 
be put to better use elsewhere.
<P>Years ago, Joseph Schumpeter was asked whether 
his gloomy analysis of the impending decline of capitalism 
was defeatist.  He replied with some indignation, &quot;the 
report that a given ship is sinking is not defeatist, only the spirit 
in which this report is received can be defeatist.  The crew 
can sit down and drink.  But it can also rush to the pumps.&quot;<BR>

<P>President and Executive Director
<P>The E.L. Wiegand Foundation</B>
<P>
<P>The business of nonprofits is the business of 
for-profits plus altruism.  More than ever, responsible giving 
and responsible disbursement are the bywords of 
exemplary philanthropy.  But today's philanthropic climate also 
demands that we repeat two caveats: Henry Ward 
Beecher warned donors, &quot;Do not give, as many rich men do, like 
a hen that lays an egg, and then cackles.&quot;  William Simon 
has warned trustees, &quot;Do not accept a foundation board seat 
and then sit back.&quot;
<P>Avansino: &quot;While a grant proposal may pull at a trustee's heartstrings,
<P>a sound business assessment is mandatory.&quot;<BR>
Management expert Peter Drucker reminds us that 
&quot;leadership is a foul-weather job.&quot;  The trustee who 
exercises real leadership must have a discerning mind and heart. 
 Every decision, however minuscule, embodies a 
fiduciary responsibility that transcends business as usual.  The 
trustee must understand the foundation's mission and have a 
profound respect for the donor whose wealth created 
the foundation.
<P>The trustee should assure that the financial 
mandates inherent in the for-profit world are also brought to bear 
on the foundation.  Questions regarding the foundation's 
fiscal health, management practices, efficiency, and 
effectiveness should be addressed, as should the &quot;buzzwords&quot; of 
the '90sduplication of services and accountability.  In 
short, while a grant proposal may pull at the trustee's 
heartstrings, a sound business assessment is mandatory.
<P>In the end, the business of nonprofit grant review 
should resemble business itself.  Philanthropy, the cornerstone 
of a civil society, demands no less.

<P>Business is not a social experiment.  Far too 
many business leaders lose sight of what should be the goal 
of corporations in a capitalistic environmentlong-term 
profit optimization.  This objective creates and promotes 
the 
<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 5 -->

competitiveness which is essential for America to 
prosper in a global economy.
<P>One of the major underlying problems with 
corporate philanthropy is that most executives are self-serving 
and shortsighted.  Their actions, however, have long-term 
consequences for which they either do not care or do 
not understand.  They thirst for acceptance and 
recognition from the &quot;elite&quot; and fear criticism from the public.  
In today's environment, where the press is quick to attack 
and even sensationalize controversial views and decisions, 
most business leaders politicize their actions to avoid such 
criticism.
<P>If capitalism is to be protected and American business 
is to thrive, business leaders must be educated as to 
the completeness of their actions and their long-term effect 
on free enterprise.  They must then have the conviction to 
make decisions for the good of the whole, even if those 
who benefit resist due to their ignorance.  The price of 
leadership is criticism.
<P>
<P><B>Dr. Milton Friedman
<P>Senior Research Fellow
<P>Hoover Institution</B>
<P>
<P>As William Simon stresses, the social function of 
a business corporation is to produce goods and services 
that customers wish to buy, and to do so at the lowest 
possible cost.  Its function is not to serve as a philanthropic 
or charitable organization.  The only justification for 
philanthropy is tax avoidance: under present law, 
contributions up to a specified fraction of income are deductible 
in calculating income subject to tax, whereas dividend 
payments are not.  Accordingly, a one dollar reduction 
in dividends enables corporations to make a contribution 
of more than one dollar at the same cost.
<P>Friedman: &quot;I see little reason to expect the business community 
to change its current suicidal behavior with respect to philanthropy.&quot;<BR>
lative and rights can be created and changed.  
Importantly, too, since men are naturally good, evil can't 
come from them but rather wholly from the effects of evil 
social forces (e.g., poverty, capitalism, racism, and sexism).  
These forces must be countered by massive changes to 
society, essentially through the instrument of government.
<P>As a culture, we have largely succumbed to this 
second <BR>
The individual stockholder benefits if and only if 
the contributions are to causes or organizations that he or 
she wishes to support.  Except for closely held 
corporations with few stockholders, the way to assure that outcome 
is one Warren Buffet adopted many years ago for 
Berkshire-Hathaway.  Dividend checks to stockholders are 
accompanied by a statement along the following lines: &quot;In 
addition to paying a dividend, Berkshire-Hathaway will 
contribute X dollars per share of stock to charitable causes.  
Please return the enclosed form telling us whom you would 
like your share of those contributions to be given.&quot;
<P>Unfortunately, few corporations have followed that 
excellent example.  Short of their doing so or of tax 
changes that either permit the deductibility of dividends in 
calculating corporate taxes or deny the deductibility of 
charitable contributions, I see little reason to expect the 
business community to change its current suicidal behavior 
with respect to philanthropy.

<P>
<P>From earliest childhood, I recall my frustrated 
father commenting in disgust that when it came to philanthropy 
or serving on boards, &quot;Businessmen park their brains at 
the door.&quot;  Sadly, experience repeatedly bears out this 
observation.
<P>Simon is correct in his analysis of the various factors 
that influence this behavior: preoccupation, ignorance, 
timidity, naivet&eacute;, and shallowness.  I would go even 
further, however, and argue that behind these characteristics lie 
a vast philosophical change which has affected most 
Americans, not just business leaders: a complete reorientation 
in the basic assumptions of who we are and how we relate 
to the world around us.
<P>The classical view, held even by deists, was that we 
were creatures of Goda relationship that had vast 
implications for our understandings of right and wrong, and for the 
role of government.  In such a world view, man is neither 
good nor bad but capable of choosing either.  As defined by 
God or natural law, there is both truth and a baseline for 
good that exist outside of man.  And there are basic rights, 
which also exist outside of man and delimit the capacity of 
others to encroach upon him while creating obligations 
toward others.
<P>In contrast, the modern view holds that man himself 
is good and therefore the arbiter of the good.  Since each 
can define his own understanding of what is right, truth

 giving.  Thus, we often find that corporations and foundations based 
on business wealth regularly support a left-wing 
intellectual and social agenda.  This activity must be the 
philanthropic counterpart to the Edsel.
<P>But as Mr. Simon makes very clear, there are some 
very good products available to both corporate and 
foundation officials interested in free markets, smaller 
government, individual freedom, and private property.  It would 
certainly be worth more of these officials' time to 
inform themselvesand avail themselvesof these 
&quot;purchase&quot; opportunities.

<P>
<P>William Simon makes a strong case for his 
argument about what he perceives as wrongheaded corporate 
philanthropy.  But he uses an overly broad brush in painting 
a picture of business leaders whose charitable giving 
does not meet his standards.  In my view, it does not help 
Mr. Simon advance his cause unless he's satisfied with 
simply &quot;preaching to the converted.&quot;
<P>I am disheartened, in fact, by the tone he employs to 
make his case.  Thoughtful people who do not already hold 
his views surely are turned off by language asserting that 
they are &quot;financing the destruction of freedom&quot; with their 
gifts to unnamed organizations that &quot;happily [devour] the 
fruits of capitalism while <BR>

expenditures to 'purchase' a desired product or service.&quot;<BR>
working to poison the tree that bears them.&quot;  Colorful language, smacking of an evil plot.  
Such demonization does not advance his argument.
<P>The central strength of organized philanthropy in 
this country has always been in its diversity.  Deliberation, 
even strong debate, should be encouraged among those 
with differing views on the ramifications of that diversity.  
But characterization that leads to rigid polarization does 
not foster rational conclusions.  Nor does it change 
many minds.<BR>
view, and until we change that understanding, it is 
unlikely that the majority of businessmen will have either the 
intestinal fortitude or the intellectual ammunition to 
understand and defend the foundations of our society.
<P>One final point: I wholeheartedly endorse Simon's 
recommended solutions.  To them I would add the 
observation that because John M. Olin was a keen student of 
human nature and of the long-term problems of bad systems, he 
set up his foundation with a life limited to the likely lifespan 
of the handpicked individual he most trusted, William Simon. 
 While there are various ways to limit perpetuities, I 
would encourage us to look to the sunsetting of foundations as 
a valuable tool in the reform and strengthening of 
philanthropy.

<P>School of Law</B>
<P>
<P>Among the first articles I ever published, over 40 
years ago, was a criticism of the doctrine of corporation law 
that allowed corporations to engage in philanthropic activities. 
 Over the next 20 years I came to see that my position, 
while theoretically correct, was impractical and unworkable. 
 While I still believe, as an old American case had it, 
that &quot;charity <I>qua</I> charity has no seat at the board of 
directors,&quot; this is a long way from approving a rule that would 
allow courts to examine the deepest motives and intentions 
of corporate officials.
<P>Very little of what we term corporate philanthropy 
today is done with the sense of anonymous altruism that 
would have satisfied Maimonides.  Rather, consciously or 
unconsciously,  corporate officials recognize that it is 
good business, and I would never allow judges to interfere 
with straightforward business judgments, no matter what 
they are called.
<P>But since my justification for allowing corporate 
charities is ultimately a profit-oriented one, I would 
strongly endorse William Simon's clarion call for use of 
normal business intelligence in making these contributions.  
In fact, I would even urge corporate and foundation 
officials to go one step further and to view these expenditures not 
as &quot;contributions&quot; or &quot;philanthropy&quot; at all.  Rather, 
they should be seen as normal expenditures to &quot;purchase&quot; 
a desired product or service.
<P>The words &quot;charity&quot; and &quot;philanthropy&quot; have today 
been so confounded by liberals to cover only their own set 
of desired goals that it has become difficult for busy

<B>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy</B>
<P><I>(continued from page 1)</I><BR>
During the ensuing years the ratio rose steadily, reaching $3.42 in 1992.  In 
the first year after President Clinton's election, corporate 
giving to left-of-center advocacy groups spiked at $4.07. 
 Corporate contributions to advocacy groups favored by 
the Administration, such as the Children's Defense Fund 
and Planned Parenthood, were particularly pronounced.
<P>
<P><B>Ratings System</B>
<P>As in previous years, we have divided grant recipients  
of corporate philanthropy into the following categories:
<P>n<I>Change-Oriented Right</I> (ratings of 8 and 7).  
These are conservative groups such as the Heritage 
Foundation and Capital Research Center, and libertarian or 
market-liberal groups such as the Cato Institute and Reason 
Foundation.  These organizations promote policy reforms 
that encourage private-sector alternatives to government 
programs, urge tax cuts, call for reduced regulatory burdens 
on businesses, and promote individual freedom and 
responsibility.  These groups received $3.01 million in 
1994a little over eight percent of corporate public-affairs giving.
<P>n<I>Establishment Right</I> (ratings of 6).  
Organizations such as the American Enterprise Institute and the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce generally favor free-market 
policies.  But they also allow for more government 
regulation and are skeptical of radical and systemic changes in 
public policy.  They received $4.85 million, or 13.5 percent 
of corporate public-policy giving, in 1994.
<P>n<I>Centrist</I> (rating of 5).  Think-tanks like the 
Rand Corporation and the Center for Governmental 
Research generally support &quot;good government&quot; reforms.  They 
tend to study specific policy issues and avoid taking 
philosophical or broadly political positions on controversial matters. 
 They received 2.71 percent of corporate public 
affairs giving in 1994the smallest percentage going to 
advocacy.
<P>n<I>Establishment Left</I> (ratings of 4 and 3).  
These groups favor government action to solve most social ills. 
 They support higher taxes, more government spending, 
and more regulation of the economy.  They include the 
Brookings Institution, National Alliance of Business, National 
Urban League, Committee for Economic Development, and 
National Wildlife Federation.  They received $22.88 
million in 1994almost two-thirds of corporate public-policy giving.
<P>n<I>Change-Oriented Left</I> (ratings of 2 and 1).  
This category includes organizations that work for 
extensive government control of social and economic 
institutions, such as the Children's Defense Fund, NAACP, and 
Center <BR>
<B>Advocates for Bigger Government</B>
<P>Much of the Administration's failed legislative 
agenda was crafted and promoted by nonprofit special 
interest advocacy groups headquartered in Washington, D.C.  
Advocacy groups and think-tanks that want more 
government control over the economy published policy papers and 
held press briefings to support the Administration's 
programs while offering their personnel to staff federal 
departments and agencies.  Groups like the Children's Defense 
Fund, once chaired by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, pushed for 
government health care and mobilized to scuttle welfare 
reform.  The NAACP, Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Education Fund (MALDEF), and National Urban 
Leagueorganizations that supplied high-ranking officials to 
the Clinton Administrationalso got behind the 
health-care plan.  On the environmental front, groups such as 
the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), Wilderness 
Society, and World Wildlife Fund demanded more 
environmental regulation at the expense of private property owners. 
 LCV president Bruce Babbitt became Secretary of 
the Interior.  A host of nonprofit executives from other 
environmental groups also filled Administration jobs.
<P>The ties between government and big-government 
advocacy groups have never been stronger.  As the 
federal government runs out of money and ideas, it is 
increasingly turning to these groups.  They not only supply 
proposals and lobby to enact them into law.  Increasingly, 
they determine where taxpayer dollars will be spent.  They 
get government jobs, run government programs, and 
spend taxpayers' money.  A large and expanding government is 
in their self-interest.  This much is clear.
<P>
<P><B>Corporate Support for Bigger Government</B>
<P>What is less understandable is how nonprofit and 
tax-exempt advocacy groups can successfully ask 
profit-making and taxpaying corporations for financial support 
for their agenda.  Why do corporations willingly agree to 
their requests for funding?
<P>In 1994, the most recent year for which data is 
widely available, major American corporations gave almost 
$27 million to advocacy groups that promote public 
policies calling for higher taxes, more regulation, and less 
economic freedom for corporations. <I> For every dollar that 
corporations gave to right-of-center and pro-free market 
groups, they gave $3.43 to liberal and left-of-center 
advocacy groups promoting bigger government.</I>
<P>Each year since 1986, Capital Research Center has 
measured corporate giving to public-policy organizations 
and has compared giving to groups on the left and right.  
In 1986, the ratio was $1.64 to $1.00.  <BR>

 liberal or left-of-center.  For their money, corporations in 1994 
supported tax-exempt groups that favor public policies that 
harm business and free enterprise.
<P>Chief among these policies was the Clinton 
health-care proposal.  Its immense and complicated bureaucracy 
coupled with mandated heavy costs on employers threatened 
the survival of many small businesses.  When First Lady

in America,&quot; she revealed an attitude that should 
have opened the eyes of corporate leaders.  Many, 
however, continued to contribute to groups like the Children's 
Defense Fund and the NAACP that strongly supported 
Clinton health policies.
<P>In 1994, major corporations also gave to the 
Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society, 
Natural Resources Defense Council, and World Wildlife Fund. 
 These groups supported the Administration's ill-fated 
BTU tax on energy the year before.  The tax would have 
increased the price of oil by an estimated 17 percent, coal 
by 15 percent, and natural gas by 11 percent.  But 
apparently many corporations were not outraged by the effort to 
raise taxes and force a reduction in the use of fuel.  In 1994, 
even President Clinton momentarily admitted, &quot;I raised 
your taxes too much.&quot;  Did corporations agree?
<P>When corporations contribute to political advocacy groups that 
want more government programs, they make their own shareholders foot 
the bill twice overas shareholders and as taxpayers.<BR>
 disguise their current policy activism.
<P>In other cases, corporations may distribute 
relatively small contributions as tribute money to buy time and 
avoid harassment.  But the activities of advocacy groups 
during the Clinton years make a mockery of that hope.  
The millions of dollars these groups receive from 
corporations simply enable them to pursue goals that undermine the 
free-enterprise system on which corporations depend.
<P>Of course, some corporations may conclude that 
their well-being ultimately depends on the favor of the 
Administration in power.  That might explain an initial flurry 
of 1993 contributions to the Children's Defense Fund 
and Planned Parenthood.  But this kind of giving yields 
bad public policy and worse philanthropy.
<P>When corporations support advocacy groups that 
want more government entitlements and social services, 
they hurt the recipients of charity as well as charities themselves. 
 This is the sorry lesson of our welfare programs.  
Philanthropy, including corporate philanthropy, should call 
on the desire of good people to do good deeds.  But 
when corporations contribute to political advocacy groups 
that want more government programs, they make their 
own shareholders foot the bill twice overas shareholders 
and as taxpayers.<BR>
<B>Corporate Misgiving</B>
<P>This year's <I>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy 
</I>contains other examples of foolish giving:
<P>nACORN (the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) is a direct-action advocacy group.  
It uses the threat of federal penalties to pressure 
banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions 
to make higher-risk loans at lower-risk rates to borrowers 
it recommends.  In 1994, BankAmerica, Bank of 
Boston, Chase Manhattan, Fannie Mae, PNC Bank, and the St. 
Paul Companies contributed $483,000 to ACORN.  This is 
an almost six-fold increase in 1993 corporate support 
for ACORN.
<P>nFord Motor Company gave $1,000 to the American Lung Association (ALA), which has lobbied to 
increase EPA emissions standards for automobiles.  ALA's image 
as a non-political public-health group belies its 
aggressive lobbying on a wide range of controversial issues.  Ford 
also donated $10,000 to the World Wildlife Fund, which 
promoted the failed BTU tax to cut fuel consumption 
and increase costs.  What was Ford thinking?
<P>nOil companies Chevron (despite a number two 
rating in our Top Ten) and Atlantic Richfield (ARCO) gave to 
the National Audubon Society and the Center for Marine 
Conservation, both of which oppose offshore oil drilling.  
Chevron, although it gave to groups that support free 
markets, also supported the Trust for Public Lands, which 
also opposes offshore oil drilling.
<P>
<P><B>Harming Charities and Those They Serve</B>
<P>Why do corporations support policy groups whose 
goals are bad for business?  CEOs and managers of 
corporate grantmaking departments may simply be ignorant of 
the agendas of nonprofits applying to them for grants.  
Groups with catchy names and smooth fundraisers often present 
an image at odds with the hardball politics they play in 
Washington.  Large and well-known groups like the 
American Cancer Society, National Audubon Society, and 
Humane Society of the United States trade on their reputations to<BR>

John M. Hood's <I>The Heroic Enterprise</I><BR>
<B>Reviewed by Martin Morse Wooster</B>
<P>What should business' responsibilities be towards 
the community?  Advocates of &quot;corporate social 
responsibility&quot; argue that businesses should use their profits 
&quot;responsibly,&quot; by which they usually mean making donations 
to liberal causes and organizations.
<P>John Hood, president of the John Locke Foundation, 
a market-oriented think tank in Raleigh, North Carolina, 
has a different view.  In <I>The Heroic Enterprise: Business 
and the Common Good</I> (New York: Free Press, 199 
pages, $25.00), he argues that the primary responsibility of 
businesses is not to promote social causes or redistribute 
wealth but, quite simply, to provide needed goods at a 
competitive price.
<P>Take the case of Jerome Lemelson, an inventor 
and philanthropist.  Lemelson has made substantial 
donations to the Smithsonian Institution and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, which co-sponsors the annual 
$300,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize for the best American inventor.  
When Lemelson dies, his foundation will have an endowment 
of at least $300,000,000.
<P>But Hood argues that Lemelson should not be 
celebrated primarily for his philanthropy, but for the five 
hundred inventions he has patented.  These include improvements 
in bar code readers, devices that make assembly lines 
more flexible, and the typewriter tape eraser, which 
Lemelson invented in college.  These, Hood argues, are 
Lemelson's main contribution to society.  &quot;No matter how hard he 
tries, there is no possible way that he can give enough 
money away to make his charitable contribution to society 
equal the value of his contributions as an innovator and 
entrepreneur.&quot;
<P>Advocates of corporate social responsibility often 
judge businesses by looking at how much they give.  But 
Hood suggests that a more meaningful criterion is to 
examine whether the goods and services companies produce 
make people's lives better.  Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, 
for example, is renowned by some because it gives 7.5 
percent of its profits to charityfar higher than the average 
corporate gift of one percent.  But its profits come from ice 
cream that, although tasty, is loaded with fat.  Who does 
more good for society, Hood asks: Ben and Jerry's or a 
lower-profile company that makes 55-gallon drums which 
ensure that goods can be transported cheaply, ensuring 
lower prices for everyone?
<P>Hood believes that corporations should practice 
&quot;strategic philanthropy;&quot; that is, they should make grants to 
causes <BR>
Terrence Scanlon, Publisher<BR>
Capital Research Center is a nonpartisan education and research organization
<P>classified by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) public charity.<BR>
CRC, 727 15th Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC, 20005 (202) 393-2600  http://www.capitalresearch.org<BR>
that advance a company's interests.  He agrees with 
Sunmark Capital president Menlo Smith, who has said, &quot;because 
our shareholders will always have different charitable 
interests, we concluded long ago that any giving done by 
Sunmark should have a very direct business purpose, and that if 
it does not, the giving should be done individually by 
the shareholders, and not the corporation.&quot;
<P>According to Hood, corporations can practice 
strategic philanthropy in different ways.  Amoco, which has 
long sought a better-educated workforce, has a substantial 
share of its filling stations in urban areas.  Thus, its 
foundation gives mostly to groups seeking to improve education and 
to rebuild inner cities.  Other companies practice 
&quot;cause-related marketing&quot; by making grants in proportion to 
their sales volume.  American Express pioneered this 
approach in 1981 by donating a percentage of the charges made on 
its credit cards to arts organizations in the San Francisco area. 
 It has since launched several national philanthropic 
campaigns, including a 1983 promotion in which a penny 
of every charge was used to help restore the Statue of Liberty. 
 By tying the use of its credit cards to charity, 
American Express has increased card use by 20 percent.
<P>Many corporations also use philanthropy as a means 
to improve employee morale.  General Electric, Questar 
Corp., and Union Planters National Bank encourage employees 
to volunteer at charities in the evenings and on weekends. 
 Researchers at Columbia University and the 
Conference Board have found that such volunteering increases 
workplace productivity.
<P>Hood suggests that one way businesses can improve 
their philanthropy is by supporting organizations that 
promote free enterprise.  Yet he cites data from the Capital 
Research Center showing that many large corporations give 
generously to groups hostile to free markets and limited 
government.  He speculates that corporate giving officers may 
do so to buy off antagonistic anti-business organizations.
<P>This approach, Hood argues, is ineffective.  In the 
long run, companies that support such groups, or that 
make contributions without a clear strategy, are eclipsed in 
the marketplace by competitors that practice strategic 
philanthropy.  Moreover, Hood suggests that advocates of 
corporate social responsibility must recognize that markets 
are not evil, but necessary if businesses are to create the 
wealth that makes philanthropy possible.  &quot;Without an 
efficient market system, there are likely to be more social 
problems (stemming from poverty and technological 
backwardness) on which philanthropists must spend their time and money.&quot;<BR>

<i>August 1996<BR></i>
<h2>Charity and Responsibility</h2>
<p>
<h3>CRC Hosts Washington Conference</h3>
<p>
<p>
<DD>On June 25, Capital Research Center hosted a 
conference on the theme of &quot;Charity and Responsibility.&quot;  Some 
100 guests from private and family foundations, 
corporations, think tanks, and the media gathered at the University 
Club in Washington, D.C. to discuss the prospects for 
strengthening private charity and reforming the welfare state.
<DD>Capital Research Center president <B>Terrence 
Scanlon</B> opened the event by remarking that &quot;our country 
cannot have a prosperous and free economy and a 
responsible government unless we have strong and independent 
social institutions.&quot;  He criticized the way that many 
tax-exempt organizations in recent years have undermined the 
American tradition of charity and responsibility by 
promoting governmentrather than private and 
voluntaryapproaches to public problems: &quot;Rather than provide a 
valuable public service that government cannot or should 
not provide, many nonprofits mobilize activists and lobby 
for higher taxes, more regulation, and more welfare 
programsthe same programs that have repeatedly failed our 
neediest citizens.&quot;<BR>
<H4>The View from Capitol Hill</H4>
<DD>The morning keynote speakers were 
Representatives <B>David M. McIntosh</B> (R-IN) and 
<B>Ernest J. Istook</B> (R-OK), sponsors of last year's &quot;Istook Amendment,&quot; a measure which would have limited taxpayer funding of 
nonprofit organizations that engage in political advocacy.
<DD>Rep. McIntosh criticized the welfare state for 
undermining America's tradition of community-based 
problem-solving.  He also endorsed the idea of a tax credit for 
charitable giving.  This would allow individual taxpayers to 
directly earmark a portion of their federal tax dollars to 
charities that help the needy while requiring dollar-for-dollar cuts 
in government welfare programs.
<DD>Noting that &quot;charity begins at home, not in the 
Capitol building,&quot; Rep. Istook called for greater exposure of 
nonprofit organizations that receive taxpayer support 
while lobbying for more welfare programs.  He argued 
that Congress and the media must educate the public about 
the role of advocacy groups so that voters will demand 
passage of legislation such as the failed Istook Amendment: 
&quot;The invisibility of many advocacy groups makes it difficult 
to build public support for reform.  The public tends to 
think all nonprofits are good, but many nonprofits are 
essentially lobbying arms of the government.&quot;<BR>
<H4>The Media's perspective</H4>
<P>Former Attorney General <B>Edwin Meese III</B> chaired 
a lively panel on the media's coverage of philanthropy.  
Five speakers who have written extensively on nonprofit 
organizations from a variety of perspectives argued about 
changes in the nonprofit sector and their impact on the kinds 
of stories they write.  Panelists generally agreed that the 
media pays ample attention to &quot;horror stories&quot; in 
philanthropy, such as the recent United Way scandal, but that the 
day-to-day work of charities and grantmakers goes largely 
unreported.
<DD><B>Jody Curtis</B>, executive editor of the <B>Council on 
Foundations</B>' <I>Foundation News + 
Commentary</I>, said that her publication has focused on offering &quot;how-to&quot; advice to donors and has generally avoided controversial issues 
in philanthropy.  Future editions, however, might 
explore more contentious subjects, such as direct-service 
giving versus advocacy or highlight examples of failure in 
philanthropy<BR>
<DD><B>Roberta d'Eustachio</B>, president and founder of 
the soon-to-be-launched <I>American Benefactor 
Magazine</I>, contended that wealthy individuals need entertaining and 
easy-to-understand articles that will encourage them to 
become donors and create foundations.  She emphasized that 
benefactors sometimes need help in clarifying their 
philanthropic values but cautioned those who advise them to 
&quot;let 1,000 flowers bloom&quot; and not try to choose donors' causes.
<DD><B>Laurence Jarvik</B>, editor of CRC's newsletters 
<I>Foundation Watch</I> and <I>Culture Watch</I>, contended that a 
&quot;1960s sensibility permeates most large foundations,&quot; making 
them reluctant to reconsider long-standing grants programs aimed at 
expanding the welfare state.  Unless the media begins to subject the nonprofit sector 
to greater scrutiny and criticism, he contended, major foundations will 
not change their ways.
<DD><B>Adam Meyerson</B>, editor of the <B>Heritage 
Foundation</B>'s <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American 
Citizenship</I>, contended that the mainstream 
foundation world is wedded to the welfare state 
and is dominated by ideas that don't work.  Fortunately, he said, there are 
many small, community-based organizations that are successfully addressing 
problems such as crime, failing public schools, and family breakdown.  If 
journalists tell the story of these groups, they can serve as models for 
broader privately based initiatives.  (Meyerson's presentation appears on page five.)
<DD><B>Vince Stehle</B>, assistant editor of <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>,
opined that recent media scrutiny has helped make the nonprofit sector more professional and efficient. During the question-and-answer period, Meyerson 
observed that unlike private businesses, nonprofits do 
not have to satisfy customers to stay in business and, 
unlike government, they do not have to heed the will of voters. </I>Nonprofit accountability, he contended, requires close 
scrutiny by donors, the media, and watchdog groups.  
<B>Joseph Dolan</B> of the <B>Achelis and Bodman 
Foundations</B> suggested that evaluation of the effectiveness of nonprofit 
programs will become increasingly important as the needy come 
to rely on private programs rather than government welfare.
<P>
<P><H4>Replacing the Welfare State</H4>
<DD>A second panel, following lunch, explained why it's time for private 
initiative to replace failed government programs.  Chaired by 
<B>Daniel J. Popeo</B>, chairman and general counsel of 
the <B>Washington Legal Foundation</B>, it featured three leaders from private 
foundations.
<DD><B>Michael Cawley</B>, president of the <B>Samuel Roberts Noble 
Foundation</B> of Ardmore, Oklahoma, argued that 
the welfare state has &quot;stunted our desire to be charitable.&quot;  Nonetheless, he 
noted how Americans have time and again responded generously in the wake 
of natural disasters and tragedies such as the Oklahoma City bombing.  He 
expressed optimism that the genuinely needy would receive adequate 
assistance as government welfare is scaled back.
<DD><B>Heather Higgins</B>, director of the <B>Randolph 
Foundation</B>, contended that the welfare state's universal 
guarantee of benefits has undermined the desire of many recipients 
to change self-destructive behaviors.  The goal of 
charities, she said, &quot;should not be to replace government welfare 
but to do better than government programs.&quot;  She 
suggested that the media celebrate &quot;heroes&quot; in 
philanthropygrassroots organizers who are successfully addressing 
social problems through private initiativeso that 
average Americans can see that their efforts will make a difference.
<HR>
<BR>
<I>Heather Higgins: The goal of charities &quot;should not be to replace 
government welfare but to do better than government programs.&quot;</I><BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<B>James Piereson</B>, president of the <B>John M. Olin 
Foundation</B>, conjectured that we are in the early stages of 
major change in the philanthropic sector.  He urged supporters 
of a free society to develop a richer philosophy that 
encourages more voluntarism and a sense of moral obligation 
to others.  Arguing that lower taxes are essential to increased charitable giving, he expressed reservations about a 
charity tax credit, saying that it would undermine prospects for 
a lower, flat tax.  (Piereson's presentation appears on 
page four.) 
<BR>
<H3>Counsel for Charitable Giving</H3>
<DD>Also speaking at Capital Research Center's 
&quot;Charity and Responsibility&quot; conference were Daniel J. 
Popeo, chairman and general counsel of the Washington 
Legal Foundation (WLF) and a CRC trustee, and William 
J. Lehrfeld, a private attorney.  They announced 
the creation of the Counsel for Charitable Giving, 
whose aim is to provide technical assistance to 
individuals, families, and companies wishing to create 
charitable foundations to promote the cause of free enterprise 
and limited government.  For more information, call

<H4>Alternatives in Philanthropy</H4><BR>
Fashioning a Conservative Alternative to Welfare<BR>
by Dr. James E. Piereson<BR>
Executive Director<BR>
 The John M. Olin Foundation
<P>
<DD>What is the conservative alternative to the welfare state? 
 If welfare were ended, how would we help the poor, the 
sick and disabled, and the elderly who now depend upon 
welfare programs?
<DD>These questions are often posed to those of us who 
reject the policies, institutions, and ideological assumptions 
of the welfare state.  Unfortunately, they do not admit of 
easy answers.  The fact that the welfare state has entangled 
itself in the lives of countless families and communities makes 
it all the more difficult to end without painful disruptions.
<DD>Some conservatives argue that we need a new 
public philosophy to challenge the world view of the welfare state. 
 This would emphasize duties as well as rights, the 
community as well as the individual, and private charity rather 
than government programs as the best means of 
addressing social problems.  Speaker Newt Gingrich has emphasized 
a &quot;conservative opportunity society,&quot; in which 
privately funded institutions assist the needy.  Others, borrowing 
the terminology of Eastern European reformers, stress 
rebuilding the institutions of &quot;civil society,&quot; which have 
been weakened by decades of reliance on government.  In 
both conceptions, private philanthropy is given the 
important task of bringing into place viable alternatives to 
welfare programs.
<DD>It is sometimes said that private institutions can 
better serve the poor and needy than the national government 
with <HR>
<BR>
&quot;We are in the relatively early stages of an important 
reform movement that has a long time yet to run its course.&quot;<HR>
<BR>
its array of welfare programs.  As a general proposition, 
I believe this is true.  Certainly, as Marvin Olasky has 
shown, it was true historically in America from colonial days to 
the Great Depression.
<DD>Yet the poverty problem, driven by misguided 
welfare policy, has exploded to a scale that will be very difficult 
for private institutions to manage.  It will be more effective 
to reform the welfare state in ways that begin to scale back 
the problem, rather than try to turn the task wholly over 
to private institutions.  Perhaps both can be done, but 
welfare reform appears to be a necessary condition for any success.
<DD>Is philanthropy being asked to do too much?  I suspect 
it is, especially when we consider the limited resources on 
our side.  Currently, the federal government spends 
some $400,000,000,000 annually on poverty programs, 
including AFDC, Medicaid, food stamps, rent supplements, and the like.  In 1995, individuals, foundations, and corporations donated some $144,000,000,000 to charitable 
institutions of various kinds.  My sense is that private 
philanthropyespecially conservative philanthropyis not 
yet substantial enough to carry out the assignment some 
have given it.
<DD>Still, I believe we are in the relatively early stages of 
an important reform movement that has a long time yet to
<HR>
<BR>
&quot;I have some reservations about an earmarked charitable deduction, 
as proposed by Senator Dole and others, because I fear it would 
undermine efforts to achieve a low flat tax.&quot;<HR>
<BR>
 
run its course.  We should remember that liberal 
philanthropy developed at the turn of the century in tandem with 
the Progressive movement.  It was built on the idea then 
in fashion that experts could identify social problems 
and design appropriate solutions that government would 
implement.  The cultural revolution of the 1960s drove 
liberal foundations ever deeper into this morass as new 
constituent groups were identified as clients of the welfare state.  
If conservatives are to reverse this trend, they will need 
to develop their own persuasive ideas.  This is now 
beginning to happen through the work of people like Marvin 
Olasky, Arianna Huffington, and groups like the 
Philanthropy Roundtable and the Capital Research Center.
<DD>I have given something of a mixed answer to the 
question posed earlier about philanthropy and the dismantling of 
the welfare state.  Bearing in mind Harry Truman's comment about the one-armed economist, let me lay down a 
few simple principles so that I do not end on a mixed note.  
It seems that several things should be done in tandem and 
in combination:
<UL>
<LI>First, public policy must be reformed, particularly 
in the areas of welfare and taxes, in order to scale back the 
size of the poverty problem and to encourage donations 
to charitable organizations.  Lower tax rates and reform 
of estate taxes would allow Americans to pass along 
more wealth to charities and to their families.  I have 
some reservations about an earmarked charitable deduction, 
as proposed by Senator Dole (R-KS) and others, because 
I fear it would undermine efforts to achieve a low flat tax.
<LI>Second, a conservative vision of philanthropy, 
linked to our understanding of a free society, must be advanced 
to challenge the reigning liberal philanthropy of such 
institutions as the Council on Foundations and the 
Ford, Rockefeller, and Pew foundations.  Such a vision, if 
aggressively pressed, will begin to increase donations to 
conservative organizations.
<LI>Third, we need to show that private-sector approaches, realistically conceived and assessed, are more effective than government programs in moving people 
out of poverty and into mainstream American life.  
Fortunately, many such models exist, but they need to be expanded 
and brought to the public's attention.
</UL>
<DD>With so much to do, there is no need for donors to fall 
into line behind one or another particular approach.  We are far better 
off if we encourage a healthy diversity that leaves room for donors to 
express their own interests in philanthropy.
<DD>The John M. Olin Foundation, for example, following the lead 
of our late donor, emphasizes public-policy studies in the areas of 
taxation, regulation, welfare, and national security, among others.  
Our general objective is to support individuals and institutions that work 
to strengthen our system of free enterprise and limited government.  
Most of our funds are directed to academic programs and research 
centers that support scholars, students, and researchers who address 
these issues.
<DD>Other donors, however, will want to emphasize 
different approaches.  Some will want to focus on direct assistance 
to the needy in their communities.  Others may want to 
support programs in the arts, education, history, literature, 
and philosophy.  This is all good and a sign of healthy 
growth in a movement just beginning to find its stride.
<DD>But let us not forget our larger goal, which is not 
to promote philanthropy for its own sake, but to strive 
to create for our children and grandchildren a country 
with more prosperity, more freedom, and greater moral 
confidence than the one we inherited.<BR>

<H4>The Trouble with Philanthropy</H4>
<BR>
by Adam Meyerson<BR>
Editor<BR>
<I>Policy Review</B></I>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>I come to you with the sad message that 
mainstream philanthropy is part of the problem in this country, not 
part of the solution.  There are many fine people in the 
mainstream foundations, and they fund many fine programs.  
But the foundation world has been dominatedand is 
still dominatedby ideas that do not work.
<DD>For the past 30 years, one of the central objectives 
of foundations has been to open opportunity for black 
Americans.  That is a noble, marvelous objective.  But what 
do foundations have to show for their efforts?  More black 
men are in jail or prison today than in college.
<DD>A second objective of foundations has been to 
revitalize cities and their economies.  Again, a noble objective.  
But New York City is bankrupt.  Washington, D.C. is bankrupt. 
 Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, 
Baltimore, and St. Louis have seen population declines of 25 
to 30 percent.
<DD>For 30 years, mainstream philanthropy has 
supposedly been standing up for children.  But more children 
are growing up in poverty today than 30 years ago.  We have 
an epidemic of child abuse.  Half a million children 
are languishing in state foster care.  And we've seen the 
collapse of the best safety net a child can havea mom and 
a dad who love him or her so much that they are willing to 
stay together despite marital difficulties.
<P>I submit that mainstream philanthropy has failed in 
all these areas because it has had the wrong ideas.  What 
are these ideas?  Here are eight of them:
<UL>
<LI>The failure to understand the importance of 
stable, two-parent families.  Philanthropy's focus has been 
on food, medical care, and income maintenance for the 
children of broken homes.  These are important, but it's 
more important to bring husbands and wives back together.
<LI>An overconcern with funding levels for schools 
and health and welfare programs and too little concern 
with performance levels.
<LI>Opposition to desperately needed reforms of 
the public-school system, such as the introduction of vouchers.
<LI>A bean-counting obsession with &quot;diversity,&quot; 
which has led public schools to set tragically low expectations 
for poor children, especially minorities.  The best 
affirmative action offers equal opportunity to all while holding 
everyone to the same high standards.
<LI>nThe perception of criminals as victims rather than victimizers.  This has undermined true rehabilitation, 
which must begin with repentance for committing evil.
<LI>A reluctance to say that certain kinds of 
behavior, such as teenage sex, abortion, promiscuity, or 
long-term welfare dependency, are morally wrong.
<LI>A misguided economic strategy, based on a 
misunderstanding of capitalism and wealth creation.  This has 
led to a disregard for the way that poor Americans are 
ravaged by high taxes, regulation, and crime.
<LI>A preoccupation with using the federal 
government to solve all our problems.  The great tragedy of 
government today is that it tries to do so much that it doesn't do 
anything well.
</UL>
<DD>The good news is that a tidal wave of social 
entrepreneurship is sweeping the country.  Ordinary Americans, 
through grassroots organizing, are solving problems that have 
perplexed mainstream foundations.  They're putting 
marriages back together, cutting crime, improving schools, and 
offering economic opportunity to the poor.  You can read 
their stories in our magazine, <I>Policy Review: The Journal 
of American Citizenship</I>.

<blockquote>
<u><h3>Impact of Drug Use</h3></u>
<P>
 <B>Illicit drug use is extremely costly to society</B>.  One
study conducted by Columbia University's Center for Addiction
and Substance Abuse found that drugs cost New  York City alone
$20 billion annually, or 21 cents of every taxpayer's dollar.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug abuse is surpassed only by violent crime as the issue
Americans consider the most serious facing the nation</B>.  According
to a recent Gallup poll, 94 percent of Americans surveyed consider
the use of illegal drugs a &quot;crisis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<h3><U>Drugs &amp; Crime</h3></U>
<P>
 <B>The vast majority of criminals use drugs</B>.  Data from Bureau
of Justice Statistics studies show that 79 percent of state prisoners
in 1991, 60 percent of federal prisoners in 1991, and 83 percent
of youths in long-term public juvenile facilities in 1987 had
used drugs at some point in their lives. <BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug use contributes to and exacerbates other crimes</B>.
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics also found that 31 percent of
prison inmates in 1991 had reported being on drugs at the time
of their offense.  In addition, more than 80 percent of reported
cases of child abuse involve illicit drug use by the abusing adult.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>The percentage of prisoners convicted of drug charges has
increased</B>. The number of persons convicted of violating federal
drug laws rose to 17,349 in 1991 from 5,981 in 1981, an increase
of 190 percent.  The number of drug trafficking convictions in
State courts more than doubled between 1986 and 1990.  In 1960,
approximately one out of every 25 prisoners was incarcerated on
drug charges; today, around one in three is.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
higher rate of  conviction and punishment of drug offenders</B>.
 More than 170,000 people were convicted of drug trafficking charges
in 1992, more than four times as many people so convicted just
four years earlier (before mandatory sentencing requirements).
 About half of those convicted were sent to prison, compared to
around 37 percent in 1986.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
significant increase in the average length of sentences imposed
on convicted drug traffickers</B>.  Since the U. S. Sentencing
Commission set guidelines on November 1, 1987, the average drug
sentence has more than tripled from 23.1 months in 1987 to 84.2
months in 1991.<BR>

<h2>A record of failure in drug treatment</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[We] should deal with the drug problem in a far more heads-up manner than we are now with two things.  Number one, treatment on demand without delay . . . The second thing we ought to do is find an alternative for first-time drug offenders."</I><br>
	--Bill Clinton, address at Georgetown University, December 12, 1991.<p>

Today's addicts are the most visible casualties of both the permissive culture and the drug fad of the late 1960's, 70's, and early 80's.  These addicts have moved up in the ranks from casual users.  They are largely aging, never married, and predominately male.  Most commit crimes - including selling drugs - as a means of income to purchase drugs. They are also largely concentrated among blacks and live in our inner cities.  While these addicts constitute the single largest demand for heroin and cocaine in the United States, they  also use a variety of other drugs (particularly marijuana) and alcohol.<p>

The overwhelming reaction to this problem has been a call for more drug treatment.  "Treatment on
 demand" is the preferred weapon of many in the drug fight. In fact, many liberals have argued the rational and humane response to drug addiction is to shift resources from drug enforcement and supply reduction to drug treatment.<p>

There are a number of very sophisticated and very effective drug treatment programs (many of which we visited), including very modest ones sponsored by churches and using
 variants of the 12-step method.  These are often every bit as effective as much more expensive and elaborate programs.  But the typical discussion of drug treatment in the press and by the government reflects a dangerous ignorance of the most basic facts.<p>

First, the government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  From fiscal 1988 to fiscal l994, federal drug treatment spending almost tripled.  At the same lime, however, the number of treatment slots remained virtually unchanged and the estimated number of people treated actually declined by 145,000.  Why?  As with much of government, it is because the bureaucracies have consumed more and more of the resources, leaving less and less for services.<p>

Bureaucratic waste and inefficiency aside, the number of addicts served per year, measured in terms of persons served per year, is equivalent to more than half the total estimated number of cocaine and heroin addicts.  Clearly, when given the chance, the bulk of these programs are not that successful.<p>

A substantial number of addicts have attended several treatment programs.  The real-world fact is that many treatment programs are simply not effective.  In addition, federal treatment funds continue to e distributed largely on the basis of population, even though we know that addicts are concentrated in our major cities.  And there has been no effort to ensure that addicts are placed in appropriate programs.  Today, out-patient treatment slots predominate when most experts argue that the only reasonable hope of successfully treating today's hard-core addicts is to place them in long-term, residential treatment.  Bush Administration efforts to make programs accountable - to cut off support to those that did not produce results, and match resources with the need-were not enacted by Democratic leadership in Congress.  And the Clinton Administration has abandoned all such efforts.<p>

In last year's crime bill large sums were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were highlighted by liberals who announced that they were being "smart and tough."  The model, and essentially the justification, for this funding was the Miami Drug Court and Attorney General Janet Reno's personal involvement with it as prosecutor.  But last August, as the crime bill fight was near its peak, the Miami Herald published a lengthy report raising serious questions about the effectiveness of the program.  In particular, the program established to divert first-and second-time drug offenders into treatment instead of prison was being used by robbers and burglars to serves as little as 45 days.  .And in December the Herald reported that the chief judge overseeing the Miami drug court order an audit of the entire program, expressing alarm that it "had no mechanism to measure whether it was succeeding" A central flaw in the rush to embrace drug courts as a major answer to addiction and crime is that a very large number of addicted offenders today are long-term, hard core addicts who are poorly suited for diversion program.  Drug courts, properly run, may hold promise for treating young addicts.  But young addicts are not the primary problem.<p>

Last year, two groups of studies were released that purport to demonstrate the effectiveness of drug treatment and its superior cost effectiveness to all other categories of drug-enforcement and supply control.  One, funded by the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, received attention for its conclusion that treatment "averages [a] $7 return for every invested."  But it included both alcohol and drug addiction and was thus too broad to be enlightening in regard to the cost-effectiveness of treating cocaine, and particularly crack, addiction -- the most destructive addiction threat today.  None of the sympathetic news reports noted that such "benefits-to-society-for-every-dollar-invested" studies for expenditures on prisons and jails have produced estimates as high as 17-to-1.<p>

A second, widely-reported study, was funded in part by the White House drug office, and conducted by the RAND Corp.  It was entitled "Controlling Cocaine," and concluded that "treatment is seven times more cost effective in reducing cocaine consumption than the best supply control program." Most of the press reports on the release of this study failed to mention that even Clinton Administration drug office officials participating in the release distanced themselves from the reliability of the methods RAND used to measure the effectiveness of supply control programs. And to our knowledge none of the press reports explained what the study actually found in regard to the effectiveness of programs treating cocaine addicts.<p>

In reviewing all forms of cocaine treatment, RAND found that 20 percent of addicts continue using drugs while in treatment and only 13.2 percent of the cocaine addicts treated reduce their drug use below weekly or more frequent use (what RAND defined as "heavy use") during the year following their treatment Overall, RAND reported, only "6 percent of heavy users leave heavy use each year [i.e., to something less than heavy use, not to be equated with no use]. About two-thirds of that out flow is apparently due to existing treatment programs . . . [and] one third of the total annual outflow from heavy use is estimated to be due to unassisted desistance from heavy use."<p>

In other words, overall, cocaine treatment is only 4 percent effective in reducing heavy use and only two percent more effective in reducing heavy use than no treatment at all. Needless to say, if the effectiveness of cocaine treatment were measured in terms of the percentage of addicts who stopped using cocaine altogether and for good, these numbers would be much, much smaller.<p>

While we should continue to support treatment programs, we need to face the harsh reality of cocaine and crack addiction: most addicts are likely do die from the effects of their addiction, sometime in their 40's, if not earlier.  This is yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use by young people -- the first step on the path to addiction -- is so important.<p>

As long as the drug problem is discussed in terms of treatment vs. Enforcement or supply vs. demand, it will remain fundamentally misguided. These dogmatic positions are at odds with both reality and common sense. An effective drug policy should begin with this assumption: as long as young people and those who receive treatment reside in communities where the supply of dangerous, addictive drugs remains plentiful -- i.e., where there is de facto legalization -- prevention and particularly treatment efforts will be severely undercut and for purposes of national policy, ineffective.<p>

Walters is president of the New Citizenship Project and former deputy director of drug policy during the Bush Administration.  This is the second of four articles.]</I>

<I>Restoring Hope In America: The Social Security Solution<BR>

<P>Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your
employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4
percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.
<BR>
<BR>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional
$2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest,
you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.
<BR>
<BR>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic
goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social
Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire
over the course of one working lifetime&oacute;45 years. By the year 2000,
there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category. <BR>
<BR>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they
are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits
(28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running
out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20
today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the
fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter
of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called
normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion.
I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from
the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system. <BR>
<BR>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax
increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security
trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits
will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent
to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans
are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll
taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?
<BR>
<BR>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building
up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end
of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assets&oacute;on
paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when
the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything
the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust
fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxes&oacute;by
over $36,000 per family&oacute;just as if the trust fund had no assets at
all. <BR>
<BR>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay
for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an
illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy. <BR>
<BR>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there
is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have
a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans
now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising
taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of
existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open
up opportunity for younger people&oacute;so that their standard of living
will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the
principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old
making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.
<BR>
<BR>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income:
wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes
money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to
your children. <BR>
<BR>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580
or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine
that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When
you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum
wage can become a millionaire in 45 years. <BR>
<BR>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your
investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual
return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the
Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week
($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000.
After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years&oacute;$822,000.
And 45 years&oacute;the normal working lifetime&oacute;$1.3 million. After
50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes
to an estimated $2 million. <BR>
<BR>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for
inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after
45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than
most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could
purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's
dollars) during your retirement years. <BR>
<BR>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest
work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save
Social Security&oacute;and enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires.
The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program,
but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded
system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security
and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to
set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional
voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use
their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to
their children. The plan has four basic elements: <BR>
<BR>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits
would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and
without reductions. <BR>
<BR>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your
employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent
on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits
of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal
account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would
be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040. <BR>
<BR>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tier&oacute;current
payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from
two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income
from their personal retirement accounts. <BR>
<BR>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of
Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own
IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your
account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The
first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year
would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You
could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to
$3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched
by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would
vary according to income. <BR>
<BR>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240
per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal
account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program
will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into
the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per
year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.
<BR>
<BR>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per
year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000
comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional
funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match.
In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in
charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security
would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve
private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience
in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.)
You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch
to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working
well in Chile. <BR>
<BR>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on
your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two
attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be
to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefits&oacute;and
then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your
children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your
capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime
but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect
to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity
you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year. <BR>
<BR>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits
would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent
a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance,
you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security
benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security
income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base.
When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to
your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions
of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds
today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages
keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their
promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a
59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social
Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percent&oacute;from $9,121 to $6,892
per year. <BR>
<BR>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal
accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose
an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year&oacute;$5,390
higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the
$1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be
$9,138. <BR>
<BR>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded
Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would
begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year
(in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive
deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can
America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources.
<BR>
<BR>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from
the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation,
the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would
be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system.
If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees
would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's
dollars). <BR>
<BR>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion
a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would
the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social
Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid
extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go
to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn
down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that
other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds
of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be
raised by $30 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument
we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year
interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive
principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do
not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would
gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their
children. <BR>
<BR>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds.
Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a
$25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many
would even set aside their full benefits&oacute;$10,000 to $15,000 a year
for their remaining lifetime&oacute;to build a nest egg for their children.
The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of
Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary. <BR>
<BR>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future
retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal
retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in
gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age.
It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are
extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security
and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longer&oacute;because
they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs. <BR>
<BR>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation
for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation.
Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation.
Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits
will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed
again for real wage growth&oacute;about 1 percent a year. This is icing
on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by
50 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural
dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to
pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to
avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities.
It will drain a growing amount of America's resources&oacute;our savings
and investment&oacute;out of the private sector. A shrinking private sector
damages our ability to create new jobs and new industries&oacute;our future
strength. <BR>
<BR>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking
pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs.
<BR>
<BR>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage
points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would
increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million
millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America
by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create
a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this
investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.
<BR>
<BR>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would
unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children,
and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with
its best days yet to come. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>According to a recent study, people who are now in their
twenties believe they are more likely to see a UFO than Social Security
benefits. <BR>
<BR>
</B>THE FACTS ARE CLEAR. When the baby boomers hit retirement, Social Security
will run out of money, and the timetable for reform requires meaningful
change by the end of the century. Based on over three years of extensive
research and consultation with S.S.I. experts and authorities, <I>Restoring
Hope in America</I> presents a bold plan to save <B>your</B> Social Security
benefits and guarantee financial security in <B>your</B> retirement.<BR>
<BR>
Social Secuirty reform must happen within the next five years or America
will face economic disaster in the next century, and unacceptable social
consequences in the pitting of young against old. Resotring Hope In America
is a call to action -- action based on accountability and reason in establishing
a new &quot;Declaration of Financial Independence&quot; for the modern workforce
and instituting guidelines for pension management by the government.<BR>

<title>Defending Gingrich -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>Defending Gingrich</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 23, 1997 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Where have all the great leaders gone?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	That's a question I've heard many times. My answer is: It's not that America no longer produces great men and women. It's that our political and media establishments no longer revere the qualities that make for greatness. They even turn on greatness when it threatens their complacency.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I would submit to you that no one poses a greater threat to the complacency of the Washington establishment than Newt Gingrich, narrowly re-elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, and leader of a noble campaign to get Washington off the backs of American families and workers. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ever since young Congressman Gingrich had the temerity to challenge then-House Speaker Tip O'Neil in the 1980s, the Washington establishment has had it in for Gingrich. It comes as no surprise that the business-as-usual crowd eventually drew blood.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's not just that Gingrich favors balancing Washington's checkbook, lessening the burden of taxes on American families, giving authority and autonomy back to states and localities, and giving all Americans greater economic independence by reforming welfare, Medicare and Social Security (three of Washington's biggest power-grabbing programs).  

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's that he has forced President Clinton to sign on to all of these objectives, albeit in different forms, which cut at the heart of big government. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Say what you want about Gingrich. But he believes his ideas passionately, pursues them relentlessly, and is willing to take a beating for it. When all the smoke clears, he frequently comes out on top. By contrast, Americans still are trying to figure out what the occupants of the White House believe.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To the Washington establishment, Gingrich is clearly the devil. His 104th Congress eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices and projects. It enacted farm and telecommunications reform, changing antiquated laws dating back to the Depression. The 104th Congress also reduced discretionary domestic spending by $53 billion. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	His revolution is rolling. It wasn't repudiated by the voters in 1996 as liberals believed it would be. The 105th Congress is on the brink of truly ending the era of big government and re-instituting the era of citizen-directed self-government. Bill Clinton was re-elected because he sang Gingrichisms like a canary: lower taxes, balanced budgets, family values.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How did Gingrich pull off this victory? By being the lightning rod and taking the heat. Like any great leader, he recognized that since his cause was just, the only thing his opponents could attack was himself. Accepting this, he didn't buckle, and while his enemies attacked, the victory was being won.  And more victories lie ahead.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Heck, Newt Gingrich even admits and apologizes for his mistakes! By contrast, can you imagine hearing  an admission of guilt or an apology -- about far worse "ethical lapses" than anything even dreamed of by Gingrich -- from other key players in Washington? 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"We are at the end of a 60-year cycle of liberalism," he said recently before The Heritage Foundation President's Club. "We had to have at the national level a great debate about where we were going. And that debate was a confrontation with those on the left who still believe in redistribution of wealth, centralized bureaucracy, command-and-control planning."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With so much at stake, someone had to take the heat. According to some polls, Newt Gingrich is now one of the most unpopular men in America. But when was the last time you could look at a national leader and say, "Here is someone willing to suffer public humiliation for doing what is right?"

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is one leader who deserves another look

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h3> It's In The Water </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br> 
January 23, 1997

<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I got such a kick out of the following whimsical story, which talk-radio personality Brian Wilson retrieved from the Internet, that I just have to share it with you. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now, before you read this, please bear in mind: My purpose in sharing it is not to suggest that responsible, sensible environmentalism isn't something we should strive for. On the contrary, that's the whole point: When environmentalists adopt extremist positions and use government to impose unreasonable restrictions based on unproven "dangers," like the Alar scare a few years ago, they invite public ridicule. In the long run, this hurts their cause, which is a perfectly reasonable one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Anyway, here's the story: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"LONDON:  Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) recently announced the discovery of a new firefighting agent to be used in conjunction with existing ones such as dry powder and BCF (bromine-chlorine-flourine). Known as WATER, it is particularly suited for fires in buildings, timber yards, and warehouses. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Though required in large quantities, it is cheap to produce, and can be stored in quantities of about a million gallons in urban areas and near other installations of high risk. BCF and dry powder are usually stored under pressure, but WATER will be stored in open ponds or reservoirs.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Unfortunately, ICI's proposal already is encountering strong opposition from safety and environmental groups. Prof. Connie Barriner has pointed out that if anyone immersed their head in a bucket of WATER, it could prove fatal in as little as three minutes. Each of ICI's proposed reservoirs would contain enough water to fill 500,000  buckets. As each bucket could easily be used 100 times, there is enough water in one reservoir to kill the entire population of the UK. Risks of this size, said Barringer, should not be allowed, whatever the gain. If WATER were to get out of control, the incidents at Seveso or Bhopal would pale by comparison.  What use was a firefighting agent that could kill people as well as put out fires?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"One local official already has said he would strongly oppose granting permission for construction of a WATER reservoir in his area, unless the most stringent precautions were followed. Open pools were certainly not acceptable. What would prevent people falling in them?  What would prevent the contents from leaking out? At the very least, WATER would need to be contained in a steel pressure vessel surrounded by a concrete containment wall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"A spokesman from the fire brigades said he did not see the need for the new agent.  Dry powder and BCF could cope with most fires. The new agent would bring risks, particularly to firemen. Did we know what would happen when this new chemical was exposed to intense heat?  Would it decompose into something even more dangerous?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"An environmentalists group, the Friends of the World, said it had obtained a sample of the new chemical WATER and found it caused clothes to shrink.  If it did this to cotton, what would it do to humans?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"In the House of Commons yesterday, the Home Secretary was asked if he would prohibit the manufacture and storage of this lethal new chemical. He replied that local authorities would have to take advice from the Health and Safety Executive before giving planning permission.  A full investigation is planned by the Major Hazards Group ...
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, the whole reason this satirical tale is funny is because the environmental movement has cried wolf a few too many times: Dire warnings of cancer if rats eat enough saccharine to fill Hoover Dam are never going to be taken seriously by sensible people. And we've all heard stories like this by now -- not jokes, but serious situations affecting people's lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When jokes like this one no longer resonate, we'll stop repeating them.
<p>

GOLIATH IN THE VALE of Elah roared his contempt at the weapons and zeal
of David: &quot;Do you think me a dog that you contest me with sticks and
stones?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, the Goliath of software, sees himself simi-larly beset by zealous
rivals with risible weapons. Entering his modest second-floor office on
the edge of the Microsoft campus on a twilight evening in late November,
I find him irked and addled by what he sees as a siege of slingshots from
irrational media and capital markets in his industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft entered November on an autumnal blaze of upside news-earnings
up 53%, sales up 63%, a double gi-gabuck quarter. But now, amazingly, people
were speaking of a &quot;crisis&quot; at Microsoft. &quot;That's an emotional
word,&quot; says Gates, twisting uncomfortably in his chair. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH when Netscape came on with 9,000 lines of code for a World
Wide Web browser that took six weeks to build and that was given away free,
and people began talking of his company's downfall. Gates had pulled that
trick himself in 1976, with a few thousand lines of code for the Basic programming
language for the PC and then again in 1980 with MS-DOS. But to do it to
Goliath seemed l&eacute;se-majest&eacute;. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then comes Sun Microsystems with a new program-ming language called Java,
and people like me, who by Mi-crosoft standards don't know anything about
programming, who have never written a single line of code, presumed to tell
him about its virtues. It's safe, secure, interpreted, plat-form independent;
it collects your garbage (automatic garbage collection). It compiles as
if by incantation. It builds market cap as by magic. Give poor Bill a break.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; says Gates. &quot;I have to wonder who screwed
your head around....&quot; Oh, he knows, he knows. &quot;The In-ternet&quot;
makes everything different. You can make any claim you want, however bizarre
or ludicrous, that would ordi-narily be laughed off the stage, and if you
add the mantra &quot;on the Internet&quot; at the end you can morph yourself
from a typical media clown into a visionary, a prophet, a guru. &quot;Nobody
pauses to say, 'Huh?' &quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the analysts will nod and the market will bow. It's &quot;on the Internet.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One day in November, three days before my visit, Rick Sherlund, the Goldman
Sachs analyst who helped bring Microsoft public in 1986 and had touted the
stock for a decade, downgraded Microsoft's shares from buy to &quot;mod-erately
outperform&quot; on the basis of Internet incantations from Sun and Netscape.
Sherlund also replaced Microsoft with Netscape on his recommended list.
Indeed, Goliath's net worth was shrinking by the minute as Microsoft's mar-ket
cap sank by $9 billion, and Sun's and Netscape's surged by $9 billion in
a matter of weeks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does Bill Gates know Rick Sherlund, by any chance? Sure, Gates answers,
&quot;extremely well.&quot; &quot;He's your man, he's great,&quot; says
Gates, &quot;if you want to run a spreadsheet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this world of manias and emotions, &quot;I have to make rational decisions,&quot;
Gates says, glaring at me. &quot;Somebody who thinks that because of a browser
that anyone can clone, because of a language that is magic, they [Netscape
and Sun, the unmentionables] can overthrow the world-that person can't even
think two chess moves ahead. You're not even in the game I'm playing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, thinking forward a couple of moves, what is the big thing bearing
down on Microsoft on that road ahead? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's middle age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, in Redmond, they have another name for it. Throughout the company, wherever
you go-from hum-mus on pita bread at the cafeteria with a glib former Holly-wood
agent hired to handle publicity, to a Starbucks latte at the Microsoft model
&quot;home&quot; with software sage Rick Rashid incandescent on a couch,
or off to Rover's Restau-rant where Nathan Myhrvold spiels refulgently at
a cor-ner table through 12 courses of rococo &quot;fatware&quot; and my
two missed flights-the word is middleband. From the top down, Microsoft
is becoming a middleband company. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates, Myhrvold, James Allchin, Craig Mundie- nearly anyone in Redmond will
step you through it. The future is not broadband, not narrow-band; it is
some middle way. It takes Excel and Word and Pow-erPoint presentation graphics
and multimedia CD-ROMs and the new Video ROMs-indeed all the front and back
Office suites that are the core of the company, all the teeming tow-ers
of legacy code-and attaches that to the Internet. It's Encarta and Baseball
and digital TV all tied to the Web over middle-band circuits. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates explains: &quot;We will translate Encarta into many lan-guages and
make it a front end to the Internet, so that when-ever you look up a topic
in the encyclopedia, we can link you into what there is in the Inter-net
on that topic. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now the Internet is not fast enough when you just want to go pure
Internet, so every year you can buy the CD that holds the bulk of the material.&quot;
It will be a middleband world. I see the millennium at hand: People are
all queu-ing up at Egghead for their Encarta update CDs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From Gates on down, however, Microsoft leaders do grasp the essence of the
change. Myhrvold trenchantly points out that communications standards no
longer rise from the center out, from the LAN to the WAN. They be-gin on
the Net and move inward to the LAN and transform it. &quot;The LAN is dead,&quot;
as Myhrvold says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these same Microsoft leaders seem to believe that the transforming power
of the Net stops short of the PC and operating system. Sun will set, but
Windows will open wide on the World Wide Web (up to ISDN speeds). After
all, as Allchin puts it, &quot;We see the Internet as an extension of the
operating system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask Gates how we can have a middleband world in the face of a rising tide
of bandwidth. Gates in the past has spo-ken of virtually &quot;infinite
bandwidth.&quot; But he does not see it today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Twenty years from now we will have broadband in homes, he explains, but
until then middleband is the best you can expect. Indeed, in his presentation
to the press the week after my visit, on December 7, he strangely declared
&quot;broad-band is the holy grail, [but] it's much further away than ever
before.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask about cable modems. But to Gates, cable modems are mere middleband:
&quot;Don't get me wrong-you can do a lot in middleband. But cable is a
shared medium. Cable modems are middleband. You get 10 megabits per second
and share it with 500 homes and you are back to ISDN speeds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, I protest, Netscape has a different view. It has joined with @Home
(the Kleiner Perkins-TCI joint venture) to supply browsers and servers for
a new scalably broadband Internet based on cable. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates's voice reaches a new pitch. &quot;I assure you Netscape has no relationship
with @Home that Microsoft does not have. I didn't spend three years talking
with John Malone for nothing three years with Bruce Ravenel [Tele-Communications
Technology Ventures' senior vice-president and chief operating officer].
In the first place, browsers are trivial. We will have cable browsers. And
we will have cable servers. We will do anything with @Home that Netscape
does.&quot; After all, TCI Technology Ventures invested $125 million in
MSN (Microsoft Network). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So it went in the Redmond gloaming. I deeply admire Gates. The guts to leave
Harvard at the end of his junior year and launch a new industry; the tenacity
to build it into a planetary utility; the audacity and ingenuity of the
original deal with IBM; the entrepreneurial confidence to cut loose from
OS/2. The vision to be the only major software company to embrace Macintosh
and save Apple by en-dowing the Mac with the leading GUI spreadsheet and
word processor, Excel and Word, while at the same time gaining the graphics
skills to create Windows. The bold challenge to Unix through Windows NT.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
THERE IS NO DOUBT that Gates has been the exemplary business leader of our
era. Compared with the leaders of IBM, heavy with &quot;NIH&quot; (not-invented-here)
and degrees in business administration and finance, who could not even grasp
the concept of sunk costs or the rule of self-cannibalization well enough
to burke OS/2, who could not even see the huge opportunity to embrace the
Mac OS, Gates is indeed a giant. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A week later, in an announcement emblazoned in Com-puterworld as &quot;Capitulation,&quot;
Gates showed his superiority to the NIH syndrome at IBM. He declared that
he was licensing Sun's Java Internet animation language, in which he seemed
suddenly to have discovered new virtues, and was essentially abandoning
Microsoft Network as a proprietary paid service. It would serve as an attractive
Inter-net entry point, open to all, with content and advertising prepared
with anyone's available software. Beyond that, Microsoft announced an array
of impressive-sounding new Internet products: Blackbird publication tools
for the Net; Gibraltar Internet server products four times as fast as Netscape's;
Visual Basic as a scripting language for the Net already far easier and
more familiar than Java; upgrades of current Word versions that allow direct
creation of HTML documents; and an array of other announcements. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But all the brave talk, the bestselling book, the stilted TV appearances,
the an-nouncement of a news channel with NBC, the stream of new products,
the bold embrace of an In-ternet strategy, the spread of Windows 95, could
not disguise the rising confu-sion in Redmond. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of a sudden, Gates seemed to have lost his bearings. The man who elbowed
aside an on-air Connie Chung as if she were a bothersome gnat and shunned
NBC as a nuisance, now was clutch-ing the old network, of all things, as
a source of news and investing in it, as if it had a future. It was as if
old NBC with its Max Headrooms of smiling anchor faces and two-minute splashes
of &quot;news&quot; could morph into an in-formation resource simply by
invoking the mantra &quot;on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in his long romance with Warren Buffett, Gates seemed to be reaching
out to old money, power and pres-tige to bolster his company as it whirled
in the vortex that he had described as the &quot;Internet tidal wave.&quot;
It was as if he no longer trusted the PC to sustain his growth as an $8
billion revenue company, as if he needed sustenance from mass media. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Netscape, Sun, @Home and other firms, Silicon Valley is in the ascendant
again. But the software colossus is still losing ground on the road ahead,
so Gates pivots on his peerless pinnacle simultaneously at the summit of
the New York Times bestseller list and the Forbes 400 and looks back with
a Macaulay Culkin smile from the cover of a book that is mostly news of
yesterday. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I N T E L   O U T S I D E ? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks later, back in Silicon Valley from the Vale of Elah, I visit Goliath's
prime mover, Andrew Grove of Intel. With revenues more than twice as large
as Micro-soft's and a price/earnings ratio less than half as high, and commanding
the world's most awesome manufactur-ing facilities for the world's most
complex and portentous product, Intel seems to stand on firmer foundations.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove opens the meeting with jokes about the &quot;tunnel of death&quot;
that perpetually menaces his industry in the pages of the media. Ensconced
in a small open cubicle on the fifth floor of the Robert Noyce headquarters
in Santa Clara at the heart of Silicon Valley, with &quot;Intel Inside&quot;
inscribed on the roof to enlighten the planes from nearby San Jose In-ternational
Airport, Grove effervesces wit and irony and bonhomie where Gates seethed
sarcasm and defensiveness. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Grove, there is no longing for canonization by old money, no sell-sign
craving for the sickly glamour of Hol-lywood and TV, no fashionable yearning
for business in &quot;content.&quot; Grove grasps that the PC is the ascendant
force in the global culture of capitalism and that the Internet consummates
the PC. Nonetheless, asked about the possibility of the teleputer-the $500
Internet PC-freed from the coils of Wintel, he echoes Gates in a cele-bration
of current PC culture that somehow misses the point. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove associates the teleputer with dumb or static appliances, from set-top
boxes to PDAs, in the catalog of PC sub-species that emerged in hype as
substitute PCs. Most of them sold a few hundred thousand units, and then
expired. &quot;The new device will be produced and it too will sell a few
hundred thousand units. But not 10 million units,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Forbes ASAP editor Rich Karlgaard and I prepare to leave his office,
he asks us to guess the cycle rate of the up-coming '96 basic home-based
PC. I suggest 100 megahertz. Grove shakes his head. He confides that he
is headed for a meeting to decide whether the 1996 PC will bear a 120- megahertz
or a 133-megahertz Pentium. &quot;Everyone un-derestimates the progress
of PCs,&quot; he says with satisfaction. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You could fix on a special-purpose device today, to satisfy Larry
Ellison's mother [who wants a simpler PC], but by the time it came out,
the PC will have moved on, powered by incomparably more potent microprocessors,
leaving the new machine trivialized and obsolete in its wake.&quot; In other
words, evolutionary products will suffice in this revolutionary time of
exponentially expanding Nets and peripheral CPUs. Nonetheless, moving a
few miles north on California's Route 101, out of the hypergravita-tional
fields of Philistea, one can still feel a radical shift-ing in the spheres
of possibility. &quot;And David took his staff in his hand and chose him
five smooth stones.&quot; I Samuel 17:40 <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
FOR THE NEW ORDER, the ultrawideband wireless Sand Hill slingshot-the capitalist
conjurer of the forces causing new sleeplessness in Seattle-is John Doerr
of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. Shunning Herb Allen's summits of
schmooze, where the entrepreneurial big-time is an &quot;au-dacious&quot;
investment in Coke or NBC, Doerr epitomizes the venture capitalist as industrial
demiurge. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As technology investor Roger McNamee puts it: &quot;While other venture
capitalists say, 'Let's start a company,' John says, 'Let's start an industry.'
&quot; So far, beginning at Intel in the early years, he has played a key
role in launching in-dustries in electronic design automation, RISC workstations,
personal computers, financial software, multimedia and wire-less pen appliances
(well, let that last one pass). His current new industry will be the biggest
yet. It is broadband Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From the vertiginous launch of Sun, Lotus and Compaq in the early 1980s
to a fund gush-ing Go at pens, his career has seen several peaks and valleys.
Doerr has even dallied with middle age. He once weighed a mid-life retreat
from the madding bustle of Silicon Val-ley to contemplate the Tantra or
the Tao: &quot;I sometimes think,&quot; Doerr told the New York Times in
1987, &quot;I would like to become a Buddhist monk.&quot; Sure, John. But,
tell me, what yoga discipline was he brewing two years ago in Palo Alto,
at breakfast at Il Fornaio head-to-head with Jim Clark? What karmic rites
was he conjuring with Clark and Bill Joy in the winter of 1994 on a three-hour
conference call among wildernesses of Marriott on the road? What karass
was he kenning in December 1994 among the tacky booths and bins, the barkers
and indoor bikinis at the Western Cable Show in Anaheim? What tables were
tipping in January 1995 in his Woodside home, among pizzas and pastas with
his wife, Anne, and Marc Andreessen, Bill Joy, Andy Bech-tolsheim, Jim Gosling
and Rick Schell (Netscape's VP of engineering)? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why, in early 1995, was he lurking around the NASA Ames Research Center
at Moffett Field in Mountain View, Calif.? Is he seeking evidence of alien
IPOs, or just some hard-core Unix Christian libertarian netbender from outer
space to levitate a new industry in Palo Alto? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T venturer Thomas Judge told Forbes ASAP's Nancy Rutter in 1993:
&quot;You have to be on the fringes to make money in [Doerr's] business,
and that's where he is.&quot; Follow Doerr, however, from day to day, call
to call, from Sun to Oracle to America Online to Netscape to Macro-mind,
and you will find yourself at the fringes just as they invert into the Zen
center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A lean figure, with blondish hair, a cowlick and horn-rims, Doerr at 44
is as bashfully all-business and freneti-cally bitwise as Gates whom he
resembles, but he is still flouting the gravity of middle age. On a crisp
Sunday in mid-December, I catch up with him at Buck's restaurant, near his
home in Woodside in Silicon Valley. Wearing a dark suit from church, he
checks for messages on his Skytel pager, greets fellow venturer Bill Davidow
passing by and then opens a black briefcase full of technotoys. From across
the restaurant, this venture colossus looks to be a frowsy salesman perhaps
a little desperate to present his wares. He removes a Mac Power-Book 5300
and Sony speakers and lays them out on the table. Amid empty latte glasses
and plates of ravioli pesto and his own half-eaten hamburger, Doerr is ready
to give a demo of the new industry-a fore-cast for next year's Netscape-style
IPO. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes a minute or so to boot up the Mac, checking through the 32 megabytes
of RAM (teleputers, Doerr says, will boot up instantly from flash ROM).
But from there on out, it is all immediate grati-fication. Click to ignite
a Java Web page with streaming stockmarket data, a c/net talking- head newscaster
and a vocano video from Venezuela. &quot;Wow, look at that new PowerBook
go,&quot; exults a jolly woman observing from the next table. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Doerr is on a rush through a world of his own. Click again and you have
the Sunnyvale Sun, efflorescent with vivid speech, sports clips and classified
personals. Newspapers will be hot on the broadband Internet. Click on the
classifieds and you can presumably meet their makers in living color. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is a glimpse of @Home, a mere demo of Doerr's new broadband Internet
company. As the service develops you will soon be able to download movies
and other pro-grams on demand. Over 28.8 modems or even 128-kilobit-per-
second ISDN lines, all such dynamic fare would be ag-onizingly slow to access.
By contrast, Doerr says, in @Home everything is instant, full motion and
always on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How can this be, you ask, on an essentially middleband Internet? &quot;That's
the genius of Milo Medin, @Home's net-work chief,&quot; he explains, &quot;linked
to the genius of Marc An-dreessen of Netscape.&quot; NASA Ames's network
king, Medin is now building a scalable, extensible architecture for a cable-based
World Wide Web. With some help, I might add, from John Doerr and his five
smooth stones. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
B R E A K I N G   W I N D O W S   A N D   B O T T L E N E C K S <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, four of the five companies-Sun, Netscape, Macromind and Intuit-Doerr
estimates, &quot;have added more than $10 billion to their market cap in
the last six months because of their Internet initiatives,&quot; this new
model of computing based on the Web, while Microsoft lost a similar total
by briefly resisting it. Now @Home is on target to generate another multibillion
market cap by exploding the current bandwidth bottlenecks of the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At Intel, Doerr worked at a desk down a corridor from Bruce Ravenel. Then
an architect of the 8086 and the 8087, Ravenel is now TCI Technology Ventures'
influential chief of technology. Igniting the fuse for @Home were words
between Doerr and Ravenel as the two old grads from &quot;Noyce-Moore U&quot;
wove their way through the Western Cable Show in the first week of December
1994. &quot;I dare not call it an epiphany,&quot; Doerr says, &quot;but
Bruce and I were at the Motorola booth where they were showing off a sleek
little $300 box the size of a modem that would enable telephone calls over
a cable line. 'What would it cost,' I asked, 'to add an Ethernet port to
the device, so you could link a computer to the Internet through it at up
to 10 megabits per sec-ond? ' When the Motorola guy guessed, 'Maybe $30,'
our eyes got as big as saucers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Doerr sees a hole in the line, he hits it hard and fast. Two weeks
later, four days before Christmas 1994, he was in John Malone's office in
Denver presenting a plan for a Silicon Valley startup to bring broadband
Internet over cable. Likely IPO market value in two years? $3 billion. Malone
also hits hard and fast. After a three-hour meeting, the TCI chief signed
off on the venture with-out a qualm. Doerr's chief job was to &quot;line
up some unique Silicon Valley technical genius to make it work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tapping Internet experts at Sun and around the Valley, Doerr found only
one name popping up on every list. It was that hard-core Unix Christian
libertarian netbender from outer space, Milo Medin. A 32-year-old wunderkind
manager of the multiple networks converging at NASA Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, Medin had spent the last 12 years making increasingly
crucial contributions to the Internet's growth. But uh-oh. For a week or
more, Medin refused to answer any calls from Kleiner Perkins. He says, &quot;I
thought they were a bunch of lawyers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
DOERR WAS ATTACKING the key problem of the Internet. With the number of
host computers doubling every year since 1970 and the power of the computers
doubling every 18 months, the Internet had mastered every challenge of capacity
by multiplying cheap local routers and servers. The Net has already overtaken
the U.S. Postal Service as a carrier of mail (by one estimate, a trillion
e-mail messages compared with 180 billion postal deliveries). And the Net
similarly has pushed the number of digital data bits ahead of the total
of voice bits on the phone system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last two years, however, the traffic has taken a turn toward GIFs
and graphics, doubling the number of bits every few months. As the Internet
careens toward its destined collisions with television and telephony as
the prime sources of information, entertainment and commu-nication for the
public, the prime obstacle is bandwidth. Many in the industry have begun
to blink and bluster in the bright light of optical media and other broadband
pipes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Led by Bill Gates, they believe in middleband and ISDN. They dabble defen-sively
in TV. As a shared medium, even cable, so Gates contends, will dwin-dle
to ISDN rates as the number of customers on the system rises. But at 128-kilobit-per-sec-ond
or even at 1.54- megabit-per-second T1 rates, ISDN means picture quality
inferior to NTSC television. A shared medium linked to slow routers means
bottlenecks throughout the system if cable modems yield a thou-sandfold
increase in bit traffic beyond existing modems (up from 28.8 kilobits to
close to 30 megabits per second). On-line services will bog down in slow
access, sticky searches, jerky movement, blurred faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such a middleband net will not be able to maintain its current momentum
of growth and power. It will not be able to challenge television and telephony.
Yet the valuations of Internet companies depend on a continued exponential
ascent. Thus many people believe the Net is overhyped, overvalued, starved
for &quot;content.&quot; They believe Doerr's broadband revolution will
fail. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Milo Medin is Doerr's weapon to break the bottleneck. He has spent most
of his adult life overcoming crises on the Net. Medin's fast rise began
in 1987 when he led the creation of NASA's Internet and almost came to an
end in 1993, when the swarthy Serb with the spruce mustache and the piping
voice and broadband gush had barged into Washington to persuade the entire
government to em-brace the Internet protocols (TCP/IP). Fueled by this uni-versal
language, the Net had grown exponentially up a wall of worry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problems did not reach critical mass until 1994, however, when its traffic
began doubling every couple of months. Andreessen's Mosaic browser had spurred
the World Wide Web into a multiterabyte cyclone of growth and expansion,
concentrated in California. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the entire Internet converged in one room in one building at Ames.
On one side of the room were the Cisco 7000 routers and Digital gigaswitches
and Northern Telecom add-drop multiplexers of the FIX (the Federal In-ternet
Exchange), the government peering-and-exchange point, managed mostly by
Medin. On the other side was MAE West, the Internet access exchange point
for most of the private Internet, including the pullulating college and
university Nets, the regnant Internet service providers such as ANS and
Sprint, and the budding local fiefdoms of Netcom and The Well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in April 1994, the government ended its $25 million in annual Internet
subsidies and arranged for a private takeover. Among the winning bidders
were Pac-Bell and Ameritech, assigned to run two key network ac-cess points
(NAPs). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Long expecting the withdrawal of government subsi-dies to throw the Net
into chaos, many observers would welcome the ensuing crash. The private
sector would flub the job. There would be a tragedy of the commons. As in
feudal Britain, when the commonly owned lands were overgrazed and ruined,
the commonly owned Internet would suffer a glut of graphics &quot;GIFraff&quot;
and traffic jams. Sure enough it was happening. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PacBell's ATM switches from Newbridge Networks, with skimpy buffers designed
like a PBX for voice-traffic pat-terns, choked. California, the source of
two-fifths of In-ternet traffic, was down. The Western NAP jammed, and Ameritech's
Chicago NAP was also largely out of commis-sion. Bay Area e-mail from a
student on Netcom to a small business on BBN's BARNet had to steer clear
of the Ames hub and pinball through routers all the way across the country
to Sprint's NAPs in Pennsauken, N.J., or Reston, Va., and then all the way
back again. As a result, the Eastern Inter-net hubs also began to tilt.
An obvious solution seemed to be to have FIX West, the government hub at
Ames, take over the traf-fic that was fleeing the Pacific Bell NAP. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Savvy residents of Silicon Valley, the Ames management was sympathetic.
Then Medin gained the blessing of NSF networking chief Steve Wolff and enlisted
Jack Waters at MCI, a crucial Internet backbone supplier that no longer
used its PacBell connection. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Within two weeks, Medin created a system comparable in capacity and reliability
to the original FIX, with expanded Net management capabilities, power supplies,
communications ports and routing facilities. The result was a broadband
national peer-ing- and-exchange point, with a cumulative capacity of some
10 gigabits per second. It combined traffic from all the major commercial
Internet suppliers with the bitstreams from government laboratories and
agencies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, throughout this period of crisis and turbu-lence, no ordinary
Internet customer experienced any un-toward deterioration of service. Although
Medin's contri-bution was only part of a major national effort, he became
the talk of the Net. Doerr had to sign him up. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AS DOERR SUMS IT UP, &quot;Milo was running the largest IP net in the federal
government. When they decided to set up a White House.gov Web site, they
asked where to put it. They put it on Milo's server. Milo helped run the
fiber ring around Moscow. Internet connections for Australia and Antarctica
and for deep space probes ran through Milo. He was supplying IP connectivity
for the entire Scandinavian subcontinent. He had some 200 remote nodes.
And he ran it all with some 99.98% uptime.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
@Home CEO Will Hearst of Kleiner Perkins likes to tell a story that gives
some clues as to how this young Net nerd from NASA became a legend in his
own time: &quot;In 1988, a Finn-call him Lars-hacks his way into Milo's
comput-ers. Ticks Milo off. He does a trace route and finds his way back
to the administrator of the domain in Finland. It's an academic site. Milo
already knows Lars's IP address. You can't hide from Milo. He says to the
administrator, 'We have a problem. Please have a conversation with Lars.'
That upset the Finns, who say, 'We are not going to do that! We respect
civil liberties here! You can post a complaint if you like, but we can't
tell the guy what to do.' So Milo goes into a slow boil. Says, 'I'll give
you about 30 minutes to get that guy's files off our machine.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nothing happens. So Milo issues an order: 'Take down Scandinavia.'
The switch is pulled. Three countries go dark. They don't notice it immediately,
but pretty soon e-mail messages are not getting returned. At last, three
senior administrators go to Lars, so the story goes, and they say: 'We don't
care if you hack into the CIA; we don't care if you bring down NSA; and
we don't mind if you abscond with all the financial bits in the Federal
Reserve. But don't mess with Milo at NASA.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Finns called back Milo, said the situation had been taken care
of. Milo said fine and put the service back up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
NOW DOERR and Medin are again confronting the perennial doomsday adven-tists
who gather on mountaintops of slightly older money and disparage the future
of the Net, talking crisis, over-load, overhype, overvaluation. Tragedy
of the Commons. The experts are chiming in. From Howard Anderson of the
Yankee Group to Andrew Seybold and Bob Metcalfe, lead-ing analysts are prophesying
a crash in 1996. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin has been there before. The answer to traffic jams on a narrowband
Net is creation of a broadband Net. Don't tell him it is not technically
possible. Who are you kidding? This is the age of the telecosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, though, thinks it is the age of middleband. It is obvious beyond
cavil to Gates that his regime, ruling 80% of the world's computers, is
destined to prevail. He commands a market share so overwhelming that Wash-ington's
antitrusters see it as a monopoly in need of gov-ernment dissolution. For
Gates, among the most ludicrous claims to be validated by the mantra &quot;on
the Internet,&quot; is the idea that Windows machines are an inferior minority
system difficult to digest in the prevailing habitat of Unix and TCP/IP.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To Medin, however, it is a matter of simple fact that Win-dows and NT are
awkward systems, hard to incorporate in his domains except as mere terminals.
To Medin, Unix is the heart of the Internet, the matrix of creativity in
net-working, the bearer of thousands of programs and services and tools
and scripts and languages that together comprise the pullulating fabric
of the rampantly growing Web. So far, Medin has a strong case. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sixty percent of the managers of Internet host comput-ers use Macintoshes
as their preferred personal machine. On the Internet, as a platform for
servers, whether for the World Wide Web, e-mail, FTP, Telnet, Gopher or
NeWS, Microsoft's favored NT now ranks seventh, with a 4% share, behind
Sun, which commands a 56% share, Apple, Silicon Graphics, IBM, Digital Equip-ment
and Windows 3.1. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Around the time that Gates was assuring me of Microsoft's impregnable position
with @Home, Medin was reviewing the Seattle company's software concepts
for his new network. The @Home people wanted to adopt Microsoft's Explorer
browser if they could (TCI fa-vored its interactive TV ally), but it was
simply impossible. Explorer ran on neither Unix nor Macs, and could not
handle mul-ticasting. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's browser already worked with all the existing systems, including
the various Windows. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the influence of Marc Andreessen, who had learned net-working in the
broadband 45- megabit-per-second environment of the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Netscape had long ago left behind all
the comforts of middleband. Andreessen was eager for broadband con-nections.
Gates was not even in the game that Medin and Andreessen were playing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All right, suppose that &quot;browsers are a trivial tech-nology,&quot;
as Gates told me dismissively. It was servers that Microsoft really wanted
to sell to @Home. Their Gibral-tar system was running Microsoft's somewhat
balky inter-nal Internet at a pace some four times faster than Netscape's
server might. Here, Microsoft benefited from its homogeneous cam-pus environment.
Netscape had to employ the &quot;union&quot; code-using the lowest-common-denominator
instructions to coordinate several varieties of Unix, Mac and Windows NT.
Meanwhile, Microsoft could optimize Gibraltar for all the most powerful
instructions in Windows NT, so it was much faster. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the @Home people were perplexed. How could they use Windows NT, an alien
system on the Internet, unfa-miliar to their employees or to the Internet
service-provider personnel who would work the @Home headends and oth-er
nodes? Microsoft was behaving in the Internet environ-ment as if the company
were still safe in the imperial realms of Windows desktops. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So @Home, which promises to be the most important force in the next phase
of Internet evolution, and Medin, the intellectual firebrand at the heart
of @Home, seem un-likely to embrace Microsoft's offerings. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
MILO'S DARK SHADOW OVER MICROSOFT <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As for TCI, its enthusiasm was dented a bit by the collapse of the MSN project,
in which Malone invested $125 mil-lion. But TCI has recouped its loss. Jim
Clark was persuaded to offer TCI a small share of the Netscape IPO. After
the initial public offering and the subsequent boom in Net-scape shares,
TCI's holding was worth $125 million, leav-ing TCI quite comfortable with
its new allies in Moun-tain View. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A deeper look at Medin's plans casts darker shadows in the path of Microsoft.
Asked about the notion of an Internet computer being free of Windows and
other Mi-crosoft levies, Gates stops rocking on his chair and gets to his
feet. He turns and paces urgently back and forth across his office. He gestic-ulates,
summons the history of past challenges, refers repeatedly to dumb termi-nals
and other unappetizing machines, and hurls forth rhetorical questions: &quot;Do
you want to go onto the Internet when you are doing word pro-cessing, do
you want to go on the Internet when you are using PowerPoint or Excel?&quot;
In other words, do you want to forgo all the wonderful new OLE interactions
among Microsoft programs and all the new Microsoft hot links and other forthcoming
tools when you go on the Net? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the pressure of Gates's energy and conviction and hypotheticals, I
answer, &quot;Of course not.&quot; But the real answer is, &quot;Sure, if
in exchange I can have a computer that outperforms a current Wintel machine
on the Net and con-tains linking capabilities comparable to OLE for one-third
the price.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates himself sketched out the answer in his famous In-ternet Tidal Wave
memo, issued in May to galvanize his company in the face of the new threat.
He pointed out that not only could he access far more information on the
In-ternet, he could also find, search and browse it more read-ily on the
Net than on a LAN or, for that matter, he might have pointed out, Gates's
own hard drive or CD-ROM. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The error of all the critics of the $500 teleputer is their assumption that
it will be inferior to current PCs. It will be, they claim, a PC minus a
fast CPU, short a high-reso-lution monitor, without a fast memory or large
drive. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This assumption misses the compounding impact of mi-crocosm and telecosm.
The advance of chip technology through Moore's Law, together with the advance
of net-work bandwidth, will endow a machine not inferior but hugely more
powerful, than the most supercharged Pentium workstation on a local-area
network linked to the Internet at ISDN speeds. The Law of the Microcosm
ordains that one-chip sys-tems will be better, not worse, than intersecting
boards strewn with devices linked by wires and buses. As Wilf Cor-rigan,
chief of LSI Logic, observes, &quot;From calculators to cellular phones,
every time a system has moved onto a sin-gle chip, it has wreaked havoc
with the existing industry.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IN PREPARING THE WAY for one-chip teleputers, Medin con-cedes that the current
Inter-net will not support broadband services. &quot;You link a broad-band
modem to the existing Internet and what you get is an impedance mismatch&quot;-a
bunch of fire hoses attached to a network of garden hoses. In order to accommodate
the fire hoses of @Home, Medin will have to enlarge the band-width of the
Net, from the humblest service provider to the NAPs at the top of the net-work
hierarchy, where the leading service providers join to &quot;peer and exchange&quot;
data. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Leasing capacity from the telephone companies, @Home will create a new broadband
network linking to the existing NAPs at MAE East in Tyson's Corner, Va.,
at the Sprint NAP in Pennsauken, N.J., and at MAE West in Mountain View.
This will expand the capacity of the so-called Internet back-bone (in fact,
an ever-shifting array of virtual vertebrae), which currently works with
maximum pipes running at 45 megabits per second. Over the next two years,
Medin plans to upgrade his backbone to 622 megabits a second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important and revolutionary, though, are Medin's plans for the local
loops and service providers of the Net. Contrary to the claims of many critics
that the Internet PC implies a return to the now-discredited model of the
main-frame and dumb terminals, @Home resolutely distributes intelligence
and memory through the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of the @Home system is ingenious hierar-chical memory management
and caching to conceal the mazes of slow routers, sluggish switches and
narrowband wires that lurk treacherously among the higher reaches of the
Internet. Indeed, when Doerr finally got through to Medin and, with Will
Hearst, first proposed cable modems to him, he said they wouldn't work.
There would be &quot;im-pedance mismatches&quot; with the hardware and software
in the rest of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This kind of blew the air out of their tires,&quot; says Medin. &quot;But
then I told them how the system could work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You have to think of it as a distributed computer sys-tem. In such
systems, every processor cannot access memory at once. You build caches
and shared-memory pro-tocols and you mirror and replicate a lot of the data
so that it's always available locally. That's what you're going to have
to do on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other words, the Internet is a computer on a plan-et. Like a computer
on a chip, its raw bandwidth cannot handle the necessary throughput. Thus
its communica-tions depend on ingenious hierarchical memory manage-ment,
with registers, buffers, latches, caches and direct-memory access controllers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Studies of Internet use show that some 80% of the traffic is still local.
If a particular Web page is popular in a particular locality, you have to
have that page in the hard drive or even in RAM on a local server. You have
to use the multicast ca-pabilities of cable to broadcast popular information
to all ad-dresses. Above all, you have to make the system scalable. You
have to phase in bandwidth, moving fiber links and nodes deeper into neighborhoods
as demand rises. All this is per-fectly possible technically, Medin assured
Doerr. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;After I was through, they decided they had to hire me. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I still thought we would have to build all the software ourselves.
I didn't know Netscape was thinking the same way. But I went down to Netscape
and got together with Marc Andreessen, who is a friend, and we had a real
mind-meld on all this stuff. They were doing the software already. Netscape
became our main software partner. It turned out that their browser is de-signed
for multicast. And their proxy server is great for caching information and
delivering it to users on demand.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin thinks that a key to making the system work is to distribute lots
of cache through all the local points of presence. With this kind of network,
the teleputer might become not only far cheaper but also far superior to
today's PC. A now famous Gartner Group study shows that the average office
PC costs $40,000 over five years when you factor in software and network
maintenance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps 75% of cumulative PC costs now come from staff support. @Home will
supply tech support, mainte-nance and storage more efficiently, whether
centrally by phone or at local headends. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a glimpse of the future, visit Boston College, where cable modems supplied
by Continental Cablevision are already becoming &quot;addictive&quot; to
many students and professors. On the basis of this experience, Forrester
Re-search is now predicting sales of some 7 million cable modems by the
turn of the century. Medin thinks this es-timate is conservative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With cable modems you will come to demand wireless connectivity throughout
your home or small office, so that your teleputers can link to the Net wherever
they are with-out plugging them in to a connector or dialing up a connection.
Only cable can accomodate such demands. &quot;Internet PCs fit with @Home
like ice cream and hot fudge,&quot; sums up Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the big question: Is it possible to build such a machine? &quot;Sure
it is,&quot; says Medin. &quot;Just take a Sony PlayStation, essentially
based on a one-chip ASIC, and re-place the CD-ROM connec-tor with an Ethernet
adapter. You'll get 3D graphics, Dol-by III sound, a 30-megahertz CPU controller,
a memory-access controller, and a 10-megabit-per-second 10BaseT link to
your cable headend.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
C O N S T E R N A T I O N    I N S I D E    I N T E L <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the new paradigm be-gins to threaten the cause and complacency not
only of Bill Gates but also of the other master of Wintel, Andy Grove. When
I ask him about such an ASIC so-lution to the problem of the $500 PC, consternation
breaks briefly through the surface of his bonhomie. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He snaps: &quot;I won't comment on the fantasies of Brian Halla,&quot; the
former Intel manager now executive vice-president of product marketing at
LSI Logic. Yet LSI Logic offers precisely Medin's PlayStation so-lution
to the problem of cheap teleputers, free of Wintel code. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
LSI Logic is the supplier of the workhorse chip for the PlayStation. Using
some 2 million transistors, this integrated chip combines a 30- megahertz
Silicon Graphics MIPS processor, a 60-MIPS geometry transfer engine, a direct-mem-ory
access unit, and Sony's proprietary MDEC device (for hybrid MPEG and JPEG
decompression) for full-screen video playback. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a Netstation, the MDEC would be replaced with the appropriate decompression
engines, and added to those would be Reed-Solomon and Viterbi error correction
to-gether with a cable modem module that receives 64-QAM signals and sends
QPSK. Based on its experience with the PlayStation chip, which LSI Logic
will be producing in volume on the world's first commercial 0.25-micron
fab-rication lines, LSI Logic estimates that it could sell a tele-puter
on a chip for around $50 in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This machine is the consummation of a long LSI Logic strategy. In the mid-1980s,
the company suffered a serious crisis as NEC, Fujitsu and Toshiba all opened
fast-turnaround design centers in the U.S. to deliver high-speed, high-density
gate arrays. At the same time, LSI launched a spinoff, Headland Tech-nology,
to make chipsets for PCs in competition with Chips &amp; Technologies and
VLSI Technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Supporting Headland,&quot; says Halla, &quot;was like walk-ing around
with an open artery. Intel remorselessly sucks out all the margins in PC
hardware.&quot; Chastened by the Japanese in gate ar-rays, LSI learned from
Grove not to take on Intel in PC markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To a company special-izing in gate arrays and chipsets, these lessons were
not inspiring. Then Wilf Corrigan, LSI's salty founder and CEO-a Silicon
Valley legend from Liverpool who previously played key roles at Fairchild
and Motorola-underwent a triple bypass. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
People talked of retiring him, giving him a title with a new consortium,
U.S. Memories, where he might have learned not to compete with the Koreans
in DRAMs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks after surgery, however, Corrigan returned to work at LSI and developed
a new strategy that would transcend the strategies of both Intel and the
Japanese. Under the new plan, LSI built state-of-the-art fabrication facilities
and design tools that could enable creation of a software library of &quot;Core-Ware.&quot;
CoreWare programs would generate a large variety of key functions, from
CPU kernels to signal processors and graphics engines, that could be deployed
in weeks on single special-purpose chips tailored to high-volume applications
mostly outside the Wintel ambit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By 1995, this strategy was bearing rich fruit. The com-pany announced it
had developed a fab process that could place some 49 million transistors
on a single sliver of silicon some 200 millimeters square. LSI released
a series of bellwether high-volume devices that moved the company beyond
the path of the PC, out into the network and into the consumer appliance.
The Sony PlayStation chip ran 1995's most successful CD game machine. LSI's
MPEG-2 decoder will go in the next version of RCA-Thomson's hugely successful
direct-broadcast satellite receiver. LSI also sup-plied the first ATM segmentation
and reassembly chip for several key equipment companies, and the first 100-megabit
switched-Ethernet solution for a fast Ethernet pioneer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking beyond Intel, this experience led Corrigan and Halla to conclude
that their company commanded all the crucial CoreWare ready to deploy a
teleputer on a single device manufacturable in volume for about $50. Attesting
that Halla's view is not fantasy is the success of the Sony PlayStation,
now on sale for $299, leaving room to buy a monitor and still stay under
$500. LSI also has several as-yet-unannounced design wins for cable modem
chips aimed at the markets to be opened by @Home. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel's response to such capabilities is its currently embattled program
for native signal processing. NSP allows software implementation of real-time
functions performed in special-purpose hardware under the &quot;CoreWare&quot;
model. As Grove points out, DSPs and com-pression chips may be getting cheaper
all the time, but from Indeo video to Proshare teleconferencing to Intel's
new Vertical Blanking Interval webware, NSP comes free of charge-if you
are already buying a Pentium (and you prob-ably are). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But no sooner will the CPU suck in another real-time role than a new virtual
temptation will glimmer on the hori-zon. For reaching the ever-receding
real-time goals-from continuous speech recognition to 3D rendering-the Core-Ware
approach will prevail, at least until the arrival of the new super broadband
mediaprocessors from MicroUnity and other Silicon Valley firms. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS on these far frontiers of tech-nology, John Doerr
will launch his five smooth stones as the foundation for a new industry.
With Intuit leading the move to Internet financial services, Netscape pioneering
Internet software, Macromind supplying the authoring tools for multimedia,
@Home providing the bandwidth and Sun offering Java and UltraSPARC, the
entente is on its way. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But perhaps Doerr's most important stone is Sun. Asked to name the key influences
in TCI's shift toward the Net, John Malone mentions Doerr first, hesitates
and then stress-es the role of Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems.
Relentlessly, year after year, McNealy would travel to Denver and give his
pitch to Malone: Buy sets of Sun servers and link them to your headends
in order to supply data services. At first Malone resisted. &quot;Two-way
data,&quot; he used to say, &quot;is not a business that I want to be in.&quot;
But as the Internet grew, McNealy's argument gained new force. In late 1994,
it triumphed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Malone now believes that two-way broadband com-munications is the heart
of his business. For a total in-vestment of less than $188 million, Doerr
claims @Home can launch a business yielding at least $500 million in cu-mulative
revenues by the year 2000. Later this year, the Sunnyvale system will be
up and running. Weeks later, depending on cooperation from other cable companies,
the entire state of Con-necticut will move onto broadband two-way cable.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At that point, all the other cable companies will accelerate their dri-ve
to upgrade their facilities to ac-commodate the gold rush. By the turn of
the century, @Home hopes to extend service to all the major urban and suburban
centers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Sprint, TCI leads a cable group that is paying $2 billion for wireless
personal communications service (PCS) spectrum across the country. Through
New York-based Teleport Communications and other bypass providers, TCI and
other cable firms already command fiber-optic rings through most major metropolitan
areas. With cable providing broadband backhaul for PCS, @Home's founders
think the company will emerge as the backbone for a full-service digital
communications network, including high-resolution teleconferencing, on-demand
films and other pay-per-view video, local news and school listings, classi-fied
advertisements, World Wide Web resources, and mul-timedia programming. TCI
itself is furiously upgrading and streamlining all its billing systems to
accommodate this rich transactional environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Z E R O   M A R G I N A L    M A G I C <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, as Nathan Myhrvold ex-plains, is the extension of
the computer model of flat-rate pricing into the field of communications.
When you buy a PC, you purchase its MIPS and bits essentially at a flat
rate. The average cost per MIP or bit of memory you use is de-termined by
how much you use the machine. The marginal cost is zero. As a result, people
have a powerful incentive to use computers as intensively and creatively
as possible. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This flat-rate pricing effect-where incremental costs are essentially zero-largely
explains the huge success of the general-purpose PC and the companies supplying
it with software and peripherals. Faced with a zero marginal cost of incremental
use, PC owners channel as much of their information processing, education
and entertainment as possible through the PC. Flat-rate pricing makes the
PC a dire threat to all contiguous industries and related functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, on the Internet model, you will pay a flat rate for bandwidth.
Again marginal costs will be zero. Average cost will respond to the extent
of usage rather than to a Public Utilities Commission tariff or some per-minute
charge. As Myhrvold points out, this approach will give you a tremendous
incentive to exploit bandwidth as fully as you can, channeling as much communication
as possible away from systems that charge incrementally and toward flat-rate
systems. In the end, nearly all communications will gravitate toward the
Internet model, and companies will prosper to the extent that they can ally
themselves with this tremendous force of creativity and economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Myhrvold now says that bandwidth is growing at the same pace as Moore's
Law. Gates, too, though long alert to the effects of exponentials in semiconductors,
is strange-ly blind to the faster trajec-tory of communications. He finds
the Internet a big sur-prise: &quot;Who predicted it?&quot; he asks. &quot;Let's
find the guy and make him king.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But by any measure- nodes, total bandwidth, traf-fic- the Internet has been
dou-bling every year since 1970, and many people have pre-dicted that it
would come to dominate communications. I prophesied in 1989 that it would
usurp television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today I believe the band-width tidal wave will sweep away the notions of
Gates and Myhrvold of a smooth middleband transition for Microsoft and its
boob-tube collaborators. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Increasingly released from regulatory restrictions, band-width is now expanding
far faster than MIPS and bits (see <I>Forbes ASAP</I>, &quot;The Bandwidth
Tidal Wave,&quot; Dec. 5, 1994). Over the next five years, for example,
@Home will increase the bandwidth to home- and small-business computers
by a factor of thousands. While Moore's Law doubles com-puter power every
18 months, the law of the telecosm, by the most conservative possible measure,
doubles total band-width every 12 months. This adds up. Over the next decade,
computers will im-prove a hundredfold while bandwidth will expand a thou-sandfold.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until this year, the computer and software industries have drafted behind
Moore's Law, while hiding behind what Roger McNamee has dubbed &quot;Moron's
Law&quot;-the telecom regulations that stifle bandwidth expansion. The industry
thus has thrived by employing MIPS and bits as a replacement for bandwidth
by using compression, de-compression, switching speed, and logic circuitry
to make up for the constrained bandwidth of public networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove capped off this tradition in early October, in a memorable keynote
address, following South African pres-ident Nelson Mandela to the podium,
at the Telecom 95 quadrennial exposition in Geneva. Grove wowed the large
audience of telco potentates with an on-stage real-time demonstration of
Intel's Proshare teleconferencing tech-nology. And yet, what chiefly struck
the viewer was the mediocrity of the partial-screen facial images. They
were far lower in resolution than ordinary television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As long as the pictures are inferior to TV images, PC teleconferencing will
remain chiefly a niche or a stunt. As bandwidth expands powerful-ly over
the next decade, it will seem increasingly perverse to substitute processing
for band-width, and more and more inviting to substitute band-width for
processing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The logic of MIPS and bandwidth works both ways. Not only can processing
make up for bandwidth, but bandwidth, as Claude Shan-non pointed out in
1948, can serve as a substitute for switching and other comput-er functions.
With bandwidth now expanding faster than processing speeds, new ar-chitectures
will prevail by substituting bandwidth for MIPS and bits. Today, the bulk
of bandwidth to homes is coaxial cable laid over the last 25 years by the
cable tele-vision industry. Exploiting that bandwidth for the Inter-net
is the single greatest opportunity in the history of in-formation technology.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
HAVING ASCERTAINED that Doerr had been meeting reg-ularly with all the pioneers
of the new paradigm that Andreessen was &quot;mind-melding&quot; with Medin,
and that Mal-one had been consulting with Doerr and McNealy, I ask McNealy
whether he has talked to Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No,&quot; he answers, &quot;I have not talked with Medin at all ...
since lunch on Wednesday. But back then he and I had sore necks from basically
agreeing with what the other was saying. We're fighting like crazy to become
the standard platform for Medin's environment. Our companies are in-credibly
well aligned. We have a list of about 12 engineering efforts that we are
undertaking and driving at Medin's request. The power of a network comes
from the number of nodes times the bandwidth. By this measure, the @Home
opportunity is as big as there is.&quot; McNealy revealed that the day before
in his office at Sun, he saw the demo of &quot;a diskless, CD-less, floppyless,
OS-less computer, and it was great. It had just about every bus, serial
and parallel and S-bus, and every kind of interface you can imagine. With
connectors on all four sides, it was a model for what I call a zero-administration
client. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Consider: If you give a user a disk drive, a CD, a floppy, an OS and
16 megabytes of memory, you have made him, whether he wants it or not, a
system administrator. He has so many resources to manage. What they showed
me yesterday was a virtual machine written in Java, and it booted up instantly
off flash ROM and ran like crazy be-cause the virtual machine rides so close
on the hardware.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Echoing Medin and Corrigan, McNealy evoked the future of the teleputer:
&quot;Put a touch screen on it and make it a kiosk, put a large screen on
it and make it a worksta-tion, put in an infrared detector and make it a
set-top box, put a joystick on it and make a game machine, put a cable modem
or an ISDN port on it and make it a PC or a digital phone. You never run
out of disk space; you never have to back it up; it's mirrored so you never
lose your files. You have an uninterruptible power supply. Your phone or
cable line is much more reliable than your hard drive on your PC. You get
used to the security of the system with no disks to corrupt and with Java
programs that execute only in a virtual machine and cannot invade your system.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
McNealy might have added, in ecumenical concern for Larry Ellison's mother,
&quot;Put in some Oracle code and you have a terrific, cheap database client
in an emerging world of far-flung databases.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the participants in the new regime agree. Combined with a broadband
network, the teleputer will be more flex-ible and powerful than existing
PCs. Rolling out both the network and the teleputer will be the central
activity in the industry over the next two years. Responding to it will
be the principal challenge to Gates and Grove, and possibly a route of redemption
for their companies. All the leading figures in this Silicon Valley renaissance
have endured recent periods of trial and failure. Malone suf-fered the collapse
of his Bell Atlantic merger in 1994 and the long stagnation of his stock.
Corrigan suffered physical collapse and the slump of his company. McNealy
endured a long tunnel of shrinking market share as his SuperSPARC processor
proved too complex to keep pace with rivals. Clark of Netscape lost influence
at Silicon Graphics, the company he had founded, and finally had to leave
in order to retain his self-respect. Even Doerr lost his touch for several
years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Bill Gates, however, business life has been an al-most unrelenting ascent
toward riches untold for one so young. In the end, his success has made
him seem a bionic business leader leached of his humanity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
His company has appeared to government and to competitors alike as a monopoly
threat, targeting existing rivals and systematically suppressing them, rather
than creating new products and industries. Much the same is said of Intel.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps this is the time for the Wintel team to face a domestic challenge.
From it they may well emerge stronger. Without them, it is clear, the Internet
will be weaker. Only from the crucible of competition between paradigms
can emerge a robust and redemptive new economy of information. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>WILL THE INTERNET COLLAPSE? NO WAY!</CENTER>
</H3>
What is all this commotion in Massachusetts? The very source of the Arpanet
at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman--the cradle of the Internet--Massachusetts
is falling to the forces of Auntie Spiker and Aunt Sponge.<BR>
<BR>
These are the mingy ladies in the Roald Dahl story who rejoiced in James's
Giant Peach as long as it didn't take flight. Now Massachusetts--the state
that once barred Apple shares as a likely West Coast levitation scam--looks
askance at the Giant Peach of the Internet, aloft in Silicon Valley and
around the globe, with James Clark, James Gosling, Netscape and a series
of thin-air IPOs.<BR>
<BR>
Howard Anderson of Boston's Yankee Group, long an Internet tout, thinks
those wired yahoos on Wall Street and Sand Hill Road are blind to the inevitable
sine waves of advance: What goes up must come down, he sternly avers, trying
to bring some simple physics to the scene, as if the Internet has to obey
the law of gravity.<BR>
<BR>
And now Bob Metcalfe--Metcalfe himself!--inventor of Ethernet, pioneer of
Arpanet and the founding father of the networking era. Here he is, prophesying
lugubriously into every megaphone he can grasp, from the New York Times
Magazine and PBS to U.S. News &amp; World Report and InfoWorld, that the
Internet will collapse in 1996. Metcalfe now predicts a general retreat
to Intranets, shielded from the public system and unavailable to it.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe was striking a blow against the very solar plexus of my prophecies.
I had founded my confidence in the Internet on the continuing power of the
law of the telecosm, an edict adapted from Metcalfe's very own law of networks.
Metcalfe's Law ordains that the value of a network rises by the square of
the number of terminals attached to it.<BR>
<BR>
In its most basic form, this law merely captures the exponential rise in
the value of any network device, such as a telephone, with the rise in the
number of other such devices reachable by it. Metcalfe, however, shrewdly
added in the declining cost of Ethernet adapters and other network gear
as the Net expanded. In the law of the telecosm, I summed up these and other
learning-curve factors by incorporating into Metcalfe's Law the law of the
microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the power-delay product in semiconductors, the law of the microcosm
ordains that the cost-effectiveness of the terminals will rise by the square
of the number of additional transistors integrated on a single chip. Amplified
by the law of the microcosm, the law of the telecosm signifies the rise
in the cost-effectiveness of a network in proportion to the resources deployed
on it and the number of potential nodes and routers available to it.<BR>
<BR>
As the network expands, each new computer both uses it as a resource and
contributes resources to it. This is the secret of the stability of the
Internet. The very process of growth that releases avalanches of new traffic
onto the Net precipitates a cascade of new capacity at Internet service
providers (ISPs). They supply new servers and routers, open new routes and
pathways for data across the Web, and buy new terminals and edge switches
to upgrade their connections to the Network Access Points (NAPs), the Internet
supernodes that in turn exert pressure on the backbone vendors to expand
their own bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Because all these routes and resources are interlinked, they are available
to absorb excess traffic caused by outages, crashes or congestion elsewhere
on the Net. Because all these resources are growing in cost-effectiveness
at the exponential pace of the law of the microcosm, and total available
bandwidth on the Net is rising at the still-faster pace of the law of the
telecosm, the Internet has been able to double in size annually since 1970
and increase its traffic two times faster still, without suffering any crippling
crashes beyond the Morris worm of 1988.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling the growth of the largest interconnected network, the law of the
telecosm means that the most open computer networks will prevail. Proprietary
networks lose to a worldwide web.<BR>
<BR>
<B>LOADED FOR BEAR </B><BR>
<BR>
I wanted to answer Metcalfe's challenge. As the apparent winner of a previous
argument over ATM and Ethernet [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Metcalfe's Law and
Legacy,&quot; Sept. 13, 1993], I thought I might have an edge (after all,
Fast Ethernet outsells ATM at least 20 to 1). But when he met me on a rainy
day late in May at his Boston townhouse on Beacon Street, where he looks
benevolently across the Charles at the mit campus, Metcalfe was loaded for
Internet bear. At the peak of his influence, this smiling cover boy of June's
ieee Spectrum, winner of the 1996 ieee Medal of Honor, was ready to explain.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am way out on a limb here,&quot; he says over sushi and wasabi at
a restaurant near his house. &quot;I actually told a World Wide Web conference
I would eat my column if the Internet didn't collapse....<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do I mean by a collapse? Well, the FCC requires telcos to report
all outages that affect more than 50,000 lines for more than an hour. I
mean something much bigger than that.&quot; I suggested that with enough
raw tuna and wasabi, his column would go down well. But Metcalfe was dead
serious.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet will collapse and it will be good for us, and for the Net.
&quot;The collapse has a purpose. The Internet is currently in the clutches
of superstition, promoted by a bio-anarchic intelligentsia, which holds
that the Net is wonderfully chaotic and brilliantly biological, and homeopathically
self-healing by processes of natural selection and osmosis. The purpose
of the collapse will be to discredit this ideology.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What the Internet is--surprise, surprise--is a network of computers.
It needs to be managed, engineered and financed as a network of computers
rather than as an unfathomable biological organism.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's intellectual targets are not hard to find. He dubs them the &quot;Wired
intelligentsia, epitomized by Nicholas Negroponte,&quot; and, one supposes,
author/editor Kevin Kelly and hippie mystic seer John Perry Barlow, celebrating
a &quot;neo-biological civilization out of control.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For example, at a recent meeting of NANOG (North American Network Operations
Group), whenever Metcalfe brought up the problems of Internet management--the
need for a settlements-and-payments process so that people who invest in
the Net backbone can get their money back--&quot;they kept telling me to
get lost.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They'd tell me, 'You just don't get it, do you?' This is the worst
possible charge of the politically correct: 'You just don't get it.' The
implication is that I am a clueless newbie.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But I am not a newbie and I do get it: an accelerating pattern of
wild behavior on the Internet [caused by] a breakdown of any relationship
between supply and demand for Internet services, any way of metering usage,
any method of paying back people who invest in the backbone. One thing is
sure: They will not be paid by biofeedback loops.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The result is bad--the deterioration of the public Internet and the
rise of private Intranets. These are not really part of the Internet at
all. Many of them use 'hot potato routing,' throwing any messages from nonsubscribers
back into the pot. It is a tragedy of the commons, a shrinkage of the public
network on which we all ultimately depend.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Since I had frequently cited Metcalfe's Law as an answer to &quot;The Tragedy
of the Commons&quot; argument, this charge hit home.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe warns that &quot;back when Internet backbones carried 15 terabytes
of traffic per month, the world's Ethernet capacity was 15 exabytes per
month, a million times higher.&quot; (Exabytes, if you wonder, add up. While
a terabyte is a 1 with 12 zeros after it, an exabyte commands 18 zeros.)
But those were last year's numbers. Carrier of some 40% of backbone traffic,
MCI now reports 250 terabytes per month. Just a small shift in local traffic
onto the public Net can create catastrophic cascades of congestion.<BR>
<BR>
With private networks increasingly becoming TCP/IP Intranets that can use
the Internet but shield their resources from it by &quot;firewalls,&quot;
the likelihood of a crippling cascade from private to public Nets grows
more acute every day. According to Metcalfe, one way or another, such a
disaster is now at hand.<BR>
<BR>
His primary evidence is data from the Routing Arbiter at Merit (the Michigan
group that commands routing servers at every NAP and collects Internet statistics
by &quot;pinging&quot; routers across the Net every few minutes). Merit's
pings yield an echo of chaos: &quot;a dramatic, accelerating rise of packet
losses, delays and routing instability. This data is available on the Net.
But the Merit people are afraid of making waves, offending the big carriers,
so they don't really tell anyone how bad it is.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I ask my readers [at InfoWorld], and they tell me they think the Net
has already collapsed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As the North American guild of network operators, what does NANOG need?
I asked. &quot;One thing NANOG definitely needs,&quot; sums up Metcalfe,
&quot;is more people in suits.&quot; The trouble with NANOG is that it is
full of biomystics with big beards and Birkenstocks who look like Bob Metcalfe
did when he finally got his Ph.D. from Harvard after a dramatic setback
the year before, when his thesis board flunked him at the last minute.<BR>
<BR>
(Perhaps it was because he &quot;hated Harvard&quot; and spent all his time
at mit and Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, laying the foundations for the Internet
with Larry Roberts rather than sitting humbly at the feet of Crimson computer
scientists refining their professorial perks and queues. Republished in
June under the title Packet Communication, with a new introduction from
the author, Metcalfe's thesis is now recognized as a classic text on networking
that anticipated most of the evolution from the Arpanet to the Internet.
In the front of the new edition is a picture of Metcalfe as a newbie at
the Harvard commencement, with a big beard and a weird shirt and jacket,
looking kind of like a bio-anarchic, Harvard-hating Hawaiian homeopath himself,
ready to help start the Internet movement back in 1973.)<BR>
<BR>
What does this all mean? The conversion of Bill Gates into an Internet obsessive.
The jeremiads of Metcalfe, one of my favorite people in the industry, both
as a technical seer and conservative economic voice in a webby-minded wilderness.
What do I make of the descent into vapor of several of my favored technologies
and the admitted biodegradation of the Net?<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEW SCARCITY, NEW ABUNDANCE</B><BR>
<BR>
Rather than debating this apparent jumble of conjectures--and for a second
time jousting with the Olympian Metcalfe--I would instead transcend the
details in a larger theme: Marking every industrial and economic transformation
are new forms of scarcity and new forms of abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Economics has been termed the dismal science of scarcity. Indeed, scarcity
is at the heart of most economic models; many of my critics still live in
the grip of the dismal scarcities and zero sums of pre-Netic economics.
But what is the controlling scarcity of an information age? In the Industrial
Age, natural resources and real estate were scarce. But Julian Simon of
the University of Maryland has shown that, as manifested by falling real
prices, all natural resources, such as foodstuffs, minerals, clean air and
available water and energy, have been increasing in abundance over the last
century.<BR>
<BR>
If conventional resources are becoming more abundant, what is the ruling
scarcity of the information era? Is it information? Hardly. The information
glut has become a ruling clich&Egrave;. As all resources--from energy to
information--become more abundant, the pressure of economic scarcity falls
ever more heavily on one key residual, and that single shortage looms ever
more stringent and controlling. The governing scarcity of the information
economy is time: the shards of a second, the hours in a day, the years in
a life, the latency of memory, the delay in aluminum wires, the time to
market, the time to metastasis, the time to retirement.<BR>
<BR>
The ruling scarcities in the economy of time, however, can be distilled
to two commanding limits: the speed of light and the span of life. They
form the boundaries of all enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
The speed of light is the most basic constraint in information technology.
As a key limit, the speed of light shapes the future architectures and topologies
of computers and communications. For example, the light-speed limit dictates
that the fastest computers will tend to be the smallest computers. Electrons
move nine inches a nanosecond (a billionth of a second). As computers move
toward gigahertz clock rates--a billion cycles a second--the longest data
path must be decisively smaller than nine inches. Pulses of electromagnetic
energy--photons--take some 20 milliseconds to cross the country and one-quarter
second to reach a satellite in geostationary orbit (as you notice in a satellite
phone call). At a gigabit per second, this means that as many as 250 megabits
of data--many thousands of IP packets, for example--can be latent (or lost)
in transit at any time, thus playing havoc with most prevalent network protocols,
such as TCP.<BR>
<BR>
Thus light speed is a centrifuge. It abhors concentration in one place,
ordains that these small supercomputers will be distributed across the globe
and will always be near to a network node. Although the networks will be
global in reach, they will depend on the principle of locality: the tendency
of memory or network accesses to focus on clusters of contiguous addresses
at any one time. Light speed imposes limits on the pace of any one processor
or conduit, and pushes both computer and communications technologies into
increasingly parallel and redundant architectures.<BR>
<BR>
As a governing scarcity in the new economy, no less important than the speed
of light is the span of life. Just as light speed represents the essential
limits of information technology, lifespan defines the essential shortage
of human time. Although medical and other health-related advances have increased
the span of life in the United States some 5 years in the last 25--while
the media focused on aids and cancer, and zero-sum pundits declared that
our descendants, the scions of our science, will live less well than we
do--the ultimate lifespan remains limited. Indeed, the modal economic activity
of the information economy is exploitation of the technologies of the speed
of light to increase the effective span of life by increasing efficiency
in the use of time.<BR>
<BR>
GDP and other economic numbers from the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) totally miss the minting of new time through innovation: the opening
of parallel universes of choice in ideas, courses, arts, letters, entertainments,
therapies and communities. Finding stagnation and poverty and agonizing
over new wealth, Morgan Stanley gapologist Stephen Roach plumbs the shallows
of NIPA for all the world like the CIA economists who found the Soviets
exceeding the United States in growth for 17 years. Video teleconferencing,
telecommuting, teleputing, digital wireless telephony, Internet mail, cybercommerce,
telemedicine and teleducation all are in the process of compressing the
span of life toward the increasingly thronged channels of the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
If time is scarce, what is the growing and defining source of abundance
among all the material abundances in the information economy? Signifying
the definitive abundance in any economic era is the plummeting price of
a key factor of production. In order to grow fast, every new-era company
must exploit the drop in the cost of the newly abundant resource. Companies
that use the resource that is plummeting in cost will gain market share
against all other companies and will come increasingly to dominate the economy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FROM WATTS TO MIPS AND BITS</B><BR>
<BR>
Over the last hundred years, there have been three such economic eras. The
industrial era fed on the plummeting price of physical force or energy,
best measured in watts. Some 30 years ago, with the regulatory sclerosis
of the nuclear and natural gas industries, the price of watts began to plateau,
dropping less than 0.7% per year for the last 35 years. The last 30 years
brought the reign of the microcosm, which fed on the plummeting price of
transistors, manifested in the exponential drop in the cost of computer
MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and memory bits. For the last
30 years, the price of a bit of semiconductor memory has dropped 68% per
year. With this year's decline in DRAM prices, the trend line is being resumed
after a four-year hiatus. The likely result is a sharp upside surprise in
PC sales--and thus in chips--through 1997.<BR>
<BR>
As fast as the price of MIPS and bits continues to drop, however, this Moore's
Law trend line will no longer dominate the economy. Like a great river headed
for a falls, a new factor of production is racing toward a historic cliff
of costs. Over the next 30 years, the spearhead of wealth creation will
be the telecosm, marked by the plummeting cost of bandwidth--communications
power--measured in gigabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
This result means that the growth of bandwidth will outpace the growth of
processor power. After an entire career keyed on Moore's Law, Bill Gates
remains skeptical, foreseeing an era of middleband nets, with shared cables
bogging down in gigabytes from tomcruise. com/vrml and fiber gushing into
twisted copper cul-de-sacs. The usually savvy Network Computing columnist
Bill Frezza believes that bandwidth is inherently a slower-moving technology
than processing, because bandwidth has to be delivered at once to an entire
area while processors can be sold one at a time. Robert Lucky, Bell system
laureate, and Paul Green of IBM debated these points two decades ago. Stressing
the dependence of bandwidth on the labor-intensive digging of trenches and
stretching of wires across continents and under seabeds, Lucky doubted that
communications could ever be truly cheap. Paul Green, a computer network
man, thought that digital computer communications could join the Moore's
Law learning curve.<BR>
<BR>
The evidence mounts that Green was more than right. Impressed by Green's
own achievements in fiber optics, Lucky now acknowledges that communications
power will grow at least tenfold more than computing power over the next
decade. Using the rough metric of Moore's Law, computer power doubles every
18 months. Bandwidth is now doubling at least every year. Over a 10-year
period, this means a hundredfold rise in computer power and at least a thousandfold
rise in bandwidth, measured at any point in the network from the home to
the backbone.<BR>
<BR>
The reason communications power has lagged behind computer power is not
the difference in technology but in regulation. Moore's Law in bandwidth
has given way to what venture capitalist Roger McNamee calls Moron's Law,
the labyrinthine tangle of tariffs and rulings and FCC dockets that frustrate
the implementation of communications advances. With an acceleration of technology
and a tsunami of new Internet demand for bandwidth, this bottleneck is breaking
at last.<BR>
<BR>
Backbone capacity is leaping upward today. As TCP/IP coinventor Vinton Cerf
of MCI told Forbes ASAP in December, his company correctly predicted its
backbone bandwidth would increase from 45 megabits per second to 155 megabits
per second this year, or by a factor of nearly four. But on March 11, MCI
Vice-President of Enterprise Marketing Stephen VonRump told Gordon Cook
of the Cook Report on the Internet that MCI will jack up the speeds to 622
megabits per second before the end of the year, or nearly fifteenfold in
one year. Meanwhile, cable modems, telco Digital Subscriber Line technologies
(from HDSL to ADSL and SDSL) and digital wireless advances promise even
larger factors of expansion in the bandwidth to homes, though unlike the
backbone expansion, the impact will be incremental.<BR>
<BR>
Shaping the future, however, will be breakthroughs in laboratories. As &quot;Into
the Fibersphere&quot; maintained, the ultimate source of bandwidth expansion
is the immense capacity of optical fiber. Now comprising a global installed
base of 40 million miles (some 25 million miles in North America), each
optical fiber, as Paul Green of IBM estimated to Forbes ASAP four years
ago, commands an intrinsic available bandwidth of 25,000 gigahertz. At the
time, the world record transmission over a significant distance was still
approximately 20 gigabits per second, and the highest deployed capacity
was just 2.5 gigabits per second. Moreover, the light pulses had to be converted
to electronic pulses every 50 to 70 kilometers to amplify and regenerate
the signal. This electronic bottleneck restricted the speed of long-distance
transmission to the maximum speed of the optoelectronics, or some 10 gigahertz.
So Green's projections provoked incredulity in many quarters.<BR>
<BR>
Early this year, however, Green's visions were becoming more plausible.
On Feb. 26, 1996, at the conference on Optical Fiber Communication (OFC
'96) in San Jose, Calif., papers from Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs, Fujitsu
and NTT Labs all reported successful transmissions at a landmark rate of
a terabit per second, one twenty-fifth of Green's limit. For these terabit
rates, Fujitsu and Bell Labs used between 50 and 55 separate bitstreams
or wavelengths, each some 20 gigabits per second. NTT, which employed 10
separate bitstreams, also reported diffraction grating receivers that could
resolve 64 different wavelengths at once.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers were smashing the electronic
bottleneck. Impelled by a pump laser (light amplification by stimulated
emission of radiation), these all-optical amplifiers are now being deployed
in networks around the world. They open a new era. Simple broadband amplifiers
made of a coiled fiber thread, they replace optoelectronic repeaters comprising
nine custom bipolar microchips that must be duplicated for every frequency
or modulation scheme used in the fiber. Thus the new amplifiers make possible
the creation of vast broadband fiber networks bearing hundreds or even thousands
of separate carriers, and permit the sending of thousands of separate messages
around the globe or under the seas entirely on wings of light. The bandwidth
of these all-optical amplifiers is now up to 4.5 terahertz, or close to
20% of Green's estimated limit.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate capacity of fiber is not a merely academic issue. At a rate
of 4,000 miles a day, fiber deployment is beginning to make a dent in neighborhoods.
David Charlton of Corning estimates that over the past five years, the top
10% of U.S. households, comprising most of the early technology adopters,
have drastically improved their access to fiber. Five years ago these homes
were, on average, 1,000 households away from a fiber node; this year, they
are just 100 households away. Milo Medin of @Home estimates that 15% of
U.S. cable TV subscribers had systems directly connected to fiber nodes
at the beginning of 1996. By the end of the year, that number will be close
to one-third.<BR>
<BR>
Hostility to cable TV remains high and politically useful; many city governments
subsist on cable TV franchise fees and regulate these companies into a stupor.
Eerily mimicking computer experts of the 1960s who attested that telephone
wires were too beset with noise and interference to carry digital data,
telco experts today pronounce cable plant entirely unsuited for Internet
bits. But the fact remains that cable TV coax is the only truly broadband
link already in most U.S. homes.<BR>
<BR>
Flaws in the transmission of analog video, in which every glitch of interference
is visible on the screen, fall away in digital systems that can deliver
flawless images at a signal-to-noise ratio more than 1,000 times lower.
Directv, for example, does not outperform cable TV because it is harder
to send a signal a few thousand feet down a coaxial cable than to zap it
to a satellite 23,600 miles away, beam it to an 18-inch dish on a roof,
then send it down a coaxial cable to your TV. The superiority of Directv
derives from its digital nature. Essentially, the picture is created in
the set rather than at the station. Using a variety of new cable modems,
possibly including Cisco and Terayon's CDMA for upstream signals (CDMA finesses
interfering frequencies by spreading codes through them all), cable TV plant
will prove to be entirely adequate for digital transmissions, both upstream
and downstream.<BR>
<BR>
But what about switching, ask the critics of cable? Claude Shannon of mit
and Bell Labs, the inventor of information theory, had the answer in 1948:
Bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Rather than performing the processing
at some central point, you use routers in the Net and filters in the terminals.
If you have adequate bandwidth, you can emulate any switching topology you
want. Cable commands a potential of some 8 gigabits per second of two-way
bandwidth. Linked to the potential terabits of fiber bandwidth, cable plant
has as much chance of accommodating the explosive growth of the Internet
as the telcos do. <BR>
<BR>
The two essential models for the distribution of information are select
and switch or broadcast and select. Select and switch is based on intelligence
in central servers that search databases for desired material, and on intelligence
in switches that channel the material to the desired address. Select and
switch uses computer power at the servers and switches to compensate for
the lack of bandwidth on the network and the lack of storage and processing
power in the terminals. By contrast, broadcast and select is based on bandwidth
in the network and on intelligence and storage in the terminals. <BR>
<BR>
Envisaging video servers, information warehouses and other centralized schemes,
select and switch is the model pursued by much of the industry today. In
some schemes, agents from networked terminals search through large banks
of data looking for specified items, which are switched through the network
to the terminals. Computers reach out and grab data they need from servers
with large storage facilities.<BR>
<BR>
Epitomized by the World Wide Web today, the marvels of this select-and-switch
model are evident to us all. It is far superior for personal two-way communications
and one-to-one file transfers. But it is not superior for everything, as
companies trying to send movies point-to-point over ATM switches discovered
in Orlando and elsewhere. The success of select and switch, using the storage
of servers, has been too total for the health of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
In its extreme form, select and switch contravenes the laws of the microcosm
and telecosm. These laws will increase storage at the terminals far faster
than at the centralized server and will expand the network's bandwidth faster
than its switching capability. For many uses, the broadcast-and-select method
is appropriate--indeed, inevitable--and its spread will relieve many of
the pressures on Internet capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Broadcast and select is the system used in wavelength division multiplexing
systems in the new multi-bitstream terabit-per-second fiber tests. Broadcast
and select conforms closely with the strengths of the cable system. In late
April, for example, Wave Systems (where I serve as a director) launched
its Cablepc project in the heart of Silicon Valley with the Palo Alto Cable
Co-op. Supporting the test are 26 other companies with equipment and services,
including cable modems from Com21 and En Technology; a merchandising engine
from Zero.one; the Destination PC/TV from Gateway 2000; game machines from
mak Technologies; and content from Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive, Network
News, William Morris Agency, Microsoft's interactive software arm and an
array of CD-ROM publishers. <BR>
<BR>
This system uses cable bandwidth to broadcast huge amounts of digital information
and entertainment. Originating anywhere from the World Wide Web and Directv
satellites to CD-ROMs on a PC, the rush of bits will be filtered and downloaded
by the PC at the programmable specifications of the viewer. Customers pay
for material by the piece and only when they choose to decrypt it through
an onboard &quot;credit chip&quot; or WaveMeter that may be periodically
tapped over telephone lines from a transaction center. Rather than millions
of people downloading new versions of Netscape one at a time over 28.8 modems,
for example, you can program your machine to download all new Netscape browser
releases to your hard drive when they are broadcast, probably late at night.
The next day you can decide whether to buy, save or delete the program.
Explains new Wave Systems president Steven Sprague, &quot;This system creates
a new channel where the customer pays only for what is used, when it is
used, and the owner of intellectual property benefits from each use.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Together with systems of mirroring, replicating and local buffering being
pioneered by @Home, the Cablepc project is one of many ways to use cable
bandwidth to relieve pressure on the Net and to exploit the ever-rising
intelligence and storage in the terminals. Other broadcast-and-select systems
include PointCast for the PC, which uses the screensaver as a way to display
programmably filtered news and other information. Another large contribution
of broadcast-and-select bandwidth for the WWW will come from digital satellite
systems, such as Directv, that devote channels to Internet services.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, coming to the rescue of the Net backbone are an array of technologies
incorporating asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), an elaborate set of standards
for broadband switching. Supported by some 800 companies in the ATM Forum,
ATM resembles RISC (reduced instruction set computer), which accelerates
speeds by making all instructions the same length and processing them in
silicon. Similarly, ATM breaks all data into 53 byte cells, small enough
to be processed in a semiconductor chip at speeds fast enough to accept
voice, video or data at once. Conceived as an end-to-end system from your
phone or PC through the &quot;cloud&quot; to your Internet service provider
and beyond, ATM seems a panacea for the protocol zoo emerging in data communications.<BR>
<BR>
ATM to the desktop faces dire challenges, however. Paul Green noticed that
the most popular booth at the early May ATM Year '96 conference in San Jose
was by a company called Ipsilon. Now partnering with Hitachi, Ipsilon makes
an IP switch that dispenses with all ATM software and uses ATM cells only
for fast hardware switching. Similarly, NetStar [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Angst
and Awe on the Internet,&quot; Dec. 4, 1995], now being purchased by Ascend
Communications for $300 million in stock, offers an IP crossbar switch in
gallium arsenide with a backplane throughput of 16 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, vendors of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet attracted increasing
attention. Why transform your network when you can get most of the advantages
of ATM through new forms of Ethernet and TCP/IP? But in one form or another,
ATM switches are still the fastest switches and use their advantage in silicon
integration to dominate the top-of-the-line slots in the backbone of the
Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>REVENGE OF BEARDS AND BIRKENSTOCKS</B><BR>
<BR>
The readers of Forbes ASAP will recall Gordon Jacobson and Avi Freedman,
East Coast ISPs who have graced these pages contemplating a national network.
Tonight, in New York, they are debating the future of the Net with each
other and with two executives from a San Diego company called AtmNet who
have similar ambitions. I am there to get a view from the pits of the Internet
on Metcalfe's lament. Jacobson has a problem, though. He wants to take us
to Le Colonial on East 57th Street, which he describes as the hottest bar
and best French-Vietnamese restaurant in the city. But the bearded Avi Freedman
has shown up in a green T-shirt and Birkenstock sandals, which won't cut
it at Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
A second-floor hideaway, Le Colonial looks like Rick's place in Casablanca,
so they say, and it sounds like a bar on the Champs-Elysees. More important
to guru Gordon, it allows him to flaunt a tycoon's cigar, unlike P.J. Clarke's,
his other favored haunt, which has succumbed to nicotine correctness since
Dan Jenkins's novel on the Giants, Semi-Tough, celebrated its smoke and
grit. Unlike P.J. Clarke's with its elderly Irish trolls, Gordon tells us,
Le Colonial offers &quot;the most beautiful bartender in all New York. You
got to see her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi, though, has more important things on his mind. Polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
They're a dilemma, those polynomials. But Gordon decides to act anyway.
We will start out with dinner at Clarke's and then move on to Le Colonial
for after-dinner drinks. At the bar, Le Colonial will tolerate the T-shirt,
and perhaps, with adequate lubrication, we will be able to relieve the pressure
of the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet is in the process of a horizontal explosion, with new network
exchange points popping up everywhere--two in L.A., one each in Tucson,
Phoenix, Atlanta, Cincinnati--you name it, a hundred or more network exchange
facilities coming online. AtmNet is beginning one in San Diego and has plans
to participate in those in L.A.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the P.J. Clarke's waiter, delivering salad with home fries well
done and a Diet Pepsi, is struggling with the demands of serving different
meals to five customers (that's 25 different possibilities). With mental
buffers overflowing and packet losses mounting, he resolves on a polling
algorithm, offering the plate to each of us around the table before settling
on Avi. Gordon is looking worried; Avi is questioning his confidence that
ATM switching can resolve most of the complexity problems on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SEX AND POLYNOMIALS AT LE COLONIAL</B><BR>
<BR>
I ask whether the problem arises from scanty RAM buffers in the Cisco routers.
Avi says no. An entire global routing table still takes just 14 megabytes
and virtually everyone on the Net can now handle that. Soon they will be
able to handle a gigabyte of routes, no sweat, enough to deal with any foreseeable
growth of the Net. Yes, I observe, it's exponential; I talk about it all
the time. No, Avi corrects me, complexity growth is not exponential. It
is polynomial.<BR>
<BR>
This problem will have to wait, however, says Gordon, hailing the waiter.
It's time to leave for Le Colonial. Gordon wants Jim Browning and John Mevi
of AtmNet to explain how their ATM systems can transcend all these complexities.<BR>
<BR>
AtmNet is visiting New York to consult with Gordon and Avi about AtmNet's
plans to create a new national 155-megabit backbone across the country.
AtmNet already has a 155-megabit-per-second backbone on the West Coast connecting
San Diego, L.A. and San Francisco. But they are dependent on the caprices
of long-distance carriers to cross the country. Gordon pays the waiter and
we're off to Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
After dinner, Avi's T-shirt and sandals pass. But upon arrival, Gordon is
crestfallen: The exponential bartender is off for the night. When Gordon
recovers, we all troop to a table in the corner. Thronging the room are
models in miniskirts--tall, lithe and pneumatic. Across the table, in front
of a large framed photograph with a wraithlike image of Ho Chi Minh in a
Huey Newton chair, a sleek young couple in black hungrily writhes through
hot kisses. A sultry Asian waitress in a red kimono blouse emerges from
behind palm leaves to take orders of port, Courvoisier and Diet Pepsi. Avi
is worried that we still don't get his point about the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
He wants to correct me: Strictly speaking it is not exponential (that's
when the exponent rises), it is polynomial (the variable n rises). In this
case, the complexity of the network rises by n nodes times n-1, which is
not even quite the square of n. I got it. The growth of Internet complexity
is polynomial. But the growth curve still rises toward the sky, okay?<BR>
<BR>
Avi ignores my comment and cruises on. Cisco is selling 60,000 routers a
month. It's the low end of the Net that is exploding. Hierarchical segmentation
through routers is the answer, reducing the n squared factor to the logarithm
of n. &quot;Log n is wonderful,&quot; Avi says. &quot;It shears off complexity.&quot;
The curves are relatively flat. But what about Metcalfe's prediction of
a whopping Internet crash in 1996? Avi will get to that. And what is the
role of AtmNet's ATM switches?<BR>
<BR>
Indeed. Apparently joining Avi in ignoring these tantalizing questions,
the girl across the table raises her legs and hooks them sinuously around
the body of the sleek young man. The waitress leans forward to deliver the
drinks, suffusing the table with exotic perfumes. The two AtmNet promoters
insist that the router problem can be overcome through the interposition
of ATM switches.<BR>
<BR>
Avi dismisses the ATM argument. The complexity curve is still polynomial,
he says. Whether routed or switched, the messages have to follow the same
physical routes. The complexity is the same. Moreover, Avi's cell phone
is on the blink and he has been out of reach for three hours. Gordon offers
a show-off Audiovox the size of a pack of cards, only lighter. Avi manages
to put through a call.<BR>
<BR>
The girl across the table shudders with pleasure as the man reaches out
and cups her breasts in his hands. &quot;The FIX is down,&quot; Avi sighs.
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; I ask. That means, so I learn, a 45-megabit
line is out of service and the Federal Internet Exchange, a Washington NAP,
cannot trade routes or data with MAE East, Metropolitan Fiber Systems's
Fiber Distributed Data Interface exchange point in Vienna, Virginia. This
glitch ramifies, creating certain problems for some of Avi's new customers
in Washington. The young man whispers something in the ear of the girl.
She balks. &quot;No, I'm getting embarrassed,&quot; she says. &quot;Let's
leave.&quot; &quot;I'll call back in 10 minutes,&quot; says Avi. The pair
unwrap their entangled limbs and staggers up from the table. Avi and the
rest of us get up to go.<BR>
<BR>
Thus ends the visit to the palmy domain of Le Colonial. Before I can pry
in a question about Metcalfe, Avi is on the road back home to his wife and
an Internet crisis at 11 p.m., enjoying life as a Diet Pepsi bon vivant
polynomial ISP. Anyway, it was time for fresh air. John Mevi of AtmNet needs
a break. &quot;Avi talks so fast it makes my ears ring,&quot; he explains.
&quot;You've got to understand. I'm from a telco environment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So it was that on a steamy evening in New York, on June 17, I returned to
consult Avi again on Metcalfe's predictions of a network crash. We met with
Gordon Jacobson at Martini's, an Italian restaurant near the Sheraton Hotel
on the west side of Manhattan. While Avi and Gordon consume a lox pizza
and several orders of pasta, I question these men who live on the Net from
minute to minute, day to day, who live in a world of routing tables, TCP/IP
address resolutions, and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and Gate Daemons,
about what they make of the doom scenario.<BR>
<BR>
Avi believes that Metcalfe has ascended to an elevation in the industry
that takes him out of the loop. He really doesn't get it. The Merit data
is mostly irrelevant. Pings from the Routing Arbiter are weighted as lowest-priority
packets. It is predictable and unimportant that many are dropped and re-sent.
&quot;That's the way the Internet works. Like Ethernet, it is tolerant of
failure. Undelivered packets are re-sent; they show up as a few milliseconds
of delay.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe makes much of Merit's index of router instability, measured by
the number of routes announced and withdrawn. In the extreme, instability
brings &quot;route flaps,&quot; in which waves of announcements and withdrawals
spread across the Net in positive feedback loops that congest the system.
Avi dismisses this effect. &quot;There have been no significant route flaps
in the last six months or more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A large portion of the instability problems is attributable to a bug in
Cisco router software that is in the process of being fixed. He confirms
the findings of Ken Ehrhart of Gilder Technology Group that shows little
correlation between the router instability number and performance of the
Net measured by throughput at NAP switches. While all this &quot;wild statistical
behavior&quot; went on, the Net continued to perform stably by using other
routes, circumventing the congested paths. &quot;That's how the Internet
works.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi sums it up: &quot;Metcalfe has become an elder statesman and now he
is doing more harm than good, spreading fear and doubt while the rest of
us solve the problems.&quot; As Ehrhart puts it, &quot;These Merit numbers
bear bad names like 'instability,' 'packet loss' and 'delay.' Metcalfe says
these bad things are growing wildly. But in back of these numbers what is
really growing wildly is the Internet and that is a good thing.&quot; Richard
Shaffer's ComputerLetter, for example, reports that MCI's backbone traffic
has risen fivefold in the last year. MCI reports that its traffic has grown
a total of 5,000% since it opened the backbone in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
Like Howard Anderson, Bill Gates, Andy Grove and other bandwidth skeptics,
Metcalfe seems to find the explosive growth of his intellectual progeny--Ethernets
and Internets--too good to be true. All the sages and titans seem to seek
obsessively the worms in the Giant Peach as it hurtles through the air.
The message from Avi, Gordon and the AtmNet crew is &quot;Let them eat worms.
We'll feast on the peach.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's economics arguments are largely true. As Michael Rothschild's
Bionomics shows, growth in natural and economic systems depends on running
a surplus in every cell. But the cells of the Internet are thriving today.
From the creators of the backbone who lease their facilities, to the ISPs
who are madly multiplying their points of presence, the leading companies
are attracting so much investment and support that laggard behemoths such
as AT&amp;T, TCI and the RBOCs are rushing in.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm depends on the principle that new computers and
routers on the Net not only use its resources but also contribute new resources
to it. If the recent upsurge in Intranets is parasitical to some degree
(because these newcomers use the resources of the Net without contributing
resources of their own), the ultimate parasite on the scene may be AT&amp;T,
which commands perhaps the world's largest Intranet.<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T has attracted some 6 million orders from newcomers for Net service,
with plans to have 20 million by the end of the year, while lagging far
behind MCI and Sprint in contributing to the Internet system. Until recently,
AT&amp;T's vast fiber backbones carried just 2% of Internet traffic. AT&amp;T
preens as the largest and lowest-cost ISP, but its traffic mostly travels
the backbones of MCI, Sprint and other national Internet carriers. A key
to clearing the current bogs and bit pits of the Internet and preventing
a Metcalfe collapse is the enlisting of the full-fiber and switching resources
of AT&amp;T to relieve the pressure on the existing NAPs and backbones and
to accommodate the Internet's growth. AT&amp;T is currently moving to supply
such support.<BR>
<BR>
The Intranets criticized by Metcalfe are crucial to the Internet's growth.
Like the corporate PCs that spearheaded the advance of PC technology, Intranets
spread Internet technology through business, expand the market for high-powered
gear, lower component prices, enlarge bandwidth, and bring new users and
buyers onto the Net.<BR>
<BR>
As for Metcalfe's prediction of Internet crashes from private network overflows,
the fact is that no computer memory system could work without the principle
of locality--the tendency of memory accesses to focus on a contiguous region
of addresses. The Internet is similar. Internal corporate e-mail, for example,
is about 10 times as voluminous as remote e-mail. Metcalfe's private Net
overflow cascade is mostly a theoretical chimera. Like Ethernets, &quot;the
Internet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A second key fact of the Internet is that nothing in modern computer systems
could survive the combinatorial explosions of multimillion-line software
programs and multimillion-node circuitry without the magic of the microcosm.
Semiconductors sink the complexity into silicon, where it gives way to the
exponential boon of the power-delay product. The performance of the circuit--measured
by its speed and low power--improves roughly by the square of the number
of transistors on the chip.<BR>
<BR>
A microprocessor using separate components would be taller than the Empire
State Building and cover most of New York state. Most of the problems of
Internet complexity must be solved the same way that the microprocessor
solves its complexity explosion, sucking the complexity into semiconductors
and taming it on the chip. This means that Internet nodes would ideally
be single-chip systems. Avi is correct; it makes little difference whether
these systems are routers or switches. Today the backbone is being renewed
by ATM switches because these devices integrate more of the process onto
silicon than any other switches. In the future, broadband optics will likely
prevail by integrating entire communications systems onto seamless webs
of glass.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE INTERNET AS LIFE EXTENDER</B><BR>
<BR>
The internet is a human contrivance requiring finance and physical renewal.
In practice, this means capital from phone companies and other large institutions.
In the real world, self-organizing systems rely on market incentives rather
than bio-analogies. Metcalfe is right that these incentives must be protected
and extended in order for the law of the telecosm to conquer the laws of
entropy.<BR>
<BR>
The key remaining obstacle to the fulfillment of the promise of the Internet
is government regulation. This obstacle is being overcome at last by the
brute force of bandwidth abundance, stemming from breakthroughs in fiber
optics, smart radios, satellites and cable modems.<BR>
<BR>
In every industrial transformation, businesses prosper by using the defining
abundance of their era to alleviate the defining scarcity. Today this challenge
implies a commanding moral imperative: to use Internet bandwidth in order
to stop wasting the customer's time. Stop the callous cost of queues, the
insolence of cold calls, the wanton eyeball pokes and splashes of billboards
and unwanted ads, the constant drag of lowest-common-denominator entertainments,
the lethal tedium of unneeded travel, the plangent buffeting of TV news
and political prattle, the endless temporal dissipation in classrooms, waiting
rooms, anterooms, traffic jams, toll booths and assembly lines, through
the impertinent tyranny of unneeded and afterwards ignored submission of
forms, audits, polls, waivers, warnings, legal pettifoggery.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Well, it had to happen. As the Internet emerges as the central nervous system
of global capitalism, the Luddite left is bursting into &quot;flames&quot;
against the microcosm and telecosm, against interlinked computers and the
global radiance of electromagnetic communications. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This rising resistance resonates with the press coverage that has long lavished
attention on the excesses of the Net. Richard Shaffer of the Computer Letter
counts 39,158 Internet stories during the first three quarters of 1995,
beating O.J. by some 15,000 citations. Much of the coverage has been lurid.
For psychedelic visions of virtual reality, the media have exalted Jaron
Lanier in dreadlocks and bankruptcy above Bob Metcalfe, creator of Ethernet,
or Gordon Moore, inventor of IC processing, or Charles Kao, father of fiber
optics, all of whom reshaped the boundaries of human possibility. Computer
viruses and Net porn win headlines and magazine covers that elude the creators
of vast new computer powers, such as RSA encryption or the World Wide Web
or new tools of chip fabrication at the quarter-micron level. Last August,
Windows 95, a modest advance in operating systems, exploded across the press
and the airwaves as if the entire media had been preempted for a Microsoft
infomercial. No wonder befuddled academics, politicians and book publishers
gain a grotesquely distorted view of the industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Tom Peters's first Forbes ASAP interview (March 29, 1993), he predicted
that the '90s would see a fabulous unfolding of new technology, accompanied
with increasing outbreaks of technophobia, Ludditism and Marxism. Alvin
Toffler greeted the initial readers of Wired with a similar dual prophecy
of networked marvels, foiled by a multifront war against the Third Wave.
Once again, Peters and Toffler may well be right, as from Hollywood to Harvard,
America's brainlords rebel against computer technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his pungent new book War of the Worlds, Mark Slouka joins the rising
chorus of resistance. Slouka finds it all a &quot;kind of lie.&quot; Like
a &quot;speech of Ronald Reagan&quot; or a spiritual vision from the &quot;religious
right,&quot; the virtual world is increasingly usurping reality and identity
itself. &quot;Rather than doing away with the couch potato, the telecomputer
has actually created a new, more tenacious variety of tuber: the individual
who swivels from the television screen to computer monitor without missing
a beat . . . .&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, Sandra Bullock writhes in anguish in the sinister clutches of The
Net, with a blond, predatory, arachnoid Bill Gates (using &quot;Gateway&quot;
software) masterminding the Web. Similar chimeras recur in antitech crusades.
Bathed in the ultraviolet frequencies of sunlight, humans throughout the
history of the species have raced through a planetary magnetic field of
half a gauss in power on a terrestrial sphere charged by worldwide lightning
strikes a hundred times a second to a capacitive level of 100 volts per
meter of height. Yet Paul Brodeur and other electrophobes panic at power
lines, power plants, cathode-ray tubes, microprocessors, cellular antennas
and other high-tech oscillators with an impact on humans measurable only
in millionths of a gauss. They defy the fact that around the world use of
electricity correlates almost perfectly with greater longevity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, despite the higher longevity and the globally spreading jobs
and riches springing from high technology, pseudoeconomists prattle endlessly
about the growing gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; Publishers sign up other disgruntled nerds to write hymns to
noble savagery and gardening. And from the fever swamps, a Marxist enrage
posts bombs through the mail and addled editors detonate them in the pages
of the Washington Post. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such fears and fantasies have always afflicted the course of human innovation
and progress. With life expectancies rising eight years in the developed
countries and 22 years in the Third World since 1950, people have more time
to lash out at industrial benefactors who gain wealth and create it from
sources hard to comprehend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Misconceptions about the Internet, however, also abound in more savvy circles.
From Stewart Alsop's Agenda conference to the Internet Society, serious
critics are emerging to predict that the network itself will bog down and
degrade, jammed by traffic and trivia. Often unconsciously, these critics
feed upon a spurious vision of capitalist ecology. Constantly recycling
Garrett Hardin's &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot; as a theory of the
Internet, writers such as Clifford Stoll in Silicon Snake Oil, and others
from publications such as the New York Times to the National Review and
the Atlantic, predict that the Web, as a public good, will be overgrazed,
like the commonly owned fields of feudal Britain. Each herdsman or entrepreneur
gains from adding to his herd or bandwidth, beating rivals to the remaining
grass or spectrum, until congestion ruins the common space. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the epitome of a capitalist commons, the Internet, according to the critics'
predictions, will collapse under the impact of this law, clogged with traffic
and polluted with porn and violence. As a precursor, the same writers cite
citizens band radio, an earlier fad that rose meteorically and collapsed
ignominiously when, as they see it, millions of middle- and lower-class
hoi polloi rushed in and polluted the bandwidth without renewing it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the resistance converges many streams of reaction. In general,
the &quot;humanist&quot; opponents mistake the Internet for a continuation
of television technology. Thus they ascribe to the Internet the very flaws
that they find in TV -- crudeness, violence, porn, entertainment for &quot;diverting
ourselves to death&quot; -- and extend to the computer the old and mostly
valid arguments of Neil Postman and Jerry Mander against the idiot box.
Some of the other critics of the Internet benefit from TV and fear the Web
will replace their familiar tube. The executives of media companies are
mostly baffled by the new technology. Paralyzed by market research, as Jim
Barksdale, CEO of Netscape puts it, &quot;They are trying to build bridges
by counting the swimmers.&quot; A Washington lobbyist for a long-distance
carrier wonders poignantly if &quot;America is ready for all this bandwidth.&quot;
Baby Bells spurn the Internet to fund Hollywood films and TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Blinded by the robber-baron image assigned in U.S. history courses to the
heroic builders of American capitalism, many critics see Bill Gates as a
menacing monopolist. They mistake for greed the gargantuan tenacity of Microsoft
as it struggles to assure the compatibility of its standard with tens of
thousands of applications and peripherals over generations of dynamically
changing technology (avoiding the dialectical babel of the more open Unix,
for example). They see the Internet as another arena likely to be dominated
by Microsoft and a few giant media companies, increasing the wealth of Wall
Street at the expense of the stultified masses of consumers and opening
an ever-greater gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Focused on the summits of the industry -- CEO s&eacute;ances among media
conglomerates and software kings -- all the critics can foster the impression
that the Internet is a questionable, unpromising venue, vulnerable to monopoly
and trash, thereby vindicating the Luddites and the Cassandras. From the
beginning of its civilian eruption, however (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The
Issaquah Miracle,&quot; June 7, 1993), the Net has risen from the bottom
up rather than from the top down; by nature, it is a heterarchy rather than
a hierarchy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To get a view of the future of the Net, let us turn aside from Herb Allen's
golfing groves and Bill Gates's mansion and Louis Gerstner's &quot;net-centric&quot;
revelation, and visit some of the fertile bottomlands where the Web is growing
fastest. Here no robber barons or monopolists come into view and there are
no signs at all of an impending slide toward tragedy and decline. Here the
negative externalities of the degraded commons fall before the huge positive
externalities of Moore's Law and Metcalfe's Law, the microcosm and the telecosm,
where smaller transistors yield exponentially more efficient machines and
the value of networks rises by the square of the power of all the computers
attached to them. Governing the positive externalities of the Internet is
the convergence of these forces, compounded by the creativity of entrepreneurs.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps such a combinatorial explosion explains the mind of Avi Freedman
of Net Access. Among the vanguard of the armies of the Internet, Freedman
is a classic American entrepreneur, entirely alien to the megalithic visions
of the critics. As an Internet service provider (ISP), Freedman supplies
the Philadelphia area with access to the goods and services of this global
ganglion of networks at a flat rate of between $12.50 and $20 per month,
depending on the services chosen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access still operates chiefly out of his cellar in a marginally middle-class
suburb of Wyndmoor. The street bristles with wires, transformer nodes, terminal
boxes and power lines, many of them converging on the duplex red-brick bungalow
where Freedman lives with his wife in an apartment above a basement crammed
floor-to-ceiling with multiplying racks of electromagnetic conversion and
processing gear for computers and telecom. These technologies are all oscillating
and radiating like crazy in the spirit of their hyperkinetic owner, who
is multiplexing Internet insights between his cellular phone and an attentive
audience of aspiring ISPs from western Pennsylvania and geek students visiting
from the University of Pennsylvania, gathered at his door next to the power-line
link. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this an entrepreneurial dream, or a carcinogenic nightmare out of the
muddled pages of Paul Brodeur? Avi is too busy to give the issue much thought.
Extending business service to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Chicago,
overflowing his basement, he is now moving his operations to a collocation
cage at the Philadelphia central office of MFS (Metropolitan Fiber Systems)
where he has just turned up a T-3 fiber circuit (45 megabits per second)
direct to MAE East, the major East Coast Internet exchange point. From Seattle
to San Jose, top companies are besieging him with multimillion-dollar buyout
offers, but looking to the future and its promise, Freedman calculates that
he can't afford to sell. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With only 4,000 customers, however, Net Access hardly seems to pose a threat
to such local colossi as Bell Atlantic and Comcast, now searching the world
for &quot;content&quot; opportunities and looming ever larger on Rodeo Drive.
Yet Ray Smith and Brian Roberts should pay attention to what is going on
in Freedman's teeming mind and basement. Millions of PC owners may well
become part-time Internet service providers in the future -- as their home
and small-business PCs supply content for others, perhaps beginning with
teleconferencing and telecommuting activities that will soon dwarf Hollywood
in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the students hanging on Freedman's words, for example, is Meng-Weng
Wong, whose personal Web page at Penn attracts some 35,000 hits a week with
its restaurant reviews, film criticisms, Philadelphia maps, technology insights
and other delectations. Drawing wide media attention, from Forbes ASAP to
Scandinavian TV (a crew is visiting this very day from the Netherlands),
Wong has now established a server at Net Access, pobox.com, which supplies
his clients with a permanent Internet address wherever they may go, and
he is developing a Web-page design business. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Responding to the onrush of innovative customers like Wong, the configuration
of Freedman's bottom-up operations offers clues to the future shape of the
industry. A portly, perspiring, blond, balding geek-genius bursting with
monologic humor and street smarts -- hardly full-duplex (scant signs of
upstream flow) -- Freedman has just hustled past his 26th birthday. He has
been deep in computers since age eight, when a prescient uncle gave him
a book on the Basic programming language at a Seder. Within months he was
entrenched among the information rich, opening an unbridgeable gap in computer
savvy between himself and nearly all of the other five billion inhabitants
of the planet. If you think you are going to catch up, forget it. By the
age of 12, in 1982, he was an active user of e-mail and Usenet news and
familiar with the abstruse command codes of the Unix operating system that
ran on his father's DEC PDP-11. Freedman senior, a pulmonary physician,
inherited the machine indirectly from Bell Labs, where it had been employed
as a Usenet news hub until displaced by a VAX. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1986, still a teenager, Freedman began exploring the uses of Unix machines
for commercial databases and discovered to his surprise that serious businessmen
would give him gouts of money to get help with their computers. Eventually,
he was earning &quot;lawyers' rates&quot; (his mother is a Philadelphia
tax attorney) for work he found &quot;amazingly routine&quot; and &quot;even
fun.&quot; Nonetheless, after high school, his parents sent him off to college
in Massachusetts, where his computer skills were underappreciated. He returned
after a few weeks to get a job at the National Software Testing Labs in
the Philadelphia suburb of Conshohocken before enlisting at nearby Temple
University, which he chose because it offered more freedom for computer
experiments and consulting work than the more prestigious Penn a few miles
away. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After arriving, he discovered that Temple's computer lab also commanded
a superb resource: bandwidth, in the form of a nearly empty T-1 line linking
to the Internet at 1.544 megabits per second. Already computer rich, he
was becoming communications rich as well. In Avi Freedman, Temple's department
of computer science got rather more than it bargained for. Realizing that
the available PCs were network hostile and the lab's MicroVAXes ran VMS
rather than Unix, Freedman used his savings to buy five secondhand Sun 3
workstations for $600 apiece. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In short order, Freedman began his career as an Internet service provider
and &quot;professional geek,&quot; albeit unpaid. Soon he had some 100 students
as users, mostly cavorting through games of Multiuser Dungeons (MUD). Temple's
address, supplied by Freedman -- bigboy.cis.temple.edu -- became known far
and wide as a hive of MUD activity. Temple's computer science professors
began to rebel at this untoward distinction, particularly when they found
that lost in the crypts and catacombs of the Net, their charges were virtually
unreachable for assignments in higher-level languages. Freedman was forced
to close down local access to the game portions of the server during daytime
hours. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman has given some thought to the problem of &quot;how to civilize
young, intelligent teenage males.&quot; He concludes, &quot;You have got
to get them interested.&quot; He says the students playing MUD at least
were learning Unix commands, &quot;a better way to get a job than mastering
the Pascal programming language,&quot; which was then being taught in the
regular classes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a student, working with Prof. Yuan Shi and other Temple professors, Freedman
developed a toolkit for distributed processing on Suns and presented a paper
in London in 1989 at a conference on computer-aided software engineering.
As his time at Temple drew to a close, he began contemplating graduate school.
&quot;Everyone was very surprised that anyone who could do anything on the
outside was going to graduate school,&quot; he says, &quot;but Stony Brook
on Long Island offered me a nice job as a research assistant in the lab
and I went up there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After graduating from Temple, Freedman also encountered the harsh facts
of life in the world beyond college computer laboratories. With their local-area
networks and T-1 links to the Internet, universities offered a revel for
budding cybernauts. Marc Andreessen of Netscape discovered a similar disjunction
between college lab and residential communications. At LAN's end was a communications
cliff and a bandwidth scandal. Most homes and offices connected to the world
only through twisted-pair, four-kilohertz, copper telephone wires. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In October of 1992, Freedman became an ISP chiefly to continue his college
revels by chasing bandwidth. Twenty-three at the time and engaged, he could
still recall his days in high school and remembered how much he had learned
from the Internet through his father's PDP-11. He began to fill up his basement
with second-hand Sun machines, mostly at prices well below new Pentium levels,
all using Berkeley Unix, equipped by Bill Joy with fast TCP/IP (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with 40 customers from local bulletin board systems, Freedman
provided access through the serial ports of a single SPARCstation IPC with
a 200-megabyte hard drive and 12 megabytes of memory that he purchased secondhand
for $1,500. The serial ports ran up to 38.4 kilobits per second, linked
to 14.4-kilobit-per-second Zoom and Supra modems connected to POTS (plain
old telephone service) outside lines running from the phone company's central
office. Costing a total of some $4,000, the system worked well enough until
his clientele began to multiply and the modems balked at continual resetting.
In April 1992, he bought a 16-port Iolan terminal server that answered the
phones and connected subscribers to the Sun servers, which supplied e-mail,
Usenet news, Gopher searches, Telnet and file-transfer services in a Unix
environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In June of 1992 emerged the menace of competition. A local entrepreneur
launched Voicenet by simply linking a 386 PC with a modem to each phone
line through a terminal server. Charging fees several times higher than
Net Access's, Voicenet thrived through the device of hiring two full-time
people to scan in pictures from porno magazines for what Freedman describes
as the &quot;sticky keyboard set.&quot; Eventually the &quot;adult&quot;
bulletin board service enlisted some 5,000 members paying $4 per hour to
peruse images. Nonetheless, Voicenet protested what it called Net Access's
predatory low pricing, a $12.50 to $20 flat rate per month with no full-time
employees to pay. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the early years of the Net's development, the late '80s, the Internet
business outside campuses and corporations was a small-time and sometimes
tacky trade. In 1992, the entire Net comprised a million linked computers,
many of them in university and government labs. It wasn't until November
1993 that Net Access acquired a dedicated 56-kilobit line for direct connection
to an official network access point. Costing $400 per month, it multiplexed
22 dial-up modems among 250 users. With the Mosaic World Wide Web browser
yet to catch on outside the universities, Net Access did not even have to
supply SLIP (serial line interface protocol) or PPP (point-to-point protocol)
accounts, which shield the user from the details of Unix. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman, however, saw the need for new technology to link people to the
full resources of the Net without having to know abstruse Unix commands.
&quot;As a professional geek, writing code is my true calling,&quot; he
says, adding that he threw himself into this work. Although the program
was eclipsed by Mosaic, Lynx and other approaches, he still believes that
his software provided easier access to the Internet, complete with the ability
to trace routes and &quot;ping&quot; remote machines. Enabling users to
log in to the program in 1992, he put Net Access on the technological forefront
of ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The largest challenge for an ISP, then and now, is managing the floods of
bits engulfing a Usenet news server at a rate of some 500 megabytes per
day, five news articles per second, each with a unique identification that
has to be scanned to assure that the news is fresh and not duplicated. The
heart of the Internet until the arrival of the World Wide Web -- and still
cherished more than the Web by many Internet veterans -- Usenet is the huge
collection of textual bulletin boards and other information troves and exchanges
from which the communities of the Net exfoliate. As Steve Willens of Livingston
Enterprises puts it: &quot;This is the real source of the Internet as we
know it and the challenge that forced the development of technology specialized
for the Net&quot; -- notably Livingston communications servers that linked
modems to the Net through fast comports functioning with compression at
115.2 kilobits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, Freedman recognized he had a major business on his hands. He decided
to lease a T-1 line from PREP-NET (Pennsylvania Research and Economic Partnership
Network), which required a prepayment of $1,000 per month. With 50 phone
lines and modems and 500 users, he broke all ties with Stony Brook and began
hiring people to handle a rising tide of traffic and a surging demand for
technical support. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That summer, he had three full-time people: &quot;Myself, my wife, Gail,
and my 20-year-old brother, Noam. Working with him made me realize why people
pay me so much money as a consultant [up to $150 an hour]. He served as
a kind of Avi echo, intuitively knowing what I wanted and when.&quot; A
student in computer science at the University of Chicago, Noam is in the
process of extending the business to that city, while Avi has established
points of presence in New York and Washington, D.C. He has hired five Net
Access customers, none with college degrees, to provide technical support
full time as the number of users has climbed at a pace of some 15% per month
since the end of 1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For links to other cities, Freedman relied on advice from telecommunications
consultant Gordon Jacobson, a Penn alumnus who maintains close links to
the Penn school of engineering, where his father graduated. With Jacobson's
help, Freedman is ending 1995 with a fiber circuit connecting him to MAE
East at 45 megabits a second, a 10-megabit-per-second link to Sprint's network-access
point, and more than half a dozen point-to-point T-1 lines, all for well
under half of the normally tariffed prices for these services. With increasing
broadband connectivity, Net Access commands more than half as much bandwidth
at the nerve centers of the Net as Netcom, which has 50 times more customers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Though indispensable, technology alone cannot sustain a successful ISP.
It is people that make the vital difference. If Freedman had originally
hired people to perform the work that he did himself part-time -- &quot;keeping
the machines running, maintaining software, recovering from disasters, installing
and tuning equipment and circuits&quot; -- he would have incurred expenses
of some $100,000 per year and his financial model would have collapsed.
The reason many corporations are so slow to develop Internet programs is
not the lack of equipment but the dearth of personnel. The large companies
pursuing Net Access did not care about Freedman's rooms full of gear. They
were after Freedman himself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's entrepreneurship and technology ride on a tide of other enterprise
by the suppliers of Internet gear. These, too, are not huge telephone company
equipment manufacturers or rising software monopolists but mostly small
or medium-size companies, led by young entrepreneurs, fighting to survive
in the most intensely competitive arena of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An Internet service provider must begin by supplying modems through which
the outside world can connect to his offerings. With millions of home customers
who dwarf the ISP modem volumes, U.S. Robotics is currently ascendant in
most ISPs, but Freedman spurns them for cheaper devices from Multi-Tech.
These modems connect to a Xylogics terminal server that authenticates the
name and password combination entered by the user and validates the caller
as legitimate. Then the customer enters Net Access's local-area network
linking a set of Sun Microsystems servers that supply World Wide Web, Gopher,
Usenet, e-mail, file transfer, Telnet and other Internet services. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access is unusual for an ISP, since few use Xylogics equipment. Recently
bought out by Bay Networks, Xylogics supplied nearly all the terminal servers
for the university market, and it still shies away from the tumultuous world
of ISPs. These customers mostly use Livingston products that run a security
protocol named Radius (remote authentication dial-in user services). Channeling
the bits around the ISP's internal net and on to other networks are banks
of routers, also often built by Cisco or Livingston (although Freedman originally
chose Morningstar because it was cheaper). Linking a particular ISP to other
ISPs and network access points are T-1 cables running at 1.544 megabits
per second through multiplexing and demultiplexing and conditioning equipment.
These functions are performed by DSU-CSUs (data service units-channel service
units) made by such companies as TxPort, Adtran, General DataComm and ADC
Kentrox. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman insists on the Law of the Microcosm in choosing all his equipment
and in making all his projects for expansion. Since his study of distributed
computing at Temple, he has everywhere cherished duplication and redundancy
and cheap components over centralization and scale economies. He at first
bought a nine-gigabyte drive from Micropolis. Now he regrets the decision
and is replacing it with five two-gigabyte drives (more I/O [input/output],
redundancy and reliability). &quot;The more spindles the better,&quot; he
says. He buys lots of cheap secondhand Suns rather than one powerful server.
He criticizes some of the larger ISPs, such as Netcom, for centralizing
their servers and technical support. It causes bottlenecks and delays, he
says, and opens the system to crashes if any of the communication lines
go down. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's rule is to provide service as locally as possible. He believes
ISPs with fully equipped local network sites, rather than mere communications
nodes like Netcom's, will prevail. Like most small ISPs, Freedman is wedded
to flat-rate pricing, though his accounts of altercations with customers
who want to resell or overgraze his commons may undermine confidence that
this pricing regime can survive into the future. But managing flat-rate
prices is a core competence of the ISPs. Believing that bits will flee toward
flat rates, Freedman says MCI will fail in its plans to transform Internet
pricing models by adding some as yet unannounced scale of measured usage
based on time, packets or both. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is Freedman's model scalable, or is it doomed as he grows? Could Freedman
be displaced by MCI or Sprint-Comcast or Bell Atlantic or Microsoft-UUNet
or AT&T in a siege of merger-monopolization? He believes that up until a
threshold of some 25,000 to 50,000 customers, meaning revenues of between
$5 million and $10 million net of more lucrative business clients, his economic
and technical model can trump all comers. At that point, he will face the
usual entrepreneurial crisis of transition: Freedman will need business
partners, routinized technology management schemes and expensive accounting
to maintain operations as Net Access spreads across the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But he does not fear competition. His problems, he says, are servicing the
flood of new customers and anticipating the depredations of &quot;Congresscritters&quot;
who want to make him liable for any vagrant flasher who strays onto one
of his hard drives. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still a small force in the global matrix of telecommunications, Freedman
now dreams of exploiting available resources of fiber, dark and lit, to
acquire major new bandwidth, linking cities up and down the East Coast and
across the U.S. Helping Freedman move this project toward reality is his
telecom guru Jacobson, an entrepreneurial dervish from Portman Communications.
With financiers on the line to supply some $5 million in startup capital,
Jacobson is planning to launch a national IRamp network. The service will
ultimately open fully staffed Internet access facilities in 30 cities nationwide,
linked everywhere by fiber, at a cost of some $1 million per site. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such investment looms large compared to the rock-bottom base of Freedman's
operation, and easily eclipses a national ISP's point-of-presence facility
that can cost upwards of $70,000. But David Farber, gigabit-testbed guru,
recently told a New York audience at the Penn Club that, spurred by business
needs, the marketplace is seeking higher-end, stable-broadband ISP services
that can handle millions of hits a day at a Web site with no access delays
or congestion and that provide local access and custom software configuration.
For these high-end customers, the SPARC 20 servers and T-1 and 56-kilobit
links of the many small ISPs will no longer suffice. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering the kind of broadband channels that will eventually become ubiquitous
on the Net, IRamp's planned facilities will command OC-3 fiber (155 megabits
per second) links to a national network of both dark and lit fiber, available
from utilities, pipelines and other unusual sources. Such bypass strategies
will become increasingly common in coming years. The 10 million miles of
fiber currently installed in the U.S., after all, is exploited to approximately
one-millionth of its potential capacity -- and much of it is unused &quot;dark
fiber.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For key ISP server and security functions, Jacobson plans to use fully fault-tolerant
Tandem S4000 servers running the new ServerNet multibus scheme. It was conceived
by venerable Tandem designer Robert Horst as a new-generation architecture
explicitly optimized to substitute bandwidth for switching speeds. Fully
scalable, ServerNet was licensed in October by Compaq, yet it commands a
theoretical throughput limit of an unprecedented petabit per second (a million
billion bits). For graphics-intensive applications, Jacobson envisages Silicon
Graphics WebForce Challenge S servers using Irix software. Even with as
few as 5,000 subscribers per site paying a competitive nonusage-based rate,
Jacobson projects a high rate of return. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, at Netcom, the nation's largest ISP, David Garrison, the CEO,
is undergoing the stresses that Freedman foresees for himself as he expands
his business. During his previous stint at the helm of the meteoric paging
company, SkyTel, Garrison, a rangy dark-haired entrepreneur with a slight
uneasiness in his ready smile of prosperity, thought he had approached the
ultimate in entrepreneurial excitement. But nothing in his career in the
wireless industry prepared him for his first nine months as head of Netcom.
Here is a company that during the last three quarters grew from 400 to 1,200
employees, from 58 to 201 points of presence, from 72,000 to more than 200,000
customers, and from revenues of $12.4 million in 1994 to a $50 million run
rate in 1995 and to a market cap of some $400 million, while the traffic
in bits grows at an even faster pace -- impelled by the graphic demands
of the World Wide Web, itself expanding at the rate of more than 1,000 new
servers per week. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netcom pares down its points of presence to simple communications nodes
and handles all the technical support and Internet services for them at
the company's headquarters. This operation fills up a high-rise in San Jose.
Some floors teem with desks manned by earnest engineers in jeans, many of
them Asian, working the phones. Other floors are replete with row upon row
of racks filled wall-to-wall with Cisco routers, Sun servers, Livingston
PortMasters, Ascend ISDN pipelines, Cascade edge switches and U.S. Robotics
modems. Walking through these ever-expanding mazes of machinery, Garrison's
entrepreneurial smile at times moves from the ready to the giddy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this environment of riotous growth, the telcos move their slow thighs
like trolls under the bridges and routers of the Internet. Currently commanding
perhaps 2% of the traffic, AT&amp;T, for example, has declared its ambition
to capture 60% of the Internet business over the next two years. But Garrison
demurs: &quot;From the Olympian perspective of a McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant,
AT&amp;T could take over any business. They have one of the greatest brand
names in the world, they've got more money than God, a billing relationship
with some 40 million people, a global network and alliances and consortia,
Internet pioneer Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman in their fold, and they have
perhaps the world's largest internal World Wide Web on their own Unix servers
among their 300,000 employees.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But like most of the telcos, AT&amp;T lacks focus. As Netcom marketing chief
John Zeisler explains: &quot;Phone companies have their 700 numbers, 800
numbers, corporate customers, their Hollywood links, their leased lines,
their frame relay, their ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line), their
cable aspirations, their huge wireless opportunities, their bureaucracy,
their regulatory tariffs, their pricing confusions. Should voice be priced
as data or should data be priced as voice? They are great at laying fiber
and wire, connecting it to switches and bringing signals to the central
office and to the curb. But the Internet is a second thought, just another
business to them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in the PC industry, focus and agility are crucial. In an arena where
the technologies ride a remorseless onrush of exponential changes, no prolonged
bureaucratic process can succeed. Even the maps and schematics of rapid
convergence among media industries miss the point. Dominating this arena
is the computer industry -- with its millions of piranha processors and
entrepreneurs -- and it doesn't converge with anything; it eats everything
in its path. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now ascendant is the Internet computer industry. Most of these new companies,
from Livingston to Netscape, focus on the Internet. Using personal computer
components to reduce the price of ISP infrastructure far below the price
of telco installations, these companies endow the ISPs with a further advantage
in a dynamic industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Livingston Enterprises epitomizes the success of the new companies creating
this new industry. Secreted in Pleasanton, Calif., and financed by corporate
cash flow, Livingston has grown up with the Internet at a pace not far in
the wake of its more illustrious rival, Cisco Systems. Livingston PortMasters
crowd Netcom's headquarters, as they do most of the other ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched in 1989 under the leadership of Steven Sillens, then a manager
of multiprocessors at Sun Microsystems, Livingston's networking drive began
by creating a cheap router and communications server based on a new operating
system, ComOS, specifically developed to help ISPs meet their Usenet burdens.
Livingston quickly became a dominant force in Internet terminal servers
and routers, and grew at a pace of more than 50% per year until engulfed
by an explosion of demand in 1995. In August of this year, Livingston launched
cheap low-end routers to serve both ends of an Internet connection: a $1,395
two-port PortMaster to link small offices to the Net at up to 230.4 kilobits
per second and a sleek space-saving $3,495 PortMaster with 24 ports for
ISPs. In October, Livingston announced a series of ISDN remote-access machines
that will compete with the currently dominant Ascend ISDN pipeline system,
if ISDN becomes the preferred mode of Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, everywhere in the Internet industry companies are resigning themselves
to ISDN as the next &quot;modem&quot; (though, in fact it just brings into
home and office the 64Kbps digital channels long used by the telcos between
central offices). The scandal of U.S. telecom, however, is that the telcos
could just as easily be bringing video capable T-1 service (1.544 megabits
per second of bandwidth, equivalent to CD-ROMs) to homes if regulations
permitted a reasonable tariff structure. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, new access technologies are emerging, such as cable modems and
AT&amp;T's new SDSL (symmetrical digital subscriber loop). Available this
year and under test by Bell Atlantic, SDSL modems promise to bring T-1-Line
capability to homes on twisted-pair copper wires for about $10 a month.
SDSL follows many such copper prosthetics announced over the years (notably
HDSL) [high bit rate digital subscriber line] from Level One, PairGain,
Brooktree and others), all largely spurned by the telcos on pricing grounds,
but capable of transforming the entire world of Internet access before ISDN's
niggardly pipes catch on with the public. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While Internet hardware rushes ahead, Netscape, Sun and other providers
of Internet software make the ISP a fast and elusively moving target for
the telcos that wish to compete. With eight million browsers in the field,
all upgradeable to the new 2.0 system--with the Java interpreter and Java
multimedia programming language and toolkit--Netscape expects to attract
some 100,000 software developers to its platform over the next year. There
are already some 400 Java applications available, including word processors,
spreadsheets and games that can play on any machine with a browser running
a Java interpreter, regardless of operating system or microprocessor instruction
set. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's expected army of 100,000 developers compares with some 10,000
developers for Apple's Macintosh and perhaps 3,000 for Microsoft's network,
MSN. Emerging from a company that did not even exist two years ago, such
a juggernaut will further empower the ISPs in their competition with the
large invaders of the territory--not only the telcos but also the on-line
services such as American Online and MSN. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The ISPs, however, are not usually in direct competition with the large
phone companies. ISPs bring them new customers and new business users, and
the ISPs also depend on them for home connections and for potential fiber-trunking
services. The American telcos are currently laying some 1,300 miles of fiber-optic
line every day. Moreover, beginning with TCI's and Kleiner Perkins' @home
system, which functions with cable modems and new software from Netscape,
the ISPs also may end up using cable plant. As cable modems become available,
cable companies will likely turn to the ISPs to supply Internet services,
local content, technical support and point-of-presence technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of these whitewater torrents of change, the some 4,000 ISPs
and their increasing armies of supporters represent a serious threat to
many of the established empires of telecom. Not only can they move much
faster and more resourcefully, but they also have the key advantage of having
bet exclusively on the PC and the Internet as the platforms of the future.
However smart and powerful, Ray Smith, Mike Ovits of Disney, Gerland Levin
and Ted Turner, Sumner Redstone and other aspiring Kings of the Road still
entertain crippling visions of set-top boxes and interactive TV sets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andrew Grove of Intel had the last word for these efforts when he told Forbes
ASAP last year: &quot;By the time the set-top people reach the price points
and form factors of consumer electronics and penetrate 30% of homes, the
personal computer will be everywhere, controlling the TV like a minor peripheral.&quot;
Bill Joy elaborated on this point in the October issue of Red Herring: &quot;By
the time [they] bring digital TV to the home, you will be able to take your
Super Netscape version 4.0 Web browser with Super-Ultra-HotJava-Burners,
and that will be your animated user interface. [The TV people tried, but[
it's like the Internet happened in the meantime. Right?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Distracting most of the large companies (seen by the Internet's critics
as impending monopolists), the pursuit of the set-top not only misses the
point and begs the question but it also blows the key new hardware opportunity
of the epoch. Although the PC will not be dislodged for most office applications,
there is a real and rare chance today to create a new home architecture
and software optimized for the bandwidth rather than for installed base.
Together with the Java language, the Web browser breakthrough allows creation
of new network PC and software architectures at price points that take advantage
of the &quot;hollowing out of the computer&quot; caused by the impact of
the Internet. Sun, Apple, Oracle and Jean-Louis Gass&eacute;e's BeBox are
all focusing on this target today. All are trying to take advantage of the
elusive opportunity of creating cheap machines optimized for bandwidth and
graphics rather than for legacy software baggage (the storage can be supplied
on the Net). That opportunity follows the PC and Internet model--the microcosm
and the telecosm--into the cornucopian digital future of the information
age, with the old analog TV and telephone left far behind. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>AMID ALL THESE TORRENTS</B> of futuristic technology and prophecies of
a tragic denouement in a wasted commons, it is comforting to return to the
man who began it all, Vinton Cerf of MIC. Coinventor of the Internet protocol
TCP/IP, developer of the once-pioneering and a philosopher of the Net, he
is now in charge of MCI's data network, which includes MCI's Internet backbone
network. A rare combination of technical grit and visionary enthusiasm,
he faces resistance from forces within the company that still lust for the
glamour of Hollywood and see the Internet as the CB radio of the 1990s.
Nonetheless, Cerf at 52 is leading MCI toward a new Internet-centric strategy
that is more likely than the MCI lobbyists to save the company from the
grave perils of long-distance deregulation. The company is already creating
a new backbone for the National Science Foundation part of the Internet,
connecting supercomputer centers and other high-bandwidth applications at
speeds of up to 622 megabits per second. MCI also is a major supplier of
Internet bandwidth. Its network connects to all six NAPs (national access
points) through which the ISPs link to one another. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cerf observes that the national phone network grew at a similar pace through
much of its history and regularly met ever challenge. The telcos, for instance,
surmounted the predicted crisis of the NAPs early this year, when--following
the withdrawal of government funds--the network was expected to collapse
under galloping increase sin traffic. But the NAPs, despite unsuccessful
struggles with the remaining instabilities of ATM (asynchronous transfer
mode), ultimately rose to the challenge, saving the Net by using fiber optics
and digitization, as well as transparent silicon and opaque silicon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, new entrepreneurs are rising up to shape the future of broadband
networks and possibly seize the market from the incumbent backbone suppliers.
Silicon, both see-through ad solid, remains at the heart of the solution.
One of the ways MCI is meeting the challenge of the future is by purchasing
eight &quot;gigarouters&quot; from NetStar, a startup in Minneapolis that
is exploiting Moore's Law to bring IP (Internet Protocol) switching and
router technology into the microcosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched five years ago by a group of veterans of the Minneapolis supercomputer
scene--Lee Data, Cray and other companies--NetStar went public this fall
at a $83 million valuation. It is pioneering an elegant routing architecture
that gets eight times the throughput of a Cisco 7500 at a 20% lower price.
While existing routers run bits down shared backplane buses, NetStar's IP
router reserves a full one gigabit per each of up to 16 media cards attached
to a single-chip TriQuint 16 gigabit-cross-bar switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ubiquitous on the Internet, Cisco remains an imperial force. But as the
microcosm advances, it too faces threats. Not only can it not compete with
NetStar at the top of the line but it also faces Livingston, Ascend and
possibly even Compaq at the bottom. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Critics of the Internet have long predicted that as ever-more-turbulent
floods of broadband data and Web images crowd the commons, the Net will
no longer be able to bear the load. The routers in the NAPs and other critical
paths will jam up and crash. But the microcosm enables a constant stream
of exponentially more powerful new architectures as functions that were
once spread out across entire boards collapse into single chips and multichip
modules. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For 1995 and beyond, MCI has bent on NetStar's feats of microchip integration
to countervail every population explosion across the network commons. Following
the laws of the telecosm rather than the megalithic visions of the critics,
the fast new networks are becoming constantly dumber and more entrepreneurial.
Ciena Corp., a small, venture-funded vendor of optical networks, is now
supplying the next generation of back-bone gear, a system that can carry
16 separate bitstreams on every fiber thread. The first application of the
new all-optical technology in public networks, is now Ciena's innovation
is a precursor of the terabit (trillion-bit throughput) networks that will
be filled with video teleconferencing, video on demand, virtual reality,
and other bit-thronging and polygon-shuffling applications of the future.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Only one competitor, Northern Telecom, might challenge NetStar and the others
providing the new superswitches dumb enough to prevail at the top of the
line. In early October, Northern's BNR lab exhibited a terabit-switch architecture
at the Telecom 95 show in Geneva. This machine, once again, illustrates
the triumph of dumb networks. The dumb terminals of the past, whether POTS
phones or mainframe 3270 panels, required smart networks, with central-office
switches from Northern and AT&amp;T containing no fewer than 26 million
lines of software code. But the new Northern terabit uses passive optical
components and virtually no software at all. It points to the evolution
of a fibershpere for broadband wire traffic that will function like the
atmosphere for wireless traffic. (See Forbes ASPA, &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot;
December 7, 1992). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While the critics of the new technology fix on the foibles of television
and the monolithic aggregations of old media, the Internet is emerging as
an entrepreneurial efflorescence. Comparing the Net to the decline of CB
radio and the tragedy of the commons misses the providential convergence
of the laws espoused by Moore and Metcalfe, with thousands of entrepreneurs
in tow, exponentially expanding the commons with streams of new invention
in a creative spiral of growth and opportunity. In seeing the technology
as a killer of jobs and family life and a polarizer of opportunities between
rich and poor, they miss the most radically egalitarian force in the history
of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics seem oblivious to the most basic realities of the U.S. job miracle.
While the U.S. deployed three times as much as computer power per capita
as any other industrial region, this country created some 45 million jobs
in 25 years at rising, real incomes. Not only was the U.S. a world leader
in the proportion of its working-age population with jobs, but it also created
employment for some 12 million immigrants, while its corporations endowed
new work for people around the globe. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, a billion people, mostly Third World Asians, used the
technology to leap into Third Wave riches without ever having to endure
a heavy industrial phase. Gaps between the rich and the poor collapsed everywhere
that the networks reached, as former peasants around the world--from Bangalore
to Los Angeles--gained new freedom and opportunity from the information
economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet creates jobs by making workers more productive, and thus more
employable, regardless of where they live. By engendering more investable
wealth, it endows new work, providing the key remedy for the job displacement
entailed by all human progress. By aggregating distant markets, the Internet
enables more specialization, and more productivity and excellence. It will
help all people, but most particularly the poor, who always comprise the
largest untapped market for enterprise. And the Internet will continue to
grow, transforming the global economy with its power and building a new
industry even larger than the PC's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>FUELING THE TRANSFORMATION</B> are the laws of the telecosm. They begin
with Metcalfe's Law: The power of computers on a network rises with the
square of the total power of computers attached to it. Every new computer,
therefore, both use the Net as a resource and adds resources to the Net
in a spiral of increasing value and choice. This means that any limited,
exclusive or proprietary network will tend to lose business to a more open,
accessible and widely connected network. Metcalfe's Law dooms all the dreams
of the Time Warners of the world to create exclusive and proprietary combinations
of content and conduit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a further rule, networks prevail to the extent that they feed on the
invention and creativity of their users, since the power of the computers
on the edge of the network will increasingly dwarf the intelligence of the
network fabric itself. For example, a 5ESS central-office switch from AT&amp;T,
commanding some 10 MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and linking
some 110,000 lines, once represented the most powerful computer in a local
phone network. Today those 10 MIPS are infinitesimal compared to the collective
computer power of the tens of thousands of personal computers, each commanding
20 to 100 MIPS, linked by modems to the switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lacking an entrepreneurial environment of inventive users, the government-run
PTTs (Post Telegraph and Telephone) of Europe have been rapidly losing ground
to the U.S.'s more rivalrous RBOCs (regional Bell operating companies) and
long-distance carriers, and all have been losing ground to the explosion
of interconnected private nets. The U.S. has some 700,000 private networks
compared to just 14,000 in Europe and some 75,000 in Japan. Private nets
that feed on the creativity of their users will always tend to prevail over
public nets, such as France's Minitel or American's interactive TV projects,
that try to supply their entire system from a central office. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt of Sun offers a true parable of the Net. Back when the Internet
was the Arpanet, two routers were added to the system, but the routers'
hopping ratio (the number of hops to any destination) got struck at zero.
Because traffic always seeks out the optimal path, most of the traffic on
the Net rushed to these two machines, since they promised instant transmission.
Until the settings were corrected, the system was swamped. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the Net, traffic will always gravitate to the most efficient broadband
channels. If the telcos and software monopolists attempt to gouge customers
in a badly designed and costly &quot;top-down&quot; network, traffic will
migrate rapidly toward the freedom and bandwidth of a bottom-up solution.
In the engineering global Internet, these channels could emerge among bypass
suppliers using dark fiber; among low-earth-orbit satellite systems, such
as Teledesic and GlobalStar; among cable companies and renegade long-distance
suppliers; or among companies as yet unknown. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guided by the valuations of the market, capital follows a similar rule:
It is routed rapidly to the channels where it can be used more productively.
At present, afflicted by perverse regulations that bar phone and cable companies
from collaborating in the same region, valuations of these companies are
low. Meanwhile, analysis complain of the excessive valuations for ISPs,
such as Netcom, and their suppliers, such as Cisco, 3Com and Netscape. Not
only traffic but also investment flows to the least regulated and most enterpreneurial
arena. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A further law of the telecosm ordains that, in an age of dumb terminals
and phones, traffic flows to smart networks full of intricate software.
In an age of ever-multiplying computer power, impelled b Metcalfe's Law,
traffic flows to the dumbest networks that gain their intelligence from
the variety of powerful machines attached to them. A corollary is that,
along with traffic, capital flows to the dumbest and most broadband nets
with the most computer intelligence on their edges. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important of all is the cultural law of the telecosm. Networks
promote choice, choice enhances quality and quality favors morality. Television
is culturally erosive because its small range of offerings requires a broad,
lowest-common-denominator appeal. Linking to millions of cultural sources,
global networks provide a cornucopia of choices, like a Library of Congress
at your fingertips. On the Net, as at a giant bookstore, you always get
your first choice rather than a lowest-common-denominator choice. A culture
of first choices creates a bias toward excellence and virtue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics of the Internet are mostly skeptical about the value of choice.
But choice validates freedom and substantiates individuality. Choice accords
with the inexorable genetic diversity of humans. It makes possible individual
aspiration and creativity. It is the lowest-common-denominator offerings
of mass-broadcast media that lower humans to the animal level, eclipsing
the differences that make us human, cutting off the higher aspirations and
inspirations that elevate us beyond our appetites, reducing us to an impressionable
crowd, zapping through the channels looking for a splash of blood or flash
of nudity or demagogic spiel of hate. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In prophesying centralization and tyranny, the Cassandras miss the centrifugal
forces of the Law of the Microcosm, overthrowing all monopolies, hierarchies,
pyramids and power grids of established industrial society and endowing
individuals with the power to be transcendent and free. <BR>

Take George Gilder's Aug. 28 ForbesASAP piece, &quot;The Coming Software Shift.&quot; Lucky Forbes readersgot their copies in mid-August, smack between the year's two biggest technologyevents--Netscape's record-hot IPO and the release of Windows 95. Gilderused the timing to explain why creative energy and profits in desk-top softwarewould soon migrate from Microsoft to the Internet and toward companies likeNetscape. Needless to say, Gilder's point is controversial, drawing fireand praise from a host of computerdom's biggest names </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Nathan Myhrvold, Group Vice-President, Applications and Content Group,Microsoft </H3><BR><BR>As usual, George Gilder's diagnosis is dead-on. The software industry functionsby turning its fuel-cheap processing power, as described by Moore's Law--intovalue for consumers. In turn, software soon soaks up CPU power, fuelingmarket demand, which sustains Moore's Law. The software-hardware twosomeis about to become a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois, with the addition ofcommunications. The three-way cycle will drive growth and value creationin each area at an even faster rate than we've seen so far. I begin to differwhen George frames the computer industry in lurid terms of battle. In reality,computer industry shifts are quite dull affairs. The multidecade declineof the mainframe has been a lot like watching a glacier melt. A leadingcompany fails to invest in new technology and ultimately finds its productobsolete. New entrants might capitalize on this, but most--including Netscapeand HotJava--blaze new trails instead. When an established leader does fall,the proximate cause is almost always slow suicide or atrophy through internalmismanagement; not the wounds of combat. The Internet means opportunityfor all software developers--new and old. Mosaic and its commercial descendantsare currently at the center of the cyclones, but their day in the sun willpass just as surely as it did for previous Internet standards like Gopheror FTP. The instant rise of Mosaic and Netscape foreshadows what Georgemight dub another Law of the Telecosm: In a world with easy electronic distribution,it is very hard to hang onto your position--easy come, easy go. A particularweakness of HTML is that it is a data format no different in spirit fromthe protocols of 1970s-vintage mainframe terminals. Next-generation Internetsoftware will use programmability at both ends of the pipe. Java is noteworthyand may play a role, but its hype falls into a very old trap. Every newprogramming language is heralded as a breakthrough. Fortran was going tocomputerize science and engineering, Cobol would revolutionalize business,and Lisp (and later, Prolog) would deliver us to the promised land of AI.The reality is quite different--new languages offer some modest benefits,but all of the real value resides in the programs created with them. Finally,I must comment on the obsession with finding the next Gates. Bill has beenmy friend and colleague for nearly 10 years, so the topic is familiar. Writinggreat software and founding a company is a first step, but that only matchesBill Gates circa 1976. The secret that made the Bill Gates of 1995 is tohave the technical and business skills to develop new product lines repeatedly.Microsoft is unique in this accomplishment. Our competition is invariablysingle-product companies, or ex post facto assemblages of them. I don'tdoubt that the next Gates will eventually appear, and the Internet may fuelher rise, but it's one hell of a tough act to follow. Scott Mcnealy, ChiefExecutive Officer, Sun Microsystems I'd like to compliment George Gilderfor so eloquently articulating Sun's nearly decade-old credo: &quot;Thenetwork is the computer.&quot; I believe in Gilder's thesis that we are,indeed, at the onset of the age of network-accessed, disposable software.Desktop operating systems, utilities and applications will soon be relegatedto peripheral status. The network will be the operating system, and, asGilder points out, this change is being brought about the almost incomprehensiblemomentum of the Internet. The ultimate change agent, Gilder suggests, mayin fact be Java, yet another technology that Sun has offered to the industryin an open and barrier-free way. Java is a programming language that createsthe first true network operating system for the globe, because it is safe,secure, robust, fault tolerant and, among many other attributes, platform-independent.Here's how we see it playing out. three computer science students from Berkeleyhacking code late at night will create a Java word processing program. Let'scall it &quot;NetWord.&quot; They put it on their Web server at http://www.netword.com.It will be free because these kids want fame first, knowing that will leadto fortune as with their hero, Marc Andreessen. It will be 100,000 linesof code versus 1.5 million for WordPerfect, because NetWord isn't boggeddown with all the APIs [applications programming interfaces] and other extraneousbaggage of typical applications that must interoperate with a specific operatingsystem, or have become overfeatured. So you're shopping for a new word processingprogram. You've seen the ads offering Word on sale for $249. Of course,you know that means you get the privilege of upgrading in a year for another$89. Your buddy sends an e-mail and says check out NetWord. You take a testdrive. It works! Cool! You are not alone. A few million others have heardabout NetWord. Now the makers have a following and in a few months theystart a company and offer NetWord 2.0 for a mere $2 per copy. You and 10million other avid followers have no qualms about paying the nominal fee.It sure beats the competition. In fact, at that price, you'll be checkingthe NetWord home page monthly to download the latest copy. As of the threecollege kids, they are now millionaires. Suddenly the OS that controls theCPU on your desktop is a legally of an old paradigm, relegated to a secondarytier in the software food chain. This means that Microsoft is now a severelyoverpriced personal productivity tools applications vendor with an OS businessthat is no longer able to &quot;captivate&quot; the end user by being theonly platform to run desired applications. Keeping API's secret won't workanymore. Controlling the interfaces won't work anymore. The wall is downand there's no turning back. So where will that leave Microsoft? Scramblingto explain to investors why the company's market cap is 10 times revenues,scrambling to explain how they can survive in the world of disposable, run-anywhereInternet software. Of course, the marketing muscle up in the Northwest willtry to figure out a way to play in this space. But playing now means playingon a level field. The rules are the same for everyone. They're spelled TCP/IP,Mosaic, WWW, HTTP, HTML and now Java--all the open protocols and languagesthat make up the Internet. It's barrier-free computing. It's consumer choice.It's a free-market economy in the information age, finally. From there,just about anything is possible. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Tesler, Vice President and Chief Scientist, Apple Computer </H3><BR><BR>To report technology history accurately is a difficult task requiring percipience,perspiration and perspective. Gilder has done it. He has combed throughthe attics of computing and assembled for the family a gripping album ofthe events and circumstances that created the phenomenon we call the Web.If the past is buried in clutter, however, the future is still more difficultto perceive, especially before the dazzle of Netscape and Java. In my view,the Web is a catalyst, but it is not all that matters about the Internet.The browser is to the Internet what the spreadsheet was to the desktop computer.Mosaic is the new VisiCalc, Netscape Navigator the new Lotus 1-2-3. Microsoftwould like to make Explorer the new Excel. Wall Street is as enamored withNetscape today as it was with Lotus when that company went public. Netscapeis a winner, but is the winner? With the aid of its ally, the Sun King,will it inherit the throne? Not necessarily. Where is the proprietary operatingsystem that runs not merely the equivalent of spreadsheets, but thousandsof applications? Where is the PI that some megalomaniac weaves into, well,a web, to attract, ensnare and ultimately consume hapless applications developersand most of the profits they worked so hard to earn? I hope that the namelessidealists who create the Internet on a daily basis succeed in their resistanceto central control more successfully than did their computer club counterpartsa decade ago. If they do, there may be no single successor to Bill Gates.If they don't then it's anyone's guess who will maneuver into that role.The drama promises to remain gripping. <BR><HR><H3>Howard Anderson, Founder, Yankee Group </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George - what took you so long? What is so surprising isthat you were so surprised that the Netscape revolution may supersede theMicrosoft revolution. Think back! Fifteen years ago, the office automationhype was about word processing, but the real revolution was electronic mail.Today 36 million Americans get their mail electronically and no one reallygives a damn about new word processing packages. Your beatification of MarcAndreessen is a little premature, don't you think? There are many visionaries,but few company builders. We in the venture community intuitively know thatthere is little likelihood that the visionaries will turn into the operatingmanagers new industries need. Other than Gates, who? What you have proposed(correctly) is that the peripheral becomes the major focus. Five years ago,the thought that IBM and the clone industry would become &quot;value-addedresellers&quot; for Intel and Microsoft would have been heresy. Now youare suggesting that the Internet will become the major focus--and Inteland Microsoft will be relegated to that &quot;value-added&quot; focus. Youare right. Nonetheless, quite frankly, the Internet needs three years tobe ready for prime time. Meanwhile, we will go through a sine curve of hype,backlash, then reality. Just when the naysayers sound and seem logical,the Internet will begin to fulfill its destiny, and that destiny is to becomethe most potent force in technology. And George, invite your mother to dinnerfor me. Of your technobabble family, she seems the most interesting! <BR><HR><H3>John Perry Barlow, Rancher, Writer, Web Guru, <BR>Grateful Dead Lyricist </H3><BR><BR><BR>I am enormously encouraged by George Gilder's discovery of the World WideWeb. I'm tempted to stoop to catty remarks about how long it took him. Lately,he's seemed almost alone among intelligent commentators in continuing tocredit the myth of the information superhighway--a belief that you can sustainonly if you don't know about the Web or if your perceptions have been profoundlyaltered by the reality-distortion fields generated within large contentconglomerates, telcos or cable companies, or the vast cluelessness thatis Washington, D.C. In fact, anyone using the phrase information superhighwayis almost certainly in the thrall of some large and doomed institution,or is a complete nimrod who knows only what he hears on television. Whichis, for obvious reasons, filled with people who believe in it. They're notgoing to be roadkill on it, by golly. They're going to find that on-ramp. . . hey, they're going to be the on-ramp! No way, San Jose! The futureof the Industrial Era media megaliths, whether Disney, Time Warner or, moreto the point, Microsoft, will arrive over the Web, not the mythical infobahn.The Web will be the end of them. We are up against a discontinuous leapas we hit the next layer of interactive complexity, both in software andin thought. It has now reached a point where about the only way to developall the scripts, scraps and code objects from which the next World WideOperating System (WWOS) will assemble itself is to grow them in the distributed,massively parallel amalgam of minds and processes that make up the Net.The Web is alive, and filled with life, nearly as mysterious, complex and,well, natural as a primordial swamp. Microsoft is a factory. You can't manufacturelife in a factory. You have to grow it in nature. This ___________ so new,really. _______________'s proprietary claims notwithstanding, I take thefirst WWOS, Unix, as proof that if enough graduate students type into enoughterminals long enough, they will eventually produce an operating system.And given enough graduate students, you can be sure that somewhere amongthem will be a Bill Joy or a Marc Andreessen. In accordance with Joy's Law,they won't be working at Microsoft. Furthermore, the Web and most browsersgive them a way to crib from one another, lavishly and easily. All that'snecessary to see the code that generated what's on your screen is to click:&quot;View source.&quot; All that's necessary to get your page employingsome of the same innovations is to copy and paste. This creates an environmentof dense autocollaboration. To see how productive it's already been in lessthan two years of existence, get on the Web now. This will make the micromputerrevolution look like a good start. Gilder's article is a fine thing. I'vebeen talking about the End of Microsoft for a couple of years and have feltlike a madman parading a ragged sign. When it starts coming from such impeccableseersuckers as George Gilder, it may be time to short a little of that Microsoftstock. <BR><HR><H3>Bert C. Roberts, Jr., Chairman &amp; CEO MCI Communications </H3><BR><BR>Gilder is dead-on right that hardware and operating systems will becomesubordinate to the network; that the network will, in effect, become subordinateto the network; that the network will, in effect, become everything andthe only thing. And he's right, too, about the evolution and impact of theInternet and the resultant focus on content. Gilder's allusions to Gatesand Microsoft, however, yield a very real question: Can they deal with thecoming transformation? Doing so will require a new vision of the futureand a new understanding of merging industries, evolving ways of computing,and some hard new facts. Here's a key one: Companies that don't addressand act on the need for collaborative work from a widening universe willfall hard--and fast. Confronting any rival with the market dominance ofMicrosoft will be very difficulty. But trying to run in place could be evenharder. The challenge is not only to understand, as Gilder writes, &quot;thatyour computer will never be the same&quot;--but also that it's your companythat will never be the same. Dan Lynch, Founder, Interop Chairman, CybercashGilder has got it figured out. His article is dead-on about how the Internetis the architecture of the future for information dissemination. Want proof?Pouring huge resources into its Microsoft Network and Microsoft Navigatorofferings, Microsoft admits that it does not really know the business modelfor how to make money in this new arena, but it is determined to get onthe playing field in a big way. Meanwhile, Sun is too hooked on hardwareprofits to make a new fortune on this round. No doubt that Java is the righttechnology for making the Net be the center of the universe. Sun shouldsimply spin that group out as a new company unfettered by dragging alonghardware. The only fault I find with Gilder's article is his picking MarcAndreessen as the next Bill Gates. Marc only has a few percent of Netscapestock; Bill has tons of Microsoft stock. Marc will make a lot of othersmuch richer and he surely won't suffer, but he will not become a feared/lovedmogul because of Netscape. Maybe he and Bill Joy should bolt and start theirown company? Marc is still younger than Gates was when Microsoft got itsplum from IBM. I asked Marc one question when I met him during his briefstint at EIT in Menlo Park. What was the central design assumption for Mosaic?He said 45 megabits per second! I asked why. He said that it makes it easyto program because you do not have to develop hairy mechanisms to mask outthe slowness of the network. Then commercial reality set in when he andJim Clark got together and they recentered their Netscape Navigator forthe 14.4 kilobit world, thus giving us the MS-DOS of the Internet. It isa good start, but Marc was right about 45 megabits--only it is not justto make the programmer's life easy, it is to make the consumer's life joyful.<BR><HR><H3>Nicholas Negroponte, Director, MIT media Lab Author, Being Digital </H3><BR><BR>Once again, George Gilder's got it right. His guide to the past and futureof the Net is on the digital dime and, as best I hear from my colleaguesat the MIT Media Lab, Java is really hot. We're betting our house on it.The Net, however, is no place for kings. It is a collective intelligencethat will work in spite of government and any attempts to control it. NoCarnegies, Rockefellers or Harrimans this time. The white envelope, George,is empty. When Larry Roberts invented the Internet in 1969, his decentralistapproach made the idea interesting for the military, because it was fail-safe.More than 25 years later, after the Vietnam and Cold wars, the Net is alsosafe from dominance of any kind. Supercomputer &eacute;migr&eacute;s, Unixhackers and Media Lab alumni have moved it forward (not Windows or Mac users),because they are made of the right stuff. This is serious media and computerscience, not the world of Windows applications. Here is where George iswrong. The next Bill Gates is not Marc Andreessen. Yes, Marc will do verywell. However, if you were a sucker to pay $75 per share for Netscape atthe opening on Aug. 9, keep it to yourself (if I hadn't been traveling betweenRio and Buenos Aires that day, I would have sold short and made 25 pointsin a few minutes). There will be many browsers, hundreds of them. Today,I'll bet on Niki Grauso's, which will come out in 37 languages. Browsersare the surface of a much deeper phenomenon. Sun Microsystems has it right:Java. Why? Because Java is a language and many smart people will expressthemselves and invent new applications in that language. Netscape is butone awning on the Virtual Boulevard of Digital Cafes. Java is the coffee.<BR><HR><H3>Andy Grove, President and CEO, Intel </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George--you haven't met a new technology you didn't like,and conversely you haven't met an older one that you don't think is readyto be toppled by the new. Do you remember when you wrote that &quot;specializedcomputers-to-a-chip will become the prevailing product category&quot;? Well,it didn't happen. Not that silicon compilers were back, not that ASICs areinsignificant, but the general-purpose computer that you pooh-poohed hasbecome the prevailing paradigm of the subsequent six years since the publicationof Microsm. Now you predict that the PC will become a peripheral attachedto an all-knowing, all-powerful Internet. I don't think so, George. Notthat the Internet won't be important; I look at it as one of the most importantapplications that will be used on my PC in the future. And that is the differencebetween us. What matters to me is my computer. I use my computer. I am usinga word processor to write this response; I use e-mail to communicate withhundreds of coworkers from my desk and from my home; I use CompuServe toget updated industry news; I use ProShare conferencing to do business withpartners across the world in real time. And I use Netscape to check outa new home page that I have hears about. A couple of years from now, I mayspend more time in the Net-based applications than in some of the others,just as today I spend my time differently among my applications than I didfive years ago. My computer will evolve and adapt (as PCs have been so goodat doing) to the ever-changing mix of applications with which I work. Youare wrong in another area. Implicit in so much of your writing is a fantasy:the notion of high-bandwidth communications reaching every PC. Today mycomputer is connected with ISDN to other computers; it is also connectedto LANs and to an ordinary phone line. Five years from now, my computerwill still be connected to an ordinary phone line and to ISDN, but alsoto broadband networks via a cable modem and to an ATM network to reach otherluck computer users; and probably to do some kind of wireless connection.Ten years from now, it will be another set of communications transport media.But it will never be a single superconnection, because goodness doesn'tarrive in a sing step. It comes a little at a time. To be sure, if God erasedall computers and networks and forced us to start from scratch, we wouldcertainly come a lot closer to your utopian view of broadband to the computer,with intelligence cleverly distributed between network and computers. Butthen, if God erased New York City, it would not be rebuilt the way it istoday. In real life, both cities and computer networks evolve, incrementby valuable increment. The bottom line is this: The magic of the PC businessis that there is a computer that I can look at, put my hands on and say,&quot;This computer is mine, and it opens the universe of tens of millionsof computers to me through its screen and keyboard--and whatever connectionscheme is available to me.&quot; Don't bury this magic; cherish it. <BR><HR><H3>Andy Kessler, Partner, Unterberg Harris </H3><BR><BR>Once again, my colleague and trendtender, George Gilder, has eloquentlyset forth the next wave of innovation. But in the process, the PC or clientdevice will not be hollowed out. Rather than living with fast servers andPCs acting as relatively dumb terminals, which is the architecture of Mosaicand the Web and even Java so far, the endgame is instead a network whereevery device is a server, even your own lousy PC. This means terribly intelligentand &quot;fat&quot; clients, enabling rather than just hanging off the network.Moreover, it is much too early to be handing out crowns to the new kingsof the network. George's trends are dead-on, but the kings are coronatedby natural selection, not by just showing up and claiming the throne. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen Manes, Columnist, New York Times, Author of Gates</H3><BR><BR><BR>Slow down, George! Sake's alive! Ma missed signs four and five! What sprangto mind upon reading Gilder's latest panegyric was not the rosey technologyfuture, but a Burma Shave ditty from my youth. I don't know Colombian beansabout Java, but I've been watching this industry too long not to reach formy methane detector when somebody announces in the language of corporatepropaganda that &quot;your computer will never be the same.&quot; This particularlocution almost always signifies too much time spent amid the rarefied gasesthat hove around chairmen and CEOs. A particularly toxic dose is to be suspectedwhen the proclaimed agent in change is an interpreted language. Interpretedlanguages have a long line of champions, not the least of whom is that greatBasic patron, William Henry Gates III (who seems less &quot;Archimdean&quot;than Charles Foster Kancan). But their magic has its limits, as Gates himselffound out when Microsoft developed its Multiplan spreadsheet on the interpretedruns-on-everything (but kinda slow) model and watched the compiled runs-on-DOS-only(but really fast) Lotus 1-2-3 force some massive recalculations at Microsoftheadquarters. Wasn't it only a few months ago that the press went gaga overGeneral Magic's interpreted Telescript, which now reportedly has, uh, someproblems? The runs-everywhere promise of interpreted languages generallymanages to get broken when it hits some Least Common Denominator--say, anotherLCD, the liquid crystal display. If you want to run Gilder's helicoptermodel on your crappy little Personal Digital Assistant, you may not haveto worry about having AutoCAD on your hard drive, but you probably willhave to worry about having a hard drive, not to mention a screen with enoughdetail and contrast to make the thing look vaguely like the original. TheIBM PC version of Multiplan was no prize, but it looked and felt great comparedwith the on that ran on the toy Commodore 64. Software is never truly independentof the hardware it runs on, interpreting programs tend to run with all thespeed of a tricycle, and bandwidth is still a long, long way from beingfree. <BR><HR><H3>Jesse Berst, Editor, Windows Watcher </H3><BR><BR>Mr. Gilder's article on the coming software shift is 10% fact and 90% wishfulthinking. Fact: Windows's dominance will come to an end when it is renderedirrelevant by a new platform. Wishful thinking: hoping the new platformwill be owned by somebody other than Microsoft. Gilder's fantasy of a Microsoft-freecomputer industry might come to pass if Bill Gates spent his time in hisvault counting his money. he doesn't He obsessively watches the horizonfor threats to his hegemony. When he spots a danger, he works feverishlyto use his current monopolies to leverage his way into the new arena. Hespotted the Internet danger about two years ago and has already spent morethan $100 million to make sure that Microsoft isn't left out. Yes, George,we will all eventually emigrate from the Windows desktop empire. But whenwe get to the new promised land, we're likely to find that Bill Gates hasalready acquired the prime real estate. Scott Cook, Chairman, Intuit Gilderchronicles invention like no other. He finds the history in the most recentevents. He finds the significance in invention before that significanceis real or realized. But Paul Saffo of the Institute for the Future tellshow the innovations that reshape our lives follow their enabling inventionsby years or decades. Gutenberg invented movable type. It took another 40years for an entrepreneur named Aldus to assemble what created book publishingas we known it. Marconi invented radio exactly 100 years ago. It took another25 years for entrepreneurs in Pittsburgh and New York to create broadcasting.It was through broadcasting that radio reshaped our lives. None of us expectit will taken 25 years for this chapter of the Internet story. But I hopeGilder will tackle the next question: How will these inventions change ourlives? Gordon Bell, Research Fellow, Microsoft, Inventor of Digital VAXcomputer Telecosm, like microcosm, is another interesting Gilder story.Like transistors that follow Moore's Law, bandwidth increases at 60% peryear. The Gilder Fallacy is that transistors and bandwidth will also becheap. This may be true in the very long run, and I hope to live long enoughto see it. Meanwhile, the memory cartel has kept prices constant at $50per megabyte and the telephone cartel has metered out bits in 64 kilobitPOTS [plain old telephone service] = chunks for decades. For example, fullISDN lines (two voice lines) cost at least twice POTS. ISDN is also veryinelegant since it makes poor use of the precious last mile, and is notadequate or scaleable. Only modems, created by a new datacom industry, havegotten faster. My version of the Internet story is at http://www.uvc.com.It is called &quot;Internet 1.0 (Arpanet), 2.0 (today), and 3.0 (what weneed),&quot; subtitled: &quot;It's bandwidth and Symmetry, Stupid.&quot;In 1987, I chaired the cross-agency federal task force that proposed NREN[National Research and Education Network], aka NII [National InformationInfrastructure], aka GII [Global Information Infrastructure]. Our recommendationwas &quot;that an advanced network be designed and developed to interconnectacademic, industrial and government research facilities in the U.S.,&quot;with the plan for a factor of a ten thousandfold increase in bandwidth by2002. Things have gone according to our &quot;vision&quot; to maintain constantdoubling for the last 25 years. Thank goodness Berners-Lee created the http://wwwnetwork, aka the Web, so that Andreessen could build Mosaic and its viewers;that's the serendipity part. Public funding of research (this time at Illinois'National Center for Supercomputing Applications) &quot;saved&quot; us again.Intermixed in Gilder's piece is another story about a new Sun programminglanguage, Java, which when combined with the Web, will render Microsoftineffective. If that's the case, then Sun needn't support the anti-Microsoftlegal consortium and should concentrate on toppling it with their products.However, as a newly hired Microsoft researcher, anxious to work his waydown the corporate hierarchy to programmer, I hope that he's wrong aboutour undoing. Microsoft is its own greatest enemy if it fails to make everyproduct embrace the Internet. In an organization that has to keep with chaotichardware platform evolution, having an external standard and threat is thebest thing that could happen. Of the 50-plus million Word and PowerPointusers, however, perhaps 10,000 will see Java as an Internet developmenttool. More likely it's a tool for developing Internet tools. Word alreadyproduced HTML pages and PowerPoint should have the goal of being the mostused Internet content editor. I'll bet that Windows NT (created by DaveCutler, who also happens to be the world's greatest programmer) will becomethe &quot;standard&quot; server platform, just as the Wintel platform, likethe Gilders use, runs nearly all the viewers. As for staying in the centerof the sphere---Gilder's right: Andreessen's there, but I wouldn't countGates out . . . yet. <BR><HR><H3>Charles Mann, Contributing Editor, Atlantic Monthly </H3><BR><BR>The vision Mr. Gilder proposes is wonderfully attractive--who could notlike the idea of a future in which nobody has to struggle with the maddeninglimitations and incompatibilities of the PC? But the idea of plugging everyoneinto the Net for their work and play poses problems of its own, pride ofplace perhaps going to security. The number of Internet crackers and wannabecrackers is rising; worse, the very speed and ubiquity of the Net meansthat each new break-in technique becomes instantly available to all of them,as the spread of Root Kit an its analogues attests. Putting the whole worldonline will increase the opportunity for mischief enormously. At present,we have two basic means for fending off these guys--firewalls and encryption.Put crudely, firewalls are small computers that stand between you and theNet, scanning for unwanted incoming bits. (CheckPoint Software Technologiesin Israel, makes one of the more interesting examples). In one way or another,firewalls intercept and read parts of every Internet packet that comes yourway. If everyone's software is based somewhere &quot;out there&quot; onthe web, the computing power and bandwidth required to filter every screendump and rewrite through the firewall is interesting to contemplate. A worseproblem comes when the information is encrypted--how is the firewall toread it without decoding it? And if it does decode it, aren't you decodinginformation outside the intended recipient network? It's a problem. Forthis reason, most Net aficionados argue that some form of public-key encryptionis the answer. Leaving aside the extraordinary reserves of computing powerthat will be required to encrypt every bit of info going in and out of everysystem in the world--and the even more vexing question of who will pay forit, a subject on which I am not nearly as sanguine as Mr. Gilder--one hasto worry about the possibilities of breakthroughs such as those reportedrecently in Science, where researchers took advantage of the vagaries ofquantum mechanics to reduce the time required to factor large numbers enormously.Because encryption in its present form depends on the huge amount of timeit now takes to factor such numbers, these advances have dismaying implications.We could face a future in which advances in encryption and decoding raceeach other, Red Queen-style--hardly a situation favoring the confident useof a global network. Until these problems are resolved, they will be a bigdamper on the kind of bustling, productive, interconnected future that Mr.Gilder and I both hope is just around the corner. <BR><HR><H3>Bob Metcalfe, Ethernet Inventor and 3Corm Founder, <BR>InfoWorld Columnist </H3><BR><BR>To refind Gilder's model for how Gates gets dethroned, I'll briefly explainhow Gates made his billions. Gates came of age just as Grosch's Law aboutthe scale economies of bigger computers was giving way to Moore's Law aboutthe volume economies of smaller computers. Gates saw early and clearly theprofit potential in controlling standards, like the horizontal protocolstandards for communicating back and forth among computers, and like thevertical interface standards for communicating up and down between applicationssoftware and underlying computer operating systems software. I went withhorizontal protocol standards, namely Ethernet, which I advanced by givingit away to all other comers. Gates went with vertical interface standards,namely IBM's PC-DOS, which he advanced more shrewdly by giving it away toIBM but selling it to all comers. To build the value of PC-DOS, Gates gathereda huge flock of application software developers and got them committed tohis interface standards. Then by controlling changes to DOS's interfaces,upgrading them step-by-step all the way up to Windows 95, Gates was alsoable to sell them over and over again in upgraded forms. With that money,he could exploit inside knowledge of his own interface changes to pick offone after another of the larger application developers, like those in wordprocessing, spreadsheets, presentations and, now, electronic mail and databases.His only major failure to date has been in networking, where he's failedso far to kill Novell. That failure involved control of Novell's protocolstandards rather than interface standards where Microsoft is king. Gildersays that Moore's Law is giving way to Metcalfe's Law, which projects therunaway value of numerous internetworked computers. According to Gilder'spoint of view, this exponential effect shifts importance from the verticalprogramming interface standards upon which the Redmond Rockefeller's fortuneis built to horizontal communication protocol standards which the likesof Marc Andreessen might be expected to dethrone Gates, perhaps becomingthe Microsoft of the Internet. But Gates, of course, aims to be the Microsoftof the Internet. And he need only broaden his tried-and-true interface strategyto include the protocols from the World Wide Web, now threatening his standardsdominance. Gates has the advantage of his current Windows monopoly, whichhe is now trying to leverage into control of the Web--let's hope our antitrustsheepdogs eventually arrive on the scene. Andreessen and company have thedisadvantage of coming from the virtuously open but fractious Unix world.Unless they can keep their Web standards act together, they will lose theWeb to the Windows Microsoft Network in the same way they lost Unix to DOS.MSN and Netscape will likely shape up to be the major opponents in the comingWeb Wars. MSN is making its play to replace Berners-Lee's Web standardswith its own under Blackbird. Microsoft is now giving away MSN browserslike Netscape and can be expected at some point to sell MSN servers andtools directly opposite Netscape's servers. Netscape, on the other hand,with its very busy Web pages is looking more and more like an on-line servicein competition with MSN, advertising and all. I must say that this battleis one that my InfoWorld readers will enjoy, as the fierce competition willdrive the Web toward its full potential. Gates doesn't need it, and certainlydoesn't expect it from me, but I do have to defend him. Andreessen and companyhave not yet made their billions, and they now look innocently charming,gregarious and eager, attractive compared with the shrewd and intense Mr.Gates. But, I've seen close up what even $1 million can do to people, andfrankly Gates handles his billions about as well as it is reasonable toexpect. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen S. Roach, Chief Economist, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. </H3><BR><BR>Gilder's gushing hype has finally come full circle. He has come to the keyrecognition that there's more to the information age than the alluring powerof Moore's Law. This time-worn mantra of a vendor-driven rhetoric extolsthe miracles of performance of payback--the productivity paradox wherebystartling advances in computational speed fail to deliver the value-addedsolutions that truly matter for society as a whole. But now Gilder heraldsa new &quot;killer app&quot; in user-friendly browsers and new &quot;minimalist&quot;programming languages such as Java. But don't count on it--at least notyet. In the fast-track 1990s, technology must still come to grips with aprofound upheaval in American lifestyles. For the first time ever, white-collarworkers--fully two-thirds of the U.S. workforce--are being asked to up theante of their own productivity contributions through longer and harder work,squeezing family and leisure time as never before in the last 50 years.Surfing the Net in a quest for the &quot;best&quot; application--and learninghow to use each of the new tools--takes considerable time. And that's therub: Time-intensive surfing is in direct conflict with the harsh realitiesof a time-constrained era. In the end, it all boils down to return. Theaverage U.S. worker who has toiled under the burden of stagnant real wagesfor more than a decade will insist on measurable improvements in personalproductivity before squandering ever-greater amounts of leisure and familytime on an open-ended journey on the telecosm. However alluring the latestbreakthroughs in electronic shopping, banking, and video selection may seemto be, my guess is that they don't meet the hurdle rate for the averageAmerican. That's the crux of the dilemma that Gilder still doesn't get:The promises of the telecosm will ring hollow until new means of incomegeneration and wealth creation for society as a whole are created. At best,a flexible software paradigm is merely another means to automate existingtasks. The big steps come with applications that truly change the functionsof work and leisure. And they have yet to be taken. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Ellison, Founder, CEO and Chairman, Oracle Systems Corp. </H3><BR><BR>I believe George has it half right. The center of gravity is indeed shiftingaway from the personal computer and toward the network--specifically towardthe Internet's World Wide Web. Despite the Clinton administration's mostdetermined regulatory efforts, networks are getting faster and cheaper.Various telecommunication bills pending in Congress will decrease regulation,increase competition and accelerate this trend. Cost and ease-of-use improvements,plus video capability, will make the World Wide Web as popular as the familiarTV and telephone networks for communication and commerce, as well as forinformation and entertainment. Bandwidth will expand exponentially and sowill the quality and quantity of information on the Net. The informationage will move from dawn to full daylight. And our world will be changed.But probably not by Netscape: Wall Street and Mr. Gilder are greatly charmedby he most exciting startup since 3DO, but it is important to remember thatNetscape's improbably $2.4 billion valuation comes without earnings or anyquick hope thereof. In the absence of any commercial competition, Netscapewas able to achieve a 70% =&quot;market share&quot; by distributing itsbrowser for free via the Internet. When a clearly superior Browser becomesavailable, people will replace their Netscape browser just the way theygot it--with the touch of a button. The most important new feature announcedfor a future version of the Netscape browser in Sun's hot new Java programminglanguage, which Sun is trying to make an open standard. We're all for it,but you don't get to be the next Microsoft by distributing Sun softwareand helping create open standards. You get to be Microsoft by creating yourown proprietary standard, while convincing everybody it's actually an openstandard. Fortunately, this trick usually works only once, so there willbe no new Microsoft. One is quite enough, thank you. Marc Andreessen isnot Bill Gates. It's probably possible to be great without being Bill. Butit takes a lot of work. Gates is the chairman of Microsoft, the CEO, itsfounder and the man who makes every key hiring decision. Andreessen is neitherchairman (that's Jim Clark), nor CEO (that's Jim Barksdale), but a hiredgun. Hired, in fact, by Jim Clark. History generally shows us only one Rockefellerper industry--the first one tends to get rid of future rivals. If a cosmicshift causes King Bill to lose his throne, it will not be filled by Andreessenor anybody else. There is no next Bill Gates--in software--at least. <BR><HR><H3>Steve Case, President and CEO, America Online </H3><BR><BR>I have a simple request: Let's not forget about the customer. A &quot;realitygap&quot; exists between technologists (breathlessly enchanted with thelatest and greatest revolutionary developments) and the mass consumer market(inevitably preferring evolutionary incrementalism). Invariably, developershave powerful workstations, superfast networks, and a certain affinity forcomplexity. Meanwhile, tens of millions of people out there struggle withmemory-deprived 386s, painfully slow modems (in the real world 14.4 kbpsis considered pretty fast, and 28.8 kbps is the promised land), and a tremendousthirst for simplicity. Yes, telephone companies are getting more aggressivewith ISDN pricing and marketing, and developers are reaching for plug-and-playsolutions, but it's still too hard and still too expensive. Yes, cable companiesare testing cable modems, but the tests are going slowly and broad deploymentis likely to take many years. Switching gears to software, Gilder embracesthe commonly held notion that Netscape's browser is the standard, commandinga dominant (&quot;70%&quot;) market share. But all of the commercial on-lineservices now provide Web access, and they have overnight become the dominantforce in the consumer Web. Neither of the two largest existing players (AOLand CompuServe), nor the most significant entrant (Microsoft), are Netscape'slicensees, so Netscape's market share is therefore zero in this emergingsegment. The already fragmented Web market is likely to get even more fragmented,creating havoc for publishers and confusion for consumers. Ultimately, theservices with the largest audiences will drive standardization. So whenI read about the &quot;dynamically portable&quot; Java, linked with theNetscape browser &quot;standard&quot; and coupled with a &quot;bandwidthtidal wave,&quot; leading a &quot;telecosmic advance&quot; towards a worldchock-full of custom applets filled with tasty morsels of &quot;executablecontent,&quot; Exciting, but I wonder how -- and when -- it will all cometogether into a mass market for interactive services. People don't buy browsers.They don't buy objects. They don't buy bandwidth. They buy services. Theywant access to a broad range of content, packaged and presented in a friendly,useful, engaging manner, priced simply and affordably, with a strong underlyingsense of community. At AOL, our aim is to reach tens of millions of peopleand help shape this new medium. We will continue to leverage technologyto do -- but we'll also remind ourselves that although technologists believethe journey is the reward, for everybody else, the destination is what reallycounts. <BR><HR><H2><CENTER>George Gilder Replies: </CENTER></H2><BR><BR>When the responses to an article exceed the original in pith and pertinence,the writer may be tempted merely to step back, point and applaud. However,at the risk of revealing Forbes ASAP trade secrets, I will correct the impressionthat I am some kind of sappy seersucker who gets his information from dotingCEOs, perhaps in the telephone and TV industries. In fact, much to the irritationof the PR firms surrounding large companies, I invariably rely mostly onengineers, programmers and other technologists and consult the imperialsuits chiefly en route to the illuminati in the nether reaches of theircompanies. <BR><BR><BR>As Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley has noticed with some impatience, I alsogive short shrift to the kind of macrovisions, strategies and statisticsthat float up to the top of economic models. These data are too light onthe technical details in which reside the angels and devils of industrialdestiny. For example, Roach remains perplexed by the &quot;productivityparadox,&quot; the lack of evident payoff of information tools, the failuresof the industry to surmount the hurdle rates of humbler households, allin the face of some 60 million worldwide prospective PC sales in 1995, exceedingTV unit sales in the U.S., with e-mail passing the U.S. Postal Service inmessage units. Meanwhile, U.S. companies are capturing some 50% of all theprofits of the industrial world and maintaining market share between 60%and 90% in most leading-edge products, while deploying three times as muchcomputer power per capita as either Europe or Japan. <BR><BR><BR>Roach trusts government productivity data and wage levels more than thedemonstrable achievements of U.S. companies and calls the conflict a portentousparadox. I say that both the wage and productivity data are largely bunkum,based on silly deflators that mostly fail to capture the plummeting pricesin the industry, while U.S. leadership in PCs, peripherals, networks andsoftware is the real payoff. PC companies alone have generated some $250billion in market caps over the last decade; Internet companies will generatetrillions. These bonanzas answer all the questions on hurdle rates and socialyields (though if you want to see some real high-speed hurdling in homes,wait until cable modems proliferate next year). The payoff of informationtechnology is the global leadership of the U.S. economy despite appallingpolicy mistakes from the Bush and Clinton administrations. <BR><BR><BR>Like me, Andy Grove likes to wrangle and I hesitate to deny him his pugilisticjollies. Among the new technologies I did not like from the outset are HDTV,interactive TV, TV shopping, game machines, Japanese fifth-generation computers,NMOS, videophones, flash memories, serial Crays, Thinking Machines, 3DOand pencentric PDAs. But perhaps we can make a deal. I will concede to himand Andy Kessler that the use of the term &quot;hollowing out of the computer,&quot;borrowed from the estimable Eric Schmidt of Sun, is hyperbolic, even misleadingin an absolute sense. But they should acknowledge that in relative terms,the balance between desktop and network is shifting sharply. After all,in five out of the six PC uses Grove cites, most of the value originateson the network. Nonetheless, I do cherish the PC; indeed, using the Internet,I believe it will displace both the telephone and television over the nextfive years or so.<BR><HR><BR><H4><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="177"HEIGHT="54" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></H4></BODY></HTML>

would be fundamental . . . like being at the center of a sphere, where there
were opportunities--and problems, of course!--in all directions.&quot; <BR>

<HR>What will it take to launch a new Bill Gates--an Archimedean man who
sharply shifts the center of the sphere, alters the axes of technology and
economy, and builds a new business empire on new foundations? Who can inherit
the imperial throne in the microcosm and telecosm currently held by the
Redmond Rockefeller? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I will open the envelope in a minute. But first I want to tell you about
a new software program called Netscape Navigator Personal Edition. I brought
it back from Silicon Valley in late June and put the package next to my
PC. The PC was proudly running a beta version of Windows 95. I had presented
Windows 95 with great fanfare to my 11-year-old son Richard as his route
to the most thrilling new frontiers of the computer world. Multitasking,
32-bit operation, flat memory! Object linking and embedding! &quot;Information
at your fingertips!&quot; But, all in all, he preferred his Mac Quadra 840AV
or even Windows 3.1. They don't crash so often, he explained. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I live out in the boondocks of western Massachusetts where there are no
convenient full-service connections to the Internet. So I was much less
excited about Netscape than I was about Windows 95. I hoped Windows 95 would
put me on line through the Microsoft Network system. Some 10 minutes later,
though, Richard wanted to know my credit car number so I could choose an
Internet service provider. A couple of minutes after that, linked through
internetMCI's 800 number, Richard was on the World Wide Web, using the InfoSeek
service to examine my chapters from Telecosm on line, searching the secrets
of Sim City 2000 at Maxis, exchanging messages with Microsoft Flight Simulator
buffs, and exploring Disney. As far as I know, he is still there. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing I knew, my brother Walter came by. He worked for a computer
company, New World Technologies in Ashland, Mass., that builds customized
Pentium machines and delivers them to value-added resellers within 48 hours.
Walter wanted the Netscape program. He took it back to my parents' farm
down the road and booted it up on a four-megabyte 386SX Dynatech previously
used to map the pedigrees of a flock of Romney sheep. Soon he was on the
Web scouting out the competition from Dell and Micron and showing off the
Gilder Web page. This intrigued my 77-year-old mother, who had scarcely
even noticed a computer before. I don't know how it happened, but before
the night was out, she too was on the Web, exploring catalogs of British
colleges for her namesake granddaughter who was soon to leave for London.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now let me tell you about my introduction to Java, a new programming language
that menaces Microsoft's software supremacy. I encountered Java in early
June at a Sun Microsystems conference at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in
downtown San Francisco. For a speech I was to give, I had planned to use
a multimedia presentation, complete with Macro-Mind Director images and
QuickTime video that I had contrived with an expensive professional some
months earlier. The complexities of Director prompted me to convert the
program to Astound. However, it required an external disk drive and ran
erratically with the eight megabytes of RAM on my PowerBook. I decided to
speak nakedly from notes on the coming technologies of sand and glass and
air. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following me immediately to the stage was Sun's amiable chief scientist,
John Gage. He decided to illustrate his speech entirely from the World Wide
Web. He began with a handsome page, contrived minutes before, giving an
account of my speech, headlined: &quot;Gilder Addresses Sun, Tells of Technologies
of Opaque Silicon and Transparent Silicon.&quot; Then he moved to the Gilder
Telecosm archives run by Gordon Jacobson of Portman Communications at a
Web site of the University of Pennsylvania's engineering school. Gage illustrated
his talk with real-time reports on traffic conditions in San Diego (where
I was about to go), weather conditions in Florida as a hurricane loomed,
and developments on Wall Street as IBM bid for Lotus. He showed the Nasdaq
ticker running across the screen. He showed animations of relevant charts,
cute little Java gymnasts cartwheeling across the screen, three-dimensional
interactive molecular models and an overflowing coffee cup, entitled &quot;HotJava.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
None of his information and images used a desktop presentation program,
whether from MacroMind or from Microsoft. None of them used a database engine,
whether SQL or Oracular. Indeed, except for the Gilder speech report, none
were created beforehand. Incurring no memory or disk drive problems, Gage
summoned all the illustrations to his PowerBook directly from the Internet.
The animations employed a new computer language, Java, written for the Web
by the venerable Sun programmer James Gosling. Java allows transmission
of executable programs to any computer connected to the Net to be interpreted
and played safely and securely in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Clifford Stoll, calls it &quot;Silicon snake oil.&quot; But I call it a
fundamental break in the history of technology. It is the software complement
of the hollowing out of the computer described in Forbes ASAP (&quot;The
Bandwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December 5, 1994). Almost overnight, the CPU
and its software have become peripheral; the network, central. I had spent
working on a presentation on my desktop computer, using an array of presentation
software. But Gage improvised a more impressive and animated presentation
without using any desktop presentation programs at all. The World Wide Web
and the Java language were enough. Restricted to the files of my computer,
I struggled with storage problems and incompatible research formats, while
he used the storage capacity and information resources of more than five
million host computers on the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly for my family, the limitations of my parents' barnyard four-megabyte
386SX didn't matter. The operating system also didn't matter. What was crucial
was the network gear and software. My brother Walter had installed a modem
that linked to the Web at an average of 24.6 kilobits per second. With the
Netscape Navigator, that was enough. Actually 14.4 would have been enough.
Enough to launch a new Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Admit it, the legacy version, once so luminous, is beginning to lose its
shine. You thrill no longer at his vaporware $50 million house, fenestrated
with $40 billion Windows, offering misty views of Daytona, Memphis, Cairo,
and other far-off places you no longer really care to go, even if--OLE--they
are swimming with GML 3D screensavers from London's National Gallery endlessly
hurdling the 640K barrier as if it were flat as a Mac. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the most essential level, Bill Joy of Sun illuminated Gates's dilemma
at Esther Dyson's PC Forum conference in 1990. Known as one of the great
minds in software, yet losing share inexorably to Microsoft, Joy seemed
to be moving into the role of conference crank. Year after year, he lamented
the prolix inelegance of the triumphant waves of Microsoft programs sweeping
through the industry: &quot;As we add more and more of these features to
older systems,&quot; he said, &quot;the complexity gets multiplicative.
I have 10 different packages that interact in 10-to-the-10th different ways.
I get all sorts of surprises, and yet because these things don't play together
well the power is only additive. I get this feature and that feature but
the combinations don't work. What I'd really like to see is a system where
the complexity goes up in a linear way but the power goes up exponentially.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In software, complexity has long been rising exponentially, while power
has been rising additively. In response, Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of
Pascal and other programming languages, has propounded two new Parkinson's
Laws for software: &quot;Software expands to fill the available memory,&quot;
and &quot;Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware gets faster.&quot;
Indeed, newer programs seem to run more slowly on most systems than their
previous releases. Compare Word 6.0 for the Mac, for example, with Word
5.0 or WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows with WordPerfect for DOS. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But none of this matters. Gates has moved from triumph to triumph by shrewdly
exploiting the advances of microcosmic hardware. With Moore's Law and the
Law of the Microcosm, the number of transistors on a chip doubles every
18 months, and cost/performance rises as the square of the number of transistors.
The complexity sinks into the microcosm and power rises exponentially on
the chip to absorb all the complexity grenades rolling down from Redmond.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates travels in the slipstream behind Moore's Law, following a key rule
of the microcosm: Waste transistors. As Nicholas Negroponte puts it, &quot;Every
time Andy [Grove] makes a faster chip, Bill uses all of it.&quot; Wasting
transistors is the law of thrift in the microcosm, and Gates has been its
most brilliant and resourceful exponent. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, in the face of Gates's ascendancy, Bill Joy seemed to grow curls
and shed influence, as Sun played rope-a-dope with Hewlett-Packard and other
workstation rivals. In 1990, he retreated to a sylvan aerie in Aspen, Colo.,
to pursue &quot;advanced research&quot; for Sun. But his talk of small programs
and handheld consumer appliances seemed irrelevant to the company. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, in early 1990, showing up late--in a Hawaiian shirt--to address
a formal dinner in Silicon Valley, Bill Joy had a great prophetic moment.
He cited the Moore's Law trends as grounds for granting the first five years
of the 1990s to Bill Gates. &quot;It's pretty much determined,&quot; he
said. Indeed, in the late 1980s, Joy had personally made a separate peace
with Microsoft by selling a large portion of his Sun holdings and buying
Microsoft shares, thus becoming the second richest of Sun's four founders.
(The richest, Andy Bechtolsheim, jumped even deeper into Microsoft.) But
then, around 1995, predicted Joy, everything would change. There would be
a &quot;break-through that we cannot imagine today.&quot; He even acknowledged
that the breakthrough would not come from Sun, but &quot;from people and
companies we cannot know today.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to software innovation, he said, was smart programmers. Smart programmers
are hundreds of times more productive than ordinary programmers. And &quot;let's
be truthful,&quot; said the sage of Sun, propounding what has become known
as Joy's Law, &quot;most of the bright people don't work for you--no matter
who you are. You need a strategy that allows for innovation occurring elsewhere.&quot;
To the Justice Department, Microsoft's overwhelming OS market share and
its teeming armies of programmers seem a barrier to entry for other software
competitors. To Joy, Microsoft's size and dominance could become a barrier
to entry for Microsoft, blocking it from the key new markets of the late
1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is now clear that Joy was on target. The breakthrough is here in force,
invading and occupying all the commanding heights of the information economy,
from the media to the universities. It is the World Wide Web and its powerful
browsers, servers, languages and programming tools. Software on individual
machines still bogs down in the macrocosmic swamps of complexity. But in
the telecosm, yields rise exponentially almost without limit in proportion
to the number and power of the machines on the network. No matter how much
memory and other storage is created on the desktop, no matter what information
resources are assembled on CD-ROMs, no matter how powerful are the database
tools created for the LAN, the desktop imperium will pale and wither before
the telecosmic amplitudes of the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, the number of machines on the network has been
rising between five and 10 times faster than the number of transistors on
a chip. With 1,300 miles of fiber-optic lines being laid every day in the
U.S., band-width is sure to rise even faster than the number of networked
computers (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The Bankwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December
5, 1994). This awesome transition presents a supreme chance for new leadership
in developing software focused less on wasting transistors than on wasting
bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A computer on every desktop and in every home? Information at your fingertips?
SQL Server 6.0? My son Richard yawns. Let's face it, Bill, that stuff is
yesterday. In the new era, Microsoft cant continue to feed on the microcosm.
But the leading-edge companies will move to the frontiers of the telecosm,
where collectively they will grow far faster than Microsoft. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, open the envelope. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's find a new Bill Gates. Start by adding 100 pounds of extra heft, half
a foot of height and two further years of schooling, then make him $12.9
billion hungrier. Give him a gargantuan appetite for pizza and Oreos, Bach,
newsprint, algorithms, ideas, John Barth, Nabokov, images, Unix code, bandwidth.
Give him a nearly unspellable Scandinavian name--Marc Andreessen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Put him to work for $6.85 per hour at Illinois's National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) writing 3D visualization code on a Silicon Graphics
Indy for a Thinking Machine C-5 or a Cray YMP16. Surround him on all sides
by the most advanced computers and software in the world, under the leadership
of cybernetic visionary Larry Smarr. What will happen next? &quot;Boredom,&quot;
Andreessen replies. Supercomputers, already at the end of their tether,
turned out to be &quot;underwhelming Unix machines.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then, for a further image of the end of the world, take him in the fall
of 1990 off to Austin, Tex., for two semesters at IBM. &quot;They were going
to take over the 3D graphics market, they were going to win the Malcolm
Baldridge Award, they were going to blow Silicon Graphics [the regnant Silicon
Valley 3D workstation company] off the map, all in six months.&quot; Andreessen
began by doing performance analysis and moved on to work on the operating
system kernel. In mid-1991, after constant delays, the company was finally
ready to ship a world-beating 3D engine. But the new IBM machine turned
out to be four times slower at seven times the price of the equivalent Silicon
Graphics hardware that IBM had bundled a year and a half earlier with its
RS6000 RISC (reduced instruction set computing) workstation. Austin IBM
returned to the drawing board and Andreessen returned to Illinois to get
his degree. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In both commercial and academic settings, Andreessen thus had the good fortune
of working at the very heard of the old order of computing in its climactic
phase. As Andreessen saw it, little of long-term interest was going on at
either establishment. But both did command one huge and felicitous resource,
vastly underused, and that was the Internet. &quot;Designed for all the
wrong reasons--to link some 2,000 scientists to a tiny number of supercomputers,&quot;
it had exploded into a global ganglion thronged by millions of people and
machines. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many people saw the Internet as throbbing with hype and seething with problems--Clifford
Stoll's book, Silicon Snake Oil, catalogs many: the lack of security, substance,
reliability, bandwidth, easy access; the presence of porn, fraud, frivolity
and freaks guarantees, so he says, that no serious business can depend on
it for critical functions. But to Andreessen the problems of the Internet
are only the other side of its incredible virtues. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;By usual standards,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;the Internet was
far from perfect. But the Internet finds its own perfection--in the millions
of people that are able to use it and the hundreds of thousands who can
provide services for it.&quot; To Andreessen, all the problems signaled
that he was at the center of the sphere, gazing in wild surmise at &quot;a
giant hole in the middle of the world&quot;--the supreme opportunity of
the age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen saw that, for all its potential, there was a monstrous incongruity
at the heart of the Internet. Its access software was at least 10 years
behind. &quot;PC Windows had penetrated all the desktops, the Mac was a
huge success, and point-and-click interfaces had become part of everyday
life. But to use the Net you still had to understand Unix. You had to type
FTP [file transfer protocol] commands by hand and you had to be able to
do addressmapping in your head between IP addresses and host names and you
had to know where all the FTP archives were' you had to understand IRC [Internet
relay chat] protocols, you had to know how to use this particular news reader
and that particular Unix shell prompt, and you pretty much had to know Unix
itself to get anything done. And the current users had little interest in
making it easier. In fact, there was a definite element of not wanting to
make it easier, of actually wanting to keep the riffraff out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The almost miraculous key to opening up the Internet was the concept of
hypertext, invented by Theodor Holm Nelson, the famously fractious prophet
of the &quot;Xanadu&quot; network, and son of Celeste Holm, the actress.
A hypnotic speaker, with a gaunt countenance and flowing golden hair, Nelson
seems an Old Testament Jeremiah from Central Casting as he rails against
the flaws and foibles of current-day computing. Hypertext is simply text
embedded with pointers to other text, instantly and full available by a
point and click. For the source of the concept, Nelson quotes an essay by
Vannevar Bush written in 1945 and read to him by his father as a boy: &quot;The
human mind . . . operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it
snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts,
in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of
the brain.&quot; Projecting this idea from a single human brain to a global
ganglion, Nelson sowed the conceptual seeds of the World Wide Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen can explain both the power of hypertext and its slow emergence
in commercial products: &quot;Xanadu was just a tremendous idea. But hypertext
depends on the network. If the network is there, hypertext is incredibly
useful. It is the key mechanism. But if the network is not there, hypertext
does not give you any of the richness.&quot; Hence, Apple's HyperCard and
similar schemes failed to ignite. The link is not hyper if it is restricted
to your hard drive or CD-ROM. Connected to millions of computers around
the globe, it becomes exponentially hyper. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The other thing about hypertext,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;is that,
even on networks, traditionally it had been developed by theoreticians and
people very deep in the computer science community, and they tended to worry
very deeply about problems like, 'Well, what happens if the information
moves?'&quot; As Gates put it in 1992: &quot;The idea of locating things
that move by their properties and dealing with the security and efficiency
issues, including using replication to do this stuff well, is a very tough
problem. That's what Windows's Cairo is all about. Three or four Ph.D. theses
talk about this, but a commercial system has never done it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen brings the issue down to earth: &quot;You've got a pointer at
a piece of information on the network, but Joe, who's running that information,
moves it somewhere else. Computer scientists would take a look at the problem
and say, 'Oh, the system doesn't work.' On the Internet, we look at that
problem and say, 'Oh well, here's another 20,000 pointers that do work.'
And may be we can send e-mail to Joe and he'll put his information back.&quot;
In other words, you don't wait for Cairo or Xanadu to try to solve every
problem. You go with the fabulous flow of opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nelson's idea led to what Gary Wolf, a contributing writer of Wired, calls
&quot;one of the most powerful designs of the 20th century&quot;--a universal
library, a global information index and a computerized royalty system. But
Nelson's quest for perfection led to a 20-year adventure in futility. &quot;The
opinion of the Xanadu people to this day is that the Web and the Internet
are much too simple. They don't solve the problems. For instance, the links
aren't fully bidirectional. You don't know exactly who's pointing to your
page, and there's two ways to look at that. The way that Ted Nelson looks
at it is 'That's bad!' The way I look at it is 'That's great!' All of a
sudden anyone can point to your page without permission. The Net can grow
at its own rate. You get the network effect, you get Metcalfe's Law, it
spirals completely out of control. Isn't that fantastic?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1988, Xanadu found funding from John Walker, the charismatic recluse,
taxpatriate in Switzerland, and founder of Autodesk, the desktop computer-aided
design (CAD) company. As Walker prophetically declared in 1988: &quot;In
1964, Xanadu was a dream in a single mind. In 1980, it was the shared goal
of a small group of brilliant technologists. By 1989, it will be a product.
And by 1995, it will begin to change the world.&quot; All truer than Walker
could have imagined, but it would not happen, alas, at Autodesk. Haunted
by dreams of perfection and hobbled by hyperventilation at the helm, Xanadu
misted over. Autodesk sustained the effort until it was mercifully terminated
by the new CEO, Carol Bartz, in 1993 at the very moment that a real Xanadu,
deemed hopelessly imperfect and inadequate by Nelson, was about to burst
forth efflorescently on the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demiurgic step came from Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Switzerland, creating
the World Wide Web based on a universal hypertext function. He launched
initial HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) governing transport on the Web.
He developed URLs (uniform resource locators) as a common addressing system
that joined most of the existing Internet search and linkage technologies.
He conceived the HTML (hypertext markup language), a kind of PostScript
for the Web. He made the system ignore failures (Joe's moving data could
not crash your machine). Thus, invoking a browser (i.e., a hypertext reader),
the user could point and click to information anywhere on the Net, unconscious
of whether it was in the form of a file transfer, an e-mail, a Gopher search
or a news posting, or whether it was in the next room or in Tasmania. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Berners-Lee addressed a basic problem of the Internet from the point of
view of an academic researcher. But the real opportunity was to open the
Internet to the world and the world to the Internet, and that would require
more than a facility for cruising through textual materials. After all,
the bulk of human bandwidth is in a person's eyes and ears. For absorbing
text, as Robert Lucky, author of Silicon Dreams, has pointed out, the speed
limit is only some 55 bits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To burst open the Internet would require reaching out to the riffraff who
travel through pictures and sounds at megahertz speeds. To critics of a
more vulgar Net, such as Stoll, more riffraff sending a callipygian naked-lady
bitmaps and voluminous digital ululations from the Grateful Dead and QuickTime
first-step baby videos traipsing down the lines and wriggling through the
routers would soon cause a gigantic crash. Even some of Andreessen's main
allies at the NCSA shared some of these fears. At CERN, Berners-Lee opposed
images and video on these grounds. The technologists all held a narrowband
view of the world, imagining bandwidth as an essentially scarce resource
to be carefully husbanded by responsible citizens of the cybersphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Tim Berners-Lee alone could not burst open the Internet pi&ntilde;ata
and give it to the world. As Richard Wiggins, author of Internet for Everyone:
A Guide for Users and Providers, observes, &quot;During 1992 and early 1993,
graphical Gopher clients for the Macintosh and Windows evolved, and it appeared
that Gopher would outstrip the fledgling Web.&quot; It was the ultimate
broadband booster, Marc Andreessen, working with NCSA colleague Eric Bina,
who ignited the Web rocket. One late December night in 1992 at the Espresso
Royale cafe in Champaign-Urbana, Andreessen looked his friend Eric Bina
in the eye and said: &quot;Let's go for it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every Gates has to have his Paul Allen (or Jobs, his Steve Wozniak). Andreessen's
is Bina--short and wiry where Andreessen is ursine, cautious where he is
cosmic, focused where he is expansive, apprehensive where he is evangelical,
bitwise where he is prodigal with bandwidth, ready to stay home and write
the code where Andreessen is moving on to conquer the globe. Wildly contrasting
but completely trusting and complementary, these two--in an inspired siege
of marathon code-wreaking between January and March 1993--made Mosaic happen.
A rich image-based program for accessing the World Wide Web and other parts
of the Internet, Mosaic requires no more knowledge of its internal mechanics
than is needed by the user of the steering wheel of a car. With a mere 9,000
lines of code (compared to Windows 95's 11 million lines, including 3 million
lines of MSN code), Mosaic would become the most rapidly propagated software
program ever written. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen could defy all the fears of an Internet image crash because he
lived in a world of bandwidth abundance and fiber galore. He fully grasped
the law of the telecosm. Every new host computer added to the Net would
not only use the Net; it would also be a new resource for it, providing
a new route for the bits and new room to store them. Every new flood of
megabyte bitmaps would make the Net more interesting, useful and attractive,
and increase the pressure for backbones running at gigabits per second and
above. The Internet must be adapted to people with eyes and ears. They won't
abuse it, he assured Bina without a smile. After all, he knew he would have
to rely on Bina for much of the graphics coding. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was right,&quot; Bina says now. &quot;People abused it horribly.
People would scan in a page of PostScript text in a bitmap, taking over
a megabyte to display a page that would take maybe 1,000 bytes of text.
But Marc was also right. As a result of the glitz and glitter, thousands
of people wasted time to put in pretty pictures and valuable information
on the Web, and millions of people use it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Working night and day at the NCSA, wrangling over issues, arts and letters,
music and Unix code at the Espresso Royale down the street, the two programmers
achieved a rare synergy. &quot;We each did the job that most appealed to
us,&quot; says Bina, &quot;so each of us thinks the other did the hard stuff.&quot;
Bina wrote most of the new code--in particular, the graphics, modifying
HTML to handle images, adding a GIF (graphics interchange format) decoder,
incorporating color management tools. Andreessen took the existing library
of communications code from CERN and tore it apart and rewrote it so it
would run more quickly and efficiently on the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As time passed, they brought in other young programmers from the NCSA--among
them Chris Wilson, Jon Mittelhauser, Chris Houck and Aleks Totic--to port
the system to Windows and Mac machines. With help from them, they designed
dynamic forms with type-in fields, check boxes, toggle buttons and other
ordered ways of entering simple text for searches and other functions, beyond
simple hypertext pointing at a URL. For example, a dynamic form is now used
by Pizza Hut for ordering a pizza on line. Finally, because every change
in the browser required complementary changes in the servers at CERN--where
the physicists tended to be busy and glitz-averse--Bina and Andreessen decided
to do their own servers. The NCSA's Rob McCool took charge of this crucial
project. I<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
n the end, they had created an entirely new interface for the Internet and
new communications software to render it crisply accessible--a look and
feel that almost immediately struck everyone who used it as an amazing breakthrough.
In February 1995, Bob Metcalfe wrote a column in InfoWorld predicting that
Web browsers would become, in effect, the dominant operating system for
the next era. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Browsers are now ubiquitous. Every major company and many minor ones are
building them. Some eight million people use them. IBM, AT&amp;T, Novell,
Microsoft, NetCom, Sun, Silicon Graphics, America Online, Net-Manage, Quarterdeck,
Quadralay, Apple, SPRY-CompuServe, Frontier Technologies, Delphi, MCI, Wollongong,
even the Spyglass spinoff from the NCSA--you name it--all these companies
are building, licensing, enhancing or bundling a browser. Many of these
ventures, led by Quarterdeck's smart hotlists and &quot;drag-and-drop&quot;
ease of use, have outpaced Mosaic and prompted a leapfrogging contest of
can-you-top-this. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That is what happens when an entrepreneur performs a truly revolutionary
act, supplies the smallest missing factor, as Peter Drucker puts it, that
can transform a jumble of elements into a working system--the minimal mutation
that provokes a new paradigm. In 1977, the relevant jumble was small computers,
microprocessors and assembly language programming. Bill Gates and Paul Allen
supplied the key increment: software tools and the Basic language for the
embryonic personal computer. In 1993, Andreessen and Bina set out to supply
the minimal increment to convert the entire Net, with its then one to two
million linked computers (today it's an estimated seven million computers)
and immense information resources, into a domain as readily accessible to
an 11-year-old as a hard drive or CD-ROM on a Mac or Windows PC. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the same forces of exploding bandwidth, the same laws of the
telecosm that are wreaking revolution in hardware, hollowing out the computer--rendering
the CPU peripheral and the network central--are also transforming software.
All forms of desktop software--operating systems, applications and utilities--are
becoming similarly peripheral. The ever-growing gigapedal resources of the
Internet will always dwarf any powers and functions that can be distilled
on a desktop or mobilized on the backplane of a supercomputer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Last year, for example, four researchers at MIT, Iowa State, Bellcore and
Oxford (U.K.) triumphantly claimed a $100 reward for solving a grand challenge
problem. They announced that they had broken an RSA encryption code of 129
digits that one of RSA's inventors, R.L. Rivest, when offering the $100
prize in 1977, calculated would take four quadrillion years for a supercomputer
to crack. They did not accomplish their feat on a single machine (none yet
exists that can perform these computations) but on a virtual machine consisting
of 1,600 mostly modest workstations scattered around the Internet. Similarly,
Gordon Bell in 1992 for the first time granted his achievement award for
price and performance in the application of supercomputers, not to a single
machine, but to a distributed Internet virtual system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The success of the Internet model even in these high-powered processing
applications portends and symbolizes a definitive reality, which gathers
increasing force as network bandwidth begins to exceed the internal bandwidth
on computer backplanes. From now on, the relevant computer is the network
and the ascendant software is Internet software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Giving the program away on the Net, Andreessen released Mosaic in binary
form, already compiled for any popular computer platform, and helped bring
more than a million newcomers to the Web in six months. In that time, such
an upheaval would even reach the notice of the management of the NCSA. At
the National Science Foundation in Washington, D.C., a friend eagerly showed
Mosaic to Larry Smarr, who was visiting from Illinois. He was startled to
see that this new marvel was a creation of his own shop at the NCSA. Perhaps
he should look into it. Perhaps there was more to sell to Washington than
Fiber Channels between scientists and Crays. From that moment on, pushing
Mosaic became the chief &quot;grand challenge problem&quot; of the University
of Illinois Supercomputing Center. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After Andreessen's college graduation in December 1993, Joseph Hardin, head
of the NCSA, asked him to stay on at the center. But he added one condition,
namely, that the young programmer leave the Mosaic project. &quot;Some 40
people had a role in creating Mosaic,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't you think
it's time to give someone else a chance to share the glory?&quot; Reasoning
that they would have a still better chance in his absence, Andreessen left
for Silicon Valley. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After a few months doing Internet security functions at a company called
EIT, Andreessen attracted the attention of the legendary Jim Clark, founder
of Silicon Graphics Inc. and inventor of the Geometry Engine, capable of
3D graphics, that impelled SGI's growth. At loose ends, like most of the
industry's venturers, Clark was looking for opportunity in all the wrong
places--3D games, interactive TV, Hollywood. He found himself increasingly
entranced with the Mosaic browser. Hearing that the author of Mosaic had
arrived in Silicon Valley, he sent Andreessen an e-mail in early February
1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The rest is history, in the accelerated from familiar in the Valley. Jim
Clark met with Andreessen and signed him up as the first employee of a new
company. &quot;What has happened to the other NCSA programmers?&quot; he
wanted to know. Hearing that Chris Wilson, who had helped port the system
to the PC, had left the center to join SPRY, Clark decided to act fast.
He invited Bina to come to Silicon Valley and meet with him on his yacht.
Avoiding temptation (Bina's wife was a tenured professor of database technology
at Champaign-Urbana and is wary of snake oil), Bina spurned the invitation.
Andreessen wrote him a glum e-mail: &quot;Sorry. It would have been nice
to have had you here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing Bina knew, Andreessen called him to announce that he and
Clark were flying to Champaign-Urbana and wanted to meet with Bina and the
rest of the key programmers the next day at the local University Inn. &quot;When
I got off the elevator at the hotel,&quot; Bina recalls, &quot;this blond
guy who reminded me of my dad stepped back, looked me slowly up and down,
and spoke: 'Marc said you could walk on water. I have never seen anyone
who could do that before.'&quot; Clark soon assured him he could stay in
Illinois. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
According to Bina, Clark spread a contagion of entrepreneurial excitement.
Then one by one he made seven of them offers. All signed up. By the first
week of April, Mosaic software was on the way and Jim Clark forgot about
interactive TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Greeting this bold new company, however, were rumblings about a possible
intellectual property suit from the NCSA. This surprise banished any idea
of using Mosaic in any form. That was fine with them. They knew Mosaic was
a quickly written hack designed for T1 and T3 lines running at up to 45
megabits a second at the NCSA. &quot;We knew that everyone had Mosaic,&quot;
says Bina. &quot;We were glad to start from scratch again.&quot; Moving
into a small office in Mountain View at a cost of less than $1 per square
foot, they set to work. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the new company, then called Mosaic Communications, Andreessen ascended
to management. Bina, working in Illinois for all but one frenzied week a
month, immersed himself in creating the new code. They revised it to work
over a 14.4 modem. They focused on making it the only system that is fully
secure. They added new supports for more elegant layouts and richer documents.
Giving the program away on the Net, within a few months Netscape won 70%
of the Web browser market, which it still holds. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important for the future of the company, they developed a stream of
new server products, which they sold to most of the existing and aspiring
on-line services and Internet service providers, from internetMCI and marketplaceMCI
to IBM's Prodigy and Murdoch's Delphi. Altogether, they had released a total
of 11 new products by midsummer of this year, from $50,000 secure server
applications to the $39 Netscape Navigator Personal Edition complete with
TCP/IP stack for full connection to the Internet in 10 minutes anywhere
in the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Wall Street began pouring money on any rival company with an Internet
Product, the stock market became a Netscape imperative. This posed a problem
from Clark. There would be no difficulty attracting a frenzy of interest.
The question was, Where would they hide Andreessen during the road show?
Introducing him to John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and
other Silicon Valley clout, however, Clark instead resolved to teach the
young bear how to chew with his mouth closed, tie a tie and get to work
earlier than 8:30 . . . p.m. Then he prepared to place him in the nose cone
of an Initial Public Orbiting that would value the gang at hundreds of millions
of dollars, point Andreessen towards the Millenium and, with luck and the
right characterological chemistry, have a new Bill Gates for the late 1990s.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here he is, well after 8 p.m., roaring down El Camino Real in his '94 red
Mustang, filled with pizza rinds, empty cans of Sprite, a mostly shredded
copy of the San Jose Mercury News and a bulging issue of MicroTimes smeared
in popcorn butter, talking with both hands to a writer from Forbes ASAP
hunched amid the clutter and stealthily searching for a seat belt. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly free of the NIH (not invented here) syndrome afflicting many of
his elders--his browser combines products from some 17 sources--Andreessen
was discoursing on the virtues of Java, a language he says portends a telecosmic
advance even more profound and enduring than the browser and related servers
themselves. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For creating innovative stuff on the Web, Andreessen explains, &quot;The
alternative languages are grim, Perl is limited to text strings. Telescript
from General Magic doesn't pass because it's proprietary. Tickle [Tcl] lacks
power and features. Scheme and LISP are dead. Visual Basic lacks expressiveness
and it is too much controlled by Microsoft. Dylan is still an Apple research
project. None of them are truly suited to the Web environment. Java is as
revolutionary as the Web itself.&quot; Tying Netscape to Java assures the
company a central role in a coming efflorescence of the Web more significant
in its implications than even the current manifestation. In the process,
it will invert the entire world of software in a way that may permanently
displace Microsoft from the center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Behind this development is not some 24-year-old geek from a supercomputer
center, but the industry's most venerable leader after Bill Gates, not only
Microsoft's most persistent critic and nemesis, but also its most eminent
defeated rival: Bill Joy of Sun. In engineering Mosaic and Netscape Navigator,
streamlining the communications functions and putting it all on the Net,
Andreessen was following in the codesteps of Joy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Joy was not only a founder of Sun Microsystems, he was also the primary
champion of the Berkeley brand of Unix--BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
Unix--that he husbanded as a student at the university. BSD Unix was not
only Sun's essential software technology, but also the reference code for
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), the basic protocol
stack of the Arpanet in its evolution toward the current Internet). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By upgrading the TCP/IP protocol to run on an ethernet rather than on only
50-kilobit-per-second Arpanet lines and then giving away the Code, Bill
Joy made the Internet possible. When Sun declared in 1988 that the network
is the computer, the network it had in mind was run by Bill Joy's Network
File System (NFS), and it incorporated TCP/IP. Says Eric Schmidt--Bill Joy's
Berkeley colleague, now chief technical officer at Sun and leading prophet
of the coming software inversion--&quot;Sun was selling the Internet before
the Internet was there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, because Sun computers running BSD Unix were the most robust vessels
for TCP/IP, the lion's share of all host computers on the Web are still
Sun's, and Sun is experiencing an unexpected surge of earnings in the wake
of the Web. Now the computer world is wielding Marc Andreessen's browser
to rush toward the Net, wrenching the sphere from its moorings in Redmond,
and allowing it to oscillate toward a new center in Silicon Valley. Even
Bill Gates, the last holdout against Joy's network standard, is now bundling
TCP/IP with Windows 95. Joy must feel that the industry is coming home at
last. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Gates ignited the person computer market by writing Basic for the
PC, Joy is launching a new era on the Net by supplying a suitable software
language, Java. Joy foreshadowed Java at the 1990 PC Forum conference when
he said, &quot;Large programs are embarrassing because they have a fixed
set of ideas and so much code that it's very difficult to change them. And
they all tend to reflect existing metaphors, not the new metaphors. Everybody's
using C++. That's a 'crufty' language. It's very hard to understand. &quot;I'm
starting a small group to try to do something small--Sun Aspen Smallworks.
I believe it's possible to do small systems of a few hundred thousand lines
of code that live in this world of persistent distributed objects with open
protocols [and] make an incredible difference--much more than an extra 100,000
lines on a 10-million-line system. So I'm looking for a few great hackers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The one he found was redoubtable Sun engineer James Gosling. Called by John
Doerr of Kleiner Perkins &quot;perhaps the world's greatest living programmer,&quot;
Gosling is a bearded man with shaggy blondish hair. He displays a subtly
wounded look that is possibly the effect of a career that, to that point,
had consisted mostly of brilliant failures. But, like Joy, Gosling was eager
to do something small to bring Sun into the world of consumer electronics
where a large program used no more than a few thousand lines. In 1992, the
company spun out a subsidiary named FirstPerson Inc. to pursue this market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The goal was to conceive a way to take news, images, animations and other
real-time functions in cell sites and base stations and download them to
handheld devices such as digital cellular phones. But with the Newton fiasco,
personal digital assistants began to fall from favor and Sun and the rest
of the lemmings decided to pursue the suddenly seductive siren of interactive
TV. Again, they would use the Java (at the time called &quot;Oak&quot;)
programming language, this time running not on cellular phones, but in set-top
boxes. Here, too, the programs would have to be elegant and compact to use
the sparse memories affordable for a consumer appliance. However, Like Jim
Clark--and everyone else--Sun would soon discover that interactivity merely
offers cosmetics for the corpse of a dying television industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At this point, the project was in turmoil and former Apple designer Wayne
Rosing, its first manager, was on his way out. In May of last year, Sun
technical chief Eric Schmidt entered the breach, collapsed the set-top project
into a joint venture with Thomson Consumer Electronics, which had bought
RCA, and summoned Joy from Aspen. Joy returned and spent the entire summer
last year in Palo Alto working with Schmidt and Gosling to figure out a
strategy for Java. As the work proceeded, it became clear that the characteristics
of a language suitable for PDAs not only gratified Joy's Laws of software,
but also fit almost perfectly the needs of the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like many technology projects that seem to spring full-blown from the brow
of a genius, Java is in fact the fruit of a near-lifelong quest. Gosling's
career began at age 14 in Calgary when, during a high school tour, he memorized
the code to the locks on the doors of the computer center at the University
of Calgary. He then regularly admitted himself to read computer texts and
use DEC PDP-8s. He became so proficient that he was hired a year later by
Digital Equipment to write machine code to be used for analyses of data
on the aurora borealis from Isis satellites. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on to Carnegie Mellon University to study under the eminent Robert
Sproull and Raj Reddy, he wrote a text editor called EMACS, a Pascal compiler
and a thesis entailing the creation of a program to do drawings of levers
and strings in visual, interactive models. After graduation in 1981, he
joined an IBM lab in Pittsburgh, where he developed the Andrew Windows system.
The first major program that could control a window on a computer remotely
across a network, it never found a home. But it launched Gosling on a 15-year
struggle with the challenge of how to send programs across a network that
could be executed on other computers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling had a breakthrough in 1983 at a Sun Microsystems conference at the
Red Lion in San Jose. There, Joy observed Gosling's Andrew Windows system
dramatically outperforming a workstation running Sun View, and began a concerted
effort to recruit him. Soon after, Gosling came to Sun to develop a remote
windows system called NeWS (Networked Extensible Windows System). Initially
received with great critical acclaim in the industry, it was eventually
blocked by the X-Windows consortium despite performing far more efficiently
over a network. Long a student of object-oriented programming beginning
with the Simula language, Gosling followed his NeWS project with a compound
doc<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ument architecture, joining text and images. It, too, garnered much praise
and paltry use. Then came Sun's ill-fated pursuit of consumer electronic
products. Gosling set out to develop appropriate programs in C++. But it
soon became clear to him that this language failed on nearly all the crucial
criteria. In particular it was neither reliable nor secure, which, funnily
enough, turned out to be two sides of the same coin. &quot;The gun you shoot
the burglar with can also shoot you in the foot.&quot; That was C++. It
had pointer code that allowed rogue programs to invade and corrupt a target
operating system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Gosling began revising C++ code into something that has been termed &quot;C++
minus minus.&quot; Returning to the inspiration of Andrew and NeWS, he adapted
the language to enable real-time operations across a network. In order to
run a variety of different programs on a variety of linked devices, from
set-top boxes to palmtop remotes, he made it inherently platform-neutral
and nomadic. It would have to be a language at home on a network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The project ended with Java, an efficient programming language that is safe,
simple, reliable and real-time, yet familiar to anyone who has used C or
C++. Designed for PDAs on infrared networks, it turned out to be perfectly
adapted for the Internet. Many of Java's virtues are made possible by the
fact that it is interpreted rather than compiled--that means that it is
translated line by line in real time in the user's computer rather than
converted to machine language in batch mode by the software vendor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most languages are written in two stages. The first is source code, couched
at a level of abstraction that rarely reveals its purposes or algorithmic
procedures. Normally, source code is proprietary and not revealed to the
user. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The second stage is compilation. The compiler translates the abstractions
of the source code into &quot;binaries&quot;--the machine language of a
particular computer, locked into the set of instructions that its central
processing unit can perform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java, by contrast, is compiled not to an instruction set peculiar to a particular
microprocessor but to a virtual machine or generic computer. Putting the
language into an intermediate binary form allows creation of programs that
are not locked into any particular hardware platform, but that can still
be adapted to run fast. The intermediate code is translated line by line
by a software program called an interpreter located in the target computer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java's interpreters take up a parsimonious 45 kilobytes of memory. Sun already
has Java interpreters in the works for Microsoft Windows 95, the Mac, Windows
MT and several flavors of Unix. Netscape will include the appropriate interpreter
in future versions of the Netscape browser. This means that any program
written in Java will be portable to any common computer platform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, this portability does not seem remarkable. All programs
written in C, C++ or other compiled languages can be ported to any target
platform simply by running the source code through the appropriate compiler,
just as Mosaic was compiled for various platforms at the NCSA. The difference
is that Java can be &quot;compiled&quot; line by line in real time. That
is, it is interpreted in byte-level code in the client machine. This makes
all the difference. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It means that programs no longer have to reside in the machine where they
are used, or be written for that machine in order to be executed by it.
Potentially, a Java program can reside anywhere on the entire Internet and
be executed by any computer attached to the Internet. The little interpreters--sure
to become cheap and ubiquitous as they are distributed by Netscape and by
other suppliers of browsers--make Java programs &quot;dynamically portable&quot;
in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dynamically portable programs are suitable for a nomadic existence on the
Net, rather than a mere settled life on the desktop. Java thus emancipates
software from computer architecture. It offers a software paradigm radically
different from the Microsoft model, which is based not only on static compilation,
but on often-concealed, proprietary source code. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, the entire world of new software is potentially available to every
computer owner. Rather than being restricted to the set of programs you
own, you can use any program on the Net, just as now you can tap any information
on the Net. You not only have data at your fingertips, you have programs
at your fingertips. This means &quot;executable content,&quot; as Joy describes
it and as John Gage demonstrated in his speech at the West St. Francis Hotel
this June. Whether a film, a graph, an animation, a real-time bit stream
on the Nasdaq ticker or the Reuters wire, a virtual reality visualization,
or a game, it can be downloaded to your machine with its program in tow.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Owning the operating system and associated tool libraries becomes irrelevant
to selling applications. Owning the application or channel becomes irrelevant
to selling the content. To the extent that Java or a similar language prevails,
software becomes truly open for the first time. The Microsoft desktop becomes
a commodity; the Intel microprocessor becomes peripheral--the key &quot;microprocessor&quot;
is the software code in the Java interpreter. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Interpreted or not, however, nomadic programs will not be permitted to range
the Net unless they are also secure programs. By several judicious alterations
of C++ procedures, Gosling made Java above all a secure language. Many viruses
depend on taking an integer in the program and using it to &quot;point&quot;
to a low address in the memory where operating code resides. Java removes
this pointer conversion function. In addition, incorporated into the Java
interpreter is a code verifier. As soon as an application shows up in a
machine, the interpreter does an instant virus scan. Finally, when Java
binary arrives at a machine, it will bear an RSA data signature that verifies
the source of the code and guarantees that it has not been altered or corrupted.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These security provisions make Java programs the first certifiable citizens
of the Net. As Java interpreters become ubiquitous, any application program
that is anchored on a particular platform and desktop will eventually become
a cripple, like a pro athlete who fears to fly. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The computer hollows out, and you no longer are concerned with its idiosyncrasies,
its operating system, its instruction set, even its resident applications.
Instead, you can focus on content--on the world rather than on the desktop
architecture. If you want to run a helicopter model on your screen, you
don't have to worry about whether you have AutoCAD on your hard drive. You
can run a video of the helicopter without owning the right decoder, whether
Indeo (Intel's standard) or MPEG-4 (designed for portable appliances) or
dynamic JPEG. The helicopter flies over the Net with its own executable
code. The network is no longer a threatening place. If you want to use a
program from Finland, you don't have to worry that it will introduce a malignant
virus to your machine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Your computer will never be the same. No longer will the features of the
desktop decide the features of the machine. No longer will the size of your
hard drive or the database in your LAN server determine the reach of your
information processing. No longer will the programs in your machine determine
the functions you can perform. The network is the computer. The computer
becomes a peripheral to the Internet and the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since the release of Java and a demonstration Web browser called HotJava,
written in the language on the Sun home page, Gosling has experienced the
kind of sudden Internet celebrity undergone by Andreessen and Bina. Unlike
Andreessen, he seems somewhat baffled by it all. But in the long run, his
contribution may be greater. Browsers and servers may come and go, but successful
new languages are extremely rare. Java, or something like it, is the key
to a truly interactive Internet and a fully hollowed-out computer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently, Bill Joy made a presentation to the Sun board, outlining an upgrade
path for the future of the language. Joy is resolved that Java will not
go the way of Andrew and NeWS. Like Jim Clark, he has even turned to the
troubled supercomputer arena to find a treasure trove of new hackers. Sun
hired some 20 new programmers from the recently defunct but boldly pioneering
Thinking Machines and Kendall Square Research. Presumably, they can learn
to think small. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling shakes his head at all the uproar. He now finds himself falling
thousands of messages behind in his e-mail. Linked to the Net by a mere
T1 line, even Sun's Java server broke down under the overload. But Gosling
himself seems to be holding up better. His speaking schedule has multiplied
to a rate of three talks a week. Scores of people tell him they are using
the language as a replacement for C, for IR (information resource) tools
and for other general-purpose applications. Giant Japanese companies such
as Sony and Sega besiege him. Finally, late in June, even Berners-Lee gave
Java his imprimature as &quot;one of the most exciting things happening
on the Web right now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A movie buff, Gosling sees Java, Netscape and similar programs changing
the image of the cypersphere from an alien and menacing dystopia, as depicted
famously in Blade Runner, into a realm resembling Star Trek, where computers
are trusted tools. Perhaps this transformation will favor the emergence
of the amiable and gregarious young Marc Andreessen as the paladin of cyberspace,
replacing the fiercely brilliant but widely feared Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But as Andreessen admits, a more likely outcome is a massive move by Microsoft
onto the Net where the two will enter battle with scores of contenders.
This month, Microsoft announced an array of Internet services, under the
rubric Blackbird, with many interesting features. But it works only with
Microsoft Network Services, which will not become truly widespread for another
year. Beginning with virtually no market share and a year or so behind,
Gates will become an under dog at last. Perhaps even the Justice Department
will notice. In the age of the hollowed-out computer, the king of the desktop
rules an emigrating empire. <BR>

<P>U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska wants to know: With deregulation of telecommunications,
who will bring connections to Unalakleet, to Aleknagik and to Sleetmute?
Who will bring 500 channels up the Yukon with the salmon to the people in
Beaver? What will happen to the Yupik, the Inupiat and the Inuit? Will we
leave them stranded in the snow while the world zooms off to new riches
on an information superhighway?<BR>
<BR>
A senior Republican on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications,
Stevens is a key figure in the telecom deregulation debate on Capitol Hill.
As he contemplates the issues of restructuring communications law, he has
reason to be suspicious of the grand claims of an information age. He knows
that universal service--the magic of available dial tone in your own home--has
hardly reached rural Alaska at all. As George Calhoun points out in his
sort invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881 and now extended to some
95% of American households) are simply not feasible, either technically
or economically, in many remote regions.<BR>
<BR>
In Beaver, for example, there is one telephone in a hut linked to a nine-foot
satellite dish. Permafrost and cold economic reality make it impossible
to extend dial tone to the several hundred households of this town, even
though its average household income, mostly from salmon fishing, is some
$120,000.<BR>
<BR>
Ted Stevens is right to be concerned. Portentiously sharing his concern
are other powerful Republicans from rural states, including Larry Pressler
of South Dakota, the chairman of the subcommittee. Extended now from phone
service to broadband digital superhighways, their concerns could pose a
deadly obstacle to true deregulation of communications and thus to continued
American leadership in these central technologies of the age. At stake is
some $2 trillion of potential value to the U.S. economy (see Forbes ASAP,
April 10). The problems of universal service in Alaska disguise the more
profound paradox of telephone service in most of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that the universality of telephones is crucial to their usefulness;
yet universal service using current technology is totally uneconomical and
impractical. Snow and ice are the least of it. The basic problem is the
architecture of the system, with a separate pair of lines, on average two
miles long, devoted exclusively to each user. It simply does not pay to
lay, entrench, string, protect, test and maintain miles of copper wire pairs,
each dedicated to one household that uses them on average some 15 or 20
minutes a day.<BR>
<BR>
Connections in cities are one thing. Urban access systems comprise a bramble
of millions of wire loops, each linking a home or business telephone to
a nearby central office switch. Under a half mile in length, these lines
still represent some 80% of the cost of the system. But because the lines
are short and often bundled together, city telephony benefits from economies
of scale and convenience. In rural areas, however, the copper lines cost
between 10 and 30 times as much per customer as they do in cities.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Calhoun reports that in general, phone companies cannot supply
ISDN (integrated services digital network) and other digital services over
twisted-pair wire more than 18,000 feet (some 3.5 miles) from the central
office. Perhaps a third of all the nation's phones are more than 3.5 miles
from a central office.<BR>
<BR>
What saves us is socialism. Closing the huge differential between the costs
of serving rural and urban customers is a Byzantine web of cross-subsidies,
whereby inner-city and business callers in urban areas subsidize the worthy
citizens of Kirby, Vt.; Vail, Colo.; Mendocino, Calif.; Round Rock, Texas,
and Tyringham, Mass., among other bucolic locales, to the tune of billions
of dollars. Overall, subsidies from business and urban customers to rural
and other expensive residential users total some $20 billion a year. In
case the cross-subsidies do not suffice to guarantee universality, Congress
has established a $700 million &quot;Universal Service Fund.&quot; For all
that, some 5% of homes still lack telephone service (compared with 2% unreached
by TV, which faces no universal service requirement).<BR>
<BR>
Lending huge physical authority to this Sisyphean socialist scheme are some
65,049,600 tons of copper wire rooted deep in the rights of way, depreciation
schedules, balance sheets, mental processes and corporate cultures of the
regional Bell operating companies and other so-called local-exchange carriers.
The minimum replacement cost of these lines deployed over the last 50 years
or more--and still being installed through the mid-1990s at a rate of at
least five million lines a year--is some $300 billion. By comparison, Calhoun
estimates, the telcos could replace every telephone switch for one-tenth
that amount while radically upgrading the system.<BR>
<BR>
In this cage of twisted copper wires writhe not only the executives of the
telephone companies, but also the addled armies of telecommunications regulators,
from the Federal Communications Commission and other Washington bodies to
50 state public utilities commissions and the towering hives of lawyers
in the communications bar. The coils of copper also subtly penetrate the
thought processes of MIT Media Lab gurus, libertarian lobbyists from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and myriad political analysts who see this
massive metal millstone as a fell weapon of monopoly power. The copper colossus
even intimidates scores of staunch Republicans who have arrived in Washington
determined to extirpate every government excess, but who bow before the
totem of universal service in their districts.<BR>
<BR>
Like any socialist system, the copper colossus will die hard. But die it
must.<BR>
<BR>
Some 20 years ago, AT&amp;T's long-distance lines comprised a similarly
imperious cage of copper wires, installed over the previous 50 years and
similarly impossible for rivals to duplicate. Then too, analysts termed
telephony a natural monopoly because the system could handle additional
calls for essentially zero incremental cost and because network externalities
ensured that the larger the number of customers, the more valuable the system.
These assumptions had led to government endorsement of the Bell monopoly
as a common carrier committed to universal service.<BR>
<BR>
Regulators, politicians and litigators always imagine that they can control
the future of telecom, awarding monopoly privileges in exchange for various
high-minded goals, such as universal or enriched services. But their actual
role, as Peter Huber and his associates show in their new text, Federal
Broadband Law, is mostly to promote monopoly at the expense of such values
as universality, which ultimately depend not on law but on innovation. As
a form of tax, regulations reduce the supply of the taxed output. It is
technological and entrepreneurial progress, impelled by low tax rates and
deregulation, that brings once- rare products into the reach of the poor,
always the world's largest untapped market.<BR>
<BR>
In this case, the decline and fall of the long-distance monopoly was not
chiefly an effect of politics or litigation but of technology. Effectively
dissolving the copper cage of long distance were the millimeter waves of
microwave radio. Over the years, it turned out you could set up microwave
towers anywhere and duplicate long-distance services at radically lower
cost without installing any new wires at all. But this realization came
woefully slowly to the regulators.<BR>
<BR>
In the &quot;above-890-megahertz&quot; decision of 1959, made possible by
new Klystron tubes and other devices that opened up higher frequencies to
communications, the FCC permitted creation of private microwave networks.
On the surface, it was a narrow decision affecting a few large corporations.
But as AT&T planners noted at the time, it represented a clear break from
the previous principles of common carriage, cross-subsidy and nationwide
price averaging in the telephone network.<BR>
<BR>
Sure enough, over the next two decades a cascade of further decisions climaxed
with the authorization of MCI to emerge as a direct competitor to AT&amp;T.
Within less than a decade, MCI added to its panoply of aerial microwaves
the yet more advanced technology of single-mode glass fibers. Issuing some
$3 billion of junk bonds over a four-year period, MCI built the first nationwide
network of advanced fiber optics. GTE made comparable investments in Sprint,
and AT&T rushed to excel its new rivals. Combining microwave with fiber,
long-distance telephony became a technologically aggressive and openly competitive
arena; AT&amp;T's monopoly was a thing of the past.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the remaining monopolies in local phone service face a threat from
radio technology still more devastating than the microwave threat to AT&T in
long distance. As with microwaves, the government--in the name of preventing
monopoly--dallied for decades before acting to allow elimination of the
monopolies it had earlier established. After the invention of cellular at
Bell Labs in 1947, some 34 years passed before the FCC finally began granting
licenses for cellular telephony. By the 1980s, the FCC and Judge Harold
Greene, managing the Modified Final Judgment breaking up AT&amp;T, permitted
limited competition in wireless telephony. However, the FCC allocated half
the metropolitan licenses to existing RBOCs, which had no interest in using
wireless to attack the local loop monopoly. The other licenses it assigned
by lottery to gamblers and financiers with no ability to create an alternative
local loop. The process of buying out the spectrum speculators required
leading wireless carriers to hobble themselves with huge amounts of junk-bond
debt. Although McCaw Cellular Communications created a robust national system,
its financial structure prevented aggressive price competition with wireline
service.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the idea persists that wireless telephony is an expensive supplement
to the existing copper colossus rather than a deadly rival of it. The installed
base of twisted-pair wire still appears to many to be a barrier to entry
for new competitors in the local loop, rather than a barrier to RBOC entry
into modern communications markets. The conventional wisdom sees the electromagnetic
spectrum as a scarce resource. Few believe that it will soon emerge as a
cheaper and better alternative to the local loop, in the same way that microwave
emerged as a cheaper and better substitute for copper long-distance wires.

Making Waves</B></PRE>
At the foundation of the information economy, from computers to telephony,
is the microcosm of semiconductor electronics. It reaches out in a fractal
filigree of wires and switches that repeat their network patterns at every
level from the half-adder in a calculator chip or the SLIC in a telephone
handset to the coaxial trees and branches of a cable TV system or the mazes
of switched and routed lines in the global Internet. In computers, engineers
lay out the wires and switches across the tiny silicon substrates of microchips.
In telecommunications, engineers lay out the wires and switches across the
mostly silicon substrates of continents and seabeds. But it is essentially
the same technology, governed by quantum science and electrical circuit
theory.<BR>
<BR>
Semiconductor engineers may still spend more of their time with circuit
theory, contemplating the operations of resistors, inductors and capacitors
on currents and voltages in the device. But quantum theory is most fundamental,
because it allows humans for the first time to manipulate matter from the
inside--to control the conduction bands and energy-band gaps of the internal
atomic structure of silicon and other elements, and to make electrons, holes
and photons leap and lase at the behest of the designer. It is quantum theory
that allows chip engineers to control with exquisite precision, gauged in
tenths of microns and trillionths of seconds, the movements of electrons
at the heart of electronics.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of quantum theory, however, is a perplexing duality. Most of
contemporary physics seems to deal with particles--electrons, quarks, leptons,
neutrons, protons. In 1994, for example, scientists at Fermilabs in Chicago
announced &quot;discovery&quot; of the &quot;top quark,&quot; which they
described as the &quot;last building block of matter.&quot; Yet these entities
manifest themselves only in the midst of explosions in which their wave
signatures can be identified. So-called quantum particle theory is unintelligible
without quantum wave theory.<BR>
<BR>
The elements of quantum physics intrinsically combine the characteristics
of particles--definite specks of mass--with the characteristics of waves--
an infinite radiance of fields and forces. Entirely unlike particles, waves
merge, mingle and mesh in vectors and tensors propagating boundlessly through
space.<BR>
<BR>
It is this paradoxical combination of the definite with the infinite that
gives the microcosm its promise as a medium, not only for computation in
one place, but for communications everywhere. Spectrum unfolds in a global
ethersphere of interpenetrating waves that reach in a self- similar fractal
pattern from the plasmas of semi-conductor lasers through the ethers of
the planet.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the telecosm of modern communications brings decisively to the fore
the wave side of the quantum duality. Wires may seem more solid and reliable
than air. But the distinction is largely spurious. In proportion to the
size of its nucleus, an atom in a copper wire is as empty as the solar system
is in proportion to the size of the sun. The atmosphere and wires are alternative
media, and to the electron or photon are only arbitrarily distinguishable.
Whether insulated by air or by plastic, both offer resistance, capacitance,
inductance, noise and interference. In thinking about communications, the
concept of solidity is mostly a distraction. The essence of new devices
emerges more and more as manifestations of waves.<BR>
<BR>
Whether in the air or in a wire, the electrons or photons do not travel;
they wiggle their charges, causing oscillations that pass through the medium
at close to the speed of light. As in waves of water, the wave moves, but
the molecules of water stay in the same place. Thus belied is the analogy
of particles or even bullets favored by physics teachers who give primacy
to the mass rather than to the wave. Since the age of carrier pigeons and
catapults, communications systems have transmitted masses only in the postal
services.<BR>
<BR>
Today, even in entirely stationary electronic systems, the wave action is
increasingly dominant. The microchip itself--a Pentium processor, say--now
runs at 120 megahertz, a rate in cycles per second that puts it in the middle
of the FM radio band. New computers must pass the FCC requirements for radio
emissions. Texas Instruments now advertises its 486 SXL-66 microprocessors
as selling for under 50 cents per megahertz. Increasingly in the world of
computers, people speak of bandwidth and cycles, reserving the discussion
of mass chiefly for the batteries. The world of the telecosm is subtly shifting
from electronics, with its implicit primacy of electrons, to what might
be termed spectronics, seeing the particle as an expression of the wave
rather than the other way around--moving from Bohr's atom and Heisenberg's
electronic uncertainty to Maxwell's rainbow and Schrodinger's wave equation.<BR>
<BR>
In a global marketplace increasingly unified by telecommunications at the
speed of light, the vision of waves as fundamental affords not only a better
image of physics, but also a better purchase on economic reality than a
spurious search for solid states, physical resources, national economies
and commodity products.<BR>
<BR>
Conceived as some irreducible essence, the particle of mass, whether in
the form of a top quark or Higgs boson, wire conduit or central switch,
pushes our thinking about the world toward a vision of ultimately discrete
and confinable entities, with electrons moving through the p-n junctions
of microchips like so many steel ingots crossing a national border. Conceived,
by contrast, as a continuous span of waves and frequencies, tossing and
cresting, reflecting, diffusing, superposing and interfering, the telecosmic
vision accords with the ever-rising global commerce in information services--ubiquitous,
simultaneous, convergent, emergent.<BR>
<BR>
To grasp the next phases of the information economy, one begins not with
the atom or any other discrete entity, but with the wave. In 1865, in a
visionary coup that the late Richard Feynman said would leave the American
Civil War of the same decade as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by
comparison, Scotch physicist James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic
spectrum. This spread of frequencies usable for communications is both the
practical resource and the most profound metaphor for the global information
economy.<BR>
<BR>
Is it a domain of limits, to be husbanded by governments and appropriately
allocated by auctions at a price of billions of dollars for a tiny span
of wiggle rates? Is it beachfront property to be coveted as a finite and
unrenewable resource? Is it a constricted domain to be exploited under the
iron laws of diminishing returns? Is it a zero-sum game to erupt in Star
Wars and street fights as satellite magnates and personal communications
entrepreneurs crowd into a feudal fray of frequencies? At the heart of the
gathering abundance of the information economy, would it sustain a new economics
of scarcity?<BR>
<BR>
So one might imagine from today's conventional wisdom. Contemplating these
limits, diminishing returns and zero-sum economics at Richard Shaffer's
Mobile Forum in March was industry guru Carl Robert Aron. He sees the world
of wireless entering a &quot;new ice age,&quot; like the recent ordeal of
the tire industry in the face of radials. He predicts that customers, capital
and revenues will become increasingly scarce and many species of company
will become extinct. Offering a similarly grim vision, BellSouth Vice President
of Corporate Development Mark Feidler declares that the price elasticity
of demand for telephony is negative--you lower the price and revenues will
sink. On the same panel, AT&amp;T-McCaw executive Rod Nelson asserted that
he could see no threat from personal communications services, because McCaw
was already offering &quot;a low-priced, high-quality service.&quot; Even
Martin Cooper of ArrayComm saw spectrum as a limited resource sure to grow
more valuable over time.<BR>
<BR>
What would Maxwell say? As he discovered it, the spectrum is infinite, ubiquitous,
instantaneous and cornucopian. Infinite wave action, not the movement of
masses, is the foundation of all physics. It ushers in an age of boundless
bandwidth beyond the dreams of most communications prophets. As industry
guru Ira Brodsky concludes in his authoritative new book, Wireless: The
Revolution in Personal Communications, &quot;We are quickly moving from
the era of spectrum shortage to the age of spectrum glut.&quot; This expanding
wavescape is the most fertile frontier of the information economy. In its
actions are the essential character of the coming economics of abundance
and increasing returns.<BR>
<BR>
In contemporary networks, as Nicholas Negroponte stresses in his best-selling
book, Being Digital, all bits are fungible. In spectronics, all spectrum
is fungible. In particular, the distinction between wireline and wireless
service dissolves. A wire is just a means of spectrum reuse. Down adjacent
wires, appropriately twisted or insulated, you can transmit the same frequencies
without fear of interference or noise.<BR>
<BR>
Using new digital radio technologies, such as code division multiple access
or smart and directional antenna systems, you can similarly beam the same
frequencies through the atmosphere, insulated by air. The chief difference
is that the wire system costs far more to install and inhibits mobility.<BR>
<BR>
The only wire technology commanding a decisive edge over wireless for critical
applications is fiber optics. The intrinsic bandwidth of a fiber thread
is nearly 1,000 times larger than the bandwidth of all the &quot;air&quot;
currently used for terrestrial radio communications. In both media, capacity
is largely governed by the need to avoid the water molecules that absorb
many frequencies of electromagnetic <BR>
waves--in air, from humidity or precipitation; in fiber, from the unremovable
residue of water in the structure of the glass.<BR>
<BR>
Compared with perhaps 30 gigahertz of currently accessible frequencies in
the air, every fiber thread can potentially bear 25,000 gigahertz. This
huge bandwidth derives from the possibility of using infrared light frequencies
for long-distance communications rather than radio or microwave frequencies.
When you are dealing in terahertz (infrared light encompasses some 50 trillion
hertz worth of frequencies between 7.5 X 10[11] and 3.5 X 10[14]), there
is a lot of room for sending messages.<BR>
<BR>
One fiber thread the width of a human hair can potentially use about 25
trillion of those hertz for communications (the rest tend to be fraught
with moisture). This span is enough to carry all the phone calls in America
on the peak moment of Mother's Day, or to bear three million six-megahertz
high-definition television channels--all down one fiber thread the width
of a human hair. As Paul Green sums it up, fiber commands 10 orders of magnitude
greater bandwidth than copper telephone lines and 10 orders of magnitude
lower bit-error rates. Optical engineers have packed as many as a million
such threads in one bundle with a cross-section a centimeter square. Such
feats plausibly support the assertion that, as a practical matter, spectrum
is infinite.<BR>
<BR>
The capacity of fiber is so large that the best way to think of it is as
a radio system in glass--a fibersphere that can potentially accommodate
as many as 10,000 separate wavelength bitstreams. Under a system called
wavelength division multiplexing, users will tune in to a chosen frequency
band in the same way they currently time in to a chosen radio or television
channel, whether in the air or in a coaxial cable. Indeed, engineers can
take the same infrared frequencies used in fiber and move them to the air
for shorter distance applications such as local-area networks, point-to-point
connections between buildings, links between handheld computers and desktop
hosts, and even television remote controls. As tunable laser transmitters
and photodiodes, along with other optoelectronic gear, become more sensitive
and efficient, airborne infrared will become more robust and useful. Experiments
by the Israelis with ultraviolet frequencies suggest that even these superhigh
frequencies above visible light might someday be used for communications
through the atmosphere (offering tens of thousands of TV channels, for example).<BR>
<BR>
Now the FCC has auctioned off 120 megahertz of frequencies for personal
communications services. The most prominent winning bidders were consortia
led by Sprint, TCI, Comcast and Cox (a long-distance carrier and three cable
companies going under the name Wireless Co.); by AT&T; and by AirTouch,
Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and U S West as PCS PrimeCo. Most analysis has focused
on what is called the wireless market and has assumed the major competitor
to PCS to be the current cellular companies. Aron's ice-age ruminations
stemmed from contemplation of this radical increase in competition for a
limited number of cellular customers who currently cost some $540 each to
sign up (counting handset subsidies) and whose per-capita revenues are declining
at a pace of some 8% per year. Remember BellSouth's Feidler's vision of
a negative elasticity of phone markets, meaning that lower prices bring
lower revenues?<BR>
<BR>
From a spectronic perspective, all this analysis is deeply misleading. Whether
channeled down wires or through the air, spectrum is spectrum. Digital wireless
is a cheaper and better way of delivering service. The market for PCS is
not the cellular customer, but the one billion wireline customers in rich
countries and the several billions of potential phone and teleputer customers
around the globe. In pursuing these customers, the price elasticities will
be dramatically positive, with various price points reachable with new wireless
technologies releasing torrents of new demand and new revenues. What Aron
calls an ice age will in fact prove to be a gigantic global warming, unleashing
huge new growth in telephony, using spectrum in all its various forms (except
perhaps the twisted-pair copper wires that currently dominate the installed
base of the industry).<BR>
<BR>
The winning bidders from AT&T and Sprint did not put up their $3.7 billion
in order to join a zero-sum straggle for new cellular customers. These bidders
are dominated by long- distance businesses that can use PCS to reduce their
some $30 billion in access charges to the local exchange carriers by creating
an alternative local loop. Similarly, MCI, though avoiding the auction,
created a subsidiary called MCI Metro that may seek to manage service for
spectrum winners in 17 cities, again harvesting the benefits of obviated
access charges. Then all these companies can use their PCS technologies
to pursue customers around the world without any thought of wire.<BR>
<BR>
A chart created by industry analyst Herschel Shosteck illustrates the opportunity.
The Shosteck chart is a bell curve relating the incomes of the world's households
to telephone penetration rates. He shows that telephony has so far penetrated
only to countries representing the top tail of the curve, where national
wealth suffices to reduce the cost of telephony to a threshold of between
4% and 5% of incomes. As incomes rise around the globe, more and more people
cross the telecom threshold. A chart of GDP in real dollars per capita versus
telephone penetration shows that a 40% rise in incomes could bring a 1,600%
increase in potential customers.<BR>
<BR>
Compounding the surge in incomes, however, will be the plummeting cost of
wireless telephony. Shosteck estimates that between 1985 and 1994 the price
per customer dropped 80%, from $5,000 to $1,000. Combining these two trends,
he calculates that there will be between 400 million and 800 million new
wireless subscribers by the end of the year 2000. These numbers represent
an awesome upsurge from the world's current level of some 60 million cellular
customers. Any further acceleration in income growth or decline in telephone
prices will increase these numbers. A 50% further drop in telephone prices
combined with a 50% rise in incomes would quickly thrust the vast bulk of
the world's population above the Shosteck threshold. Far from the negative
elasticities that U.S. phone executives see in their saturated wireline
voice business, the world-wide communications market will be a financial
trampoline.

In an ordinary industry, a 50% drop in price seems a major obstacle. But
telephony is becoming a branch of the computer industry, which doubles its
cost effectiveness every 18 months. The wireless convergence of digital
electronics and spectronics will allow the industry to escape its copper
cage and achieve at least a tenfold drop in the real price of telephony
in the next seven years.<BR>
<BR>
Sen. Stevens should meet Martin Cooper, a former research chief at Motorola
and now CEO of ArrayComm. Located in San Jose, ArrayComm is devoted to drastically
reducing the cost of telephone access over the next two years while entirely
obviating the problems of twisted-pair wiring that afflict Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
The current pitch of ice-age cellular providers is &quot;pay more and get
less. . .and don't even think about universal service.&quot; Although they
claim penetration rates in industrial countries of nearly 10%, most cellular
users make most of their calls on wireline systems. The real market share
of cellular is in fact under 1% in the industrial world. The cellular companies'
formula for success is to exploit the public hunger for mobility by charging
more money for worse service--extracting premium prices for calls with acoustics
and reliability far inferior to wireline telephony. Followed by both sides
of the cellular duopoly--by Bells, McCaws and other suppliers--this pay-more-
for-less-and-worse formula has concealed from much of the industry the basic
technological fact that wireless will soon be acoustically better than wireline
and drastically cheaper as well. As the CD example shows, after all, digital
sound systems are superior to analog. And without wires, phones finesse
the largest capital and labor costs of conventional telephony.<BR>
<BR>
In economic terms, the intrinsic cost advantage of wireless is concealed
by the colossal installed base of copper. Already mostly paid for and largely
written off, the 154 million twisted-pair access lines will allow the Bells
to compete in price for some time with wireless rivals that have lower real
costs.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, technical reality will prevail in the end. Spectronics offers
technologies in four dimensions for dividing and conquering spectrum: Frequency
division, time division, code division and space division. All address in
various ways the issue of frequency rouse--how many times in a system particular
frequencies can be roused without causing interference in other calls using
the same frequencies. Of the four techniques, so far only frequency division
has been widely exploited. As these other methods come on line, the cost
of telephony will go over the same kind of digital cliff long familiar in
computers.<BR>
<BR>
Surveying all these proposed schemes and their promised upgrades (see sidebar
next page), it is safe to project between a 60% and 90% drop in the cost
of wireless telephony over the next five years, depending mostly on the
progress of CDMA. Qualcomm's CDMA could reduce costs tenfold, compared with
the threefold gains from current global services mobile (GSM) technology,
which contemplates an upgrade path chiefly through downgrading the voice
quality with a half-rate vocoder.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains in wireless efficiency from dividing by time, code or frequency
are compounded by dividing spectrum by space. Mathematically, every 50%
reduction in the cell radius yields a 400% increase in the number of customers
who can be served in a given area with a given technology. Huge theoretical
gains accrue from cell-splitting--reducing the physical extent of cells
and multiplying their numbery--converting current macrocells as large as
35 miles in diameter into microcells a mile or so in width, and into picocells
measured in hundreds of yards in buildings, shopping centers or congested
urban streets.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains, however, could be nullified by the expense and difficulty
of implanting base stations all over cities and neighborhoods. The key to
the gains of space division, therefore, is creation of base stations drastically
cheaper, smaller, more discreet and more functional than the current cell
sites, costing between $500,000 and $1 million, occupying 1,000 square feet
and containing between 55 and 416 radios, depending on the frequency reuse
factor. The most notable breakthrough in base stations is the Steinbrecher
MiniCell, to be demonstrated in July and launched at the end of the year.<BR>
<BR>
Putting a base station into a briefcase, Steinbrecher uses a single broadband
digital radio to perform the functions of between 55 and 416 analog transceivers.
The key breakthrough is a proprietary mixer that can flawlessly down-convert
all the waveforms in the entire cellular spectrum into a stream of baseband
digital bits without losing any information or introducing spurious signals.
Containing all the electromagnetic contents of the cell, this digital bitstream
is broken into channels by a 0.4- micron technology application-specific
integrated circuit and is interpreted by digital signal processors. Governed
by the learning curves of semiconductors, the MiniCell promises to reduce
the cost of a cell site by an initial factor of 10 and by an eventual factor
governed chiefly by the Moore's Law exponentials manifested in the PC industry.<BR>
<BR>
In an important article in the April issue of IEEE Personal Communications,
Donald Cox, former Bellcore wireless leader who is now at Stanford, calculated
that such digital base station technologies soon could lower capital costs
per wireless customer to $14, compared with a current cellular cost of $5,555
(assuming, in both cases, 180 channels per unit).<BR>
<BR>
Using leading-edge silicon technology, the broadband digital radio can transform
the entire landscape of wireless. It takes the channeling, tuning, filtering,
modulation, demodulation, coding, decoding and other processing out of the
analog radio domain, where a different radio system is needed for each frequency
band or modulation scheme. Moved into a digital signal processor or ASIC,
these functions yield to the huge efficiencies of the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate in space division, for example, is devoting the entire available
spectrum to every caller. Using broadband digital radios fed by arrays of
smart antennas, Cooper's ArrayComm is approaching this ultimate. &quot;We
believe that over the next few years, everyone will be using broadband radios,&quot;
Cooper says, pointing to Watkins- Johnson and Airnet joining Steinbrecher
in this business (though with far narrower bandwidths).<BR>
<BR>
All base stations, one way or another, have to find all the callers in a
cell and link them to callers outside. Broadband digital radios move the
search function from an array of radios to a single computer. Cooper contrasts
the technology with radar. As he puts it, traditional radar systems use
active beams to scan a location and find a targeted object; ArrayComm uses
a passive array of antennas and a digital radio to provide a broadband snapshot
of a cell 20 times a second, and employs computers to locate the targeted
object, in this case a handset.<BR>
<BR>
Like the Craig McCaw-Bill Gates low-earth-orbit satellite scheme called
Teledesic, the ArrayComm IntelliCell originated with work done for the Strategic
Defense Initiative program. Inventor Richard Roy developed algorithms for
rapidly calculating the source and trajectory of missiles from their electromagnetic
emissions as detected by satellite antennas scanning the surface of the
earth. Now he is using similar algorithms to identify the position, direction,
distance and amplitude of electromagnetic emissions from handsets in a wireless
cell, as collected by arrays of smart antennas at a base station. Once the
information is digitized, Roy's algorithms can sort out all the calls by
their location in the cell, excavating signals otherwise buried in neighboring
noise or shrouded in cross- talk, and conducting several calls at once on
the same frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper gives the analogy of human hearing. &quot;You close your eyes and
I walk around talking, and you can point to me at any moment. Add another
voice and you can still listen to me, or shift to the other voice. You can
hear the voice you want to hear twice as loudly as the voice you want to
suppress. You null out the interference. This is not a physical process.
You don't move your ears. Your brain calculates and correlates the different
sounds or signals. That's what Dick Roy's algorithms do in our smart base
stations.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Roy explains further: &quot;That works if you have a variety of frequencies.
Suppose, though, you were faced with a chores of monks all chanting in monotone
in the same frequencies. This is more like the cellular telephone or PCS
situation in the presence of interference or cross-talk. This is what prevents
frequency reuse in adjacent cells. Amid the drone of the monks, you could
not isolate the sound of one monk. What you need is more ears. Then you
could resolve the source of a particular sound by its location. That is
what we do with antenna arrays.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Adding a spatial dimension to the frequencies, time slots or codes tracked
by ordinary cell sites, an ArrayComm system can distinguish signals entirely
unintelligible to other systems. For example, an array with eight antennas
can effectively magnify the signal by a factor of eight. There is no theoretical
limit to the number of antennas, but as a practical matter, the size of
the array becomes a problem in urban cells. By moving up spectrum from 900
megahertz 15 centimeters to 1,800 megahertz, PCS reduces the size of the
antenna array from two meters across to one meter across (antenna size drops
in proportion to the decline in wavelength at higher frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
As a result of the effective magnification of signals, an eight-antenna
array could double the range of a base station, quadruple the area covered,
reduce to one-third or one-fourth the number of cell sites, and raise frequency
reuse to 100%, without CDMA. Because CDMA doesn't define channels by frequency
at all, but by codes, its limit is the number of codes that can be differentiated
in the cell. Thus, Roy believes that among all the competing technologies,
CDMA can benefit most from using the spatial dimension. Spatial processing
can help differentiate the calls in a cell as the noise of call codes accumulates
toward the limit where further traffic is impossible. As Qualcomm leader
Andrew Viterbi declared in a paper released on Jan. 13: &quot;Spatial processing
remains as the most promising, if not the last frontier, in the evolution
of multiple access systems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm is part of what Don Steinbrecher calls &quot;the transformation
of wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot; As a computer
business, wireless will share in the gains of Moore's Law. It will double
cost effectiveness every 18 months, rather than continuing on the stagnant
price curves of wireline telephony in its cage of copper, dominated by the
costs of rolling out trucks, digging trenches, laying wire and climbing
poles.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper predicts that over the next five years, the combination of broadband
digital radios, ArrayComm smart antennas and a stream of other advances
in wireless telephony will reduce the cost per minute of wireless phone
calls to a penny a minute, one-quarter the average wireline level and one-twelfth
the current cellular price. This price collapse will ignite huge positive
elasticities in demand, reaching for the first time billions of new customers
in India, China and Latin America who are now untouched by telephony.<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm's first customers are Alcatel in Europe, which is creating a system
for GSM, and DDI Tokyo Pocket Telephone. The fastest growing company on
the Tokyo stock exchange for the last five years, DDI is often termed the
MCI of Japan. Using transceiver chipsets from Cirrus Logic's PCSI subsidiary,
DDI is already the world leader in low-cost wireless telephony. The ArrayComm
technology should lower its costs to the point where these pocket telephones
can break through as a wireless local loop throughout the huge new markets
of Asia and elsewhere. Earlier this year, the DDI technology, called Personal
Handy Phone, was combined with a Bellcore-Motorola proposal as a new low-end
wireless standard under the name Personal Access Communications Systems.<BR>
<BR>
By transforming the technical landscape of communications, spectronics are
also transforming the lawscape. Indeed, by entirely closing the gap between
the costs of serving rural and urban customers, digital wireless phones
will obliterate the need for cross-subsidies that underlie the entire regulatory
edifice. In the new world of bandwidth abundance, the only group that will
need cross- subsidies and emergency aid is the communications bar.<BR>
<BR>
As a guide to the era ahead, telephone executives, regulators and Washington
politicians should contemplate the computer industry. The market share of
centralized time- shared computer systems dropped from 100% in 1977 to less
than 1% in 1987. International Business Machines and Digital Equipment Corp.
lost nearly $100 billion in market cap in five years.<BR>
<BR>
Or, for a more recent example of the power of wireless technology in the
digital age, the telcos, regulators and politicians should consider the
video distribution industry, Last year, Washington was so obsessed with
the cable industry and its apparent monopoly power that Congress enacted
a reregulation bill that ultimately imposed 700 pages of new rules on the
distribution of video news and entertainment. Politicians and pundits let
forth a stream of lamentations about the future access of the poor and the
rural to the new services of digital television and proposed a series of
new requirements for universal service.<BR>
<BR>
A year later, however, the very survival of the cable industry as a distributor
of point-multipoint video is in doubt. Before Congress could enact broadband
universal service rules, Direct Broadcast Satellites were propagating 150
channels of digital video with supreme universality over the entire expanse
of the continental United States. Attaching 18-inch dishes to the tops of
their igloos, the Inuits might acquire television images of a variety and
resolution far excelling any offering of cable television in the midst of
the nation's capital. With a software upgrade to MPEG-2 video planned later
this year, the number of channels will rise to some 200.<BR>
<BR>
Privately dubbed &quot;deathstar&quot; by cable industry executives, digital
DBS became the fastest growing product in the history of consumer electronics.
Just seven months after its introduction, it had already surpassed the combined
first-year sales of VCRs, CD players and big-screen TVs.<BR>
<BR>
Today, in the name of deregulation, politicians are preparing to impose
a series of new competitive requirements upon the Bell operating companies,
on the assumption that they still wield monopoly power. Pundits still seem
to believe that the copper cage protects local telephone companies from
outside competition. But in fact, the cage incarcerates them in copper wires,
while the world prepares to pass them by.<BR>
<BR>
The digital future is not wired or wireless. It is spectronic and spectacular.
To participate in this explosive market, all telephone companies will have
to escape from their copper cages into the infinite reaches of the spectrum.<BR>

<PRE></PRE>
MICHAEL MILKEN IS BACK! Back, so the story goes, from the orgies of '80s
greed, back from the best-selling den of thieves, back from his preening
at the predators' ball, back from soft time at Pleasanton pen, back from
prostate cancer and plagues of litigation, back to tell his own book to
William Novak and to buy his redemption with the spoils of his crimes. Yes,
so they say, Milken is back, while thousands of plundered companies and
communities labor to regain their standard of living and jobs, long lost
in the shuffle of his dismal deals and loaded down with his &quot;high yields.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Milken is back. Back from the gutters of Ponzi finance, the rot of
junk and S&L sleaze, angling: to launder his weaseled wealth with educational
hype and charity hustles. Back, aiming now at history and posterity rather
than at new opportunity, but hitting it big instead with Michael Jackson,
Doonesbury laughs and Clifton compassion photo ops. Meanwhile, even the
ascendant Republicans in Washington try to steer clear of &quot;eighties
excesses&quot; of debt and deficits and supply-side economics.<BR>
<BR>
Or so it looks to media observers of the Milken saga. And yet slowly and
arduously, there is emerging from the carrels of the Harvard Business School
and other institutions a distinctly different tale.<BR>
<BR>
Under the leadership of Michael Jensen, a small group of Harvard Business
School scholars has been scrutinizing all the statistics of corporate behavior
during the 1980s. They have laboriously appraised the results of all the
leveraged buyouts, junk bond issues, venture capital, and other tools of
corporate making and remaking. They have arrived at unexpected conclusions
and have developed a new body of theory to explain them. From this perspective,
the events of the 1980s--and Milken's role--assume a wholly new meaning.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen puts the Milken episode in the context of another form of wretched
excess for which Milken was the remedy: namely, the excesses of corporate
waste and conglomeration by empire-building managers with scarcely any ownership
stake in their companies. Amid the sieges of deregulation and tax rate reduction,
amid the obvious tumult in the markets for oil, tires, tobacco, real estate,
gold and commodities, many industries needed profound restructuring. But
their entrenched managements were set to expand their domains through acquisition
and investment in new capacity. Meanwhile, a thousandfold rise in the cost-
effectiveness of microchips, governed by the centrifugal law of the microcosm,
rendered obsolete the dominant architecture of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
Most conspicuously, between 1977 and 1987 the percentage of total computer
power commanded by centralized systems dropped from nearly 100% to under
1%. Less obviously, but no less profoundly, the equally centralized structures
of television and telephony were also falling before the distributive force
of the microcosm. Ordaining that the price performance of microchips rises
by the square of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip,
the law of the microcosm exalts single chip systems, led by the PC. Pushed
into obsolescence were all monopolies and hierarchies, pyramids and power
grids of the old information structure, epitomized by the mainframe computer,
the broadcast network and the central telephone switch.<BR>
<BR>
The old establishment of AT&amp;T, the big three TV networks and some 1,400
over-the-air broadcast stations was breaking down into a new formation of
cable and wireless schemes. Affecting virtually every company in the economy
and threatening most existing management plans and practices, these trends
created huge opportunities for wealth creation and disruption.<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with his move to Century City in Los Angeles in July of 1978,
Milken aggressively rode the microcosm--inside and outside of Drexel. Inside,
he concentrated on what Jensen describes as a key role of information technology:
&quot;taking the specific knowledge previously scattered through a firm
and making it into general knowledge usable by all.&quot; In this case,
it was a matter of turning Milken's command of the details of hundreds and
then thousands of high-yield issues into the foundation for a company that
could make these bonds the prime venture capital in the U.S. economy. From
the beginning, crucial to this goal was computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
A specialist in finance, information systems and operational research at
Wharton, he had begun his career at Drexel in 1970 with a computerized move
to speed up the delivery of securities to its customers, thus saving the
company some $ 500,000 in interest charges and setting a new standard in
the industry.<BR>
<BR>
In Los Angeles, he created an advanced system for trading based on what
was then a state-of-the-art Prime 550 Model 2. Through the RS-232 9600-baud
serial ports of up to 250 Televideo terminals, the Prime computer time-shared
a Fortran database containing the trading history of all Drexel customers,
some 1,700 high-yield securities and some 8,000 securities in the public
market.<BR>
<BR>
With a quick query, a member of Milken's team could determine the customer's
history, the amount of his potential profits or losses, his investment philosophy
and ability to buy new issues. Thus the team could link the buyers and sellers
of securities in a uniquely targeted and opportunistic way and could command
the detailed knowledge needed to counteract the strong prejudice and ratings
stigma against high-yield securities.<BR>
<BR>
Under William Haloc, a former systems analyst for Prime who joined Drexel,
the team also developed real-time analytics to allow instant calculation
of pricing for these intricate securities. These functions allowed salespeople
to view the name, issue and ratings of a security and to compute complex
yields and cash flows involving call features, sinking funds, refund schedules,
puts, warrants and prices, all instantly calculable on line. Meanwhile,
at rival firms, many dealers still fumbled with the levers on $ 3,000 Monroe
calculators.<BR>
<BR>
The entire system was monitored by Drexel Burnham's New York headquarters
and linked indirectly to the floors of the exchanges by Quotron, Reuters
and 10 other on-line services, each with a separate Rich monitor, switchable
from a keyboard. These arrays of small black monitors spread across the
desk collectively functioned like a present- day Windows display.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the features of Milken's system are Common today. But in 1980 they
were novel. This customized $ 2 million computer scheme, with five times
that amount for programming and maintenance, gave the Drexel team a mastery
of 5 the high-yield market that sometimes seemed positively sinister to
outside observers and competitors. But it was not magic or malfeasance;
it was the microcosm of the new technology joined with the knowledge and
investment genius of Michael Milken.<BR>
<BR>
More famously, Milken's grasp of the information age extended well beyond
Drexel's IS department. Focusing on emergent information companies responding
to the tectonic and regulatory turmoil unleashed by the microchip in TV
and telephony, Milken channeled a total of some $ 26 billion into MCI, McCaw,
Viacom, TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Cablevision Systems, News Corp. and other
cable, telecom, wireless, publishing and entertainment companies. At the
time, virtually none of these firms commanded substantial collateral acceptable
to a bank, and thus they could have raised these billions nowhere else.
Now, these companies are collectively worth some $ 224 billion and comprise
the foundations of a national information infrastructure unrivaled in the
world.<BR>
<BR>
With an eventual $ 2.5 billion from Drexel, MCI built the first national
single-mode fiber-optic network and spurred AT&T and Sprint into action
to give the U.S. a global lead in the technology. With another $ 1.2 billion,
McCaw launched the first national wireless telephone system. And with $
8 billion, TCI, Viacom, Time Warner, Cablevision Systems and Turner, followed
by many other Drexel high-yield issuers, made U.S. cable television a unique
national asset, with unequaled programming and broadband links. Redeemed
in the process were troubled companies providing equipment and services.
One of them was Corning, which supplied 62, 112 miles of state-of-the-art
fiber to MCI's pioneering network at a time when Corning had no other customers
for this crucial technology developed over the previous 17 years.<BR>
<BR>
Milken's influence reached well beyond his actual transactions. A once-lame
Disney was restructured with Milken's guidance and takeover pressure in
some three years of 5 a.m. meetings with Roy Disney, Frank Wells and Stanley
Gold. Then worth $ 1.8 billion, Disney emerged as a revamped Hollywood colossus
worth $ 30 billion 11 years later in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Comprising more than half of all high-yield bond issues, Milken's activities
also embraced thousands of companies beyond the telecom, cable TV and entertainment
field--for example, building Hasbro into the world's leading toy company
and Barnes & Noble into the leading independent bookseller. His example
helped inspire many rivals, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann
Little, and Morgan Stanley, who also made heroic contributions to this campaign
of corporate renewal. In particular, Morgan Stanley channeled crucial billions
in high-yield funds to the computer, semiconductor and hard-disk drive industries
during extreme industry crises in the mid- and late 1980s as Drexel was
leaving the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Between 1976 and 1993, Jensen calculates that in these campaigns of corporate
restructuring, American corporations conducted 42,621 merger and acquisition
deals worth a total of $ 3.1 trillion. In these transactions, selling: firms
won premiums of some 41%, generating $ 899 billion in constant dollar gains
to the shareholders. Since buying firms also gained on average, by increments
that increased over the years, Jensen's estimate represents a lower bound
on the yields of the restructuring movement.<BR>
<BR>
No substantial evidence supports the speculations by Larry Summers (now
Treasury Undersecretary) and others that these gains disguise large wealth
transfers from bondholders, workers, suppliers and communities. Indeed,
the evidence assembled by Jensen, Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago,
Harvard economist Andre Schleifer and Jensen colleague Karen Wruck, among
others, shows that capital expenditures, employment, and research and development
all rose in the aftermath of these transactions.<BR>
<BR>
As Jensen now sums it up: &quot;These are lower-bound estimates because
they do not include gains that came about later or voluntary gains that
were achieved as a result of hostile offers. I don't know any way to add
up all these benefits. But it is clear that the impact was dramatic and
it left us much more competitive as a country. Today the Japanese and the
Europeans are suffering from their delay of restructuring and the U.S. is
much leaner and more efficient.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Both Jensen and Milken agree that the opportunities today exceed even the
gains of the 1980s. Impelled by the restructuring campaign, the real value
of the equity of public firms more than doubled between 1981 and 1990, rising
by $ 1.6 trillion, or from $ 1.4 trillion to $ 3 trillion. Since then the
pace of technical change has accelerated and the possibilities for a deregulatory
breakthrough have soared with the election of a new Congress. Forbes ASAP
projects possible stock market gains for the rest of this decade of another
$ 2 trillion.<BR>
<BR>
The heightened pace of change, however, creates a desperate need for restructuring.
This $ 2 trillion opportunity depends on emancipating into the markets the
resources currently trapped in obsolete structures by capital gains taxes
near 40%, compounded by inflation, and by new antitakeover rules and outdated
telecom regulations. Flowing again into a new communications infrastructure,
into venture funds and into restructuring campaigns, freed capital can endow
entrepreneurs with the power to align their companies with the most potent
force in the history of technology.<BR>
<BR>
But first, America needs a new Milken. 
<PRE>
<B>
The Onrush of the Telecosm
</B></PRE>
With chip densities still doubling every 18 months and chip sales up nearly
30% each of the last two years, with computer MIPS (millions of instructions
per second) per dollar doubling every year and computer sales up over 25%
in each of the last two years, with hard-disk cost- effectiveness doubling
every nine months, and fiber-optics bandwidth exploding a thousandfold while
fiber deployment spreads at a pace of 1,300 miles a day--the onrush of technology
is now accelerating well beyond the pace of the 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm is now potentially converging with
the law of the telecosm. This law ordains that the value and performance
of a network rise apace with the square of the increase in the number and
power of computers linked on it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers
and communications can ride an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
The 50 million new computers sold into America's homes and offices over
the last two years guarantee a huge market for broadband networks. Half
of the PCs sold in December bore Pentium microprocessors, and 60% of the
PCs went into homes. These computers process data at a pace rapidly approaching
100 MIPS. Early in the next century, just five years from now, most American
households will command multimedia teleputers processing data in billions
of instructions per second and pouring it out at gigabit-per-second rates--or
as much as a million times the current digital dribble of 9.6-kilobit modems.<BR>
<BR>
But not today. This computer-rich, bandwidth-poor situation means a crippling
and unnecessary mismatch between microcosm and telecosm, between the power
of PCs and the bandwidth of the networks that serve them--between PC instructions
per second on single-chip silicon and telco bits per second on twisted-pair
copper wires. Tens of millions of PC owners are demanding electronic commerce,
distance learning, full-motion videoconferencing, and ready access to the
graphics and hypertext of the Internet. World Wide Web.<BR>
<BR>
Yet phone and cable executives dawdle with market surveys and experiments
with interactive TV that amazingly manage to prove that people don't even
want full-motion movies. Meanwhile, the values and sales of their companies
languish. In the last 12 months, for example, the 24 leading telecom and
cable companies, led by the Regional Bell Operating Companies, lost an average
of 12.8% of their market value. Facing a world of shining broadband opportunities
in their own businesses, narrowband executives grope for glamour in Hollywood
and grasp for growth overseas.<BR>
<BR>
American industry is still cowed by overreaching regulators obsessed with
corporate power. In a world of exploding competition in the telecosm -galvanized
by new wireless and wireline technologies emerging every week--the administration,
the FCC and Congress have long been paralyzed by nightmares of John Malone
of TCI and a possible single- wire stranglehold in St. Louis or of a blight
of disinvestment in phone service for South Dakota or Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
If current fears of monopoly result in a contrived two-wire mandate on America's
communications infrastructure, however, all the hopes for an integrated
broadband two-way net will die until well into the next century. With oceans
of bandwidth languishing just out of reach, the tremendous resource of broadband
home computers will waste away, gasping on the beach for two-way channels
for teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine and telecommerce, while
the telephone and cable companies &quot;compete&quot; with rival offerings
of mostly one-way floods of movies, shopping and the Sega Channel for TVs.
By betraying its precious world- leading endowment of PCs in order to save
its existing telcos and TV companies, the U.S. still could make a literal
$ 2 trillion mistake.

The Amazing Vindication of Junk
</B></PRE>
To grasp the size of possible opportunity and the possible mistake, let
us return to Milken and his achievement of the 1980s, which set the stage
for the current drama. Never in history has a convicted white- collar felon
been so luminously vindicated by the passage of time. His six alleged felonies
dwindled to a series of debatable violations, devoid of insider trading
and essentially costing their victims nothing (or a total of $ 318,082,
according to a dubious estimate by the court that forced him into a plea
through RICO threats against him, his family and Drexel). Returning to the
volumes of the 1980s peak, his supposed Ponzi scheme of junk finance became
the most profitable class of domestic fixed-income securities of the early
1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if the few Savings & Loans that held a substantial portfolio of
junk had been permitted to keep it, they would have survived, prospered
and paid millions of dollars of taxes rather than collapsed into the hands
of the FDIC. For example, the shareholders of Columbia Savings & Loan may
have suffered from Thomas Spiegel's undue extravagance in company jets and
bullet-proof bathrooms. But the government crackdown cost them $ 700 million
and cost the taxpayers $ 1 billion, though the bank was on track to profit
massively from falling interest rates on its deposits and thriving high-yield
securities.<BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurs such as ex-Drexel luminary Leon Black, who purchased the bonds
from the government at bargain-basement rates, became billionaires on the
proceeds and were charged with gulling the regulators. Meanwhile, the companies
that Milken financed with these securities now form the foundations of a
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
A minor triumph came at the end of 1994 when Vanity Fair magazine, avid
vessel of many a lurid exposed of Milken and his team, published a lavishly
photographed story on &quot;America's New Establishment.&quot; Among the
19 names were Ted Turner, Craig McCaw, Sumner Redstone, Gerald Levin, John
Malone, Rupert Murdoch, Barry Diller, Michael Eisner, Ronald Perelman and
Bill Gates. Although Milken was never mentioned, all these high fliers--with
the exception of Gates--rose to prominence largely or partly on a cresting
tide of Milken's junk.<BR>
<BR>
Why does junk work! Primarily because it frees capital from corporate bureaucracy
and gets it into the hands of entrepreneurs. During the 1980s, lower taxes
and new technologies had transformed the economic environment. What was
precious in the 1970s--metals, minerals, real estate and collectibles, all
mashed together in diversified conglomerates and tax shelters-became disposable
junk in the 1980s. What was junk in the 1970s and early 1980s--Milken's
array of leveraged cable, fiber, wireless and content schemes--became the
precious foundations of a new information infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
How could this be so? How could one man with a poorly named venture-debt
financing vehicle contribute so hugely to the U.S. economy while, according
to Jensen's analysis, the nation's 500 largest corporations, led by a $
100 billion opportunity loss at General Motors in 11 years, incurred negative
returns with their free cash flow (cash flow beyond the amount needed to
fund all internal investments with a positive net present value)?<BR>
<BR>
Did not Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller win a Nobel prize for their
so-called M&M theorems showing that the performance of corporations is independent
of their capital structure? Have not scores of economists pursuing the Efficient
Market Hypothesis demonstrated that in general the capital exchanges are
fully efficient, that company prices reflect all of the available information
and no individual investor can systematically outwit the tape without illegal
manipulation or insider trading?<BR>
<BR>
In his presidential address to the American Finance Association in 1993,
however, Jensen answered all these arguments. On the basis of new research
on the experience of the 1980s, he declared that the M&amp;M theorems, &quot;while
logically sound, are empirically incorrect.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The central problem of the corporation, according to Jensen, is the &quot;agency&quot;
dilemma-the divergence between the interests of the managers and the owners
of large businesses. This problem is inherent in all cooperative human endeavor:
the interests of the individuals always deviate at the margin from the goals
of the group. But in times of rapid technological and political transformation,
as Jensen argues, the agency gap becomes a gulf. The structure of the corporation,
the training of its engineers, the skills of its executives, the costs of
its processes all become misaligned with the realities of a new technological
base, a rapidly changing state of the art, and a political environment in
upheaval.<BR>
<BR>
General Motors was the worst example, investing $ 121.8 billion during the
1980s in R&amp;D and capital equipment while the value of the company dropped
to $ 22.9 billion. IBM invested $ 101 billion while its value was dropping
to $ 64.6 billion by the end of 1990 (on the way to further collapse to
$ 41 billion in early 1995). Collectively, the 500 largest U.S. corporations
wasted hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow. What was needed,
according to Jensen, was a total overhaul of most of these companies, their
strategic redirection, and the replacement or redeployment of roughly half
of the existing managers. What occurred was a prodigal waste of resources
in defense of the obsolete structures and practices of the incumbent management.<BR>
<BR>
Creating most of the new value during the 1980s were companies funded or
restructured by corporate raiders, venture capitalists and even--in the
case of a $ 75 billion gain from the AT&T breakup--the courts (disbanding
a monopoly previously created by government). Using equity, venture capitalists
overcome the agency gulf by playing an active controlling role on company
boards and managements and by insisting that executives are compensated
chiefly through stock and options. Using venture debt and an array of complex
securities, Michael Milken overcame the agency gulf by similarly active
intervention.<BR>
<BR>
Millken channeled billions of dollars into companies such as McCaw or MCI
largely owned by the management, to compete with industry leviathans. For
companies not owned by their executives, he funded leveraged buyouts that
transformed nonowner managers feeding on free cash flow into heavy owners
of equity with virtually no liquid resources. Contracted to divert all their
free cash flow to the holders of high-yield debt, the new owner-managers
were forced to please the capital markets in order to fund any new projects.
<PRE>
<B>
The Productivity Boom</B></PRE>
With the agency problem solved, these companies became lean and mean leaders
of the global economy. Contrary to the claims of many economists, from Alan
Blinder to Lester Thurow, productivity soared. Mired in the murky data on
service-sector productivity--which was stultified by the practice of measuring
most outputs by the cost of the inputs--economists tended to miss the prodigious
real growth of the 1980s. For example, in the brokerage and finance arenas,
productivity stagnated in the data, but between 1973 and 1987 the number
of shares traded daily grew from 5.7 million to 63.8 million, while employment
only doubled in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Manufacturing productivity numbers, though more accurate, also suffer from
severe miscalculations. In a world of creative destruction, they tend to
assume that products, such as computers, that decline in price are dropping
in value. And while registering every new steel ingot, automobile or chocolate
bar, they assume that novel products represent no productivity gain at all.
These are not trivial mistakes. During the past 20 years, the cost of computers
has dropped approximately one millionfold. Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics
shows merely an annual drop varying between 14.9% in 1992 and 6.7% in 1994.
The government has finally recognized the flaws in this statistical series,
and is moving ever so slowly to correct it. But the problem is fundamental.<BR>
<BR>
Using the criteria applied to productivity in the auto industry, the statisticians
would have to multiply the improvement in computing cost-effectiveness by
the increase in the number of computers sold. Thus, with the explosion of
sales of billions of microcomputers of all kinds, from desktop systems to
embedded devices, a consistent BLS would find that the contribution of computers
to gross domestic product was close to a billion times larger than the entire
GDP of 1970. Of course, such an exercise would be preposterous. But hardly
more preposterous than mostly ignoring the productivity gains in these industries
of rapid advance, plummeting prices and cornucopian innovation.<BR>
<BR>
Even using existing data, total factor productivity in the U.S. manufacturing
sector more than doubled during the 1980s from the level during the previous
30 years. From 1950 to 1980, this productivity index rose an average of
1.4% per year; between 1981 and 1990, it rose at a rate of 3.3%. Labor productivity
rose from 1.4% per year in the earlier period to 3.8% in the `80s. Contrary
to the usual claims, wages rose at least 10%, according to Social Security
system data, while the number of jobs rose by 18 million.<BR>
<BR>
But the most striking productivity surge came in the growth of the productivity
of capital. In essence, Milken, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann Little
and others took the vast incarcerated capital resources trapped in old-line
businesses and put it back into the markets. Not only was the productivity
of the capital left behind hugely enhanced by the disciplines of restructuring,
but the freed capital flowed into venture funds and high-yield markets where
it fueled what Jensen calls &quot;a Third Industrial Revolution.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The results were dramatic. In decline for 30 years, at an annual rate of
minus 1.03%, the capital productivity index has long been beloved by Marxists
as a portent of the collapse of capitalism. During the 1980s, however, this
decline was decisively reversed. The productivity of capital as measured
in the data rose by 2.03% annually as computerized information systems transformed
the technology of finance.<BR>
<BR>
Decisively reversed as well was a long decline of U.S. market share in the
global economy. By the period between 1987 and 1992, U.S. corporations were
generating 47.7% of all the profits in the industrial world on 37.5% of
the revenues. Spearheading the U.S. economy were information firms, with
some 70% of global profits.<BR>
<BR>
Thus was overthrown by the restructuring of the 1980s all the indifference
theorems, Efficient Market Hypotheses, corporate optimality concepts, macroeconomic
monotheories wielded in business schools and economics departments to explain
away the power and &quot;wash&quot; away the paramount worth of individual
entrepreneurs and investors. Indeed, the giant corporation, with managers
largely free of ownership claims, gained its preeminence as a way of diffusing
risk among millions of stockholders with diverse portfolios. But with the
securitization of venture debt by Michael Milken and others, these behemoths
emerge as marketplace survivors largely because of their prowess at politics,
litigation and media management--core competencies that in the course of
a decade succeeded both in derailing the Milken threat and enacting laws
and regulations to forestall any followers.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps because of a bias in favor of the capitalists, Jensen's course vies
with Michael Porter's similarly entrepreneurial class as the most popular
in the last 15 years with students at Harvard Business School--a fact which
bodes well for the future of the economy.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen and Milken agree that today's economy faces technological transformations,
agency misalignments and restructuring chances even greater than the economy
of the late 1970s and early 1980s. &quot;The opportunity is truly huge,&quot;
says Jensen. ASAP estimates that in this 40% larger economy, there should
be a chance for Milkenesque investors to raise stock market value by more
than 67%, implying both a revitalized U.S. economy, a Dow level over 6500,
a Standard & Poor's Index exceeding 700, and a Nasdaq over 1400.<BR>
<BR>
The question remains, however, how to realize these gains. Because of the
incredible continuing grip of obsolete regulations and the huge mismatch
between microcosm and telecosm, the fabulous new fiber and wireless technologies
have yet to force a corresponding industrial restructuring. The same old
players are still on the field protected by the same government rules, administered
still by Judge Harold Greene in the Modified Final Judgment breaking up
AT&T 11 years ago, and regulated still by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Justice Department and 5O state Public Utilities Commissions as if history
had stood still. Forty million computers with multimedia powers remain stranded
in homes with four-kilohertz copper connections to the world while communications
companies still ponder the perplexities of interactive TV and regulators
ruminate about how to prevent monopoly and preserve universal service. 
<PRE><B>

Cable TV's Impending Death</B></PRE>
Capsizing this entire teetering apparatus of petty fears and pettifoggery
will be this year's ascent of new wireless technologies. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs 10 to 30 times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
By nature, the U.S. Senate is dominated by rural customers. Many are Republicans.
Therefore, universal service has posed a paralyzing problem for programs
of deregulation. But new wireless digital technologies have utterly banished
this problem.<BR>
<BR>
At a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the gap in costs between rural and urban customers. At
the same time, with supreme universality across the entire continent, Direct
Broadcast Satellite already delivers service superior to cable. Already
in the sky, DBS is a big bang that will ultimately transform the entire
corporate landscape of U.S. communications with a cascade of imperious new
realities.<BR>
<BR>
In digital DBS, GM Hughes, Hubbard Broadcasting and Thomson's RCA have delivered
a knockout new conduit for delivering one-way video. In image resolution,
in audio quality, in number of channels and in raw reach and efficiency
of point-to-multipoint transmission, DirecTV not only decisively outpaces
even the studio offerings at cable company headends but also vastly and
instantly excelled them in coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Currently the only weakness of DBS is a lack of certain critical content
such as local and broadcast network programming. The lack will be addressed,
with the help of Michael Milken, by major new restructuring this year.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely devastating to broadcast cable TV, a still more powerful DBS
will send reverberations throughout the broadcast industry and profoundly
affect computers, government regulators and telephone companies as well.
As Milken explains, &quot;Everything in the information economy is connected
to everything else.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As government regulators will be the last to notice, DBS utterly overthrows
the prime premise of cable regulation: the view that cable commands some
kind of monopoly in delivering one-way video programming. Far from a monopoly,
one-way cable TV is essentially dead. In response to DBS, cable has no choice
but to change its business radically to two- way computer services.<BR>
<BR>
The market opportunity is obvious and immense. The Internet boasted five
million host computers and over 30 million estimated users in January, and
growth of 26% in the last quarter of 1994. The largest spurt of expansion
in recent history, this surge came despite acute frustration at the narrow
bandwidth of available phone connections.<BR>
<BR>
At present, only the cable TV industry commands conduits to homes capable
of accommodating these multimedia teleputers. One-gigahertz cable TV coax
can accommodate some eight billion bits per second of two- way data or some
5,000 channels of the kind of MPEG1 video now offered in one direction by
DBS. Such bandwidth could accommodate ubiquitous videoconferencing and commerce.
By contrast, your phone line modem labors to transmit 14.4 thousand bits
per second, or enough to send one MPEG movie in two weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Reaching 63% of U.S. households, including at least 92% of homes with PCs,
cable supplies the obvious conduit for the exploding computer business.
Intel, General Instrument, Digital Equipment, Hybrid and Com21, among other
companies, are supplying cable modems and software for high-speed bidirectional
traffic over the existing cable plant. But consummation of the network will
entail large investments in fiber and switching at a time when cable is
just emerging from its regulatory shadows into the deadly Ku-band radiance
of DBS.<BR>
<BR>
The most obvious source of capital is the RBOCs, the local telephone companies
(though Milken stresses that the public utilities are a major alternative).
The Bells already command nine times as much fiber as cable TV does and
invest every year more money than the total $ 23 billion of cable revenues.
What they lack is bandwidth for broadband access to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The key to access to these huge new computer markets, therefore, is forthcoming
congressional action to permit collaboration between the RBOCs and the cable
companies within their own regions. If necessary, the telephone companies
must be allowed to buy cable companies and merge their systems. The coming
ascent of DBS should relieve the fears of monopoly that have long deterred
action. If it does, the cascade of change spurred by DBS will lead to a
flood of new commerce and communication on the networks of America.<BR>
<BR>
The endowment of DBS with new programming clout, however, will prove to
be the last triumph of conduit-content convergence. The restructuring paladins
of the broadband era will devote much of their efforts to dismantling the
content-conduit conglomerates that currently dominate the cable industry
and that are now in formation by the telephone companies.<BR>
<BR>
In a broadband era, content-conduit combines no longer make sense. Consider
that you are Warner Entertainment, a content company. You do not want to
restrict your movies to one conduit. You want to sell them through everyone's
conduit. Consider that you are Warner Communications, a cable firm. With
eight gigabits per second--enough for 5,000 movie channels--you want to
sell everyone's movies, not restrict yourself to Warner's.<BR>
<BR>
Efforts to mix content and conduit--artists and engineers-produce misaligned
companies that need restructuring. Content follies crowd into the agency
gulf. Nynex, Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis gave superagent Michael Ovitz
$ 14 million to pursue more &quot;content&quot; while Ameritech, BellSouth
and Southwestern Bell (SBC) romanced Disney.<BR>
<BR>
What would a new restructuring king do in the face of such ham- handed diversification?
Bring on the raiders. Sic some junkyard Doberman on the succulent bells
and whistles acquired by cable and telephone firms. Let him spin off their
recent acquisitions and interactive TV experiments and game channels and
refocus these companies on the computer networking business where they belong,
and where they can harvest the bonanza of a global economy rapidly uploading
onto the Net. 
<PRE><B>


The Two-Wire Delusion
</B></PRE>
Washington has to make a choice. Is it going to allow a freedom model that
permits telephone companies and cable companies to combine as common carriers
to build a true broadband infrastructure, in which millions of entrepreneurs
can cavort and compete in content and context? Or will regulators impose
a spurious competitive model, with two or more wires to every home, all
imitating the current cable strategy of wannabe content-conduit monopolies.<BR>
<BR>
As venture capitalist Roger McNamee warned in the Feb. 27 issue of ASAP:
&quot;There is an unspoken assumption in government circles that we can
move local loop communications to a fiercely competitive business model
and build an information superhighway at the same time...an implicit assumption
that the regional Bell operating companies and the cable companies are a
bunch of knuckle-dragging dimwits who will build the superhighway no matter
what... [But] telecom businesses are characterized by high fixed costs.
There is no such thing as limited competition... As you infuse competition...the
value model of the industry collapses. And when it does, the effect will
be exactly the same as stepping on a large cow pie in your hiking boots.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Congressman Jack Fields, new Republican chairman of the House Telecom Subcommittee,
disagrees: &quot;I am convinced that the [industry] people we talked with
will respond to telecom reform. They have tens of billions of dollars parked
on the side of the information superhighway waiting for us to pass a piece
of legislation to give definition and certainty to the scene.&quot; But
the people he consulted--chiefly the leaders and the lobbyists of the RBOCs
and cable companies--are not the ones who will decide whether the highway
is built.<BR>
<BR>
Making that decision will be the same capital markets that punished Bell
Atlantic and TCI for their broadband plans and thwarted the merger between
them. As soon as it became clear--through the passage of the cable re-regulation
act of 1992 and related policies of the FCC--that the regulators would permit
collaboration only in regions where the two companies had no competitive
advantage, the case for the combine collapsed. Under a regulatory system
in which the government can sweep down and confiscate profits and channel
them into quixotic schemes of universal service in three dimensions for
the homeless or require irrational competitive behavior in a two-wire multisubsidiary
world, a true broadband two-way network makes no business sense. What will
emerge instead is an array of dueling brands of 500-channel TV, claiming
to be interactive for the benefit of Congress and the press.<BR>
<BR>
Capital markets will avoid cow-pie competition at all costs. Under these
circumstances, a true broadband system will not be completed until 2020
in the U.S. But the competitive model is fundamentally misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
To the Washington regulators and their elected allies, competition has always
meant rivalry between the existing competitors--long distance, broadcast,
Baby Bells and Cable TV--and the regulation succeeds as long as all the
teams stay on the field. But all technological competition--all innovation--consists
of the pursuit of fugitive positions of monopoly. Current legislative proposals
from the administration and its congressional allies resemble a broad national
effort in 1981 to defend the mainframe BUNCH (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control
Data, and Honeywell) from imperial IBM. Just as the IBM &quot;monopoly&quot;
was about to fall before the microcosm, led by Intel and Microsoft, so the
RBOC and broadcasting &quot;monopolies&quot; are about to fall before the
telecosm of broadband digital computer networks, which will also sorely
challenge Intel and Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
The new information infrastructure will bring a cornucopia of new services
from a variety of new sources that cannot even be defined as yet. All we
know is that none of the existing rivals is likely to survive in recognizable
form. Only a true freedom model that allows a complete reconstruction of
the world of communications--with anyone collaborating or competing, merging
or metamorphing with anyone rise--can allow this new era to come to fruition.
Only a freedom model can release the $ 2 trillion of new asset value that
the scholars of restructuring promise for the U.S. economy of the 1990s
and beyond.<BR>
<BR>
This result the Republicans on Capitol Hill command the unique and precious
and passing opportunity to achieve. So open the floodgates of capital for
new corporate raiders and remakers, venturers and reinventors. Rejoice in
the return of Milken and pray that he be joined by scores of rivals, including
those allowed to use the securities markets. Virtually all the cable and
telephone companies, from MCI to TCI to SBC, should be up for grabs, by
each other and from outside firms. Sitting on $ 10 billion of cash, IBM
could fruitfully enter the fray, or be frayed itself. IBM could combine
its global ATM network with cable access to homes. For many of these companies,
capital is far less scarce than vision.<BR>
<BR>
Milken cites MCI. &quot;Twelve years ago, they had a cash shortage with
billions of dollars of capital expenditures to make. They had a clear understanding
of what their business was. We supplied them with billions of dollars of
capital and that fueled the spread of fiber optics throughout the country
during the 1980s. Today their situation is far less clear. They have $ 3
billion in cash, they could borrow $ 6 billion more; they've got a strategic
worldwide partnership with British Telecom. Today the challenge is not capital.
It is vision. It is, what should MCI's future be?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
With MCI's current resources, it could buy cable facilities across the country,
join them with its fiber network, complement them with wireless personal
communications services and Internet connections, and outwit AT&T as brilliantly
as it did in the 1980s. But it has to be willing to bet the company again.
The question is whether the current management, with Bill McGowan in his
grave, can escape the agency trap, shun the cushions of large corporate
life, and become a real competitor again rather than a protected player
in a continued government sham of &quot;competition.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When a visitor at one of the Capitol Hill offices in charge of telecom policy
points to the benefits of real competition and restructuring, the politician
will usually respond: &quot;The companies do not tell us that.&quot; The
dirty little secret of all too many telephone and cable companies is that
they prefer government-regulated &quot;competition&quot; to real entrepreneurial
risks and rewards. As long as telco and cable lobbyists fail to urge true
competition, these companies deserve much of the blame. for the Third World
regulations that still limit the horizons of their industry.<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly, however, the situation is changing from an unexpected source.
While much of industry still lags, the politicians seem ready at last to
seize the day with a new freedom model. Now the congealed glaciers of telecom
can begin to break up under the blows of a reinvigorated market for corporate
control.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps, the best solution will be again to deregulate Milken. 
<PRE><B>

Postscript: The Return of Mike Milken</B></PRE>
One morning, in his office on a quiet street in Los Angeles near Bel Air,
Milken is probing some of the outward edges of the new regime, delving into
a business plan for ridefilms. Ridefilms are a brand new industry of convergence
that blends features of theatrical films, theme- park rides and arcade games.
Giving the viewer the sensation of plummeting motion and soaring flight
on platforms that move in sync with motion on the screen, these systems
are virtual reality that really works.<BR>
<BR>
Presenting the project of the day is Whitmore Kelley of Berkshire Motion
Pictures, the firm that created the pioneering &quot;Back to the Future:
The Ride&quot; for Universal Theme Parks. He is proposing Ridetime, a low-cost
system of theater capsules for children between the ages of four and 10.<BR>
<BR>
These turnkey theaters could bring ridefilms to malls, shopping centers,
toy stores, theme parks, resorts, restaurants and family entertainment centers
at a toll of $ 1.50 per child, eight children at a time. Offering four-minute
musical adventures with engaging plots and educational themes, these systems
would be the first to shun the &quot;testosterone market&quot; of the arcades
and focus on young children.<BR>
<BR>
Milken had heard enough. He confessed he had only been able to read five
sections of the business plan during the two or three minutes that had elapsed.
But with a quizzical Columbo look, he said he had some questions. He had
recently seen similar systems in Norway and Sweden. Small groups of parents
and kids together paid the equivalent of $ 4 apiece to plummet down an Olympic
Alpine downhill or bobsledding course. No, they weren't real ridefilms,
with synchronized physical movement, but they were cheap to produce and
offered a similar experience and there would be a lot more where those came
from. How would Berkshire compete with these? Let's say he owned space in
an arcade. Teenagers pump in money all day long and deep into the night.
Why would he give space to a children's ride that takes up twice as much
room and closes down at bedtime? Interactivity? Watch out for that. Kids
today get real interactivity on their computers and Nintendo machines at
home. Any effort to provide interactive features for eight kids at once
might well turn them off. Where would the parents be? They would see the
show for nothing, standing behind the kids, without the motion that makes
it interesting. That's a downer. A four-year-old will demand that the parents
sit with him. The parents are your customers. Make them pay and let them
ride.<BR>
<BR>
Commenting that Kelley had described other ridefilm companies as the competition,
Milken demurred. The computer software industry would be the competition.
He grilled Kelley on the size of the capsule, its cost per square foot,
its yield to the owner of the space in a mall, the quality of the images,
the nature of the liquid crystal projection technology.<BR>
<BR>
As Kelley described it, &quot;Milken is so mentally aggressive and determined
I was astonished. I came in and he began playing the flute and several other
instruments at once, and I had to figure out what the dance was and start
moving and shaking in time. Teaching, learning and testing at the same time.
. .he was amazing.&quot; At the end of the presentation, Milken announced
that he was impressed and would go visit a prototype of the new system nearby
in the L.A. suburbs.<BR>

Or watch him on President's Day in a paneled room in Atlanta's Occidental
Grand Hotel. He is contemplating a new learning network as a climax to some
25 years and $ 250 million of Milken family ventures in the field of education.
Milken has assembled leading experts on education, film and finance to consult
with the CEO of the new project, Hamilton Jordan, recently of Whittle Communications.<BR>
<BR>
Milken began with the crucial rule that the educational network &quot;go
first to the home, later to the schools,&quot; rather than the other way
around (which was Whittle's mistake). &quot;The teachers themselves will
bring any good material into the schools,&quot; he said. He ended by suggesting
that the group had radically underestimated the size of their potential
market. He pointed to his earlier investment in Interface Group, the sponsor
of Comdex, recently sold to Japanese entrepreneur Masayoshi Son of Softbank
Corporation for $ 800 million. Virtual conferences and teleconferences for
training and education and lifelong learning could become a leading vehicle
of convergence, joining software, computers, consumer electronics, telephones
and even public utilities.<BR>
<BR>
As he summed up, he declared that the size of the educational market, appropriately
defined today to include corporate training, was not $ 400 billion as Jordan
had said, but more than $ 1 trillion. Visionary and trenchant as ever, lifting
the horizons of all around him, Milken was clearly back.

Breakup Candidates?
</B></PRE>
AT&amp;T: In both history and promise, AT&T may be the world's greatest
technology company, combining microcosm with telecosm more intimately than
any other. With Bell Labs, 59% of the long-distance market, and McCaw's
access to the local loop, AT&T today also should be one of the most valuable
companies in the world. But its management has reduced its market cap to
just over one times sales, making it nearly the cheapest major phone company
in the country. Bell Labs performed much of the early work on the vital
new multimedia communications technology of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM),
but a new startup named Fore Systems dominates the market with scores of
other companies. Judge Green broke up AT&T once. Smart management would
break it up again.<BR>
<BR>
TIME WARNER: Time Warner went to the well for high-yield securities in 1984
at the time of the Atari crash. It plunged deep into debt to save the company
and preserve it film assets. With Lorimar, it produced more than a third
of all TV programming; with Warner films, it was the dominant Hollywood
force; with Warner records, it ruled music; and with Warner Communications,
it was the second-biggest cable system. In other words, it followed the
content-conduit strategy. Unfortunately, this strategy twisted its Orlando
project into unprofitable knots. Mobilizing some of the best technology
in the world- Silicon Graphics 3D interface and servers, AT&amp;T ATM, Scientific
Atlanta's 64QAM transmission-Warner compressed it into a TV set-top box
and centralized server system focused on delivering movies over cable conduits.
This business won't pay for the plant. Perhaps belatedly recognizing this
problem, the company is now veering in the oppsite direction, ordering 1.5
million new analog set-top boxes for $ 250 million from General Instrument.
Don't they grasp the deadly meaning of the DBS big bang?<BR>
<BR>
This company needs restructuring to get ready for a broadband world. It
must spin off its precious content and transform its conduit to accommodate
the only real interactive machines with market penetration, namely PCS.<BR>

But I don't understand howIntel gets hurt unless it stops delivering the best price/performance microprocessors.The more network connectivity the more we need MIPS. Andy Grove is rightthat DSPs are just a complex way of getting more MIPS. Just because bandwidthreduces some of the need for compression doesn't mean bandwidth reducesdemand for cycles.<BR><BR>In any case Gilder is very stimulating even when I disagree with him, andmost of the time I agree with him.<BR><HR><B><TT>Nicholas Negroponte - Director,<BR>MIT Media Laboratory, Boston, MA</TT></B> <H3>Debunking Bandwidth:</H3>When our world is fibered, the planet is like a desktop. Earth is but abackplane for a single computer. True. But as mere humans, the bandwidthwe're really interested in is the one that exists between us and computers,be they the size of a cuff link or a country. That bandwidth is often onewe want to be smaller, not bigger. Most of us, most of the time, want lessbits, not more bits. Sure we want gigabits, but only for a few millionthsof a second at a time.<BR><BR>Remember the early days of computing when stacks of fanfolded output weredropped on an executive's desk? People caught on quickly; that was data,not information. Today, for some reason, we have forgotten some simple conceptsabout what constitutes meaning and understanding and where they come from.You. So while it is real easy to ship vast amounts of data and high-resolutionimages back and forth between computers and while it is suddenly possibleto ignore geographic constraints, let's not forget that in many cases &quot;lessis more&quot; when it comes to bandwidth.<BR><BR>Narrow channels force us to be smarter. Yes, bandwidth will be free, butso will computing. The future will not be driven by either MIPS or BPS,but information and entertainment content. Andy Grove does not need to worryabout John Malone or Bill Gates. He has to worry about Michael Ovitz.<BR><BR><HR><PRE><B>Mark Stahlman - President,New Media Associates,  New York, NY</B></PRE><H3>Bandwidth to Burn: Now What Do We Do?</H3>Gilder has made a case for vastly expanded bandwidth overwhelming the influenceof the steady march of computing power. [But] what new need will drive businessesto translate the inventions Gilder describes into significant new mediaopportunities?<BR><BR>Apparently, it's the need for video-on-demand. [But] if this were a plausiblemass market, the streets of New York would be filled with bicycle messengersdelivering Tom Cruise with bags of Chinese food. No, during the next fiveto 10 years, bandwidth will certainly be consumed in much greater quantities--butfor completely different reasons. We will dramatically extend ourselvesand our social relationships with video-telephones. We will consume substantialbandwidth by substituting bandwidth for gasoline--through telecommuting.We will network to multimedia databases (such as the current Internet-basedWorld Wide Web) and dramatically expand our range of social contacts--acrossborders, cultures and tribes.<BR><BR>Unfortunately for Gilder's bandwidth braggarts, these enormous markets willbe built using a telecommunications technology which began deployment over10 years ago--ISDN--and in which none of them has any important financialstake today. Unglamorous, ungainly, even downright ugly, ISDN (integratedservices digital network) will be supplied by old-time telephone companies(not cable companies) and it will be driven by the steady progress of personalcomputers--themselves now a 15- to 20- year-old industry. As has been widelynoted, we tend to overestimate (sometimes dramatically) the near-term impactof new technologies and underestimate the long-range effects.<BR><BR>In this age, new technology hype has become an epidemic. Reality itself,as it turns out, is far more interesting.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael Slater - President,MicroDesign Resources,and Editorial Director,Microprocessor Report,  Sebastopol, CA</B></PRE>Increasing bandwidth will provide computers with more information to process,and this will increase, not decrease, the computational requirements. Havinghigh bandwidth makes it possible for the interface nodes to be less intelligent,but this is not necessarily desirable. Furthermore, the time frame mustbe considered; high-bandwidth WAN (wide area network) connections are notgoing to be widely available for years, and in the meantime, computationalpower will continue to be critical as a way to mitigate bandwidth limitations.<BR><BR>No matter how much bandwidth is available, it is still very desirable tohave high-performance computational ability in desktop systems. Renderingof three-dimensional images from mathematical representations, for example,is something that has widespread application not only in games, but in otherconsumer applications (like home and garden design programs). Orders ofmagnitude more performance will result in direct improvements in such applications,and bandwidth is no substitute here.<BR><BR>Finally, with regard to the inclusion of signal-processing capabilitiesin general-purpose microprocessors, I disagree with Gilder's conclusionthat this will not occur. Minor extensions to general-purpose architectures,such as the ability to perform four 8-bit additions in parallel using thesame hardware that normally performs a single 32-bit addition, will providea significant boost for applications such as video decompression. The costof adding these features is small, and the benefit is great. Sun and HPhave already made such additions to their processors, and I expect Inteland other x86 vendors will do so in the future. Dedicated DSPs will alwaysbe able to provide higher performance, but the incremental cost/performanceof adding functions to the host CPU is superior.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael E. Treacy - President,Treacy &amp; Co.,  Cambridge, MA{Treacy is co-author of The Discipline of Market Leaders}</B></PRE>[Gilder's] view is rounded on the narrow philosophy of technological determinism.It is a peculiar and persistent form of myopia based on the wobbly assertionthat the best technology will win in the marketplace. He who rides the besttechnological wave will ascend to glory. Oh, if it were only so! If technologydetermined success, there would be no Microsoft today. By any reasonablestandards, MS-DOS, the foundation of Mr. Gate's empire, was an average technologywhen it was brought to market more than a decade ago. But Microsoft hadall the other elements that created a compelling value proposition for itscustomer.<BR><BR>Value is what customers want. Intel has got what it takes and has been avalue leader for many years. Andy Grove has already begun to direct Intel'sdevelopment portfolio toward communications opportunities. He has read thesignals and made the call, just as he did several years ago when he vacatedthe memory-chip business, in advance of grinding competition and shrinkingmargins. With constant vigilance and change, Intel's success can continuefor years to come.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Howard Anderson - Managing Director,The Yankee Group,and General Partner,Battery Ventures,  Boston, MA</B></PRE>George Gilder's analysis of the changes in the computing and communicationstradeoff is brilliant, concise, analytical--and flawed. His portrait ofthe rapid changes in communications and relative disadvantage of the old-linecomputer industry (Intel, etc.) does not overestimate the movement. It underestimateshow the next 10 years will be the decade of Bandwidth on Demand. Considerthis: <UL><LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of bandwidth will drop faster than the costof computing. <LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of switching will drop faster than the costof bandwidth. </UL>Historical examples: The cost of a T1 line (1.54 megabits) coast to coastin 1985 was $ 40,000/month. Today? Under $ 2,000/month, a drop of 95%.<BR><BR>Assume the following: by 2000, computing is free, and bandwidth is free.Now--design the future!<BR><BR>The amount of money spent on ATM Research and Development (Source: YankeeGroup ATM Planning Service): <UL><LI>1993:$ 335 million <LI>1994:$ 550 million <LI>1995:$ 950 million </UL>So Gilder is right on about the impact of ATM. In fact, Fore Systems, whereour sister company Battery Ventures is the second-largest outside stockholder,carries a market capitalization of $ 900 million--on a $ 60 million salesbase demonstrating that the ATM value is well known within the industry.<BR><BR>This past year, the Yankee Group trained 5,000 end-users on the use of ATMtechnology and the most frequently asked question was, &quot;How in theworld am I going to use all that bandwidth?&quot; But it was only 10 yearsago that users thought they would fall off the end of the earth if theywent faster than 2.4 kilobits!<BR><BR>Which leads to some immutable laws about networks, which Gilder alludesto: <UL><LI>Networks always grow. <LI>Networks always become more complex. <LI>Networks find applications that double the bandwidth needed every threeyears. <LI>The cost of bandwidth is artificially high. </UL>Andy Grove is right: &quot;Only the paranoid survive.&quot;<BR><HR><PRE><B>G. A. Keyworth, IIThe Progress and Freedom Foundation,Washington, D.C.</B></PRE>George Gilder's article goes yet another step in establishing him as theforefront signal-to-noise processor&quot; of information technology. Yet,I confess to being somewhat confused by it.<BR><BR>My dilemma resides in what I will call the &quot;30-30 rule&quot;--thatwe humans can take in information at only about 30 megahertz through oureyes or, even slower, at 30 kilohertz through our ears. The kind of bandwidththat Gilder projects are important to machine-to-machine communications,i.e., to networks, but it is the computer (in some form, whether PC, PDA,digital-phone or digital-TV) that will continue to determine the &quot;match&quot;between bandwidth and the inherent limitation of the 30-30 rule.<BR><BR>Bandwidth is important, because it will make the connection a richer one,but the fact remains that we humans lack broadband input channel to accessall that bandwidth directly. And it is the computer that must bridge thatgap, keeping it in the driver's seat as we enter the realm of ubiquitous,connected computing.<BR><BR>Gilder's article makes an additional point, and one that falls too oftenon deaf ears in Washington. That is that bandwidth scarcity, the basis formuch of our telecommunications regulation, is an outdated concept. Onlymajor revamping of the government's role in telecommunications will permitthe natural competition between computing and communications to play out.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Eric Schmidt - Chief Technical Officer,Sun Microsystems,  Mountain View, CA</B></PRE>Gilder's article does a wonderful job showing the potential impact of thebandwidth revolution. Let me give you two examples of approaches in computersystems to exploit enormous bandwidth increases:<BR><BR>The speed of light is not doubling every 18 months. There is a revolutionin system design for small, fast machines just as significant as the onefor broadband networks in your article. What we call today &quot;large servers&quot;will in fact have to become physically very small. We are now approaching&quot;design for light speed&quot; in computer systems, and we have to keepour handy ruler, measured in nanoseconds, ready for each new board design.Light travels about four inches in a nanosecond in today's wires, so that,in a 500-megahertz (two nanosecond) computer design, we have less than eightinches of room for our signals to travel in a synchronous processor design(as most are). This means that the fastest computers in our future willalso have to be the smallest!<BR><BR>The backplanes of these machines have to be physically very short. The limitof a single backplane makes it hard to keep up with the improvements inprocessor speeds, using traditional backplane designs.<BR><BR>Switching becomes a core strategy for computer systems. Two approaches thatmerge switching and architecture are now popular. One, called DistributedShared Memory, uses a switching network to link cache-coherent memoriestogether. In DSM computers, the power of shared memory designs can be extendedover very high- speed switched memory networks. The other, called clustering,has been around for at least 15 years, and uses a switching network to linkcomputer systems. In this approach, applications are modified to share commondisks, peripherals and software.<BR><BR>Small size and switching are the future of high-performance computing. Bothare based on networking as their core. As the switched networks get fasterthese architectures will come to dominate computing. The fastest improvingtechnology, in this case networking, always drives the architecture. Thehollowing out of the computer occurs when high-performance computers trulyspan networks. ATM asynchronous transfer model, now in its infancy, is thelikely network for us to bet on.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Steven Dorfman - President,Hughes Telecommunications and Space Co.GM Hughes,  Los Angeles, CA</B></PRE>In &quot;Ethersphere&quot; (Oct. 10) Gilder offers the view that high- poweredgeostationary satellites--the mainstay, high-capacity platforms of our past,current and future service offerings--are already antiques, and soon willbe displaced entirely by thousands of low earth orbiting satellites. Thatthese highly touted systems are nonexistent, unlaunched and unproven [andrequire major technical breakthroughs] are details that conveniently escapeGilder's scathing assault on geostationary systems.<BR><BR>Gilder should recognize that new technology products are designed and broughtto market based on a host of considerations in addition to pure technicalfeasibility. Tradeoffs are--must be--made. But to Gilder, &quot;tradeoff&quot;would appear to be synonymous with &quot;sellout.&quot;<BR><BR>In the corporate world, this is business naivet&Ccedil;. In deciding whatform Hughes's new Spaceway and DirecTV services, for example, should take,our goal was to deploy systems that: maximized technology insertion, therebyminimizing risk; provided a low-cost service for which there was demonstratedconsumer demand; and faced minimal regulatory, technology-development, orfinancing delays, thereby expediting service introduction.<BR><BR>A Ka-band GEO system, evolved from U.S. defense communication satelliteapplications, Spaceway is the logical extension of Hughes's universe of120,000 very small aperture terminal antennas worldwide, used for privatenetwork, two-way voice, data and video. Our me-satellite regional approachprovides global coverage at a cost of $ 3 billion. Because service can berolled out incrementally, revenues can be generated before full system deployment.(By contrast, virtually all 840 Teledesic satellites must be operational--ata $ 9 billion system cost--before service can begin.)<BR><BR>Our comparatively low investment cost and highly efficient spot beam architecture,whereby we cost-effectively target our capacity to the world's most populatedregions, yield significant savings and low user costs. . .critical becausedeveloping nations with limited communications infrastructure are a keymarket.<BR><BR>For voice, we expect that developing regions without access to low-costterrestrial voice service will embrace Spaceway despite the fractional timedelay--at least until terrestrial infrastructure is available. This is asignificant, revenue- generating window of opportunity for us. As for dataapplications, our VSAT experience has shown that custom developed protocolsprovide totally acceptable throughput efficiency and seamless interactivity.In short, we believe &quot;the delay issue&quot; has been overstated. Thereis a different delay issue, however, that cannot be overstated. Gilder is,I believe, overly optimistic about how soon Teledesic's technology willbe ready--and hence, how soon service revenues can be generated.<BR><BR>I believe Spaceway is the best technological solution for this market atthis time. But if tomorrow the technology and market are in place so thatthe LEO system makes sense, rest assured that Hughes will introduce an innovativeLEO product of Our own.<BR><BR>Gilder attaches far too little import and value (in the form of operatingprofits) to today's technology. Nowhere is this more clear than in his assessmentof satellite direct-to-home television programming. Gilder calls DBS &quot;one-size-fits-allprogramming,&quot; stressing its lack of sufficient consumer choice andabsence of Interactivity. But in holding out for a fiber solution, Gilderis making a poor business decision.<BR><BR>Today, Hughes's two DirecTV GEO satellites are filled with 150 program channels.We are adding 3,000 subscribers a day, and will break even (three million)by mid-1996. With 10 million subscribers projected by 2000, DirecTV willbe a $ 3 billion a year business, with $ 1 billion in operating profit.<BR><BR>Waiting for the future, Gilder, carries a price tag most CEOs can't afford,and are not prepared to pay. <PRE><HR></PRE><H2><CENTER>GEORGE GILDER REPLIES:</CENTER></H2>I want to thank my correspondents for their alternately poetic, ironic,trenchant and pithy responses. So many of them, though, share the notionthat I predicted dire straits for Intel that I must assume a lack d clarityin my treatment of the issue. I predicted that new and larger opportunitieswould arise in the field of communications processors and systems that centralprocessing units would bear a declining share of total processing not thatthey would in themselves decline in any absolute sense. Indeed, CPUs shouldcontinue to improve their cost-effectiveness apace with Moore's Law, plusan increment for architectural advances in parallelism. Such advances, however,will fail to keep pace with the onrushing expansion of bandwidth, as furtherdetailed by Howard Anderson's intriguing letter. Bandwidth gains will befed on the demand side, as Mark Stahlman incisively observes, more by theneeds of teleconferencing and telecommuting than by the need for one-wayvideo-on-demand.<BR><BR>Thus I agree with Bill Gates that Intel can continue to thrive as long asit continues to produce the most cost-effective microprocessors. I did raisethe possibility, foreshadowed by Microunity's new semiconductor lab process,that Intel's existing technology might face rivals that could produce moreMIPs or gigabits per second per watt. Power efficiency will be a crucialindex in a time of seething CPUs and increasing demands for power- savingdesigns from producers of mobile appliances, such as the digital cellularcommunicators which will be the most common PCs of the next decade.<BR><BR>Focusing on gigabits per second as a prime spec, these devices may welleclipse CPUs in raw processing pace and find a wide range of applicationsin digital radio, real-time compression and decompression, pattern recognition,echo- cancellation and other digital signal processing uses. The demandsof these applications have already impelled an array of processing and architecturaladvances at Microunity, Texas Instruments and elsewhere in the pullulatingfield of DSP. Unconstrained by proprietary legacies and immense installedbases, perhaps other manufacturers will also find ways to excel the Moore'sLaw pace of Intel's majestic progress down the learning curve of three-voltCMOS technology.<BR><BR>Jay Keyworth and Nicholas Negroponte both eloquently point to the centralparadox of the information age. While production systems of the industrialage use scarce resources, such as land, labor, and capital, to create abundance,production systems of the information age use abundant resources, such asbits and bandwidth, to create knowledge scarce enough to fit the bandwidthof humans. This distillation function--delivering correct and useful datato human beings with their Keyworth window of roughly 30 kilohertz cochleaand 30 megahertz retinas--requires processing speeds orders of magnitudeabove the human rates, just to sample, quantize and codify the flow. Toscan, select, recognize, correct, decompress, echo-cancel, visualize orotherwise manipulate the data entails still further accelerations of processingpower.<BR><BR>Communications processors may well emerge as most efficient for many ofthese tasks. The idea that all such functions will be sucked into the CPUhas a long history, but motherboards and their buses remain as crowded asever. I suspect that the bandwidth explosion will offer many opportunitiesfor processors specializing in communications.<BR><BR>Steven Dorfman of Hughes, I predict, will do better both for his companyand his two-way communications from space by moving quickly rather thanslowly to low earth orbits. I fully share his admiration for the point-tomultipoint-powers of DBS and I have long cited them as a prime reason forthe obsolescence of cable TV regulations based on the assumption of monopoly.Indeed, I predict far more than 10 million users by 2000 if Hughes and itssuppliers can meet the demand. But satellite and cable TV vendors will prosperbest by providing two-way channels for the 110 million personal computersin the land. I expect that these channels--particularly CATV, not ISDN--willprovide the dominant access channel for computers over the next decade.<BR><BR>Above all, I hope that whoever Andy Grove fears most, it is not MichaelOvitz. Grove goes Hollywood and we'll all be in trouble.<BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="49" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<H3><HR>Craig Mundie of Microsoft thinks that Tiger, his video-on-demand
operating system, signals a fundamental shift in the computer industry.
Ruling the new era will be bandwidth measured in billions of bits per second
rather than in the millions of instructions per second ofcurrent computers.
</H3>
<H3><CENTER>&quot;We'll have infinite bandwidth in a decade's time.&quot;<BR>
-- Bill Gates, PC Magazine, Oct. 11, 1994.</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Andrew Grove, Titan of Intel, is widely known for his belief, born in the
vortex of the Hungarian Revolution and honed in the trenches of Silicon
Valley, that &quot;only the paranoid survive.&quot; If so, the Intel chief
may soon need to resharpen the edges of fear that have driven his company
to the top. Looming on the horizons of the global computer industry that
Grove now shapes and spearheads is a gathering crest of change that threatens
to reduce the microprocessor's supremacy and reestablish the information
economy on new foundations. Imparting a personal edge to the challenge are
the restless energies of Microsoft's Bill Gates and Tele-Communications
Inc.'s John Malone, providing catalytic capital and leadership for the new
tides of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Grove's response is seemingly persuasive. &quot;We have state-of-the-art
silicon technology, state-of-the art microprocessor design skills and we
have mass production volumes.&quot; These huge assets endow Intel as a global
engine of growth with 55% margins and more than 80% market share in the
single most important product in the world economy. Why indeed should Grove
worry?<BR>
<BR>
One word only may challenge him and with him much of the existing computer
establishment. Let us paraphrase a 1988 speech by John Moussouris, chairman
and chief executive of the amazing Silicon Valley startup MicroUnity, which
gains a portentous heft from being financed heavily by Gates and Malone:
If the leading sage of computer design, in his last deathbed gasp, wanted
to impart in one word all of his accumulated wisdom about the coming era
to a prodigal son rushing home to inherit the business, that one word would
be &quot;bandwidth.&quot; Andy Grove knows it well. Early this year he memorably
declaimed: &quot;If you are amazed by the fast drop in the cost of computing
power over the last decade, just wait till you see what is happening to
the cost of bandwidth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt, chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems, is one of the
few men who have measured this coming tide and mastered some of its crucial
implications. His key insight is that the onrush of bandwidth abundance
overthrows Moore's Law as the driving force of computer progress. Until
now progress in the computer industry has ridden the revelation in 1979
by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the density of transistors on chips,
and thus the price-performance of computers, doubles every 18 months. Soon,
however, Schmidt ordains, bandwidth will be king.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth is communications power--the capacity of an information channel
to transmit bits without error in the presence of noise. In fiber optics,
in wireless communications, in new dumb switches, in digital signal processors,
bandwidth will expand from five to 100 times as fast as the rise of microprocessor
speeds. With the rapid spread of national networks of fiber and cable, the
dribble of kilobits (thousands of bits) from twisted-pair telephone lines
is about to become a firehose of gigabits (billions of bits). But the PC
is not ready. Attach the firehose to the parallel port of your personal
computer and the stream of bits becomes a blast of data smithereens.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tsunami of Gigabits<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The bandwidth bottleneck of telephone wires has long allowed the computer
world to live in a strange and artificial isolation. In the computer world,
Moore's Law has reigned. At its awesome exponential pace, computer price-performance
would increase some one hundredfold every 10 years. This means that for
the price of a current 100 mips (millions of instructions per second) Pentium
machine, you could buy a computer in 2004 running 10 billion instructions
per second. Since today the fastest bit streams routinely linked to computers
run 100 times slower, at 10 megabits per second on an Ethernet, 10 bips
seems adequate as a 10-year target. All seems fine in computer land, where
users rarely wonder what happens after the wire reaches the wall.<BR>
<BR>
In the face of the 10 times faster increase in bandwidth, however, Moore's
Law seems almost paltry. The rise in bandwidth does not follow the smooth
incremental ascent that the heroic exertions, inventions and investments
of Andy Grove and his followers have maintained in microchips. bandwidth
bumps and grinds and then volcanically erupts. The communications equivalent
of those 10 bips that would take 10 years to reach according to the existing
trend would be 10-gigabit-per-second connections to their corporate customers
next year.<BR>
<BR>
During the very period of apparent bandwidth doldrums during the 1980s,
phone companies installed some 10 million kilometers of optical fiber. So
far only an infinitesimal portion of its potential bandwidth has been delivered
to customers. Moussouris estimates that the bandwidth of fiber has been
exploited one million times less fully than the bandwidth of coax or twisted
pair copper.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the tide is now gathering toward a crest. This year, MCI offers
its corporate customers access to a fiber connection at 2.4 gigabits per
second. Next year that link will run at 10 gigabits per second for the same
price. Two years after that it is scheduled to rise to 40 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, at Martlesham Heath in the United Kingdom, home of British Telecom's
research laboratories, Peter Cochrane announced in early September that
he could send some 700 separate wavelength streams in parallel down a single
fiber-optic thread the width of a human hair. Peter Scovell of Northern
Telecom's Bell Northern Research facility declares that by using &quot;solitons&quot;--an
exotic method of keeping the bits intact at high speeds through a kind of
surface tension counterbalancing dispersion in the fiber--it will be possible
to carry 2.4 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second) on each wave length
stream. That would add up to more than 1,700 gigahertz on every fiber thread.<BR>
<BR>
Blocking such bandwidths until recently was what is called in the optics
trade the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot; The light signals had to be
converted to electronic pulses every 35 kilometers in order to be amplified
and regenerated. Thus fiber optics could not function any faster than these
electronic amplifiers did, or between two and 10 gigahertz. In the late
1980s, however, a team led by David Payne of the University of Southampton
pioneered the concept of doping a fiber with the rare earth element erbium,
to create an all-optical broadband amplifier. Perfected at Bell Labs, NTT
and elsewhere, this device overcomes the electronic bottleneck and allows
communications entirely at the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
IBM's optical guru Paul Green prophesies that within the next decade or
so it will be possible to send some 10,000 wavelength streams down a single
fiber thread. Long prophesied by fiber optics pioneer Will Hicks, these
developments remain mostly in the esoteric domains of optical laboratories.
But IBM recently installed its first all-optical product--its MuxMaster--for
a customer running 20 wavelengths on a fiber connecting offices in New York
to a backup tape drive in New Jersey. Telephone companies from Italy to
Canada are now deploying erbium-doped amplifiers. Long the frenzied pursuit
of telecom laboratories from Japan to Dallas and government bodies from
ARPA to NTT (now turning private), all-optical networks have become the
object of entrepreneurial startups, such as Ciena and Erbium Networks.<BR>
<BR>
Returning from the ethers of innovation to existing broadband technology
connecting to people's homes, Craig Tanner of CableLabs in Louisville, Colo.,
maintains that a typical cable coax line can accommodate two-way streams
of data totaling eight gigabits per second. In Cambridge and other eastern
Massachusetts cities, Continental Cablevision is now taking the first steps
toward delivering some of this bandwidth for Andy Grove's PC users. Today,
using Digital Equipment's LANCity broadband two-way cable modems, David
Fellows, Continental's chief technical officer, can offer 10 megabits per
second Ethernet capability 70 miles from your office. That increases the
current 9.6 kilobits per second speeds of most telephone modems by a factor
of 1,000.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term contributor to the tides of bandwidth is a
new communications technology called asynchronous transfer mode. ATM is
to telecommunications what containerization is to transport. It puts everything
into same-sized boxes that can be readily handled by automated equipment.
Just as containerization revolutionized the transport business, ATM is revolutionizing
communications. In the case of ATM, the boxes are called cells and each
one is 53 bytes long, including a five-byte address. The telephone industry
chose 53 bytes as the largest possible container that could deliver real-time
voice communications. But the computer industry embraced it because it allows
fully silicon switching and routing. Free of complex software, small packets
of a uniform 53 bytes can be switched at enormous speeds through an ATM
network and dispatched to the end users on a fixed schedule that can accommodate
voice, video and data, all at once.<BR>
<BR>
Available at rates of 155 megabits per second and moving this year to 622
megabits and 2.4 gigabits, ATM switches from Fujitsu, IBM, AT&amp;T, Fore
Systems, Cisco Systems, SynOptics Communications and every other major manufacturer
of hubs and routers will swamp the ports of personal computers over the
next five years.<BR>
<BR>
Why should all this bandwidth arouse the competitive fire of Andy Grove?
The new explosions of bandwidth enable interactive multimedia and video,
riding on radio frequencies, into every household--through the air from
satellites and terrestrial wireless systems, through fiberoptic threads
and cable TV and even phone-company coax.<BR>
<BR>
If the personal computer cannot handle these streams, John Malone's set-top
boxes, Sega or Nintendo game machines or Bill Gates's new communications
technology will. A communications technology that can manage multimedia
in full flood can also in time relegate one of Grove's CPUs to service as
a minor peripheral. The huge promise of the PC industry, with its richness
of productivity tools and cultural benefits, could give way to an incoherent
babel of toys, videophones and 3D games.<BR>
<BR>
Redeeming the new era for the general-purpose PC entails overcoming the
technical culture and mindset of bandwidth scarcity. In today's world of
bandwidth scarcity, arrays of special-purpose microprocessors constantly
use their hard-wired computer cycles to compensate for the narrow bandwidth
of existing channels and to make up for the small capacity of the fast,
expensive memories where the data must be buffered or stored on the way.
This is the world that Intel dominates today--a world of CPUs incapable
of handling full multimedia and radio frequency demands, a world of narrowband
four-kilohertz pipes to the home accessed by modems at 9.6 kilobits per
second and a world of what Moussouris call arrays of &quot;twisty little
processors,&quot; such as MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) decoders from
C-Cube and IIT, graphics accelerators from Texas Instruments and an array
of chips from Intel.<BR>
<BR>
By fixing the necessary algorithms in hardware, these devices bypass the
time-consuming tasks of retrieving software instructions and data from memory.
Thus these chips can perform their functions at least 100 times faster than
more general-purpose devices, such as Intel's Pentium, that use software.
But all this speed comes at the cost of rigid specialization. An MPEG-1
processor cannot even decode, MPEG-2. When the technology changes, you have
to replace the chip. Such special-purpose devices now handle the broadband
heavy lifting for video compression and decompression, digital radio processing,
voice and sound synthesis, speech recognition, echo cancellation, graphics
acceleration and other functions too demanding for the central processor.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, contemplate a world of bandwidth abundance. In a world of bandwidth
abundance, specialized, hard-wired processing will be mostly unnecessary.
In the extreme case, images can flow uncompressed through the network and
onto the display. Bandwidth will have obviated thousands of mips of processing.
The microprocessor instead can focus on managing documents on the screen,
popping up needed information from databases, performing simulations or
visualizations and otherwise enriching the conference. The arrival of bandwidth
abundance transforms the computing environment.<BR>
<BR>
Led by Grove's and Intel's bold investments in chip-making capability --
some $ 2.4 billion in 1994 alone--the entire information industry has waxed
fat and happy on the bonanzas of Moore's Law. Now, however, some industry
leaders are gasping for breath. Exkhard Pfeiffer of Compaq has denounced
Intel's avid campaign to shift customers toward the leading-edge processors
such as Pentium, embodying the latest Moore's Law advances. Gordon Moore
himself has recently questioned whether the pace of microchip progress can
continue in the face of wafer factory costs rising toward $ 2 billion for
a typical &quot;fab.&quot; He has pronounced a new Moore's Law: The costs
of a wafer fab double for each new generation of microprocessor.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, but the new world of the telecosm offers no rest for weary microchip
magnates or future-shocked PC producers. Driven by the new demands of video
and multimedia, the pace of advance will now accelerate sharply rather than
slow down.<BR>
<H4>Feeding the Tiger</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplate the advance of the Tiger, Microsoft's all-software scheme for
video-on-demand based entirely on PCs. Although Tiger has been presented
as merely another way to build a &quot;movie central&quot; for cable headends
or telco central offices, its real promise is not to redeem the existing
centralized structure of video but to allow any PC owner to create a headend
in the kitchen for video-on-demand. Today, such capability would mean buying
a supercomputer plus an array of expensive boards containing special-purpose
processors. Tiger's consummation as a popular product therefore will require
a new regime of semiconductor progress.<BR>
<BR>
Driven by this imperative, a pioneering combine of Gates, Malone and Moussouris
is making an audacious grab for supremacy in the telecosm. Just three miles
from Intel and fueled by ideas from a 1984 defector from an Intel fabrication
team, Moussouris's MicroUnity is a flagrantly ambitious Sunnyvale, Calif.,
startup launched in 1988. Fueled by some $ 15 million from Microsoft and
$ 15 million from TCI, among several other rumored backers, it plans a transformation
of chip-making for the age of the telecosm, optimized for communications
rather than computations.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity's goal is a general-purpose mediaprocessor, software programmable,
that can run at no less than 400 billion bits per second--some hundreds
of times faster than a Pentium--and perform all the functions currently
done in special-purpose multimedia devices. Escaping the tyranny of fixed
hardware standards, the mediaprocessor could receive decompression codes
and other protocols, algorithms and services over the network with the video
to be displayed in real time.<BR>
<H4>The Great Bandwidth Switch</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In launching Tiger and MicroUnity, Gates and Malone are signaling a fundamental
shift in the industry. Ruling the new era will be bandwidth or communications
power, measured in billions of bits per second rather than in the millions
of instructions per second of current computers. The telecosmic shift from
mips to bandwidth, from storage-oriented computing to communications processing,
will change the entire structure of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
In the past, the industry has been driven by increases in computer power
embodied in new generations of microprocessors--from the 8086 to the Pentium
and on to the P-6 and new Reduced Instruction Set screamers such as the
Power PC, Digital Equipment's Alpha and Silicon Graphics new R-1000 (the
latest in the family from Moussouris's previous company Mips Computer, now
owned by Silicon Graphics). External computer networks typically run much
more slowly than internal networks, the backplane buses connecting microprocessors,
memories, keyboards and screens. These buses race along at some 40 megabits
per second, up to Intel's new gigabit-per-second PCI bus. Even when computers
are linked in local area networks in particular buildings at 10 megabit-per-second
Ethernet speeds, they face a communications cliff at LAN's end: the four-kilohertz
wires of the telephone company. Under this regime, the processor is king
and Moore's Law dictates the pace of change.<BR>
<BR>
In the age of the telecosm, however, all these rules collapse. When the
network increasingly runs faster than the processors and buses in the PC,
the computer &quot;hollows out,&quot; in the words of Eric Schmidt. The
network becomes the bus and any set of interconnected processors and memories
can become a computer regardless of their location. In this bandwidth-driven
world, the key chips are communications processors, such as digital signal
processors (DSPs) and MicroUnity's mediaprocessors, which must function
at the pace of the network firehose rather than at the pace of the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, communications processors have indeed been improving
their price/performance tenfold every two years--more than three times as
fast as microprocessors. This kind of difference add up. Soaring DSP capabilities
have already made possible the achievement of many new digital technologies
previously unattainable. Among them are digital video compression, video
teleconferencing, broadband digital radios pioneered by Steinbrecher (see
Forbes ASAP, April 11, 1994), digital echo cancellation and spread-spectrum
cellular systems that allow 100% frequency reuse in every cell. All these
schemes require processing speeds far in excess of the bit rate of the information.<BR>
<BR>
For example, in accord with the prevailing MPEG standards, digital video
compression produces a bit stream running at between 1.5 and six megabits
per second. But in order to produce this signal manageable by a 100 mips
Pentium, a supercomputer or special-purpose machine must process raw video
bit flowing 100 times as fast as the compressed format--uncompressed video
at a pace of 150 to 600 megabits per second. The complex and exacting process
of compressing this onrush of bits--compensating for motion, comparing blocks
of pixels for redundancy, smoothing out the flow of data--entails computer
operations running 1,000 times as fast as the raw video bits. That is, the
video compression algorithm requires a processing speed of between 150 and
600 gigabits per second--hundred of times faster than the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, just to digitize radio signals requires a sampling rate twice
as fast as the radio frequency--at a time when new wireless personal communications
systems are moving to the two gigahertz bands and wireless cable is moving
to 28 gigahertz. A broadband digital radio must handle some large multiple
of the highest frequency it will process. Code division multiple access
(CDMA) cellular systems depend on a spreading code at least 100 times faster
than the bit rate of the message.<BR>
<BR>
In order to feed the Tiger and other such bandwidth-hungry systems, communications
processors will have to continue this breathtaking binge of progress beyond
the bounds of the microcosm. Grove does not believe this possible. He contends
that the surge in DSP will dwindle and converge with Moore's Law, allowing
the central processor to suck in functions currently performed in digital
signal processors and other communications chips. DSP is nice, Grove observes,
&quot;but it is not free--unless, that is, it is performed in the Intel
CPU, obviating the need to buy a DSP chip at all.<BR>
<BR>
But in an era when the network advances faster than the CPU, it is more
likely that communications processors will gradually &quot;suck in&quot;
and &quot;hollow out&quot; the functions of the CPU, rather than the other
way around. Echoing Sun's perennial slogan, Schmidt predicts that the network
will become the computer. In this era, Moore's Law and the law of the microcosm
are no longer the driving force of progress in information technology. Bandwidth
is king.<BR>
<BR>
As the great pioneer of communications theory Claude Shannon wrote in 1948,
bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Since ultimately a microprocessor
is a set of millions of transistor switches inscribed on a chip, bandwidth
can even serve as a substitute for mips. With sufficient communication,
engineers can duplicate any computer network topology they want. As the
network becomes the computer, they thus redefine the optimal architectures
of computing. As an example, take the problem of video-on-demand now being
confronted by every major company in the industry from IBM to Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
In 1992, Microsoft assigned this problem to Craig Mundie, a veteran of Data
General in Massachusetts, who had gone on to found Alliant Computer, one
of the more successful of the massively parallel computer firms. As a supercomputer
man, Mundie initially explored a hardware solution, hiring a team of computer
designers from Supercomputer Systems Inc. SSI was Steve Chen's effort to
follow up on his successes at Cray Research with a machine for IBM. Although
IBM ultimately closed SSI down, Chen commanded some of the best talent in
supercomputers. Mundie hired George Spix and a team from SSI.<BR>
<H4>Looking to Software</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, video-on-demand seems a super-computer task. It entails
taking tens of thousands of streams of digital images, smoothing them into
real-time flows, and switching them to the customers requesting them. Essentially
huge hierarchies of storage devices, including fast silicon memories, connected
through a specialized switching fabric to arrays of fast processors, supercomputers
seem perfectly adapted to video-on-demand, which as Bill Gates explains,
is &quot;essentially a switching problem.&quot; This is the solution chosen
by Oracle Systems, using its nCube supercomputer, and by Silicon Graphics,
employing its PowerChallenge server.<BR>
<BR>
According to Mundie, the SSI team developed an impressive video server design.
But they soon discovered they were in the wrong company. As Gates told Forbes
ASAP, &quot;Microsoft looks for a software solution to all problems. IBM
looks for a mainframe hardware solution. Larry Ellison owned a supercomputer
company so he looked for that solution. Fortunately for us, software solutions
are the most scaleable, flexible, fault-tolerant and low cost.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Enter Rick Rashid, a professor from Carnegie Mellon and designer of the
Mach kernel adopted by Next, IBM and the Open Software Foundation and incorporated
in part in Microsoft's Windows NT operating system. Rashid joined Microsoft
in September 1991 and began to focus on video-on-demand in 1992. Like most
other people confronting this challenge, he first assumed that the huge
bit streams involved would require specialized hardware--RAID (redundant
arrays of inexpensive disk) storage, fast buffer memories and supercomputer-style
switches. Soon, however, he came to the conclusion that progress in the
personal computer industry would enable an entirely software solution.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the memory problem illustrates a tradeoff between bandwidth
and processing speed. Expensive hierarchies of RAID drives and semiconductor
buffer memories managed by complex controller logic can speed the bit streams
to the switch at the necessary pace. But Rashid and Mundie saw that bandwidth
offered a cheaper solution. Through clever software, you could &quot;stripe&quot;
the film bits across large arrays of conventional disk drives and gain speed
through bandwidth. Rather than using one fast memory, plus fast processors,
and hard-wired fault tolerance to send the movie reliably to a customer,
you spread the images across arrays of cheap, slow disk drives--Seagate
Barracudas--which, working in parallel, offer bandwidth and redundancy limited
only the number of devices. Having dispensed with the idea of contriving
expensive hardware solutions for the memory problem, Rashid recognized that
with Windows NT he commanded an operating system with real-time scheduling
guarantees that laid the foundation for a software solution. On it, he could
proceed to build Tiger as a continuous digital stream operating system.<BR>
<BR>
Liberated from special-purpose hardware, the team could revel in all the
advantages of using off-the-shelf personal computer components. Mundie explains:
&quot;The personal computer industry commands intrinsic volume and a multi-supplier
structure that takes anything in its path and drives its costs to ground.&quot;
A burly entrepreneur of massively parallel supercomputers, Mundie became
a fervent convert to the manifest destiny of the PC to dominate all other
technologies in the race to multimedia services, grinding all costs and
functions into the ground of microprocessor silicon.<BR>
<BR>
Video-on-demand has been heralded as the salvation of the television industry,
the supercomputer industry, the game industry, the high-end server industry.
It has been seen as Microsoft's move into hardware. Yet nowhere in the Tiger
Laboratory in Building Nine is there any device made by any TV company,
supercomputer firm, workstation company, or Microsoft itself. On one side
of the room are 12 monitors. On the other side are 12 Compaq computers piled
on top of each other, said to be simulating set-top boxes. Next to these
are a pile of Seagate Barracuda disk drives, each capable of holding the
nine gigabytes of video in three high-resolution compressed movies. Next
to them are another pile of Compaq computers functioning as video servers.<BR>
<BR>
All this gear works together to extend Microsoft's long mastery of the science
of leverage, getting most of the world to drive costs to ground--or grind
cost into silicon--while the grim reapers of Redmond collect tolls on the
software. Exploiting another of Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy's famous
laws--&quot;The smartest people in every field are never in your own company&quot;--Gates
has contrived to induce most of the personal computer industry, from Bangalore
to Taiwan, to work for Microsoft without joining the payroll.<BR>
<BR>
In the new world of bandwidth abundance, however, it is no longer sufficient
to leverage the PC industry alone. Gates is now reaching out to leverage
the telephone and network equipment manufacturing industries as well. Transforming
all this PC hardware into a &quot;Tiger&quot; that can consume the TV industry
is an ATM switch. In the Tiger application, once one ATM switch has correctly
sequenced the movie bits streaming from the tower of Seagate disks, another
ATM switch in a metropolitan public network will dispatch the now ordered
code to the appropriate display. Microsoft's Tiger and its client &quot;cubs&quot;
all march in asynchronous transfer mode.<BR>
<H4>The Masters of Leverage</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why is this a brilliant coup? It positions Microsoft to harvest the fruits
of the single most massive and far-reaching project in all electronics today.
Some 600 companies are now active in the ATM forum, with collective investments
approaching $ 10 billion and rising every year. Not only are ATM switches
produced by a competitive swarm of companies resembling the PC industry,
ATM also turns networks of small computers into scaleable supercomputers.
It combines with fiber-optic links to provide a far simpler, more modular
and more scaleable solution than the complex copper backplane buses that
perform the same functions in large computers. ATM and fiber prevail by
using bandwidth as a substitute for complex protocols and computations.<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft Technical Director Nathan Myhrvold points to the Silicon Graphics
PowerChallenge superserver as a contrast. &quot;They have a bus that can
handle 2.4 gigabytes per second and which is electrically balanced to take
a bunch of add-in cards (for processor and memory).&quot; The complexities
of this solution yield an expensive machine, costing more than $ 100,000,
with specialized DRAM boards, for example, that cost 10 times as much per
megabyte as DRAM in a PC.<BR>
<BR>
This problem is not specific to Silicon Graphics. All supercomputers with
multiple microprocessors linked with fast buses face the same remorseless
economics and complexities. By contrast, the $ 30,000 Fore systems ATM switch
being used in Tiger prototypes--together with the PCI buses in the PCs on
the network--supply the same 2.4 gigabytes per second of bandwidth that
the PowerChallenge does. And, as Myhrvold points out, &quot;ATM prices are
dropping like a stone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Microsoft sage explains: ATM switches linked by fiber optic lines are
far more efficient at high bandwidth than copper buses on a backplane. ATM
allows &quot;fault tolerance and other issues to be handled in software
by treating machines (or disks, or even the ATM switch itself) as being
replaceable and redundant, with hot spares standing by.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Gates told ASAP, video-on-demand is essentially a switching problem.
You can create an expensive, proprietary, and unscaleable switch using copper
lines and complex protocols on the backplane of a supercomputer, or you
can use the bandwidth of fiber optics and ATM as a substitute for these
complexities. You can put the ATM switches wherever you need them to create
a system optimized for any application, allowing any group of PCs using
Windows NT and PCI buses to function as video clients or servers as desired.
As Microsoft leverages the world, it won't object if the world chooses to
lift NT into the forefront of operating systems in unit sales.<BR>
<BR>
Mundie and his assistant Redd Becker earnestly explain the virtues of this
scheme and demonstrate its robustness and fault tolerance by disabling several
of the disk drives, cubs and servers without perceptibly affecting the 12
images on the screen. They offer it as a system to function as a movie central
server resembling the Oracle nCube system adopted by Bell Atlantic, or the
Silicon Graphics system used by Time Warner in its heralded Orlando project.
But the Tiger is fundamentally different from these systems in that it is
completely scaleable and reconfigurable, functioning with full VCR interactivity
for a single citizen or for a city. It epitomizes the future of computing
in the age of ATM, a system that will soon operate at up to 2.4 gigabits
per second. Two point four gigabits per second is more than twice as fast
as the Intel PCI bus that links the internal components of a Pentium-based
personal computer.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, ATM technology can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and an external Barracuda, between a video client and a video
server. To the CPU, a local area network or even a wide area network running
ATM can function as a motherboard backplane. With NT and Tiger software,
PCs will be able to tap databases and libraries across the world as readily
as they can reach their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives. Presented as an
application-specific system for multimedia or movie distribution in real
time, it is in fact a new operating system for client-server computing in
the new age of image processing.<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Bell, now on Microsoft's technical advisory board, sums up the future
of computing in an ATM world: &quot;We can imagine a network with a range
of PC-sized nodes costing between $ 500 and $ 5,000 that provide person-to-person
communication, television and when used together (including in parallel),
an arbitrarily large computer. Clearly, because of standards, ubiquity of
service and software market size, this architecture will drive out most
other computer structures such as massively parallel computers, low-priced
workstations and all but a few special-purpose processors. This doomsday
for hardware manufacturers will arrive before the next two generations of
computer hardware play out at the end of the decade. But it will be ideal
for users.&quot; And for Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of equipment that feeds the Tiger, however, what Bell
calls &quot;doomsday for hardware manufacturers: may well be as profitable
as the current rage of &quot;Doom,&quot; the new computer game infectiously
spreading from the Internet into computer stores. The new Tiger model provides
huge opportunities for manufacturers of new ATM switches on every scale,
for PCs equipped with fast video buses such as PCI, for vendors of network
hardware and software, and perhaps most of all for the producers of the
new communications processors.<BR>
<BR>
For all the elegance of the Tiger system, however, Gates understands that
it cannot achieve its goals within the constraints of Moore's Law in the
semiconductor industry. The vision of &quot;any high school dropout buying
PCs and entering the interactive TV business&quot; cannot prevail if it
takes a supercomputer to compress the images and an array of special-purpose
processors to decode, decrypt and decompress them. Facing an ATM streams
of 622 megabits per second--perhaps uncompressed video, 3-D or multimedia
images--Eric Schmidt points out, a 100 mips Pentium machine would have to
process 1.47 million 53-byte cells a second. That means well under 100 instruction
cycles to read, store, display and analyze a packet. Since most computers
use many cycles for hidden background tasks, the Pentium could not begin
to do the job. Gate's adoption of Tiger, his alliance with TCI, his investments
in Teledesic, Metricom, and MicroUnity, all bring home face-to-face with
the limits of current computer technology in confronting the telecosm. With
MicroUnity, however, he may have arrived at a solution just in time.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity seems like a throwback to the early years of Silicon Valley,
when all things seemed possible--when Robert Widlar could invent a new product
for National Semiconductor on the beach in Puerto Vallarta, and develop
a new process to build it with David Talbert and his wife Dolores over beers
on a bench at the Wagon Wheel. It was an era when scores of semiconductor
companies were racing down the learning curve to enhance the speed and functions
of electronic devices. Most of all, the MicroUnity project is a climactic
episode in the long saga of the industry's struggle between two strategies
for accelerating the switching speeds in computers.<BR>
<H4>A New Moore's Law?</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel Chairman Gordon Moore recently promulgated a new Moore's Law, supposedly
deflecting the course of the old Moore's Law, which ordains that chip densities
double every 18 months. The new law is that the costs of a chip factory
double with each generation of microprocessor. Moore speculated that these
capital burdens might deter or suppress the necessary investment to continue
the pace of advance in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Gerhard (&quot;Gerry&quot;) Parker, Intel's chief technical officer, however,
presents contrary evidence. The cost for each new structure may be approximately
doubling as Moore says. But the cost per transistor--and thus the cost per
computer function--continues to drop by a factor of between three and four
every three years. Not only does the number of transistors on a chip rise
by a factor of four, but the number of chips sold doubles with every generation
of microprocessor, as the personal computer market doubles every three years.
Thus there will be some eight times more transistors sold by Intel from
a Pentium fab that from a 486 fab. At merely twice the cost, the new fab
seems a bargain.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Intel gets paid not for transistors but for computer functions.
To realize the benefits of the new fabs, therefore, Intel must deliver new
computer functions that successfully adapt to the era of bandwidth abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it is worth noting that measured in telecosmic terms of useful
terabits per second of bandwidth, a MicroUnity fab ultimately costing some
$ 150 million might generate more added value than a $ 2 billion megafab
of Intel.<BR>
<H4>Return to Low and Slow</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since as a general rule, the more the power, the faster the switch, you
can get speed by using high-powered or exotic individual components. It
is an approach that worked well for years at Cray, IBM, NEC and other supercomputer
vendors. Wire together superfast switches and you will get a superfast machine.<BR>
<BR>
The other choice for speed is to use low-powered, slow switches. You make
them so small and jam them so close together, the signals get to their destinations
nearly as fast as the high-powered signals. This approach works well in
the microprocessor industry and in the human brain.<BR>
<BR>
Despite occasional deviations at Cray and IBM, low and slow has been the
secret of all success in semiconductors from the outset. Inventor William
Shockley substituted slow, low-powered transistors for faster, high-powered
vacuum tubes. Gordon Teal at Texas Instruments replaced fast germanium with
slower silicon. Jean Hoerni at Fairchild spurned the fast track of mountainous
Mesa transistors to adopt a flat &quot;planar&quot; technology in which
devices were implanted below the surface of the chip. Jack Kilby and Robert
Noyce then substituted slow resistors and capacitors as well as slow transistors
on integrated circuits for faster, high-powered devices on modules and printed
circuit boards. Federico Faggin made possible the microprocessor by replacing
fast metal gates on transistors with slow gates made of polysilicon. Frank
Wanlass and others replaced faster NMOS and PMOS technologies with the 1,000
times slower and 10 times lower-power Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors
(CMOS) that now rule the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Low and slow finds its roots in the very physics of solid state, separating
the microcosm from the macrocosm. Chips consist of complex patterns of wires
and switches. In the macrocosm of electromechanics, wires were simple, fast,
cool, reliable and virtually free; switches were vacuum tubes, complex,
fragile, hot and expensive. In the macrocosm, the rule was economize on
switches, squander on wires. But in the microcosm, all these rules of electromechanics
collapsed.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, switches are almost free--a few millionths of a cent.
Wires are the problem. However fast they may be, longer wires laid down
on the chip and more wires connected to it translated directly into greater
resistance and capacitance and more needed power and resulting heat. These
problems become exponentially more acute as wire diameters drop. On the
other hand, the shorter the wires the purer the signal and the smaller the
resistance, capacitance and heat.<BR>
<BR>
This fact of physics is the heart of microelectronics. As electron movements
approach their mean free path-- he distance they can travel &quot;ballistically&quot;
without bouncing off the internal atomic structure of the silicon--they
get faster, cheaper and cooler.<BR>
<BR>
At the quantum level, noise plummets and bandwidth explodes. Tunneling electrons,
the fastest of all, emit virtually no heat at all. It was a new quantum
paradox; the smaller the space the more the room, the narrower the switches
the broader the bandwidth, the faster the transport the lower the noise.
As transistors are jammed more closely together, the power delay product--the
crucial index of semiconductor performance combining switching delays with
heat emission--improves as the square of the number of transistors on a
single chip.<BR>
<BR>
Since the breakthrough to CMOS in the early 1980s, however, the industry
has been slipping away from the low and slow regime. Falling for the electromechanical
temptation, they are substituting fast metals for slow polysilicon. For
better performance, companies are increasingly turning to gallium arsenide
and silicon germanium technologies. Semiconductor engineers are increasingly
crowding the surface of CMOS with as many as four layers of fast aluminum
wires, with tungsten now in fashion among the speed freaks of the industry
. The planar chips that built Silicon Valley have given way to high sierras
of metal, interlarded with uneven spreads of silicon dioxide and other insulators.
Meanwhile, the power used on each chip is rising rapidly, since the increasing
number of transistors and layers of metal nullify a belated move to three-volt
operation from the five volts adopted with Transistor Transistor Logic in
1971. And as the industry loses touch with its early inspiration of low
and slow, the costs of wafer fabrication continue to rise--to an extent
that even demoralizes Gordon Moore.<BR>
<BR>
In radically transforming the methods of semiconductor fabrication, John
Moussouris and James (&quot;Al&quot;) Matthews, MicroUnity's director of
technology, seem to many observers to be embarking on a reckless and self-defeating
course. But MicroUnity is betting on the redemptive paradoxes of the microcosm.
Returning to low and slow, Moussouris and Matthews promise to increase peak
clock speeds by a factor of five in the next two years and chip performance
by factors of several hundred, launching communications chips in 1995 that
function at 1.2 gigahertz and perform as many as 400 gigabits per second.<BR>
<H4>Matthews and Mead</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In pursuing this renewal of wafer fabrication at MicroUnity, Matthews has
applied for some 70 patents and won about 20 to date. A veteran of Hewlett-Packard's
bipolar process labs who moved to Intel in the early 1980s and spearheaded
Intel's switch to CMOS for the 386 microprocessor, Matthews has also worked
as an engineer at HP-Avantek's gallium arsenide fabs for microwave chips.
Commanding experience in diverse fab cultures, Matthews thus escapes the
cognitive trap of seeing the established regime as a given, rather than
a choice.<BR>
<BR>
At Aventek, Matthews plunged toward the microcosm and prepared the way for
his MicroUnity process after reading an early paper by Carver Mead, the
inventor of the gallium arsenide MESFET transistor. Mead had prophesied
that the behavior of these transistors would deteriorate drastically if
the feature sizes were pushed below two-tenths of a micron at particular
doping levels (technically impossible at the time). In the mid-1980s, though,
Matthews noticed that these feature sizes were then feasible. Testing the
Mead thesis, he was startled to discover that far from deteriorating below
the Mead threshold, these transistors instead showed &quot;startlingly anomalous
levels of good behavior,&quot; marked by high gain and plummeting noise.<BR>
<BR>
Based on this discovery, he created a low-noise, gigahertz-frequency amplifier
for satellite dishes being sold in the European market. Matthew's process
reduced the cost so drastically that Sony officials were said to be contemplating
claims of dumping. Avantek was charging a few dollars for microwave frequency
chips that cost Sony perhaps some hundreds of dollars to make.<BR>
<BR>
Having discovered the &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot; of gallium arsenide
devices pushed beyond the theoretical limits, Matthews at MicroUnity decided
to experiment with bipolar devices. Bipolar devices are usually used at
high power levels with so-called emitter coupled logic to achieve high speeds
in supercomputers and other advanced machines. Inspired by his breakthrough
with gallium arsenide, Matthews believed that biopolar performance also
might be radically different at extremely low power--under half a volt and
at gate lengths approaching the so-called Debye limit, near one-tenth of
a micron.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, Matthews was startled by &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot;
as processes approached the quantum mechanical threshold. It turned out
that at high frequencies biopolar transistors use far less power even the
CMOS transistors, famous for their low-power characteristics. At these radio-frequency
speeds, however, he discovered that the transistors could not operate with
aluminum wires insulated by oxide. Therefore, he introduced a technique
he had used with fast bipolar and gallium arsenide devices: gold wires insulated
by air. Replacing oxide insulators with &quot;air bridges&quot; drastically
reduces the capacitance of the wires and allows the transistor to operate
at speeds impossible with conventional device structures.<BR>
<BR>
With these adventures in the microcosm behind him, Matthews was ready to
develop a new process and technology for MicroUnity. Based on combining
the best features of biopolar and CMOS at radially small geometries, the
new technology uses bipolar logic functioning at gigahertz clock speeds,
with CMOS retained chiefly for memory cells and with gold air bridges for
the metalization layers. Perhaps it is a portent that the gold wires across
the top of the chip repeat the most controversial feature of Jack Kilby's
original integrated circuit. (Matthews is also seeking patents for methods
of using optical communications on the top of a silicon chip).<BR>
<BR>
In essence, Matthews is returning to low and slow. He is shearing off the
sierras of metal and oxides and restoring the planar surfaces of Jean Hoerni.
Because the surface is flat to a tolerance of one-tenth of a micron, photolithography
gear can function at higher resolution despite a narrow depth of field.
Elimination of the aluminum sierras also removes a major source of parasitic
currents and transistors and allows smaller polysilicon devices to be implanted
closer together. A major gain from these innovations is a drastic move to
lower power transistors. Rather than using the usual three volts or five
volts, the MicroUnity devices operate at 0.3 volts to 0.5 volts (300 to
500 millivolts). In the microcosm, smaller devices closer together at lower
power is the secret of speed.<BR>
<BR>
Although MicroUnity will not divulge the details of future products, ASAP
calculates on the basis of information from other sources that the MicroUnity
chip can hold more than 10 million transistors in a space half the size
of a Pentium with three million transistors. With lower power transistors
set closer together, the MicroUnity chip can operate with a clock rate as
much as 10 times faster than most current microprocessors and at an overall
data rate more than 100 times faster. Low and slow results in blazing speed.<BR>
<BR>
For ordinary microprocessor applications, an ultrafast clock is superfluous.
Since ordinary memory technology is falling ever farther behind processor
speeds, fast clocks mean complex arrangements of cache on cache of fast
static RAM and specialized video memory chips. By using the MicroUnity technology
at the relatively slow clock rates of a Pentium, MicroUnity might be able
to produce Pentiums that use from five to 10 times less power--enabling
new generations of portable equipment.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity, however, is not building a CPU but a communications processor.
In the communications world, the fast clock rate gives the &quot;mediaprocessor&quot;
the ability to couple to broadband pipes using high radio frequencies. Most
crucially, the mediaprocessor can connect to the radio frequency transmissions
over cable coax.<BR>
<BR>
Along with Bill Gates, one of the leading enthusiasts of MicroUnity is John
Malone, who for the last year has been celebrating its potential to create
a &quot;Cray on a tray&quot; for his set-top boxes and cable modems. For
the rest of this decade, most Americans will be able to connect to broadband
networks only over cable coax. Thus the link of TCI to MicroUnity and to
Tiger offers the best promise of an information infrastructure over the
next five years, affording a potential increase in bandwidth of 250,000-fold
over the current four-kilohertz telephone wires.<BR>
<BR>
The Regional Bell Operating Companies and the cable companies agree that
cable coax is the optimal broadband conduit to homes and that fiber optics
is the best technology for connecting central switches or headends to neighborhoods.
Looping through communities, with a short drop at each home--rather than
running a separate wire from the central office to every household--hybrid
fiber-coax networks, according to a Pacific Bell study can reduce the cost
of setup and maintenance of connections by some 75% and cut back the need
for wire by a factor of 600.<BR>
<BR>
In order to bring broadband video to homes, companies must collaborate with
the cable TV industry. Collaborating with TCI, Microsoft once again has
chosen the correct technology to leverage. With Digital Equipment, Zenith
and Intel all engaged in alliances for the creation of cable modems--and
several other companies announcing cable modem projects--Gates may well
be leading the pack in transforming his company from a computer company
into a communications concern, from the microcosm into the telecosm.<BR>

<BR>
All the bandwidth in the world, however, will get you nowhere if your transceiver
cannot process it. By returning to the inspiration of the original Silicon
Valley, MicroUnity offers a promising route to the communications infrastructure
of the next century, overthrowing Moore's Law and issuing the first fundamental
challenge to Moore's company. As Al Matthews puts it: &quot;Bob Noyce [the
late Intel founder with Gordon Moore] is my hero. But there is a new generation
at hand in Silicon Valley today, and this generation is doing things that
Bob Noyce never dreamed of.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Moussouris promises to deliver 10,000 mediaprocessors for set-top boxes
in 1995. As everyone agrees, this is a high-risk project (although Bill
Gates favorably compares MicroUnity's risk to his other gamble, Teledesic).
Even if it takes years for MicroUnity to reach its telecosmic millennium,
the advance of communications processors continues to accelerate. Already
available today, for example, is Texas Instruments' MVP system--the first
full-fledged mediaprocessor on one chip. It will function at a mere 30 to
50 megahertz but performs between two and three billion signal processing
steps per second or roughly between 1,000 and 1,500 DSP mips. Rather than
revving up the clock to gigahertz frenzies, TI gained its performance through
a Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data approach associated with the massively
parallel supercomputer industry. The MVP combines four 64-bit digital signal
processors with a 32-bit RISC CPU, a floating point unit, two video controllers,
64 kilobytes of static RAM cache and a 64-bit direct memory access controller--all
on one sliver of silicon, costing some $ 232 per thousand mips in 1995,
when Pentiums will give you a hundred mips for perhaps twice as much.<BR>
<BR>
This does not favor the notion that microprocessors will soon &quot;suck
in&quot; DSPs. DSP mips and computer mips are different animals. As DSP
guru Will Strauss points out, &quot;As a rule of thumb, a microprocessor
mips rating must be divided by about five to get a DSP mips rating.&quot;
To equal an MVP for DSP operations, a microprocessor would have to achieve
some 5,000 mips.<BR>
<BR>
Designed with the aid of teleconferencing company VTEL and Sony, the MVP
chip can simultaneously encode or decode video using any favored compression
scheme, process audio, faxes or input from a scanner and perform speech
recognition or other pattern-matching algorithms. While Intel and Hewlett-Packard
have been winning most of the headlines for their new RISC processing alliance,
the key development in the microprocessor domain is the emergence of this
new class of one-chip multimedia communications systems.<BR>
<BR>
One thing is certain. Over the next decade, computer speeds will rise about
a hundredfold, while bandwidth increases a thousandfold or more. Under these
circumstances, the winners will be the companies that learn to use bandwidth
as a substitute for computer processing and switching. The winners will
be the companies that most truly embrace the Sun slogan: &quot;The network
is the computer.&quot; As Schmidt predicts, over the next few years &quot;the
value-added of the network will so exceed the value-added of the CPU that
your future computer will be rated not in mips but in gigabits per second.
Bragging rights will go not to the person with the fastest CPU but to the
person with the fastest network--and associated database lookup, browsing
and information retrieval engines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm will eclipse the law of the microcosm as the driving
force of progress. Springing from the exponential improvement in the power
delay product as transistors are made smaller, the law of the microcosm
holds that if you take any number (N) transistors and put them on a single
sliver of silicon you will get N squared performance and value. Conceived
by Robert Metcalfe, inventor of the Ethernet, the law of the telecosm holds
that if you take any number (n) computers and link them in networks, you
get n squared performance and value. Thus the telecosm builds on and compounds
the microcosmic law. The power of Tiger, MicroUnity and TCI comes from fusing
the two laws into a gathering tide of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
With network technology advancing 10 times as fast as central processors,
the network and its nodes will become increasingly central while CPUs become
increasingly peripheral. Faced with a CPU bottleneck, multimedia systems
will simply bypass the CPU on broadband pipes. Circumventing Amdahl's Law,
system designers will adapt their architectures to exploit the high bandwidth
components, such as mediaprocessors, ATM switches and fiber links. In time
the microprocessor will become a vestigial link to the legacy systems such
as word processing and spreadsheets that once defined the machine. All of
this means that while the last two decades have been the epoch of the computer
industry, the next two decades will belong to the suppliers of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The chief beneficiaries of all this invention, however, will be the people
of the world, ascending to new pinnacles of prosperity in an Information
Age. Although many observers fear that these new tools will chiefly aid
the existing rich--or the educated and smart--these technologies have already
brought prosperity to a billion Asians, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia
and China, previously mired in penury.<BR>
<BR>
Communications bandwidth is not only the secret of electronic progress.
It is also the heart of economic growth, stretching the webs of interconnection
that extend the reach of markets and the realms of opportunity. Lavishing
the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly productive
tools and unleashing creativity with increasingly fertile and targeted capital,
the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope to the masses of people
whom the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>

&quot;They'll Be Crowding The Skies.&quot;
</B></PRE>
THUS STEVEN DORFMAN, president of telecommunications and space operations
for GM Hughes_the colossus of the satellite industry_warned the world of
a new peril in the skies. Planning to launch 840 satellites in low earth
orbits, at an altitude of some 435 miles, were a gang of cellular phone
jocks and computer hackers from Seattle going under the name of Teledesic.
Led by Craig McCaw and Bill Gates, they were barging onto his turf and threatening
to ruin the neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
You get the image of the heavens darkening and a new Ice Age looming as
more and more of this low-orbit junk_including a total of some 1,200 satellites
from Motorola's Iridium, Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar and Teledesic, among
other LEO projects_accumulates in the skies. Ultimately, from this point
of view, you might imagine the clutter of LEOs eclipsing the geostationary
orbit itself, the so-called Clarke belt, some 21,000 miles farther out.
Named after science-fiction guru Arthur C. Clarke, the geostationary orbit
is the girdle and firmament of the Hughes empire.<BR>
<BR>
In an article in Wireless magazine in 1945, Clarke first predicted that
satellites in orbit 22,282 miles (35,860 kilometers) above the equator,
where the period of revolution is 24 hours, could maintain a constant elevation
and angle from any point on Earth. In such a fixed orbit, a device could
remain for decades, receiving signals from a transmitter on the earth and
radiating them back across continents.<BR>
<BR>
The Clarke orbit also posed a problem, however_the reverse square law for
signal power. Signals in space attenuate in proportion to the square of
the distance they travel. This means that communications with satellites
22,000 miles away typically require large antenna dishes (as much as 10
meters wide) or megawatts of focused beam power.<BR>
<BR>
Now, however, a new satellite industry is emerging, based on gains in computer
and microchip technology. These advances allow the use of compact handsets
with small smart antennas that can track low earth orbit satellites sweeping
across the skies at a speed of 25,000 kilometers an hour at a variety of
altitudes between 500 and 1,400 kilometers above the earth. Roughly 60 times
nearer than geostationary satellites, LEOs find the inverse square law working
in their favor, allowing them to offer far more capacity, cheaper and smaller
antennas, or some combination of both. Breaking out of the Clarke orbit,
these systems vastly expand the total available room for space-based communications
gear.<BR>
<BR>
It is indeed possible to &quot;crowd&quot; the Clarke belt_a relatively
narrow swath at a single altitude directly above the equator. But even this
swath does not become physically congested; collisions are no problem. The
Clarke belt becomes crowded because the ability of antennas on the ground
to discriminate among satellites is limited by the size of the antenna.
Spaceway and Teledesic both plan to use the Ka band of frequencies, between
17 gigahertz and 30 gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second. In this
band, reasonably sized antennas 66 centimeters wide can distinguish between
geostationary satellites two degrees apart. That's some 800 miles in the
Clarke belt. Thus no physical crowding. But it means that there are only
a total of 180 Clarke slots for Ka band devices, including undesirable space
over oceans.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs, however, can be launched anywhere between the earth's atmosphere and
a layer of intense radiation called the Van Allen Belt. The very concept
of crowding becomes absurd in this 900 kilometer span of elevations for
moving orbits that can be 500 meters apart or less. Thus the 21 proposed
orbital planes of Teledesic occupy a total of 10 kilometers of altitude.
At this rate, 70 or more Teledesic systems, comprising some 65,000 satellites,
could comfortably fit in low earth orbits.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, it was clear that the LEOs, one way or another, were crowding
Hughes. Hughes commands satellite systems or projects that compete with
every one of the LEOs. Hughes responded to the threat of Teledesic by announcing
the expansion of its Spaceway satellite system, then planned for North America
alone, to cover the entire globe. Then, invoking the absolute priority currently
granted geostationary systems, Hughes asked the Federal Communications Commission
to block Teledesic entirely by assigning Spaceway the full five gigahertz
of spectrum internationally available in the Ka band.<BR>
<BR>
On May 27, Dorfman summoned the upstarts, Craig McCaw and Teledesic President
Russell Daggatt, to Hughes headquarters in Los Angeles for a talk. Busy
with Microsoft_the Redmond, Wash., company that in 1993 temporarily surpassed
the market value of General Motors_Teledesic partner Bill Gates did not
make the trip. But as the epitome of the personal computer industry, his
presence haunted the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Together with Spaceway chief Kevin McGrath, Dorfman set out to convince
the Seattle venturers to give up their foolhardy scheme and instead join
with Hughes in the nine satellites of Spaceway. Not only could Spaceway's
nine satellites cover the entire globe with the same services that Teledesic's
840 satellites would provide, Spaceway could be expanded incrementally as
demand emerged. Just loft another Hughes satellite. Indeed, Spaceway's ultimate
system envisaged 17 satellites. With &quot;every component proprietary to
Hughes,&quot; as Dorfman said, the satellites only cost some $ 150 million
apiece. By contrast, most of the $ 9 billion Teledesic system would have
to be launched before global services could begin.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the new LEOs marked as decisive a break in the history of space-based
communications as the PC represented in the history of computing. Moreover,
Teledesic would be the only LEO fully focused on serving computers_the first
truly &quot;global Internet,&quot; as McCaw's vice president Tom Alberg
depicted it. It brings space communications at last into the age of ubiquitous
microchip intelligence, and it brings the law of the microcosm into space
communications.<BR>
<BR>
If you enjoyed the New World of Wireless on the ground with its fierce battles
between communications standards, technical geniuses, giant companies, impetuous
entrepreneurs and industrial politicians on three continents_you will relish
the reprise hundreds and even thousands of miles up. Launching Teledesic,
McCaw and Gates were extending bandwidth abundance from earth into space.
Observers, however, often did not like what they heard.

Bad Press For Two Billionaires
</B></PRE>
Every so often, the media is taken by the notion of technology as a morality
tale. In place of a gripping saga of unjustly obscure geniuses enriching
the world by their heroic creativity in the teeth of uncomprehending bureaucrats
and politicians, the media treat technology ventures as a school for scandal.
We have mock exposes of computer hype, monopoly, vaporware, viruses, infoscams,
netporn, securities &quot;fraud&quot; and deviously undocumented software
calls. Pundits gabble endlessly about the gap yawning between the information
rich and the information poor, thus consigning themselves undeniably, amid
many yawns, to the latter category. While American market share climbs near
70% in computers, networks, software and leading-edge semiconductors, analysts
furrow the brows of the Atlantic Monthly with tales of farseeing foreign
teams, spearheaded by visionary government officials, capturing the markets
of American cowboy capitalists. They spiel implausible yams of tough-minded
trade warriors prying open the jaws of Japan for Toys &quot;R&quot; Us,
closing down vicious Korean vendors of low-priced dynamic RAMs, or blasting
through barriers to U.S. telecom gear in the Tokyo-Osaka corridor, saving
the day for Motorola's soon-to-be cobwebbed factories for analog cellular
phones.<BR>
<BR>
One of these sagas began early this year with two Seattle billionaires,
McCaw and Gates, allegedly boarding McCaw's sleek yacht and going on an
ego trip. With McCaw pitching in an early nickel, and the boat, and Gates
hoisting his name as a sail, the two tycoons seemed to sweep away from the
shores of rationality, as the media told it, into a sea of microwaves and
arsenic. Spinning out Teledesic to build an information superhighway in
the sky, they proposed to strew the heavens with 840 satellites, plus 84
spares. All would whirl around the world at a height of 700 kilometers (435
miles), using what they told the FCC would be some 500 million gallium arsenide
microchips to issue frequencies between 20 and 60 gigahertz from some 180,000
phased-array antennas. The entire project seemed suffused with gigahertz
and gigabucks. &quot;We're bandwidth bulls,&quot; says Teledesic President
Daggatt.<BR>
<BR>
In case the hype of the sponsors failed to keep the system radiant and aloft,
fueling it also would be a total of 12,000 batteries fed by thin film solar
collectors stretching out behind the satellite &quot;birds&quot; in some
130 square kilometers of gossamer wings. Working at 4% efficiency, these
cells would collectively generate 10 megawatts of power, enough to light
a small city, but, so the critics said, insufficient to reach Seattle at
microwave frequencies in the rain. (The Teledesic frequencies are readily
absorbed by water in the air). To manage the elaborate mesh of fast-packet
communications among the satellites and ground terminals, the constellation
would bear some 282,000 Mips, or millions of instructions per second, of
radiation-hard microprocessors and a trillion bytes or so of rad-hard RAM.
In effect, Teledesic would be launching into space one of the world's largest
and most expensive massively parallel computer systems.<BR>
<BR>
At a mere $ 9 billion, to be put up by interested investors, Teledesic's
lawyers told the FCC, the price would be a bargain for the U.S. and the
world. (By contrast, current plans call for $ 15 billion just to lay fiber
for interactive TV in California). But former Motorola, now Kodak, chief
George Fisher fresh from pondering numbers for the apparently similar Iridium
projects_suggested that $ 40 billion for Teledesic would be more like it.
(Teledesic had the improbable result of making Iridium's 66-satellite plan,
greeted in 1990 with much of the scorn now lavished on Teledesic, seem modest).
Just rocketing the 840 satellites into orbit was said to entail a successful
launch every week for a year and a half at a time when hoisting satellites
is still a precarious and sometime thing.<BR>
<BR>
Even if Teledesic succeeded in getting the things up, so other scientists
suggested, the satellites would then be impaled on some 7,000 pieces of
space debris in the chosen orbits. In any case, so it was widely reported,
10% would fail every year, some tumbling out of orbit, others joining the
whirl of litter, where they would fly ready to impale the remainder of the
satellites and the remnants of the two billionaires' reputations.<BR>
<BR>
Surely these sages know that by the year 2001, when the systems would be
up and running, the world will be swimming in the bandwidth of &quot;information
superhighways.&quot; Why support this lavish launch of technology for a
communications system that would be dwarfed by capabilities already demonstrated
on the ground?<BR>
<BR>
Summing up a near-consensus of critics, John Pike, director of the Federation
of American Scientists' Space Policy Project, declared to the Wall Street
Journal, &quot;God save us. It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of!&quot;
Provoking Pike may have been the origins of the multisatellite architecture
in the Star Wars &quot;brilliant pebbles&quot; program. Teledesic's most
amazing achievement to date has been to displace the Strategic Defense Initiative
as Pike's peak example of stupidity.<BR>
<BR>
While McCaw and Gates could be dismissed as tyros in the satellite field,
Hughes is world champion. Since 1963, the company has put 107 communications
satellites into orbit. With 19 in 1994, this year should be its biggest
ever. In 1993, well before the Teledesic announcement, Dorfman announced
the first version of Spaceway_a $ 660 million, two-satellite system offering
voice, data and video services_as a contribution to &quot;information superhighways.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of all the terrestrial uproar surrounding superhighwaymen Al
Gore, John Malone of TCI, Raymond Smith of Bell Atlantic and scores of other
telco and cable magnates, however, no one paid much attention to Hughes.<BR>
<BR>
Then came Gates and McCaw with Teledesic and claims of 20 million potential
subscribers, two million simultaneous connections, billion-bit-per-second
&quot;gigalinks,&quot; bandwidth on demand and an array of other features,
all advertised at a cost for Spaceway-type services nearly three times lower
per bit per second. Everyone noticed Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of July, though, Hughes raised the stakes. With successful launches
under way in China, Brazil and French Guiana to provide exclamation points,
Hughes made a new submission to the FCC, extending Spaceway into a nine-satellite
global system costing $ 3.2 billion. McGrath plausibly claimed it could
be in place long before Teledesic and offer nearly all its functionality
at a third of the price.<BR>
<BR>
Already planned to be in place by 1998, however, were several other LEO
projects, led by Motorola's Iridium and Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar. As
mobile phone projects, these systems could not readily offer service at
T-1 data rates. But their sponsors promised availability for simple E-mail,
faxes and paging.<BR>
<BR>
By mid-1994, Motorola seemed to command the financial momentum. The company
succeeded in raising some $ 800 million in equity investments from companies
around the globe, including Lockheed and Raytheon (which would build the
satellites), Great Wall of China and Khrunichev Enterprises of Russia (which
together would launch a third of them), the Mawarid Group of Saudi Arabia
(which pitched in $ 120 million) and Kyocera, Mitsui and DDI, which together
put up another $ 120 million (Kyocera will build the dual mode handsets
for Japan and DDI will sell and service them). On August 10, an Indian consortium
purchased a 5% stake and a seat on the board for $ 38 million. Motorola
claimed its share of the equity was dropping to 28.5%, well on the way to
the company's final target of 15%. Motorola estimates that much of the additional
$ 2 billion in the plan could come from debt securities and loans.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium's attractions are impressive. It provides ubiquitous global phone
service at a premium price with little or no dependence on local terrestrial
facilities. In times of disaster or political crisis, or in places with
sparse or unreliable local service, the system can route calls among the
66 satellites in space bypassing all infrastructure on the ground. For an
elite of government officials and corporate figures operating in remote
areas, the availability of Iridium should be worth the money. A bold and
visionary concept when it emerged in 1987 from a team in the company's satellite
systems engineering group, it endows many regions of the earth with voice
and limited data communications for the first time. For example, it actually
focuses on polar domains, such as parts of Siberia, poorly served by other
satellite systems. Kazuo Inamori, the venerable chairman of Kyocera, also
believes that Iridium will be popular in the 60% of territorial Japan not
currently covered by cellular. 
<PRE>
<B>

&quot;Give Us Spectrum, Let Others Fight&quot;

</B></PRE>
None-the-less, beyond the bold and ingenious concept (Daggatt calls Iridium
&quot;the real pioneer of LEOs&quot;), the system suffers from technical
flaws. Were it not for Globalstar, perhaps these flaws would not have become
evident until alter the 66 birds were aloft. A far simpler and cheaper solution,
Globalstar uses 48 satellites with no links between them. Each functions
as a &quot;bent pipe&quot; transponder, receiving signals from a phone on
the ground and passing them back to any gateway within the satellite's 1,500-mile-wide
footprint, linked to locally available telephone networks. Because Globalstar
uses local phone systems rather than bypassing them, the system has been
able to raise a total of some $ 300 million in support from Alcatel, France
Telecom, Vodafone (serving the United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong),
Airtouch-U S West, Hyundai and DACOM in Korea, Deutsche Aerospace and Alenia.<BR>
<BR>
This amount may seem small beside the billion raised by Iridium. But Globalstar
has capital costs (at $ 1.8 billion) one-half Iridium's, circuit costs one-third
Iridium's, and terminal costs (at $ 750 each) one-fourth Iridium's. With
no intelligence in space, Globalstar relies entirely on the advance of intelligent
phones and portable computer devices on the ground; it is the Ethernet of
satellite architectures. Costing one-half as much as Iridium, it will handle
nearly 20 times more calls.<BR>
<BR>
The advantages of Globalstar stem only partly from its avoidance of complex
intersatellite connections and use of infrastructure already in place on
the ground. More important is its avoidance of exclusive spectrum assignments.
Originating several years before spread-spectrum technology was thoroughly
tested for cellular phones, Iridium employs time division multiple access,
an obsolescent system that requires exclusive command of spectrum but offers
far less capacity than code division multiple access.<BR>
<BR>
Like conventional cellular or radio transmissions that differentiate signals
by time slot or frequency, TDMA sharply restricts the reuse of spectrum
in nearby cells. By contrast, CDMA is a form of spread-spectrum communications
that differentiates signals by a spreading code and allows the use of the
same frequencies all the time, everywhere. Just as you can reduplicate wireline
spectrum merely by laying another fiber, you can now manufacture new spectrum
in the air merely by breaking large cells into smaller ones.<BR>
<BR>
Among some six companies seeking low earth orbit satellite approval from
the FCC in 1993, only Iridium used TDMA, requiring national and international
bodies to pick it as a winner from the outset and assign it exclusive spectrum.
By contrast, in a majority report issued to the FCC on April 6, 1993, CDMA
companies in the U.S., including TRW, Loral-Qualcomm, Celsat and American
Mobile Satellite, could all agree to share spectrum and let the market choose
winners. A Motorola lawyer explained to Space News, &quot;Give us the spectrum
and let the others fight for whatever's left.&quot; In the face of alternatives
with no need for exclusive spectrum allocations, Iridium could fly only
if it offered radically superior performance or capacity. But TDMA dooms
it to generally inferior performance and capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike TDMA systems, which can &quot;see&quot; only one satellite signal
at a time, CDMA handsets have &quot;path&quot; diversity, using &quot;rake
receivers&quot; that can combine a number of weak signals into an intelligible
stream. Iridium and other TDMA systems compensate by using more power. But
no practical amount of power can propel a satellite signal through a tin
roof. And excess power means larger handsets or heavier satellites. Iridium
satellites together use 80% more power than Globalstar's, yet employ antennas
nearly twice as large and offer 18.2 times less capacity per unit area.
<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic also suffers from the use of TDMA. But Teledesic's T-1 capabilities
would compensate with 100,000 times more bandwidth and with a bit error
rate that can accommodate the new fiber standards such as SONET-ATM (synchronous
optical network/asynchronous transfer mode), which send packets without
retransmission. The issue is whether these features can justify the political,
financial, and performance costs of using a modulation scheme_TDMA_that
severely limits spectrum sharing and path diversity.<BR>
<BR>
So what is this, another saga of hubris on the information super-highway_to
go with the Raymond Smith-John Malone follies? Perhaps good new ideas are
harder to come by as company revenues grow into the billions, and Gates
and McCaw disinvest and diversify as fast as they can from their increasingly
cumbrous vessels of wealth. Having recently passed the billion-dollar mark
in his systematic process of disinvestment from Microsoft_he retains $ 8
billion or so_Gates at times seemed embarrassed by his link to this gigantic
project. He told us it was too early to write about Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
No, the story is in fact more interesting. Impelled by the onrushing rise
in the cost-effectiveness of individual chips compared to multichip systems,
the Law of the Microcosm dictates decentralization of all information architectures.
During the 1980s, this centrifuge struck the mainframe computer establishment
of IBM. During the 1990s, the personal teleputer, summoning and shaping
films and files of images from around the world, will collide with the centralized
establishments of TV broadcasting. At the end of the century, Teledesic
and the other LEOs will usher in the age of decentralization in space.<BR>
<BR>
From this point of view, Gates' participation becomes more readily intelligible.
Gates seems always to follow the microcosm wherever it leads. A vision of
software for decentralized systems of personal computers informs everything
Microsoft does. <BR>
<BR>
In 1994, for example, Microsoft made an investment in Metricom, a wireless
terrestrial system that supplies links of up to 56 kilobits per second to
portable computers or personal digital assistants. Within cells, the devices
can communicate directly with one another; outside the cell, Metricom routes
its calls through an expandable mesh of nodes each the size of a shoebox
and costing less than $ 1,000. Based on spread-spectrum technology, the
system operates at power levels low enough to avoid the need for FCC licenses.
Yet it can be expanded to metropolitan-area dimensions.<BR>
<BR>
In many respects, Teledesic is Metricom in the sky. It is focused on computer
communications. It routes packets by the most convenient path through a
mesh of nodes. It is based on microprocessor technology. (Both Teledesic
and Metricom plan to employ devices from Motorola's 68000 family). As Gates
explains the system: &quot;Some functions are most efficiently performed
by large numbers of small processors working together, rather than a few
large ones.&quot; The entire new generation of low earth orbit satellite
systems relies on this centrifugal force of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
It was not supposed to happen this way. Just as Grosch's Law of the computer
industry implied that computer power rose by the square of the cost, there
was a similar law of the satellite industry that held satellite efficiency
to be proportional to see. In a popular text, &quot;Communications Satellite
Systems,&quot; published in 1978, James Martin cited an AT&T study showing
that just six satellites could carry all the long-distance traffic from
the American continent; no fiber optics would be necessary. &quot;The next
major thrust in the space segment should capitalize on the economies of
scale which today's technology offers,&quot; wrote Martin, urging creation
of &quot;massive hardware&quot; as heavy as several tons and &quot;immensely
powerful satellites with large antennas beaming as much information as we
are capable of using to our rooftops.&quot; Many satellite advocates, led
by Arthur C. Clarke, viewed with impatient scorn the expensive terrestrial
systems that somehow forestalled the manifest destiny of big birds to rule
the world of communications. 
<PRE>
<B>

Bringing The Microcosm To Space
</B></PRE>
In 1994, the big bird dream still flourishes in Spaceway, the international
consortium Inmarsat, and the new launch this summer of direct broadcast
satellite technology by Hughes's DirecTV, Hubbard's USSB, TCI's Primestar,
and Rupert Murdoch's imperial systems in Europe and Asia. Using centralized
satellites in geosynchronous orbits, DBS is the ultimate broadcast medium,
reaching billions of potential customers at the cost of reaching hundreds
of thousands through cable-TV systems. But these geostationary satellite
systems suffer from the same flaws as mainframes: sclerosis by centralization.
At a time when customers want the choice, control, convenience and interactivity
of computers, the big birds offer one-size-fits-all programming at specified
times, with little ability to control the flow or interact with it.<BR>
<BR>
The real showstopper in the long run, though, is a nagging half-second time
delay for Clarke orbit signals. Bad enough for voice, a half-second is near
eternity for computer communications; for the living-room and desktop supercomputers
of 2001, a half-second delay would mean gigabytes of information to be stored
in buffers. While companies across the country, from Intel to Digital Equipment,
are rushing to market with cable modems to allow computer connections to
CATV coax, geosatellites remain mostly computer-hostile. Even with the new
digital cosmetics of DBS, geosynchronous satellites are a last vestige of
centralization in a centrifugal world.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, Teledesic brings the microcosm to space. Rather than gaming
economies of scale from using a few huge satellites, Teledesic gains economies
of scale by launching as many small birds as possible. Based on Peter Huber's
concept of a geodesic network_a mesh of peers equally spaced apart like
the nodes in a geodesic dome_Teledesic is not a hierarchy but a heterarchy.
Distributing the system responsibilities among 840 autonomous satellites
diminishes the requirements, such as message throughput and power usage,
for each one. Building redundancy into the entire constellation, rather
than within each satellite, yields higher overall reliability, while reducing
the complexity and price of each unit.<BR>
<BR>
As Craig McCaw explains, &quot;At a certain point, redundant systems create
more complexity and weight than they are worth. Rather than having each
satellite a 747 in the sky with triply redundant systems, we have hundreds
of satellites that offer self-redundancy.&quot; Eschewing the Hughes philosophy
of &quot;every component proprietary to Hughes,&quot; Teledesic will manufacture
and launch a large number of satellite peers, using off-the-shelf parts
whenever possible. This approach also provides economies of scale that,
according to a study by brilliant pebbles contractor Martin Marietta, could
lower unit costs by a factor of one hundred or more.<BR>
<BR>
Just as microcosmic technology uses infinitesimal low-powered transistors
and puts them so close together that they work faster than large high-powered
transistors, Teledesic satellites follow the rules of low and slow. Rather
than one big powerful bird spraying signals across continents, Teledesic
offers 840, programmably targetable at small localities. Just 435 miles
out, the delay is measured in milliseconds rather than half-seconds.<BR>
<BR>
The total computing power and wattage of the constellation seems large,
as is needed to sustain a volume of some two million connections at a time,
four times Spaceway's capacity. But with other link features equal, between
1,226 and 3,545 times more power is needed to communicate with a geostationary
satellite than with a LEO.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, unlike Iridium, TRW's Odyssey, and Globalstar, Teledesic
from the outset has targeted the fastest- growing market of the future:
communications for the world's 125 million PCs, now growing some 20% a year.
And Teledesic has correctly chosen the technology needed to extend computer
networks globally_broadband low earth orbit satellites. The real issue is
not the future of Teledesic but the future of Iridium.<BR>
<BR>
In the short run Iridium's voice services cannot compete with Globalstar's
cheaper and more robust CDMA system. But in the long run Iridium could be
trumped by Teledesic. Although Teledesic has no such plans, the incremental
cost of incorporating an &quot;L&quot; band transceiver in Teledesic, to
perform the Iridium functions for voice, would be just 10% of Teledesic's
total outlays, or less than $ 1 billion (compared with the $3.4 billion
initial capital costs of Iridium). But 840 linked satellites could offer
far more cost-effective service than Iridium's 66.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium's dilemma is that the complexities and costs of its ingenious mesh
of intersatellite links and switches can be justified only by offering broadband
computer services. Yet Iridium is a doggedly narrowband system focused on
voice.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium eventually will have to adopt Teledesic's broadband logic and architecture.
To protect its global lead in wireless communications and equipment, Motorola
should join with Teledesic now, rather than later. Working with Lockheed,
Motorola is making impressive gains in satellite-manufacturing technology.
Supplying both handsets and space gear for computer networks, Motorola could
turn its huge investment of time, money and prestige in Iridium into a dramatic
global coup in wireless computer services. As part of a broadband system,
Iridium could still become a superb brand name for Motorola. But persisting
in a narrowband strategy in the name of avoiding Teledesic's larger initial
costs, Motorola's executives will end up inflicting serious strategic costs
on the company.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the famous objections to Teledesic are based on ignorance or misinformation.
Launch anxieties spring chiefly from the GEO experience. LEOs are 60 times
nearer and between a tenth and a third the weight. Teledesic satellites
are designed to be hoisted in groups of eight or more. From Great Wall in
China to Khrunichev in Russia, companies around the world will soon be competing
to supply low-cost launching facilities for the system. Orbital Sciences,
an entrepreneurial dervish near Washington's Dulles Airport with some $
190 million in revenues, has developed a low-cost method for lofting groups
of LEOs from an adapted Lockheed 1011 Tristar.<BR>
<BR>
Other fears are similarly fallacious. Teledesic will work fine in the rain
because the high minimum vertical angle (40 degrees) of its satellite links
from the ground reduces the portion of the path exposed to water to a manageable
level. By contrast, geostationary satellites must operate at eight degrees,
passing the signal through a long span of atmosphere. Made of tough new
composite materials, Teledesic satellites will endure the kind of debris
found in space mostly unscathed. The solar arrays can accept holes without
significantly damaging overall performance. All in all, Teledesic's designers
expect the birds to remain in orbit for an average of ten years. With most
of its key technologies plummeting in price along with the rest of electronic
components, the system may well cost even less and perform better than its
business plan promises or George Fisher speculates.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, widely charged with reckless technological presumption, the designers
of Teledesic in fact seem recklessly cautious in their assumptions about
the rate of microchip progress. For example, their dismissal of CDMA assumes
that the high speed of the spreading code functions_requiring digital signal
processors that race at least 100 times the data rate_pushes cheap T-1 performance
far into the future. Yet in early 1995, Texas Instruments will ship its
multimedia video processor, a marvel that combines four 64-bit DSPs, a 32-bit
RISC CPU, 50 kilobytes of on-chip memory, a floating-point unit and a 64bit
direct memory access controller all on one chip. This device now performs
two billion operations per second and, with an upgrade from 35 megahertz
to 50 megahertz clock rate, soon will perform three billion. The estimated
cost in 1995 is around $ 400, or a stunning $ 133 per bop (current Pentiums
charge three times as much for 100 mips). Five years from now, when Teledesic
gets serious, that kind of one-chip computing power can implement CDMA for
broadband data without any cost penalty. Future generations of CDMA systems
may be able to offer, at a dramatically lower price, the same broadband
services in mobile applications that Teledesic now promises for fixed services
only.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming that Teledesic meets the CDMA challenge, the other fear is that
terrestrial systems will capture enough of the market to render Teledesic
unprofitable. This fear, however, can come true only if governments delay
this supremely beneficial system well into the next century.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike the competition, satellite systems can provide global coverage at
once. Whether for $ 9 billion or $ 90 billion, no terrestrial system will
cover the entire world, or even the entire U.S., within decades of Teledesic.
As soon as it is deployed, it will profoundly change the geography and topography
of the globe. Suddenly the most remote rural redoubt, beach, or mountain
will command computer communications comparable to urban corporations today.
The system can make teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine, and teleschooling
possible anywhere. Gone will be the differences among regions in access
to cultural and information resources. People will be able to live and work
where they want rather than where corporations locate them.<BR>
<BR>
This change transforms the dimensions of the world as decisively as trains,
planes, automobiles, phones and TVs changed them in previous eras. It will
extend &quot;universal service&quot; more dramatically than any new law
can.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Teledesic can eliminate the need to cross-subsidize rural customers.
Determining the cost of wire-line services are the parameters of population
density and distance from the central office. Rural customers now cost between
10 and 30 times as much to serve with wires as urban customers do. Teledesic
will bring near-broadband capabilities to everyone in the world at the same
price.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, this expansion of the communications frontier will foster
the very economic development that will fuel the demand for the service.
Today, it does not pay to bring telecommunications to poor countries that
might benefit most. Teledesic and other satellite services break the bottleneck
of development. Simultaneously opening the entire world, it enriches every
nation with new capital exceeding the fruits of all the foreign aid programs
of the era.<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic is a venture worthy of McCaw and Gates. In its impact on the world,
it may even rival the Herculean contributions of its sponsors in cellular
and software. The issue is not the technology or the commitment of the principals.
The issue is the readiness of the U.S. government to accommodate this venture.
Before Teledesic can be approved internationally, it will have to attain
a license from the FCC in the U.S. It has taken four years to approve Iridium.
It took 30 years to approve cellular. How long will it take to approve Teledesic?<BR>
<BR>
Currently Teledesic, Iridium and Globalstar face several political obstacles.
The International Telecommunications Union's Radio Regulation 2613 gives
GEOs absolute priority over LEOs. For Spaceway, Hughes is now demanding
an exclusive license for the full five gigahertz available in the Ka-band
worldwide, leaving no room for Teledesic or any other Ka-band LEO. Under
current law, Hughes or other GEO systems could usurp any LEO that was launched.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs are a major American innovation. The U.S. government should take the
lead now in spearheading a change in the regulations to accommodate LEOs.
This is no minor matter. As the dimensions and promise of Teledesic loom
more starkly, the Japanese or Europeans are certain to make similar proposals.
&quot;When they do,&quot; Craig McCaw predicts, &quot;they will immediately
have their government on board. They will be able to go to the ITU right
away. My greatest fear is that we will have the technology all ready, and
foreign companies will beat us out because they can get their governments
in line.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government was on board for Apollo 25 years ago and the U.S. won
the first space race. This space race is just as important, but the government
is treating it as some sleepy-time infrastructure project. In fact, it is
the information superhighway going global and ubiquitous. It is the ultimate
promise of the information age, says McCaw. 
<PRE>
<B>

Sustaining The U.S. Lead In Technology
</B></PRE>
McCaw explains: &quot;It'll mean ecological disaster if China mimics what
we did_building more and more urban towers and filling them up with people
who queue up every day on turnpikes into the city, emitting fumes into the
air, and then building new towers and new highways when you want to move
the company, and then digging up the highways to install new wires.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McCaw waves toward the window, out at Lake Washington. &quot;Look at that
floating bridge. It took $ 1.5 billion to cross Lake Washington, then it
got busted in a storm. Cross this lake, any lake, any ocean in the world
with broadband wireless. That's the promise of Teledesic. All you do is
to reconfigure the communications in software at zero incremental cost.
No wires for the final connections. It's what we do in Hong Kong and Shanghai,
where everyone uses a cellular phone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton, Vice President Gore and other members of the administration
continually ask what they can do for technology. One thing they can do is
vastly streamline the process for approval of communications projects. At
the moment, Congress is determined to retain bureaucratic dominance over
the most dynamic enterprise and technology in the world economy_what they
like to term the information superhighway. They see it as a possible source
of congressional power, campaign finance, employment and pelf, like the
Baby Bells today or like existing construction projects. Rather than turn
telecom into a vast porkbellied poverty program, however, the administration
should deregulate the field. Communications companies must be permitted
to compete and collaborate wherever the technology leads.<BR>
<BR>
Whether the administration knows it or not, these technologies are its greatest
political asset. The high-tech industries unleashed in the 1980s by venture
capital and junk bonds are now the prime fuel of the economy of the 1990s.
Comprising perhaps 60% of incremental GDP and 48% of exports, the momentous
upsurge of computers and communications is even compensating for the mistakes
of the Bush and Clinton regimes and making plausible Clinton's continuing
claims of economic success. But now Clinton, Gore and FCC Chairman Reed
Hundt must make a choice. If they want to maintain this redemptive U.S.
lead in technology, they must be willing to forge new alliances in Congress
to get the politicians and bureaucrats out of the way of the future. A good
start would be to open the floodgates for the global onrush of low earth
orbit satellites dedicated to computer communications. If they do, they
can help make the world, as McCaw's Alberg puts it, &quot;a truly global
Internet in an ever-expanding ethersphere.&quot; 
<PRE>
<B>
And The Winner Is...
</B></PRE>
Globalstar is the easy winner for current offering of mobile phone services
under a CDMA regime of spectrum sharing. But Teledesic can add phone services
to its broadband computer system. Over time, Teledesic's 840 satellites
will outperform Globalstar's 48. Big question: When will microchip technology
advance enough to allow broadband applications over CDMA? When that happens,
Globalstar has a shot at the grand prize.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium is both too expensive to compete in mobile phones and too narrowband
for data. Today's champ Spaceway is maturing. Big winner for the next decade
is... Teledesic.

<HR><BR>
Big Government and Mass Media always feed on fear of monsters. While politicians
promise to protect the people from the dreaded private sector, leading newspapers
such as the Washington Post and network shows such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;
chime in with continuing reports on the economy as seen from the shores
of Loch Ness. Peering through the shifting, inscrutable murk of the marketplace,
pundits both private and public can descry beneath every ripple of industrial
change the spectral shape of some circling shark or serpent from which only
a new bureaucracy or liberal constabulary can save us.<BR>
<BR>
There are always many witnesses to the threat. In his campaigns of creative
destruction, any great capitalist provokes enough panic in the establishment
to fuel the beadles who would bring him down. Losing competitors, whether
in oil or software, are always in the vanguard of the monster hunt, which
is therefore usually launched in the name of &quot;competition&quot; and
is designed to stop it in its tracks before anyone wins.<BR>
<BR>
In the industrial era it was the so-called Robber Barons--creators of the
great industries of oil, steel and finance--who greased the growth of government
with their chimerical menace. Radically reducing the prices of their products,
such leaders as Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan expanded the economy to
serve middle- and lower-income customers and laid the foundation for the
American industrial leadership that triumphed in two world wars. But at
the same time, charged with predatory pricing, collusive marketing dumping
and other competitive violations, Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan emerged
as the monsters of monopoly who fueled the growth of government through
the first 40 years of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Now, with information technology driving private sector wealth and power,
there is a need for new monsters to fuel new sieges of government and regulatory
growth. This time the monsters bear the names of Milken, Gates and Malone--new
trolls to terrify little children and cause competitors to cozen Washington
and judges to reach for their RICO bludgeons and commissioners to salivate
and shuffle subpoenas and senators to tremble and wreak new tomes of law
and bureaucrats to sow the economy with minefields of abstruse new rules.<BR>
<BR>
Of the three new monsters, big government managed to deliver us first from
Michael Milken, depicted as a Banker Shark. But Milken's vision impregnably
survives in the form of the industries and infrastructures he financed,
chiefly cellular phones, fiber optics and cable television--the forces that
laid the foundation for a new broadband economy.<BR>
<BR>
With Milken laid low by cancer and the courts, Washington needed new monsters
for the 1990s. After serious and continuing contemplation of Bill Gates
as a possible MicroShark hidden amid the mazes of Windows and DOS, Washington
recently has focused on the formidable visage of John Malone.<BR>
<BR>
As the titan of cable and leader of Tele-Communications Inc., better known
as TCI, he was a billion-dollar beneficiary of Milken's bonds. At a time
when governments everywhere covet the huge, new wealth emerging from information
superhighways, Malone has become the favored target of the Loch Ness news
hounds and public-law pinstripes: an Abominable Snowman ranging down from
the Rockies to raid and ruin rival companies, terrorize politicians and
gouge his 21 million customers. Or, in the words of then Senator Albert
Gore, Malone is Darth Vader himself.<BR>
<BR>
This particular monster hunt, however, could not be more ill- timed. There
is no way that this administration can demonize the cable industry and micromanage
telecom without direly damaging all its hopes for an information superhighway
and thus the best prospects for the future of the U.S. economy. Just as
the automobile industry was the real heir to the triumphs of the &quot;robber
barons&quot; in oil, steel and finance, so the computer industry--the core
of U.S. world industrial leadership--will be the chief beneficiary of cable
and telecom ventures in broadband networks.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. now commands global dominance in computer technology. But as Andrew
Grove told Forbes ASAP, &quot;infinite processing power will only get you
so far with limited bandwidth.&quot; The next generation of computer progress
depends upon the efficient use of cable bandwidth to homes and home offices,
which comprise a fist-growing 60 percent of the current market for computers.
Even if computer executives fail to see the threat, the monster hunt against
cable thus jeopardizes the supreme achievement of the American economy over
the last decade--its global lead in computers.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government constantly reiterates its desire for information superhighways.
The problem is that punctuating the call for broadband nets is an insistent
mantra of &quot;competition&quot; that reverberates through the speeches
of nearly all participants in the debate. As Ward White, vice-president
of government affairs for the U.S. Telephone Association, points out, however,
this mantra of competition &quot;disguises a new scheme of market allocation
run by the regulators.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In this competition no one can win or make any money. The $ 10 billion in
profits claimed by the Baby Bells still under the Greene thumb are highly
questionable. Most of their copper wires and narrowband switches--rapidly
obsolescing by any objective standard--are being written off over decades.
That means the real costs of the Bells should be much higher than their
announced costs, which do not adequately reflect the fact that their $ 300
billion worth of plant and equipment is rapidly losing market value. As
TCI's sharp and salty young COO, Brendan Clouston, points out, telephone
companies are used to pretending to make money under rate-of-return regulations
when they are really losing it.<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies, by contrast, are used to pretending to lose money when
in fact they are raking it in. A standing joke around the offices of John
Malone's cable empire, which comprises TCI and Liberty Media, asks what
Malone will do if the firm ever reports a large profit. The answer: Fire
the accountant. Indeed, TCI did not report even a cosmetic profit until
the first quarter of 1993. Cable firms were financed with junk bonds and
other debt that allows investors to be paid off with tax- deductible interest
payments rather than double-taxed dividends and capital gains favored by
the telcos.<BR>
<BR>
Michael Milken, the financial father of the cable industry, channeled some
$ 10 billion in high-yield securities to TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Viacom
and other cable firms at a time when they were struggling for survival.
As a result, the cable companies are eight times more leveraged in their
debt-equity ratios than telephone companies are. But driven by the demands
of debt, the cable firms use their capital some two-and-a-half times more
efficiently. Generating $ 20 billion in revenues, one-fourth as much as
the telcos, cable firms use just one-tenth the capital.<BR>
<BR>
The cable companies are leveraged at a rate of between seven- and ten-to-one
on their cash flow. Moreover, some 60 percent of cable company assets are
&quot;good will.&quot; Included in the purchase price of new acquisitions,
&quot;good will&quot; represents the intangible value of cash flows and
synergies expected from new technologies and programming.<BR>
<BR>
Built on vision and debt, such entrepreneurial companies cannot invest without
the possibility of large returns. Attack the cable industry's cash flow
and prospects, and you attack its lifeline. Attack the cable industry's
cash flow and prospects, and you reduce its available investment by a factor
of five or more. Bell Atlantic was originally willing to pay for TCI nearly
12 times its cash flow. 
<PRE><B>

The Real Monster:  Government
</B></PRE>
In this highly leveraged arena government itself is the real monster: an
800-pound gorilla. Where does the 800-pound gorilla sit? Wherever it wants.
Early in April of this year it chose to sit on the cable industry. More
specifically, it plumped down in the middle of Brendan Clouston's desk in
the form of a 700-page FCC document reregulating the cable industry. It
was full of detailed regulations on everything from how fast he must pick
up his phones for customer complaints and what he should charge for each
tier of service and for each component of cable gear, to how large, implicitly,
his return on investment can be (about 11.5 percent). He faced the mandate
to adjust nearly every price and policy in the company within six weeks
and to justify each price by filling out 60 pages of forms. In a menacing
note for the future portending new government plans for redistributionist
pricing, he is required to report the median income in each of his service
areas.<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is not really to blame for this onslaught, since it resisted the
new congressional power grab. In any case, this agency is only part of Clouston's
problem. He also faces an aggressive new spirit at the Federal Trade Commission,
at the Department of Justice and in Congress, which permits him to collaborate
with any company as long as it is not a telephone firm with useful fiber
networks and switching systems in TCI's own regions. Full of rhetoric inviting
every industry from the telcos to the power companies into the cable trade,
many of the legislative proposals, FTC policies and FCC ukases converging
on Clouston's desk seem to be intended to transform cable from a galvanizing
entrepreneurial force in the U.S. economy into a sleepy-time public utility
run by lawyers. At stake is the future of the information superhighway and
thus the future of the U.S. economy. 
<PRE>
<B>

Superhighway Hype is Understated
</B></PRE>
Information superhighways are one of those rare technologies that are actually
far more powerful and promising than the hype surrounding them. The first
fruits of this development are already evident, as the U.S. has led the
world in deploying computer networks. Over the next five years broadband
networks can transform the entire economy, projecting it onto a higher plane
of growth and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For the last decade the performance of the economy has perplexed the economics
profession. Throughout the 1980s most economists predicted that U.S. interest
rates would soar as a result of world-lagging rates of personal savings.
When interest rates instead dropped, economists pointed to a &quot;dangerous
dependence&quot; on foreign sources of capital such as Japan, which were
investing close to $ 100 billion annually in the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
Today, adverse tax and regulatory policies in the U.S. have entirely reversed
capital flows, with funds now leaving the U.S. for foreign markets at an
annual rate of $ 80 billion. Meanwhile, as Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence
Lindsey has warned, personal savings have plunged to all-time lows. By every
rule of economics, interest rates should soar or growth should collapse.<BR>
<BR>
Yet despite a slight upward drift in recent months, U.S. interest rates
remain low by historic standards, and the U.S. continues to lead the major
powers in economic growth and has extended its lead in productivity. As
Michael Jensen of Harvard Business School has shown, a close analysis of
the figures from U.S. corporations now reveals a historic acceleration of
U.S. productivity growth during the 1980s. According to an analysis by Morgan
Stanley, between 1987 and 1992 U.S. corporations captured some 47.7 percent
of global profits and 37.4 percent of global sales. Continued slumps in
Europe and Japan combined with reviving growth in the U.S. indicate that
U.S. market share is still rising.<BR>
<BR>
This record of supremacy is entirely baffling to the economics profession
and its megaphones in the media. Focusing on the Loch Ness news, they have
spent a decade in lamentations over the prospects of the U.S. economy, reaching
a pitch of funereal keening during the 1992 election campaigns. But to analysts
focused on the ever-growing U.S. lead in technology, these results are no
mystery at all.<BR>
<BR>
U.S. supremacy is focused on information tools and spearheaded by computer
networks. U.S. companies command some two-thirds of the world's profits
in information technology, hardware and software, and entirely dominate
world markets in computer networks. Half the world's 110 million personal
computers are in the U.S., and between 1989 and 1993 the share connected
to networks rose from less than 10 percent to more than 60 percent.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate information industry is finance. During the last decade the
U.S. employed information technology to transform its financial system.
Spearheaded by Milken and a $ 200 billion junk bond market, the U.S. drastically
reduced the role of banks and proliferated an array of more flexible and
specialized financial agencies. While over the last 12 years banks' share
of private credit for non-financial companies dropped from two- thirds to
less than 20 percent, the U.S. surged into global leadership in applying
information technology to the field of financial innovation.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm shattered the financial system into
silicon smithereens and vastly enhanced its productivity. As the late Warren
Brookes has written, &quot;If every bank is nothing more than an information
system, then by definition every information system has the capacity to
be a bank, and every owner of an information system, from a desktop computer
to a mainframe terminal, can be a banker.&quot; What happened was that thousands
of brokers, mathematicians, financial consultants, insurance salespeople,
credit card merchants and bonds traders took this opportunity to break into
the field of financial entrepreneurship.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the U.S. set an entirely new world standard for capital efficiency,
generating far more economic growth per dollar of savings than any other
country. As explained two centuries ago by Adam Smith, key to productivity
growth is the refinement of the division of labor, the expansion of specialization,
the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and niches. The key force fostering
specialization in the U.S. is computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade computer networks will expand their bandwidth by factors
of thousands and reconstruct the entire U.S. economy in their image. TV
will expire and transpire into a new cornucopia of choice and empowerment.
Great cities will hollow out as the best and brightest in them retreat to
rural redoubts and reach out to global markets and communities. The most
deprived ghetto child in the most blighted project will gain educational
opportunities exceeding those of today's suburban preppie. Small towns will
become industrial centers in the new information economy. Hollywood and
Wall Street will totter and diffuse to all points of the nation and the
globe. Families will regroup around the evolving silicon hearths of a new
cottage economy. Video culture will transcend its current mass-media doldrums,
playing to lowest-common-denominator shocks and prurient interests, and
will effloresce into a plethora of products suggestive of the book industry.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or down the street or in their local office or corporation.
Instead, they will seek out and command their first choices in employment,
culture, entertainment and religion. They will reach out across the country
and around the world to find the best colleagues for every major project.
Productivity and efficiency will inexorably rise. A culture of first choices
will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward the mediocre,
convenient or crude.<BR>
<BR>
The entire centralizing force of the Industrial Revolution, which brought
capital and labor together in vast pyramidal institutions and reduced workers
to accessories of the machine and the tube, will give way to the explosive
centrifuge of the microcosm and telecosm. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and Machine Age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
The vision of information superhighways revitalizing the American economy
and culture is far more true and compelling than even its advocates comprehend.
People who underestimate the impact of bandwidth will miss the supreme investment
opportunities of the epoch. 
<PRE><B>

Decline and Rise of the Malone Model
</B></PRE>
Dominant in the industry are two essential models for fulfilling the promise
of the superhighway. One scheme, long associated with John Malone and other
cable executives, is the monster model: combining content and conduit in
order to gain monopoly rents.<BR>
<BR>
Because it reaches more than 20 percent of all cable customers, access to
the TCI conduit can heavily influence the success or failure of any content
venture. As Andrew Kessler, partner and multimedia guru at Unterberg Harris
and Forbes ASAP columnist, puts it, &quot;If you want to create a cable
channel, you may have to send it through Malone's bottleneck--a satellite
dish farm outside Denver. I suspect that could cost you some $ 4 million
in cash, or, alternatively, you can give Malone 30 percent of your company.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This monster model is in essence the way Malone built up Liberty Media and
the content side of TCI, which together own parts of TNT, the Discovery
Channel, American Movie Classics, Black Entertainment TV, Court TV, Encore,
Starz, Family Channel, Home Shopping Network, QVC, Video Jukebox and an
array of regional sports networks. It has been widely reported that AT&T
and financier Herbert Allen are creating a new classic sports network and
will give a chunk of it to Liberty in exchange for access to Malone's conduit.<BR>
<BR>
The other model is that of the common-carrier, upheld both by the telephone
companies and by Internet. In this model you build an open conduit and exercise
virtually no influence on content. Using the phone system or Internet, people
can communicate anything they want as long as they observe the protocols
of the public switched telephone network or of Internet's TCP/IP. Extended
to images, this model suggests a &quot;video dial tone.&quot; You can dial
up any other machine connected to the network and download or upload any
films, files, documents, pictures or multimedia programs that you wish.
Although telephone companies or Internet providers may own content. they
cannot privilege their own programming. Their content has to compete for
customers freely with all other content available on the network.<BR>
<BR>
The notoriety of the Malone model and the resentment it arouses far and
wide explain much of the hostility toward the cable industry and John Malone.
This may even explain the current rage to reregulate the industry. The great
irony today is that Malone and the rest of the cable leaders were in the
process of abandoning the Malone model at the very moment that many telephone
executives seemed to adopt it.<BR>
<BR>
It was Malone, after all, who was willing to sell his content to Bell Atlantic,
and it was Raymond Smith, above all, who insisted on acquiring the assets
of Liberty Media. It was Bell South that was willing to pitch in some $
2 billion to QVC's bidding for Paramount when John Malone left Batty Diller
high and dry. Ameritech, too, was reported to be preparing a pitch for Paramount.<BR>
<BR>
Malone was right in his attempt to sell out at the top to Bell Atlantic.
The idea of combining conduit and content was valid in a regime of bandwidth
scarcity. In a regime of broadband information superhighways, however, content
providers will want to put their programming on everyone's conduits, and
conduit owners will want to carry everyone's content. In a world of bandwidth
abundance Paramount will not want to restrict its films to Bell South's
network any more than Bell South will exclude films from other sources.<BR>
<BR>
The key condition for the success of the open model and the eclipse of the
Malone model, however, is real bandwidth abundance. If the federal government
prohibits the interconnection of conduits, then the Malone model gains a
new lease on life. In a world of bandwidth scarcity the owner of the conduit
not only can but must control access to it. Thus, the owner of the conduit
also shapes the content. It does not matter whether the conduit company
is headed by a scheming monopolist or by Mitch Kapor and the members of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Bandwidth scarcity will require the
managers of the network to determine the video programming on it.<BR>
<BR>
In a world of information superhighways, however, the most open networks
will dominate, and the proprietary networks will wither. Malone's understanding
of this fact--that his own model would soon expire in an environment of
bandwidth abundance--motivated his effort to merge with Bell Atlantic.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm inexorably dictates mergers not between content
and conduit, but between conduit and conduit. In particular, today it mandates
the merger of the huge fiber resources of the telephone companies--which
are nine times as extensive as cable industry fiber and are estimated to
rise to 2.7 million lines by next year--with the huge asset of 57 million
broadband links to homes commanded by the cable industry. Obstructing such
mergers in the name of competition, or antitrust, or regulatory caprice,
is wantonly destructive to the future of the economy. 
<PRE>
<B>
The Siren Call From Foreign Shores
</B></PRE>
Most of the gains of the telecosm depend on government willingness to allow
the creation of coherent broadband networks with no prohibitions against
the convergence of cable and telco systems. For a while it appeared that
the Clinton administration was willing to accommodate this development.
Now it appears that it prefers to lead the U.S. government into a private-sector
monster hunt. Rather than releasing America's cable and telco firms to build
this redemptive infrastructure, Washington leaders seem chiefly concerned
with assuring themselves that no one will make any money from it. As a result,
with some $ 1 billion in annual funding from Wall Street, cable and telephone
firms are increasingly moving abroad to fulfill the promise of information
superhighways.<BR>
<BR>
TCI and U.S. West, for example, are serving some quarter- million British
citizens with combined telephone and cable functions over a hybrid network
of coax and fiber. The current regulatory climate dooms the proposed merger
of Southwestern Bell and Cox Cable and their plans to launch information
highways in Phoenix and Atlanta. But these companies continue to expand
their hybrid cable and phone networks In Liverpool and Birmingham in England.
In the U.S. NYNEX has been one of the most sluggish Bells in information
superhighway projects. But from Gibraltar to Bangkok, it is supplying an
array of wireless and wireline services. In the U.K. NYNEX Cablecomm holds
17 cable franchises passing 2.5 million homes and plans some $ 2 billion
in future investments. In the wake of the new regulations Bell Canada International
(BCI) reduced its offer for Jones Intercable by five percent, but the two
companies are barging ahead in East London, Leeds and Aylesbury. Time Warner,
Ameritech and other cable and telephone companies are also rushing to less
regulated realms to lay information infrastructure everywhere from Scotland
to New Zealand.<BR>
<BR>
In the U.S. such collaborations of cable and telephone companies would be
paralyzed by litigation and bureaucracy. It appears increasingly possible
that despite the huge lead created by the U.S. cable industry, which, unique
in the world, has extended broadband access to some 95 percent of American
homes, broadband networks will first be built outside the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
American politicians must face reality. With cable, the U.S. is far and
away the world leader in broadband technology. With cable, the U.S. can
have a national network reaching every American community by the year 2000.
Without cable, however, the U.S. can forget the idea of building a national
system of information superhighways in this decade. Without cable, the global
race is even, and several European and Asian countries command a significant
edge as a result of their integrated cable and telephone firms.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. panacea of &quot;competition&quot; without winners may work for
commodity markets, which require low levels of incremental investment and
offer returns commensurate with the rate of interest. Governing technological
progress, though, is the very different regime of dynamic competition and
creative destruction.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling most technology investment is the pursuit of transitory positions
of monopoly that may yield massive profits. That's why in the late 1970s
and early 1980s Milken directed some $ 17 billion to the cable TV, fiberoptic
telephony and cellular telephone industries, giving the U.S. a decisive
lead in all these areas. That's why Intel Corp. has been investing $ 2 billion
a year in new wafer fabrication capacity to secure its global edge in microprocessors.
That's why Microsoft invests $ 1 billion a year or more (depending on definitions)
in new software technology to integrate ever-new functions into its dominant
operating systems. And that's why Bell Atlantic contemplated investing what
amounted to some $ 33 billion in John Malone's company, TCI.<BR>
<BR>
Until replaced by a better system, every innovation gives its owner a temporary
monopoly. Otherwise it is not a true innovation. Today, whether anyone likes
it or not, the cable industry has a temporary monopoly on broadband links
to the home. By interconnecting these links to the fiber networks of the
phone companies, the two industries together can create a national information
superhighway some five or 10 years sooner than can Japan or Europe.<BR>
<BR>
Some 79 percent of the costs of a network come in the final connections
to homes: the distribution and drops that the cable industry has installed
over the last 25 years. Joined with the telephone industry's fiber optics--nine
times more extensive than the cable industry's fiber deployment--this hybrid
cable-telco network would represent an authentic innovation and would trigger
a flood of real competition supplying a huge array of powerful new broadband
communications services. According to authoritative estimates cited by Vice-President
Gore and the FCC, these innovations would increase U.S. productivity growth
by 40 percent over the next decade. This immense undertaking would also
yield huge profits for as long as a decade to some of the companies that
master it.<BR>
<BR>
The government might regard these profits as &quot;obscene.&quot; But they
will be indispensable both to pay for the transformation of American media
and to attract the next generation of competitors into the business. These
rivals are already on the way: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), wireless
cellular &quot;cable&quot; at 28 gigahertz, low-earth-orbiting satellites
such as the Gates-McCaw Teledesic, all-fiber &quot;Internets&quot; and the
array of passive fiber- to-the-home technology summed up as the fibersphere.
Even broadcasters and utilities will enter the field. In a world where the
government micromanages communications in the name of &quot;competition,&quot;
however, all these capital-hungry competitors will languish. 
<PRE><B>

Dynamic Competition or Static Competitors?
</B></PRE>
The dynamics of competition on the information superhighway repeats the
previous dynamics of competition in computers. Preventing the dominance
of successful technologies--sustaining an artificial diversity--is anticompetitive.
If in the early 1980s the Department of Justice had ruled against the Microsoft
and Intel standards, for example, and had required a variety of microprocessor
instruction sets and operating systems, the result would have been less
competition in computers, not more. Perhaps Pick, Quarterdeck, Digital Research
and others would have gained share against Microsoft. But the applications
software business, with its floods of real competition in new programs for
everything from financial management to videogames, would have languished,
along with the parallel markets in hardware peripherals.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that Microsoft faces antitrust pressure at the twilight of its
dominance. Impelled by the new markets for multimedia and handheld communicators,
the industry is on the cusp of an entirely new landscape of competition.
In this new arena Microsoft's present market share and installed base are
barriers to entry for Microsoft rather than for its rivals. If Microsoft
is to prevail in these new areas, it must cannibalize its own systems and
compete on an equal basis with everyone else.<BR>
<BR>
The laws of dynamic competition apply just as forcefully to networks as
to computers. Just as the time arrived when text editing and disk utilities
would be integrated into operating systems--or floating point computations
would be integrated into microprocessors--broadband cable services now must
be integrated into the public switched telephone network (PSTN), not segregated
from it. Despite the &quot;competitive&quot; access dreams of politicians
and regulators, true competition requires that the &quot;two-wire model&quot;
of home communications give way to a broadband, one-wire system.<BR>
<BR>
The best and most cost-effective network practicable today is a combination
of telco fiber and cable coax. Even the telephone industry agrees. U.S.
West, Pacific Telesis and Bellcore all have resolved on the same hybrid
system that TCI, Time Warner and Cablelabs have pioneered. Without mergers
with cable firms, the telcos in essence will try to rebuild cable networks.<BR>
<BR>
Attempting to duplicate the connections to homes built by the cable industry
over the last 25 years, however, the telephone industry would have to spend
some $ 200 billion. It would have to sustain this level of new investment
while maintaining its existing plant and expanding into long-distance and
other services. It would have to summon large incremental capital in the
face of continued competition from the cable industry's taking of many of
the most profitable markets.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos currently declare they are willing to make these investments.
They tell Washington regulators and politicians that all will be fine as
long as they are allowed to own programming and information services and
build equipment. But the message from the markets is clear and to the contrary.
At the very time that telco executives were intoning their bold plans, telephone
and cable share prices were plunging toward new lows. Now Raymond Smith
of Bell Atlantic is announcing a half-billion- dollar reduction in infrastructure
outlays. Southwestern Bell is giving up its plans to buy Cox Cable. Under
a similar &quot;competitive&quot; regime in cellular telephony, even AT&T and
McCaw have found their merger in jeopardy.<BR>
<BR>
Under rate-of-return regulations with prohibition of cross- subsidies from
current cash flow, a &quot;competitive&quot; information superhighway simply
cannot fly. An information superhighway cannot be built under a canopy of
federal tariffs, price controls, mandates and allocated markets. 
<PRE><B>

Highway Imperative:  Cable-PC</B></PRE>
Politicians must recognize that what is at stake is not merely games, entertainment
and a few educational frills but the very future of the U.S. economy. Cable
is central not only to the next generation of television technology but
also to the next generation of computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
Again, many companies offer bold words in business plans for interconnecting
homes with new networks. Indeed, the telcos can provide some intriguing
computer services through their accelerating rollout of Integrated Services
Digital Networks (ISDN), as was so eloquently urged by Mitch Kapor and others.
Internet will continue to expand rapidly its cornucopia of mostly narrowband
offerings. Bill Gates and Craig McCaw may even enlarge the bandwidth available
to homes to a level of 2.4 megabits per second through their elegant and
ambitious Teledesic. Direct broadcast satellite systems and public utilities
and wireless cable operators will all enrich the flow of video to the nation's
homes.<BR>
<BR>
Except in the short ran, though, these systems are not remotely competitive
with cable. Available ISDN, for example, offers less than one-100th the
bandwidth of one digital cable channel and less than one-1,000th the bandwidth
of a cable coax line. The other rivals to cable, from direct broadcast satellite
to Teledesic, are similarly far too little and too late. Even the advanced
28-gigahertz wireless cable projects, for all their promise as supplementary
systems, cannot ultimately compete with the potential two-way bandwidth
of fiber-coax systems in the ground.<BR>
<BR>
All the current plans of the telephone companies and the government leave
the huge U.S. endowment of home computers--the fastest-growing and most
promising segment of the computer industry--stranded in a narrowband world.
Only the cable industry's gigahertz links, passing into some 95 percent
of American homes, can launch the American personal computer industry into
a new level of two-way broadband digital connectivity.<BR>
<BR>
For that reason the future of the American computer industry largely depends
on the future of the cable industry. By linking America's computers to broadband
networks and then to telco fiber systems, cable can be the great enabler
of the next phase of development in America's digital economy.<BR>
<BR>
In laying broadband systems the cable industry has already been forced to
solve many of the key problems of an information superhighway. Although
often depicted as an intrinsically one- way service, cable technology has,
in fact, long provided two-way capabilities.<BR>
<BR>
Every cable coax line, for example, offers potential bandwidth equivalent
to six times the 160 megahertz of spectrum assigned by the FCC for personal
communications services. Cable can accommodate as much as one gigahertz--a
billion cycles per second--of communications power. This is some 250,000
times the capacity of a four-kilohertz telephone line to the home. Just
one six-megahertz cable channel commands 1,500 times the bandwidth of a
telephone line. In every coax connection the first four channels, between
five and 30 megahertz, are reserved not for broadcast but for reverse communications
to the headend. Widely used to transfer video programming among headends
and satellite dishes and other programming sources, these channels alone
already represent a potential information highway for home computers 2,500
times faster than a 9,600-baud modem to a phone line.<BR>
<BR>
Even these possibilities, however, underestimate the potential of cable.
The coax laid by the cable firms must carry analog video material without
interference or distortion. This means cable equipment must track perfectly
all the analog waveforms representing the shape and brightness of the image,
and must detect tiny differences in the frequencies of FM signals bearing
color and sound information. Because any deviation in an analog wave imparts
a defect to the picture, cable TV has had to develop extremely low loss
technologies. Although most current cable systems function at much lower
signal-to-noise ratios, measured logarithmically, a cable TV plant can potentially
function at nearly 50 decibels, or at a signal-to-noise power ratio of almost
100,000-to-one.<BR>
<BR>
Necessary to transmit high-quality analog video, between 10,000- and 100,000-to-1
signal-to-noise ratios are vast overkill for the relatively crude on-off
codes of digital communications, which can function at 17 decibels or less.
Therefore, the one- gigahertz coax lines can carry many more than one bit
per hertz. Craig Tanner, vice-president of advanced TV projects at Cablelabs,
the industry's research arm in Louisville, Colo., estimates that by wiggling
every wave in readable patterns using a modulation scheme called 256 QAM
(quadrature amplitude modulation), cable systems can transmit as many as
seven bits per hertz. This means that the one-gigahertz bandwidth of an
existing cable line might potentially carry between six and eight gigabits
per second, or more than three gigabits per second each way. These potential
links to homes are more capacious than the current telephone fiber lines
that accommodate tens of thousands of phone calls among telco central offices.<BR>
<BR>
This bandwidth represents the real potential of cable coax. For the next
decade much of the cable plant will still be devoted to analog TV broadcasts
or to digital renditions of pay-per-view movies. Time Warner's Orlando project,
however, envisions devoting the top 350 megahertz of its system to two-way
digital communications, including 100 megahertz for the personal communications
services of wireless telephony and 150 megahertz for digital two-way data
flows. At a very conservative estimate of two bits per hertz, Time Warner
projects a total of 300 megabits per second from these digital channels.
At these levels a computer could download a full movie of two-and-a-half
hours in about one minute.

Cable's Real Potential is Not TV</B></PRE>
Abandonment of the Malone model by Malone and the rest of the cable industry
ultimately requires that cable TV magnates develop a new grasp of the dynamics
of the microcosm: the exponential growth of computer power and connections.
Accustomed to the role of propagating mass entertainment, cable leaders
have long downplayed the potential market in computer communications.<BR>
<BR>
Gradually growing throughout TCI, Time Warner, Continental Cablevision,
Jones Intercable and other cable firms, however, is a recognition that the
real future of cable is in computers rather than TVs. As David Fellows of
Continental declared in launching his pioneering new Internet access system
in Boston In late February, &quot;The market for computer communications
is huge.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, during the next decade the cable companies are going to discover
that the computer market for their services is far more important than the
television market. The computer industry, hardware and software, is already
some 60 percent larger than the television and movie industries put together
and is growing six times as fast. On-line networked computer services, such
as Prodigy, CompuServe, Delphi and America Online, are collectively growing
at a pace of close to 100 percent per year. When on-line services can exchange
video and audio files as readily as they transfer text today, these computer
networks will be able to outperform any television system. Against all their
expectations and plans, cable executives are going to find themselves a
central part of the computer networking industry.<BR>
<BR>
As Fellows explains, &quot;Cable and computer network topologies go together
perfectly. Both provide shared bandwidth. Ethernet over cable is a natural.&quot;
In both networks all the data flow by every terminal. The receiver tunes
into the desired channel. For computers, cable offers the dumb bandwidth
that is increasingly needed as terminals gain near-supercomputer powers.
In the past networks had to be smart in order to provide needed services
to the dumb terminals on their periphery, whether phones, computers or TVs.
Dumb terminals could tolerate narrowband connections. In the future, however,
all terminals will command supercomputer powers.<BR>
<BR>
When terminals are smart, the intelligence in networks flows to the fringes.
When terminals are smart, networks must be broad and dumb. There is no way
that an intelligent switching fabric can anticipate the constantly evolving
technology emerging from a computer industry in a frenzied process of change.
There is no way that John Malone's satellite farm outside Denver will be
able to satisfy the demands for programming and communications of 100 million
networked teleputers. While the telephone business struggles with the increasing
problems of intelligent central switches with some 25 million lines of software
code, the cable industry is creating dumb networks in tune with the explosive
growth of supersmart machines in every home and office.<BR>
<BR>
The movement of computer networks onto cable need not await the development
of advanced broadband systems such as those planned by Time Warner in Orlando.
Already several companies are supplying moderns that allow computers to
link directly to cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith provided the first system, HomeWorks, operating at a rate of 500
kilobits per second. It is being used by Cox Cable to deliver Prodigy service
in San Diego at a rate 52 times faster than existing 9,600-baud phone modems.
Also using HomeWorks is Jones Intercable for Internet services in Alexandria,
Va., Continental Cablevision and CompuServe in Exeter, N.H., and TCI for
a distance learning test in Provo, Utah.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith is adding a system called ChannelMizer that can offer full Ethernet
capability of 10 megabits per second over a 15-mile radius. Intel, General
Instrument and Hybrid Technologies have announced an asymmetrical system
that runs upstream from the home at 256 kilobits per second and downstream
at 10 megabits per second, the Ethernet rate run in most office networks.<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering in the field for several years has been Digital Equipment Corp.
under the leadership of James Albrycht. Adapting equipment developed by
LANcity, DEC's ChannelWorks offers the functionality needed for true information
highway on-ramps. Extending a two-way Ethernet transparently from the office
to the home by a full 70 miles, the ChannelWorks frequency-agile modem allows
the use of all 83 cable frequency channels. Cable managers can send digital
information over any underused part of the coax bandwidth. Currently deployed
chiefly by telecommuting Digital employees, the system is under evaluation
by a variety of hospitals, libraries, schools and other institutions favored
by Vice-President Gore.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely crucial to the development of the broadband superhighway, however,
is not only the merger of the two networks but also access to the capital
of the telephone industry. Creation of high-bandwidth cable connections
to homes will be far cheaper than laying new coax. But they still will require
expensive upgrades to existing cable plant.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos already invest more money every year--some $ 24 billion--than
the total revenues of the cable industry. But even the telcos will not be
able to create information superhighways if they also have to duplicate
the broadband connections to homes already offered by the cable industry.
Similarly, the cable industry alone cannot attract sufficient funds to duplicate
the broadband fiber networks already commanded by the telcos, while the
telcos move in to skim off the best pay-per-view movie markets. Particularly
in an adverse regulatory climate neither industry is capable of building
broadband networks. With relatively narrowband networks, the Malone model
necessarily thrives. In the name of fighting monsters the administration
is in fact pursuing what amounts to a monster-protection policy.<BR>
<BR>
If this policy continues, innovation once more will follow its course toward
the least-regulated arenas. Cable and telco firms will install their best
technologies overseas. In the U.S. the computer networking industry will
build the information superhighways. To Gore's bitter regret, only business
and the wealthy will be able to afford access. Until the early decades of
the next century, much of the rest of the nation will be left to the mercies
of the Malone model for video entertainment and other cable programming.
Interactivity will tend to take the form of games and pay-per-view TV.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with the increasing movement of activity from big cities, corporate
headquarters, hospitals, schools and other centralized institutions to homes
and small cities, the demand for broadband computer connections is sure
to soar. Most current congressional legislation that imposes mandates on
businesses relating to everything from health care reform to parental leave
tends to drive work away from corporations to contractual outsources. The
market for &quot;interactive TV&quot; is likely to grow far more slowly
than the market for computer connections over cable.<BR>
<BR>
Both political parties are far behind the public in comprehending these
developments. But the reversal of the earlier forces of conurbation and
centralized industry responds to the most profound laws of new technology.
It is the most important movement in America today. If the administration
continues to strangle new technology with new regulation and red tape, a
new coalition of liberals and conservatives alike will rise up against it
and grasp the future. Al Gore may eventually wish he had never heard of
broadband networks.

Imagine it is 1971 and you are chair of the new Federal Computer Commission.
This commission has been established to regulate the natural monopoly of
computer technology as summed up in the famous Grosch's Law. In 1956 IBM
engineer Herbert Grosch proved that computer power rises by the square of
its cost and thus necessarily gravitates to the most costly machines. According
to a famous IBM projection, the entire world could use some 55 mainframes,
time-sharing from dumb terminals and keypunch machines. The owners of these
machines would rule the world of information in an ascendant information
age. By the Orwellian dawn of 1984, Big Bre'r IBM would establish a new
digital tyranny, with a new elite of the data-rich dominating the data-poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As head of the computer commission, you launch a bold program to forestall
this grim outcome. Under a congressional mandate to promote competition
for IBM and ensure the principle of universal computer service, you ordain
the creation of some 2,500 mainframe licenses to be auctioned to the highest
bidders (with special licenses reserved for minorities, women and farmers).
To ensure widespread competition across all of America, you establish seven
licenses in each metropolitan Major Trading Area and seven in every rural
Basic Trading Area as defined by Rand McNally. To guarantee universal service,
you mandate the free distribution of keypunch machines to all businesses
and households so that they can access the local computer centers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In establishing this auction in 1971, you had no reason at all to notice
that a tiny company in Mountain View, Calif., called Intel was about to
announce three new technologies together with some hype about &quot;a new
era of integrated electronics.&quot; After all, these technologies--the
microprocessor; erasable, programmable read-only memory (EPROM); and a one-kilobit
dynamic random access memory (DRAM)--were far too primitive to even compare
with IBM's massive machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The likely results of such a Federal Computer Commission policy are not
merely matters of conjecture. France pretty much did it when it distributed
free Minitel terminals to its citizens to provide them access to government
mainframes. While the United States made personal computers nearly ubiquitous
buying perhaps 100 million since the launch of the Minitel in the late 1970s
the French chatted through central databases and ended up with one-quarter
as many computers per capita as this country, and one-tenth the number of
computer networks. Today, PC networks are leading the US economy to world
dominance while Europe founders without a single major computer company,
software firm or semiconductor manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT IS NOW 1994, and Reed Hundt, the new chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, is indeed about to hold an auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than selling exclusive mainframe licenses, the current FCC is going
to sell exclusive ten-year licenses to about 2,500 shards of the radio spectrum.
Meanwhile, a tiny company called Steinbrecher Corp. of Burlington, Mass.,
is introducing the new microprocessor of the radio business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the world of radio waves ruled by the Federal Communications Commission,
the Steinbrecher MiniCell is even more revolutionary than the microprocessor
was in the world of computing. While Intel put an entire computer on a single
chip, Steinbrecher has put an entire cellular base station--now requiring
some 1,000 square feet and costing $ 1.5 million--in a box the size of a
briefcase that costs $ 100,000 today. Based on a unique invention by Donald
Steinbrecher and on the sweeping advance of computer technology, the MiniCell
represents a far bigger leap forward beyond the current state of the art
than the microprocessor did. What's more, this MiniCell is in fact much
superior to existing cellular base stations. Unlike the 416 hard-wired radio
transceivers (transmitter-receivers) in existing base stations, the MiniCell
contains a single digital broadband radio and is fully programmable. It
can accommodate scores of different kind of cellular handsets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important, the MiniCell benefits from the same technology as the microprocessor.
Making possible the creation of this broadband digital radio is the tidal
onrush of Moore's Law. In an antithesis of Grosch's Law, Gordon Moore of
Intel showed that the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology doubles
every 18 months. This insight suggested the Law of the Microcosm-- that
computing power gravitates not to the costliest but to the cheapest machines.
Costing $ 100,000 today, the MiniCell will predictably cost some $10,000
before the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In time, these digital MiniCells will have an impact similar to that of
the PC. They will drive the creation of a cornucopia of new mobile services--from
plain old telephony to wireless video conferencing--based on ubiquitous
client/server networks in the air. Endowing Americans with universal mobile
access to information superhighways, these MiniCells can spearhead another
generation of computer-led growth in the US economy. Eventually, the implications
of Steinbrecher's machines and other major innovations in wireless will
crash In on the legalistic scene of the FCC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And that's only the beginning of the story.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on the block In May will be 160 megahertz (millions of cycles per
second) of the radio frequency spectrum, divided into seven sections of
between 10 and 30 megahertz In each of 543 areas of the country, and devoted
to enhanced Personal Communications Services (PCS).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Existing cellular systems operate in a total spectrum space of 50 megahertz
in two frequency bands near the 800 megahertz level. By contrast, PCS will
take four times that space in a frequency band near two gigahertz (billions
of cycles per second). Became higher frequencies allow use of lower-power
radios with smaller antennas and longer-lasting batteries, PCS offers the
possibility of a drastically improved wireless system. Unfortunately, the
major obstacle to the promise of PCS is the auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amid the spectrum fever aroused by the bidding, however, new radio technologies
are emerging that devastate its most basic assumptions. At a time when the
world is about to take to information superhighways In the sky--plied by
low-powered, pollution-free computer phones--the FCC is in danger of building
a legal infrastructure and protectionist program for information smokestacks
and gas guzzlers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used to describe the auction betrays its fallacies. With
real estate imagery, analysts depict spectrum as &quot;beachfront property&quot;
and the auction as a &quot;land rash.&quot; They assume that radio frequencies
are like analog telephone circuit: no two users can occupy the same spot
of spectrum at the same time. Whether large 50-kilowatt broadcast stations
booming Rush Limbaugh's voice across the nation or milliwatt cellular phones
beaming love murmurs to a nearby base station, radio transmitters are assumed
to be infectious, high-powered and blind. If one is on the highway, everyone
else has to clear out. Both the prevailing wisdom and the entrenched technology
dictate that every transmitter be quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, innovations from such companies as Steinbrecher and Qualcomm Inc.
of San Diego overthrow this paradigm. Not only can numerous radios operate
at non-interfering levels in the same frequency band, they can also see
other users' signals and move to avoid them. In baseball jargon, the new
radios can hit 'em where they ain't; in football idiom, they run for daylight.
If appropriately handled, these technologies can render spectrum not scarce
but abundant.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These developments make it retrograde to assign exclusive spectrum rights
to anyone or to foster technologies that require exclusivity. Spectrum no
longer shares any features of beachfront property. A wave would be a better
analogy. 
<PRE><B>
The New Rules Of Waves</B></PRE>
In the early decades of this century, radio was king. Electronics hackers
played in the waves with a variety of ham, citizens band and short-wave
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Experimenting with crystal sets, they innocently entered the domain of solid-state
devices and acquired some of the skills that fueled the electronic revolution
in the United States and the radar revolution that won World War II. The
first point-contact transistor, created by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain
at Bell Labs in 1948, functioned like a crystal radio. The first major solid-state
product was a 1954 Texas Instruments pocket radio with six germanium transistors.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the following decades, the radio became a mass commodity. There are
now some 230 million radios in the United States alone, not even including
more than 16 million cellular phones (which are in fact portable two-way
radios). Radios roll off Asian assembly lines at a rate that might be meaningfully
measured in hertz (cycles per second), and they come in sizes fit for pockets,
belts, watches and ears. But the romance of radio has died and given way
to the romance of computers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today it is PC technology that engages the youthful energies previously
invested in radio technology. The press trumpets a coming convergence between
computers and TVs and games and films. But no one talks much about radios.
For many years, we have been taking radios for granted.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the foundation of wireless communications, however, radio--no less than
TV or films--will burst into a new technoscape as a result of a convergence
with computers. The hackers of the '50s and '60s are joining forces with
the hackers of the '80s and '90s to create a new industry. Moore's Law is
about to overran the world of radio.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You double anything every 18 months and pretty soon you find yourself with
a monster. During the 1970s and 1980s, Moore's Law overturned the established
order in the computer industry and spawned some 100 million personal computers
that are as powerful as million-dollar mainframes were when the revolution
began. In the current decade, Moore's Law is upending the telephone and
television industries with interactive teleputers that will be able to send,
receive, shape and store interactive full-motion video. And during the next
five years, Moore's Law is going to transform exotic and costly radio equipment
once consigned to the military and outer space into the basic communications
access routes for the new world economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To understand this new world of radio, however, you must forget much of
what you learned about the old world of radio. For example, these new radios
differ radically from the radios of the past in the way they use spectrum,
the way they interfere with one another and the way they are built.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For some 15 years, a hacker of the 1950s named Don Steinbrecher and a small
group of students and associates have been making the world's most powerful
and aerobatic radios. Steinbrecher radio gear can soar to spectrum altitudes
as high as 94 gigahertz to provide radar &quot;eyes&quot; for smart bombs
and pies, plunge down to the cellular band at 800 megahertz to listen in
on phone calls or drop discretely to 30 megahertz--waves that bounce off
the ionosphere--for remote over-the-horizon radar work identifying cocaine
traffickers flying in low from Latin America. At the same time, some of
these radios may soon command enough dynamic ranges of accurate broadband
reception--rumored to be as high as 120 decibels (one trillion-to-one)--to
detect a pin drop at a heavy-metal rock concert without missing a high-fidelity
note or twang.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like every radio transceiver, a Steinbrecher radio must have four key components:
an antenna, a tuner, a modem and a mixer. The antenna part is easy; for
many purposes, your metal shirt hanger will do the trick (backyard wire
fences collect millions of frequencies). But without tuners, modems and
mixers, nothing reaches its final destination--the human ear.<BR>
<BR>
A tuner selects a desired carrier frequency, usually by exploiting the science
of resonant circuits. A modem is a modulator-demodulator. In transmitting
it applies information to the carrier frequency by wiggling the waves in
a pattern, called a modulation scheme, such as AM or FM. In receiving the
modem strips out (demodulates) the information tom the carrier wave.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to Steinbrecher radios is the broadband mixer. It surmounts what
was long seen as an impossible challenge: moving a large array of the relatively
high career frequencies on the antenna down to a so-called baseband level
where they can be used without losing any of the information or adding spurious
information in the process. Compared to FM carrier frequencies of 100 megahertz
or even PCS frequencies of two gigahertz, baseband audio frequencies run
between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mixers were the basic Steinbrecher product, and in 1978 and 1980, Steinbrecher
acquired patents on a unique broadband mixer with high range and sensitivity
called the Paramixer. Even to its expected military customers, the Paramixer
was a hard sell because other radio components were unable to keep pace
with its performance. Today, however, the Paramixer is the foundation of
the Steinbrecher radio in the MiniCell.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the old world of radio, transceivers integrated all of these components--antenna,
tuner, modem and mixer--into one analog hardware system. Because the radio
is analog and hard-wired, its functions must be standardized. Each radio
can receive or transmit only a very limited set of frequencies bearing information
coded in a specific modulation scheme and exclusively occupying a specific
spectrum space at a particular power range. If you are in the radio business--whether
as an equipment manufacturer such as Motorola or Ericsson, a provider of
services, such as McCaw or Comsat, or a broadcaster, such as NBC or Turner--you
care deeply about these hard-wired specifications, frequencies and modulation
schemes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Comprising the &quot;air standard,&quot; these issues embroil businesses,
politicians, standards bodies and regulators in constant warfare. For everything
from High Definition Television to digital cellular and cordless telephony,
standards bodies are wrangling over frequencies and modulation schemes.
<PRE><B>

How Digital Radios Can End The Spectrum Wars</B></PRE>
To the people at Steinbrecher Corp., all these wrangles seem utterly unnecessary.
With antennas, tuners, modems and mixers, wideband digital radios perform
all the same functions as ordinary radios. Only the antenna and mixer are
in hardware, and these are generic; they don't care any more about air standards
than your shirt hanger does.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Steinbrecher radios, all of the frequency tuning, all of the modulating
and demodulating, all of the channelization, all of the coding and decoding
that so embroil the politicians are performed by programmable digital signal
processors and can be changed at a base station in real time. Strictly speaking,
the tuner and modem are not part of the base station radio at all. The broadband
radio in a Steinbrecher base station can send or receive signals to or from
any handset or mobile unit operating within its bandwidth (in current cellular
systems the full 12.5 megahertz of the band; in PCS, still larger bands
of as much as 30 megahertz).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the processing of codes, frequencies, channels and modulations, as well
as all special mobile services, can move onto computers attached to the
network. Steinbrecher technology thus can open up the spectrum for open
and programmable client/server systems like those that now dominate the
computer industry. Moore's Law, in fact, is changing radios into portable
digital computers. The most pervasive personal computer of the next decade
will be a digital cellular phone operating at least 40 MIPS (millions of
instructions per second).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the performance of analog-to-digital converters defines the limits
of Steinbrecher radios. Even if the mixers are perfect, the system's performance
can be no better than the accuracy of the A/D processors that transform
the output of the mixers into a digital bit stream for the DSPs. Steinbrecher
estimates that better broadband A/D converters--which can sample wave forms
more accurately at high frequencies--could increase the performance ofSteinbrecher
systems by an amazing factor of 10. Pushed by demands and designs from Steinbrecher,
Analog Devices and other suppliers are advancing converter technology nearly
at a pace with Moore's Law, and Steinbrecher's broadband digital radios
are rapidly approaching the ideal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Don Steinbrecher puts it, broadband A/D and DSP have changed wireless
&quot;turn a radio business to a computer business.&quot; At first, the
computer portion of a broadband radio was very expensive. Until the early
1980s, military customers performed advanced broadband analog-to-digital
conversion and digital signal processing on million-dollar custom supercomputers.
In 1986, an advanced DSP system for graphics at Bell Labs entailed the use
of 82 AT&T DSP32 chips and supporting devices in a custom computer that
cost some $ 130,000. Today, these same functions are performed on an Apple
Quadra 84o AV using an AT&T 3210 running at 33 megaflops (million floating-point
operations per second) and 17 MIPS for under $ 20 in volume. This rising
tide of advances in digital technology, propelled by Moore's Law, is about
to sweep Steinbrecher's recondite radio company into the midst of a mass
market in cellular telephony.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And the entire cellular and PCS industries will be beating a path to Steinbrecher's
door. Just as millions of people today have learned the meaning of MIPS
and megabytes, millions of people around the world, believe it or not, are
going to come to understand the meaning of &quot;spurious-free dynamic range.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a very rough analogy, imagine cranking the volume of your radio as high
as possible without marring the desired signal with static and distortion.
The spurious-free dynamic range of your radio would measure the distance
between the lowest and the highest volumes with a clear signal. In more
technical terms, spurious-free dynamic range is defined as the range of
signal amplitudes that can simultaneously be processed without distortion
or be resolved by a receiver without the emergence of spurious signals above
the noise floor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In building broadband radios with high dynamic range, however, Steinbrecher
faced a fundamental technical problem. As a general rule, bandwidth is inversely
proportional to dynamic range. You can have one or the other, but you can't
have both. The broader the band, the more difficult it is to capture all
of its contents with full accuracy and sensitivity or with full spurious-free
dynamic range. An ordinary radio may command a high dynamic range of volumes
because it is narrowband.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Steinbrecher radio does not begin by tuning to one frequency alone;
it gasps every frequency in a particular swath of spectrum. In some extreme
Paramixer applications (94-gigahertz radar, for example), the bandwidth
could be 10 gigahertz--larger than the entire range of spectrum commonly
used in the air, from submarine communications at 60 hertz to C band satellite
at 6 gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In most Steinbrecher applications that require high dynamic range, however,
the bandwidth runs between a few megahertz and hundreds of megahertz (compared
to 30 kilohertz in a cellular phone). Unless all of the frequencies captured
by the broadband radio are really present in the band rather than as artifacts
of the equipment--in technical jargon, unless the signals are spurious-free--the
radio user cannot tell what is going on, cannot distinguish between spurs
and signals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher has devoted much of his career to the graft of spurious-free
dynamic range. Soon after he arrived at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in September 1961 to pursue work on device physics, he moved into the school's
new Radio Astronomy Lab. The radio astronomers were using millimeter waves
at 75 gigahertz to probe remote galaxies and pour through evidence of a
big bang at the beginning of time. Because the return reflections from outer
space were infinitesimal, the radio telescopes had to command a bandwidth
of at least two gigahertz, a spurious-free dynamic range of more than 100
decibels (tens of billions-, or even trillions-to-one) and noise levels
of less than 10 decibels (millionths of a watt).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telescope signals turned out not to be spurious-free. More than 90 percent
of the receiver noise--the spurious signals--originated in the frequency
converter or mixer, which translated the 75-gigahertz millimeter waves in
cascading analog stages of diodes and transistors, fed by tunable local
oscillators, down to baseband levels that could be usefully analyzed. This
impelled Steinbrecher's obsession with spurious-free dynamic range in mixers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To achieve high dynamic range in broadband mixers, Steinbrecher discovered,
was chiefly a problem of the basic physics of diodes. At the University
of Florida, at ECI Corp. and at MIT, Steinbrecher had pursued studies in
device physics focusing on the theory of PIN junctions--the positive-negative
interfaces that create the active regions in diodes and transistors. How
cleanly and abruptly they switch from on to off--how fully these switches
avoid transitional effects--determines how well they can translate one frequency
to another without spurs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From this experience, Steinbrecher concluded in 1968 that receivers could
be built with at least a thousand times more dynamic range than was currently
believed possible. He assigned his student Robert Snyder to investigate
the issue mathematically, integrating the possible performance of each component
into the performance of a mixer. Snyder's results stunningly continued Steinbrecher's
hypothesis. They predicted that in principle--with unlimited time and effort--the
linearity and dynamic range of a radio could be improved to any arbitrary
standard. In a key invention, Steinbrecher figured out how to create a diode
circuit that could produce a perfect square wave, creating a diode with
essentially zero switching time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher then proceeded to put his theory into practice by developing
the crucial diode and field-effect transistor arrays, mixers, amplifiers
and other components necessary to build a working system of unparalleled
dynamic range. Most of their advances required detailed knowledge of the
behavior of P/N junctions. To this day, the performance of Steinbrecher's
equipment depends on adjustment to unexpected nonlinearities and noise sources
that were discovered as part of Robert Snyder's work but are still not integrated
into the prevailing models of diode behavior.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond radio astronomy, the people who were interested in analyzing signals
of unknown frequencies, rather than tuning into preset frequencies, were
in the field of military intelligence. Enemies did not normally announce
in advance the frequencies they planned to use or how they would modulate
them. Steinbrecher Corp.'s first major contract came in the early 1980s
for remote over-the-horizon radar (ROTHR) systems used to detect planes
carrying drugs from Latin America. Steinbrecher also won contracts to supply
MILSTAR satellite transceivers and 94-gigahertz &quot;eyes&quot; for smart
munitions and jet aircraft.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 these large potential businesses began to attract venture capitalists,
including EG&G venture partners, The Venture Capital Fund of New England
and Raytheon. As often happens, the venture capitalists sought professional
management. They pushed Steinbrecher upstairs to chairman and summoned a
Stanford EE graduate named Douglas Shute to manage the company's move from
a manufacturer of hard-sell mixers Into a producer of revolutionary digital
radios.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still, Steinbrecher Corp. long remained a tiny firm occupying a dingy one-story
building in a Woburn, Mass., industrial park, where it rarely pulled in
more than $ 5 million in revenues. Not until the early 1990s, when its technology
converged with Moore's Law, did the company begin to escape its niche. 
<PRE><B>
Collision With Texas Instruments' DSP</B></PRE>
Indeed, strictly speaking even Moore's Law was not enough to make this Pentagon
turkey fly. Crucial was Texas Instruments' mid-1980s campaign to remake
the digital signal processor into a commodity device comparable to Intel's
microprocessor. Creating development systems and software tools, TI transformed
the DSP from an exotic and expensive printed circuit board full of integrated
circuits into a single programmable microchip manufactured in volume on
the same factory floor the company used to produce hundreds of millions
of dynamic random access memories. The results exceeded all expectations.
Outpacing Moore's Law by a factor of nearly four for some eight years so
far, DSP cost-effectiveness began soaring tenfold every two years. Pricing
the devices for digital radios, Douglas Shute saw that the wideband digital
radio had &quot;moved onto the map as a commercial product.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Also in 1989, a secret contractor asked the company if its radios could
snoop on calls in the cellular band. After gigahertz explorations in radio
astronomy and military projects, the 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth
seemed a piece of cake. Although this national security application never
came through, the idea galvanized the company. If it should need a commercial
market, cellular telephony was a good bet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pull of opportunity, however, is usually less potent than the push of
catastrophe--which is the key reason for socialism's failure. Insulating
the economy from failure, it also removes a key spur for success. For all
the bureaucratic rigmarole of military procurement, producers for the Pentagon
live in a relatively comfortable socialist world of cost plus contracts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, however, just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Steinbrecher
began to get clear signals from Washington that the market for his products
was about to collapse. MILSTAR remained an experimental program; the ROTHR
system was halted after the creation of just four stations with 1,600 mixers;
and suddenly the cellular opportunity was not merely an attractive option--it
was crucial for survival.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Shute and Steinbrecher viewed the cellular scene in the United States,
however, they became increasingly disdainful. These radio companies had
no more idea of what was possible in radio technology than had the MIT engineering
lab when he arrived in 1961. Indeed, Steinbrecher Corp.'s first potential
customer--a wireless colossus--refused even to meet with Shute: The chief
technologist said he had investigated digital radios several years before
and determined they were unable to achieve the requisite dynamic range.
Moreover, at scores of thousands of dollars apiece, digital signal processors
were far too expensive. Most cellular executives, along with their Washington
regulators, seemed stuck in a 1970s time warp when analog still ruled and
DSP was a supercomputer. 
<PRE><B>
Importing Obsolescence</B></PRE>
As a result, the entire industry was convulsed by what Shute and Steinbrecher
saw as a retrograde war over standards. Because Europe in general lagged
far behind the United States in adopting analog cellular technology, the
EEC had sponsored a multinational drive to leapfrog the United States by
adopting a digital standard, which could then be exported to America. The
standard they chose was called GSM (global services mobile), a time-division
multiple-access (TDMA) scheme that exceeded analog capacity by breaking
each channel into three digital time slots. Racing to catch up, the American
industry adopted a similar TDMA approach that also increased the current
system's capacity by a factor of three. With McCaw Cellular in the lead,
American firms quickly committed themselves to deploy TDMA as soon as possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in 1991, Qualcomm unleashed a bombshell Exploiting the increasing power
of DSPs to process digital codes, the company demonstrated a spread-spectrum,
code-division multiple-access (CDMA) modulation scheme that not only increased
capacity some twentyfold over analog but also allowed use of the entire
11.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth in every cell. To prevent interference
between adjoining cells, analog and TDMA systems could use a frequency in
only one cell out of seven.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Much of the industry seemed paralyzed by fear of choosing the wrong system.
To Shute and Steinbrecher, however, these fears seemed entirely reckless.
Using wideband digital radios, companies could accommodate any array of
frequencies and modulation schemes they desired TDMA, CDMA, voice, data
and eventually even video. Shute resolved to adapt Steinbrecher's advanced
radio technology to these new markets. In mid-1991, Shute rushed ahead with
a program to create a prototype cellular transceiver that could process
all 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth and convert it to a digital
bit stream.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The first major customer for the radios turned out to be ADC-Kentrox, a
designer of analog cell extenders designed to overcome &quot;dead zones&quot;
caused by large buildings in urban areas. This system was limited in reach
to the few hundred meters the signals could be sent over analog wires without
deterioration. By converting the signals to digital at the remote site,
the Steinbrecher radio extended this distance from hundreds of meters to
scores of kilometers and allowed the price of the product to remain at $
100,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these gains concealed the potential impact and meaning of the Steinbrecher
technology. Once again, the Steinbrecher radios are being used to complement
the existing system rather than overthrow it. In a similar way, McCaw plans
to buy some $ 30 million worth of Steinbrecher machines to carry through
its cellular digital packet data (CDPD) network. To be provided to 95 percent
of McCaw's regions by the end of 1995, CDPD is a data overlay of the existing
cellular system, which allows users of the current analog system to send
digital data at a rate of 19.2 kilobits per second, compared to the 9.6-kilobit-per-second
rate offered by most modems over twisted-pair wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher radio can survey any existing swath of spectrum in real
time and determine almost instantly which channels are in use and which
are free. It is this capability that convinced McCaw to buy Steinbrecher
data cells despite the commitment of McCaw's putative owner, AT&amp;T, to
sell narrowband units made by Cirrus Logics' subsidiary Pacific Communications
Sciences Inc. (PCSI), which have to scan through channels one at a time.
McCaw is using the Steinbrecher radios as sniffers that constantly survey
the cellular band and direct data bursts to those channels that are not
being used at a particular time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the immediate needs of the marketplace alone justify the adoption
of Steinbrecher data cells. With modems and antennas increasingly available
and even moving sometime next year to PCMCIA slots the size of a credit
card, demand for wireless data is likely to soar.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PCSI is now shipping a quintuple-threat communicator that fits into the
floppy bay of an advanced IBM ThinkPad notebook or an Apple PowerBook, enabling
them to send and receive faxes, make wireless or wire-line phone calls,
dispatch data files across the existing cellular network or send CDPD packets
at 19.2 kilobits per second. Speech recognition capabilities from IBM and
Dragon Systems will come next year to personal digital assistants, permitting
them to read or receive E-mail by voice. Although the first Newtons and
Zoomers have disappointed their sponsors, the market will ignite over the
next two years as vendors adopt the essential form factor of a digital cellular
phone with computer functions rather than providing a kluge computer with
a vaporware phone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, McCaw has more on its mind with Steinbrecher than merely gaining
a second source for CDPD sniffers. By simultaneously purchasing some 10
percent of the company and putting chief technical officer Nicholas Kauser
on the Steinbrecher board, McCaw is signaling not a tactical move but a
major strategic thrust. The Steinbrecher rollout in fact represents McCaw's
stealth deployment of broadband digital capability.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the rival CDPD equipment from PCSI, Hughes and AT&T all can be made
to perform CDPD communications as an overly to the existing cellular phone
system. However, only the Steinbrecher systems can be upgraded to perform
all of the functions of a base station and more, for voice, data and video.
Only Steinbrecher allows the replacement of 416 radio transceivers, one
for each channel, with one broadband radio and some digital signal processing
chips. Only Steinbrecher can replace a $ 1.5 million, 1,000 square foot
cellular base station with a box the size of a briefcase costing some $
100,000 but, thanks to Moore's Law, racing toward $ 10,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen only whether McCaw will have the guts to follow through
on this initiative by completely rebuilding its network to accommodate the
wideband radio being installed at its heart. Self-cannibalization is the
rule of success in information technology. Intel and Microsoft, for example,
lead the way in constantly attacking their own products. But this mode of
life is deeply alien to the telephone business--even an entrepreneurial
outfit like McCaw.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With new software and a simple upgrade to a MiniCell, the Steinbrecher DataCell
will allow the McCaw system to handle all modulation schemes simultaneously--AMPS,
TDMA, CDMA and future methods such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple
Access--obviating the need for hybrid phones. The multiprotocol and aerobatic
capabilities of broadband digital radios could enable McCaw to roll out
a cornucopia of PCS services--for everything from monitoring vending machines
or remote power stations to tracking tracks and packages, and linking laptops
and PDAs--while the rest of the industry is still paralyzed by wrangles
over incumbent users, regulatory procedures, frequency access and radio
standards.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Making channel sizes a variable rather than a fixed function of radios,
Steinbrecher systems offer the possibility of bandwidth on demand. They
could open up the entire spectrum as one gigantic broadband pipe into which
we would be able to insert packets in any empty space--dark fiber in the
air. 
<PRE>
<B>So Stop The Auction</B></PRE>
<BR>
So what does this have to do with the impending spectrum auction? Almost
everything. Strictly speaking, the FCC is leasing 10 year exclusive rights
to radiate electromagnetic waves at certain frequencies to deliver PCS.
This entire auction concept is tied to thousands of exclusive frequency
licenses. It has no place for broadband radios that treat all frequencies
alike and offer bandwidth on demand. It has no place for modulation schemes
that do not need exclusive spectrum space. Continuing to use interference
standards based on analog transmissions that are affected by every passing
spray of radiation, FCC rules fail to grasp the far more robust nature of
digital on-off codes with error correction. By the time the FCC gets around
to selling its 1,500 shards of air, the air will have been radically changed
by new technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum. You buy or
lease spectrum as you would a spread of land. Once you have your license,
you can use it any way you want as long as you don't unduly disturb the
neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher system, by contrast, suggests a model not of a beach but
of an ocean. You can no more lease electromagnetic waves than you can lease
ocean waves. Enabled by new technology, this new model is suitable for an
information superhighway in the sky. You can use the spectrum as much as
you want as long as you don't collide with anyone else or pollute it with
high-powered noise or other nuisances.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Steinbrecher model, you employ the spectrum as you use any public
right of way. You are responsible for keeping your eyes open and avoiding
others. You cannot just buy a 10 year lease and then barge blindly all over
the air in a high-powered vessel, depending on the government to keep everyone
else off your territory and out of your way. The spectrum is no longer dark.
The Steinbrecher broadband radio supplies you with lights as you travel
the information superhighway. You can see other travelers and avoid them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even if Steinbrecher radios did not exist, however, the assumptions of the
auction are collapsing in the face of innovations by Qualcomm and other
spread-spectrum companies. Like Steinbrecher radios, CDMA modulation schemes
allow you to use spectrum without interfering with others. To auditors without
the code, calls seem indistinguishable from noise. But radios with the code
can dig up signals from under the noise floor. Up to the point of traffic
congestion where the quality of the signal begins to degrade gracefully,
numerous users can employ the same frequencies at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This property of CDMA has been tested in Qualcomm's CDMA Omnitracs position
locator and two-way communications system. Mainly used by trucking companies,
it is now being extended to cars, boats, trains and other mobile equipment.
Based on geosynchronous satellites, it operates all across the country,
with some 60,000 units, under a secondary license that forbids Qualcomm
to interfere with the primary license-holders of the same frequencies. Qualcomm's
transceivers on the tops of trucks use a small antenna that issues a beam
six to 10 degrees in width. Because satellites are just two degrees apart,
the Qualcomm beam can blanket several satellites. Other users, however,
are entirely unconscious of the presence of the CDMA signal. Omnitracs has
operated for some six years and has not interfered with anyone yet. 
<PRE>
<B>No More Blind Drivers On The Information Superhighway</B></PRE>
<BR>
<BR>
With an increasing array of low-interference technologies available, the
FCC should not give exclusive rights to anyone. Instead, it should impose
a heavy burden of proof on any service providers with blind or high-powered
systems that maintain that they cannot operate without an exclusive license,
that want to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the surf.
In particular, the FCC should make all the proponents of TDMA, whether in
the American or European GSM systems, explain why the government should
wall off spectrum. The wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth
on demand and send their packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm and Steinbrecher also radically attack
the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the auction is based. Steinbrecher's
radio makes it possible to manufacture new spectrum nearly at will. By putting
one of his MiniCells on every telephone pole and down every alley and in
every elevator shaft, the cellular industry can exponentially multiply the
total number of calls it can handle. At some $ 100,000 apiece and dropping
in price, these MiniCells can operate at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz
just as well as at the two-gigahertz range being auctioned by the government.
It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning off beachfront property, with a long
list of codicils and regulations and restrictive covenants, while the tide
pours in around him and creates new surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, the wideband capability
of the Steinbrecher radio joins CDMA in allowing the use of huge spans of
spectrum that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The Steinbrecher radio
can survey the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services,
UHF television and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions.
For example, the prime territory between 225 megahertz and 400 megahertz,
consisting of some 3,0130 25-kilohertz channels, is entirely occupied by
government and air force communications. But most of the channels are largely
unused. A Steinbrecher radio could sit on those frequencies and direct calls
to empty slots.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An ideal system would combine Steinbrecher broadband machines with Qualcomm's
modulation schemes. Steinbrecher supplies the lights and eyes to find space
in already licensed spectrum bands; CDMA allows the noninvasive entry Into
spans of spectrum that are in active use.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the Steinbrecher system changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot;
or rental. Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, Steinbrecher
radios can reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any
unoccupied territory. As Steinbrecher radios become the dominant technology,
the notion of spectrum assignments allotted in 2,500 specific shards becomes
a technological absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wall Street is beginning to catch on. When Steinbrecher announced in January
a private placement through Alex. Brown, the company wanted to raise some
$ 20 million. The response was overwhelming, and hundreds of frustrated
Investors were left wringing their hands as the new radio left the station.
The sole proprietorship of the mid-1980s with revenues of $ 5 million or
less was moving into sleek new headquarters off Route 198 in Burlington.
Steinbrecher Corp. was becoming yet another of the Moore's Law monsters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the issue for Washington emerges starkly. Do we want a strategy
for MiniCells or for Minitels?

The perennial question of all suitors of fate and fortune now whispers and
resounds through conference resorts, executive retreats and consulting sessions
across the land as business leaders from Hollywood to Wall Street pose with
pundits and ponder the new world of converging technologies. Symbolized
in a famous mandala by MIT's Media Lab, this grand fondue of information
tools_to be served la carte on a flat-panel screen_is foreseen to be a $3.5
trillion feast for American business sometime early next century. Few would
guess that crucial to the emerging mediamorphosis_as king of the flat panel_will
be a slight, graying, bearded man with some 30 teddy bears, Roger Fidler.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler coined the term mediamorphosis as the title of his forthcoming book.
His office in Boulder, Colo., looks out on the panorama of a picturesque
downtown of red brick and neo-Gothic, surrounded by the Rocky Mountain foothills
and sepia sandstone buildings of a mile-high Silicon Valley. Down the hall
is an Apple Computer media center which is developing graphical forms of
AppleLink, the company's on-line network. Down the block is Cablelabs, John
Malone's research arm, which is designing the future of the cable industry.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Fidler, though, is a newspaperman, a veteran of some 32 years in a
business little known for technology. Beginning as an 11-year-old paperboy
in Eugene, Oreg., Fidler went on to serve as a reporter, science columnist
and art director before launching what is now Knight-Ridder Tribune Graphics.
A multimillion-dollar business and reliable profit center, this venture
provides digital graphics for newspapers and video animations for TV stations
across the country over a dedicated network called PressLink, also launched
by Fidler. Now Fidler and his allies working in Knight-Ridder's Information
Design Laboratory are concocting an audacious plan to make the lowly newspaper
the spearhead of the information economy.<BR>
<BR>
Most information companies and executives are betting on him to fail. Barry
Diller, the former ruler of 20th Century Fox, recently circled the planet
of technology on a celebrated pilgrimage from Hollywood to find where the
money would be made in the new information economy. Shunning Fidler's little
lab, he arrived at nearby Cablelabs and resolved on home shopping through
cable TV. He bought into QVC for some $20 million and went into business
with John Malone. After a more corporate investigation, featuring polls
and customer surveys, Robert Allen of AT&T settled to a remarkable degree
on the $14 billion market in electronic games. Since launching an alliance
with Sega, AT&T has been collecting game companies as compulsively as your
kid collects games. It has bought shares of Sierra Online, 3DO, Spectrum
HoloByte and PF Magic.<BR>
<BR>
Moving toward the news trade is IBM. But rather than collaborating with
one of the thousands of newspapers that use its equipment, the computer
giant is trysting with General Electric's NBC in a kind of elephants' waltz
into the sunset of old broadcast media.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these leaders in the new gold rush toward multimedia are getting
it wrong. Fixated by market surveys that map demand for existing video,
they are plunging down dead ends and cul-de-sacs with their eyes firmly
focused on the luminous visions in their rearview mirrors. Blockbuster,
Nintendo and other game and video vendors have good businesses, for the
moment, but they are ballast from the past.

News In The Microcosm

</B></PRE>
The leader who best comprehends the promise of the next phase in information
technology may be Fidler of Knight-Ridder. A student of electronic technology,
he has grasped an amazing and rather obscure fact: of all the information
providers, only newspapers are fully in tune with the law of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the constant rise in the computing power of individual microchips
relative to systems of chips, the law of the microcosm dictates that power
will continually devolve from centralized institutions, bureaucracies, computer
architectures and databases into distributed systems. On the most obvious
level, it caused the fall of the mainframe computer and the companies that
depended upon it, and assured the ascent of personal computers and workstations.
In the next decade, the law of the microcosm will assure the displacement
of analog television, with its centralized networks and broadcast stations,
by computer networks with no center at all. While offering a cornucopia
of interactivity, computer networks can perform all the functions of TV.<BR>
<BR>
With the cost-effectiveness of chips still doubling every 18 months, the
law of the microcosm is not going away. Now it dictates that of all the
many rivals to harvest the fruits of the information revolution, newspapers
and magazines will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
The secret of the success of the newspaper, grasped by Roger Fidler, is
that it is in practice a personal medium, used very differently by each
customer. Newspapers rely on the intelligence of the reader. Although the
editors select and shape the matter to be delivered, readers choose, peruse,
sort, queue and quaff the news and advertising copy at their own pace and
volition.<BR>
<BR>
In this regard, newspapers differ from television stations in much the way
automobiles differ from trains. With the train (and the TV), you go to the
station at the scheduled time and travel to the destinations determined
from above. With the car (and the newspaper), you get in and go pretty much
where you want when you want. Putting the decisionmaking power into the
hands of the reader, the newspaper accords with the microcosmic model far
better than TV does. Newspaper readers are not couch potatoes; they interact
with the product, shaping it to their own ends.<BR>
<BR>
Computers will soon blow away the broadcast television industry, but they
pose no such threat to newspapers. Indeed, the computer is a perfect complement
to the newspaper. It enables the existing news industry to deliver its product
in real time. It hugely increases the quantity of information that can be
made available, including archives, maps, charts and other supporting material.
It opens the way to upgrading the news with full-screen photographs and
videos. While hugely enhancing the richness and timeliness of the news,
however, it empowers readers to use the &quot;paper&quot; in the same way
they do today_to browse and select stories and advertisements at their own
time and pace.<BR>
<BR>
Until recently, the expense of computers restricted this complementarity
to newsrooms and pressrooms. The news today is collected, edited, laid out
and prepared for the press by advanced digital equipment. Reporters capture
and remit their data in digital form. But the actual printing and distribution
of the paper remain in the hands of printers and truckers.<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm has reduced the price of personal computers
below the tag on a high-end TV and made them nearly coextensive with newspapers.
Newspapers and computers are converging, while computers and televisions
still represent radically different modes. It is the newspaper, therefore,
not the TV, that is best fitted for the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
Newspapers can be built on foundations of sand_the silicon and silica of
microchips and telecom. Not only does the computer industry generate nearly
three times the annual revenues of television but computer hardware sales
are growing some eight times faster than the sales of television sets. By
riding the tides of personal computer sales and usage, newspapers can shape
the future of multimedia.<BR>
<BR>
High-definition PC displays will benefit text far more than images. The
resolution of current NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) analog
television_62 dots per inch_is actually ample for most images, particularly
the studio-quality forms that can be converted for digital delivery over
fiber-optic lines. Even the conventional interlaced TV screen_in which alternate
lines are filled in every second_easily fools the eye for video. But for
fully readable text you need the 200 to 300 dots per inch of a laser printer
or super-high-resolution screen. Such screens are now being developed. Overkill
for most images, they could supply the first display tablets with screens
as readable as paper.

Fat Panel's Digital Newspaper

</B></PRE>
After the &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; panorama, the first thing you
see in Roger Fidler's office is a more modest tableau. At a round table
in the corner is a huge teddy bear he calls Fat Panel. Fat Panel is poised
to read a tablet that looks very much like a newspaper, but in fact is a
flat-panel screen some nine inches wide, a foot high and a half-inch thick.
Weighing a little over a pound, far less than the Sunday edition of your
local newspaper, this device_call it a newspanel_might contain a trove of
news, graphics, audio and even video, representing more than a year of Sunday
papers. Through fiber-optic lines and radio links, it might connect to databases
of news and entertainment from around the world.<BR>
<BR>
On the face of this tablet is something that looks a lot like the page of
a newspaper. It contains headlines for featured stories followed by their
first few paragraphs and a jump to an inner page. The jump, unlike that
in your usual newspaper, is electronic and immediate. You click an arrow
with a pen or a mouse_or in the near future, say the word_and the rest of
the story almost instantly appears. If your eyes are otherwise engaged,
you can click on an audio icon and have the story read aloud to you.<BR>
<BR>
Discreetly placed on the bottom of the panel are three sample ads. Since
ads currently supply some 80 percent of the revenues of many newspapers
and magazines, the entire system will rise and fall on the effectiveness
of the ads. However, electronics promises a more total revolution in advertising
than in any other facet of the newspaper outside of printing. This change
comes none too soon. As shown by a general drop in margins from 30 percent
in the mid-1980s to close to 10 percent last year, newspapers are suffering
a sharp decline in conventional advertising revenues, only partly compensated
for by an influx of funds from blow-in coupons and inserts.<BR>
<BR>
In a 1988 prophecy at the American Press Institute in Reston, Va., Fidler
envisaged electronic newspanel ads in the year 2000: &quot;When you touch
most ads, they suddenly come alive. More importantly, advertisers can deliver
a variety of targeted messages that can be matched to each personal profile.
An airline ad offering discount fares to South America attracts me with
the haunting music of an Andean flute. I'm planning to take some vacation
time in Peru next month [Fidler's wife is a Peruvian recording artist],
so I touch the ad to get more information. Before I quit, I'll check the
ad indexes to see if any other airlines are offering discount fares. With
the built-in communicator, I can even make my reservations directly from
the tablet if I choose. The airline's reservation telephone number is embedded
in the ad, and my credit card numbers and other essential data are maintained
in the tablet, so all I would have to do is write in the dates and times
that I want to travel and touch a button on the screen. The information
is encrypted as well as voice-print protected, so there is no risk of someone
else placing orders with my tablet.<BR>
<BR>
Contrary to the usual notion, the electronic newspaper will be a far more
effective advertising medium than current newspapers, television or home
shopping schemes. Rather than trying to trick the reader into watching the
ad, the newspaper will merely present the ad in a part of the paper frequented
by likely customers. Viewers who are seriously interested in the advertised
item can click on it and open up a more detailed presentation, or they can
advertise their own desire to buy a product of particular specifications.<BR>
<BR>
In deference to Fidler, who currently combs the world looking for the best
flat-panel screens, Fat Panel appears to be perusing a story on field emission
displays (FEDs). Even cathode ray tubes with VGA graphics command only 72
dots per inch of resolution. This has been shown to slow down reading by
some 25 percent compared with paper. Readers of Voyager Co.'s tomes on Mac
PowerBooks quickly discover that even Susan Faludi's breezy Backlash or
Michael Crichton's compulsive Jurassic Park or James Gleick's normally riveting
biography of Richard Feynman bog down in subtle but insidious typographical
fuzz. A newspaper with more than one item on the screen would be worse.
The age of electronic text entirely depends on the development of screens
with the definition of a laser printer. For this purpose, FEDs offer great
long-term promise.<BR>
<BR>
While the prevailing liquid crystal displays (LCDs) merely reflect or channel
light, FEDs emit light like a cathode ray tube. Indeed, as currently envisaged
by a Micron Display Technology process, FEDs will array millions of tiny
cathode light emitters that allow bright displays with high resolution and
full-motion video. Although today's FEDs require too much power for full
portability with current battery technology, they represent an inviting
option for newspaper tablets at the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Usable tablets, however, will arrive long before then. At the August Siggraph
show, Xerox demonstrated a 13-inch-diagonal liquid crystal display with
a record 6.3 million pixels, delivering 279 dots per inch of resolution.
The 279 dots per inch provide some three times more definition than the
screen of a Sun workstation_the current desktop graphics workhorse_and negligibly
short of the 300-dot resolution of a laser printer.<BR>
<BR>
Beyond resolution, the key to the newspaper tablet is portability. Portability
means low power. Active-matrix LCDs are inherently a high-power, low-transmissive
medium. The crystals absorb light; the polarizer wastes half the light;
the transistors at each pixel squander power. For high contrast, backlighting
is essential. That sinks another 20 to 30 watts. The higher the resolution,
the worse all these problems become.
<PRE>


<B>


Full-Motion Images Or Full-Motion Users?

</B></PRE>
According to the Fidler vision, the U.S. should stop emulating the Japanese,
who boldly invested some $12 billion in manufacturing capacity for power-hungry
liquid crystal displays used on notebook computers and flat-screen TVs.
Urged by the Clinton administration, this U.S. industrial policy is based
on a strategy of &quot;catch up and copy,&quot; and it will fail. Rather
than chase the Japanese by achieving high resolution at high power to compete
with cathode ray tubes, the U.S. should target high resolution at low power
to compete with paper.<BR>
<BR>
As in semiconductor electronics, the winners will follow a strategy of low
and slow. The law of the microcosm ordains exponential performance gains
from slower and lower-powered transistors packed ever closer together on
individual microchips. Throughout the history of semiconductors_from the
first transistor to the latest microprocessor_the industry has succeeded
by following this law: replacing faster and higher-powered components with
smaller, slower and lower-powered devices. When you pack enough of the slow
and low transistors close enough together, your system may end up operating
faster than a supercomputer based on the highest-powered and fastest discrete
transistors. And it will definitely be more efficient in MIPS per dollar.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm has not been suspended for displays. The Japanese
have been focusing on high-powered screens capable of reproducing the features
of low-end CRTs: full-motion color video. Rather than favoring full-motion
video, however, the U.S. should foster full-motion readers through low-
powered and slow components. It is the people rather than the pixels that
should be able to move. Speed will come in due course.<BR>
<BR>
Demonstrating the first prototype of such a system is Zvi Yaniv of Advanced
Technology Incubator (ATI) of Farmington Hills, Mich. Long among the most
inventive figures in America's eternally embryonic flat-panel industry,
Yaniv was a founder of Optical Imaging Systems, currently the leading U.S.-based
producer, with well under one-percent global market share.<BR>
<BR>
For his tablet, Yaniv uses a material invented at Kent State University
in Ohio called Polymer Stabilized Cholesteric Texture (PSCT). On it he inscribes
pixels in the form of helical liquid crystal devices. The helices are chemically
doped to give them a specific reflectivity: showing all wavelengths or colors
of light that do not match the resonant wavelengths in the helix.<BR>
<BR>
So far ATI has demonstrated images in black and white and in 16 levels of
gray scale. Color, according to Yaniv, poses no theoretical problems. Based
on current experimental successes, it will be achieved within the next two
years. For the first newspanels, however, color is less important than the
high-resolution text capability, which ATI delivers at a breakthrough price.<BR>
<BR>
This technology offers four key advantages over the active-matrix LCD: no
transistors, no polarizers, no color filters, no backlighting. Without these
power-and space-hungry features, Yaniv's screens can achieve higher density
of pixels at far lower energy use. This adds up to far higher resolution
at milliwatts of power (rather than 20 watts) and at far higher manufacturing
yields, and thus far lower cost. Yaniv predicts screens with laser-printer
resolution and with contrast higher than paper, costing between $1 and $2
per square inch (compared with around $10 for current active-matrix devices).
That means 8-1/2-by-11-inch tablets for $100 to $200 in manufacturing cost,
well under Fidler's target price.<BR>
<BR>
Still an R&D project in an intensely competitive industry, ATI may not have
all the answers, but it points the way to a solution. Within the next three
or four years, a portable tablet with laser-printer resolution and contrast
and with hundreds of megabytes of solid-state or hard disk memory will be
purchasable for an acceptable price. Fat Panel's tablet is not merely a
toy; it is the token of a technology that will sweep the world.

News On The Net

</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, precusor solutions are being rolled out on personal computers,
Newtons, Zoomers and other personal digital assistants. Already collecting
and transmitting copy in digital form, reporters and editors could just
as well provide digital content to all the other platforms that are emerging
in the 1990s, from tiny portable personal communications services to supercomputer
knowledge bases.<BR>
<BR>
Also empowering the newspaper industry will be the exploding new world of
boundless bandwidth or communications power in both the atmosphere and the
fibersphere (see Forbes ASAP, December 7, 1992, and March 29, 1993). One
of the most difficult concepts for many business planners to grasp is the
onset of bandwidth abundance: the idea that the electromagnetic spectrum
is not scarce but nearly limitless. The text of a daily newspaper takes
up about a megabyte; a hundred or so black-and-white photographs take up
about 100 megabytes; 25 color photos could run another 100 megabytes, or
even a gigabyte, depending on resolution. Video clips would take about 100
megabytes apiece. With just 500 megabytes, you could throw in the entire
&quot;MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Summing it all up, the total bit-cost of a paper, including video-rich ads,
might be comparable to that of a two-hour movie_perhaps two gigabytes with
compression. Two gigabytes can be transmitted in a second down fiber-optic
lines, in perhaps 10 seconds down a gigahertz cable connection, and in perhaps
a matter of three or four minutes down a twisted-pair copper line equipped
with Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Loop (ADSL) technology, Amati Corp.'s
amazing new phone-company access system. From Digital Equipment Corp. and
Zenith to Hybrid Technologies and Continental Cablevision, several firms
are demonstrating impressive ways to use cable lines for two-way digital
data transmission at a rate of 10 megabits a second or more, which would
fill up a two-gigabyte newspanel in just over three minutes. Electrical
power companies also are laying fiber along with their power lines. All
these pipes are little used for long hours of the night and could be employed
to deliver newspapers.<BR>
<BR>
Complementing this web of wires will be wireless methods of delivery. Cellular
technology is moving toward a code division multiple access (CDMA) protocol
that allows use of the entire spectrum every mile or so, and toward millimeter
wave frequencies that offer gigahertz of capacity. Again, access to these
systems might be expensive on a demand basis, but a newspaper can be sent
whenever space or time is available. Delivery of the basic paper through
wires and fiber and delivery of short updates and extras via the air would
be optimal. Whatever electronic or photonic techniques are used, the laws
of the microcosm and telecosm ordain that distribution of newspapers will
become vastly cheaper, more efficient and more timely than their present
methods: trucks and bicycles.
<PRE>


<B>


The &quot;Domonetics&quot; Of The Word

</B></PRE>
The future of newspapers will not depend on technology alone, however. The
ultimate strength of the &quot;press&quot; comes not from its machinery
but from its &quot;domonetics&quot;_a word that describes an institution's
cultural sources and effects.<BR>
<BR>
Judeo-Christian scripture declares that in the beginning was the word. There
is no mention of the image. Today in information technology, the word still
widely prevails. In 1992, trade publications, newspapers and magazines alone
generated some $73 billion in sales, compared with television revenues of
$57 billion.<BR>
<BR>
In general, images are valuable as an enhancement to words. As Robert Lucky
of Bellcore has pointed out, images are not in themselves usually an efficient
mode of communication. In his definitive work &quot;Silicon Dreams,&quot;
just released in a new paperback edition, Lucky writes that after an evening
of television, &quot;we sink into bed, bloated with pictorial bits, starved
for information.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
People who gush that a picture is worth a thousand words usually fail to
point out that it may well take a million computer &quot;words&quot; to
send or store it. Written words are a form of compression that has evolved
over thousands of years of civilization. In a multimedia encyclopedia, such
as Microsoft's Encarta, some 10,000 images take up 90 percent of the bits,
but supply perhaps one-100th of the information. With the pictures alone,
the encyclopedia is nearly worthless; with the words alone, you still have
a valuable encyclopedia. Most of the work and the worth are in the words.
Supremely the masters of words, newspapers can add cosmetic pictures, sounds
and video clips far more easily than TV or game machines can add reporting
depth, expertise, research and cogent opinion.<BR>
<BR>
More profoundly, the domonetics of the new technologies strongly favors
text-based communications. Video is most effective in conveying shocks and
sensations and appealing to prurient interests of large miscellaneous audiences.
Images easily excel in blasting through to the glandular substrates of the
human community; there's nothing like a body naked or bloody or both to
arrest the eye and forestall the TV zapper.<BR>
<BR>
TV news succeeds because of timeliness and vividness. Compared with TV imagery,
news photos tend to be late and lame. Nonetheless, for all its power and
influence, broadcast television news is a dead medium, awaiting early burial
by newspapers using new technologies.<BR>
<BR>
The TV news problem is summed up by the two-minute rule_the usual requirement
that, short of earthquake or war, no story take more than two minutes to
tell. This rule even applies to the epitome of broadcast news_CNN. It is
entirely a negative rule. The reason for it is not that the audience desires
no more than two minutes of coverage of stories of interest. On any matter
deeply interesting to the viewer, two minutes is much too little.<BR>
<BR>
The rationale for the two-minute rule is that the viewer will not tolerate
more than two minutes of an unwanted story. Its only function is to forestall
the zapper, but its effect is to frustrate any viewer with more than a superficial
interest in a story. Increasingly it reduces TV news to a kaleidoscope of
shocks and sensations, portents and propaganda, gossip and titillation.<BR>
<BR>
The new technologies, however, put individual customers in command. Making
their own first choices among scores of thousands of possibilities, individuals
eschew the hair-trigger poise of the channel surfer. Narrowcasting allows
appeal to the special interests and ambitions, the hobbies and curiosities,
the career pursuits and learning needs of particular individuals. Thus,
the new media open up domonetic vistas entirely missed by mass media.<BR>
<BR>
At the domonetic elevation of newspapers, images are supplementary, not
primary. The new technologies thus favor text over pure video because text_enhanced
by graphics where needed_is by far the best (and digitally most efficient)
way to convey most information and ideas. Where graphics are overwhelmingly
more efficient than alphanumerics_as in visualization of huge bodies of
data or statistics_the newspanel can supply true computer graphics and simulations.
Interactivity, after all, is the computer's forte.
<PRE>


<B>


The $700 Million Incentive

</B></PRE>
As early as 1981, Fidler saw and predicted that computer technology using
flat-panel screens would allow the newspaper business to eliminate much
of its centralized manufacturing and printing plant and much of its distribution
expenses, and deliver the product directly to the customer at half the cost.
He saw that this process would jeopardize neither the branded identity nor
the editing functions nor the essential character of the paper. The distribution
of intelligence would simply permit the customer rather than the newspaper
to supply the display and the printer. This microcosmic shift would drastically
simplify and improve the accessibility and worth of the information, enhancing
the value of newspaper archives and other resources. This step could theoretically
save Fidler's employer, Knight-Ridder, some $700 million, or between half
and two-thirds of its current costs.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler's vision is just as promising for magazines. In effect, his concept
allows newspapers to combine the best features of daily journalism with
the best qualities of specialty magazines. The front pages and shallower
levels of the system will still function like a streamlined newspaper, which
readers can browse, search and explore as they do a conventional paper without
thrashing about through the pages. The deeper levels will function like
magazines, focusing on business, technology, lifestyles, sports, religion
or art. Indeed, to exalt their offerings into an ever richer cornucopia,
news systems will want to collaborate with magazines, just as they often
distribute magazines today with their Sunday papers.
<PRE>


<B>


The Soul Of The New Medium

</B></PRE>
In addition, electronic magazines can excel newspapers in providing a sense
of community through interaction with other readers and authors in new kinds
of dynamic letters, bulletin boards and classified sections. In a sense,
the news panel never ends. Beyond its offering of news, articles and archives,
it opens into new dimensions of interactivity.<BR>
<BR>
As Stephen Case puts it: &quot;Everybody will become information providers
as well as consumers. The challenge is to create electronic communities
that marry information and communications_thereby creating an interactive,
participatory medium. This community aspect is crucial--it is the soul of
the new medium.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The most practical current vessel for this expansion of the press is Case's
own company, America Online, a supplier of an icon-based interface and gateway
to scores of &quot;infobases&quot; and bulletin boards in Vienna, Va., outside
the District of Columbia. Ten percent owned by the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
eight percent controlled by Apple, allied with Knight-Ridder and providing
access to such journals as the New Republic, National Geographic, Time and
Macworld, America Online has uniquely focused on the vital center of the
new market: the point of convergence of newspapers, magazines and computers
in new communities of interest and interaction.<BR>
<BR>
Following this strategy, America Online has invested just $20 million (one-100th
the capital of Prodigy) and devoted half the time, to achieve nearly one-third
the customer base and generate strong profits, in contrast to huge estimated
losses on the part of IBM and Sears. Prodigy is now paying AOL the high
tribute of imitation, making deals with Cox Enterprises Inc. and its 17
newspapers, and with Times-Mirror. Perhaps most audacious in pursuing this
vision, however, is Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd., which recently purchased
Delphi Internet Services Corp., the only on-line service with full Internet
access to home PC users. Delphi already offers an array of news programs
and special-interest conferences, including a popular computer news show
led by moderator Jerry Pournelle that provides interactive dialogs on everything
from abstruse computer features to science fiction. Pournelle and some 300
other conference moderators can function like editors in cyberspace.<BR>
<BR>
Internet is the global agglomeration of data networks that has emerged from
the original Pentagon research network called ARPANET. Growing at some 15
percent a month for several years to a current level of 10 to 20 million
users, Internet has bifurcated into linked commercial and research nonprofit
divisions. As John Evans, president of News Corp.'s Electronic Data, puts
it, explaining the Delphi purchase: &quot;Internet is like a giant jellyfish.
You can't step on it. You can't go around it. You've got to go through it.&quot;
Delphi now plans to go through it using much quicker access systems, including
cable.<BR>
<BR>
Evans declares that these new collaborations between News Corp. and Internet
will &quot;put the 'me' back into media.&quot; His concept, also shared
by Nicholas Negroponte's Media Lab and Apple Computer's Knowledge Navigator,
is an automated news database ultimately supplying the customer with a personal
paper filtered from floods of daily information by an agent programmed to
pursue your own interests. In Fidler's view, however, these digital papers
will succeed only to the extent that they transcend this vision of the Daily
Me.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler prefers the vision of a Daily Us, shaped by human editors rather
than by electronic agents or filters. According to Fidler, the law of the
microcosm will put so much intelligence and storage in the tablet that the
individual can personalize the &quot;paper&quot; every day in a different
way. If, as Case puts it, the soul of the new medium is community, the reader
will want to begin in a particular context, a specially favored &quot;place&quot;
in the world of information, a place with a brand name and identity: a newspaper.
<PRE>

The Computer Imperative

</B></PRE>
Above all, the key to the special advantage of newspapers in the new era
is their great good fortune in being forced to focus on computers. It should
be evident by now to everyone in the information business that the energy,
the creativity, the drive, the gusto, the pulse, the catalyst of this industry
is computers. The magic is in the microcosm of solid-state electronics (doubling
the density of components on a chip every 18 months) and in the concentric
circles of enterprise and invention that surge outward from this creative
core: the some 5,000 software firms, the thousands of manufacturers of chips,
peripherals, printed circuit boards and add-on cards; the double-digit annual
expansion in the armies of computer scientists and software engineers; the
ever growing millions of PC owners devoting their creative energies and
passions to this intoxicating machine.<BR>
<BR>
What the Model T was to the industrial era-the teenage training board, the
tinkerer's love and laboratory, the technological epitome-the PC is to the
Information Age. Just as people who rode the wave of automobile technology-from
tiremakers to fast-food franchisers-prevailed in the industrial era, so
the firms that prey on the passion and feed on the force of the computer
community will predominate in the information era.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, are so many apparently ambitious and visionary executives shrinking
from the central arena to play around on the fringes with TVs and game machines?
Why are American computer executives standing silently aside while the so-called
U.S. Grand Alliance for the Future of Advanced Television, so-called digital
HDTV, adopts an interlaced screen technology that is fundamentally hostile
to computers?<BR>
<BR>
For images, the human eye cannot tell the difference between interlaced
and progressively scanned displays. But interlace poses endless problems
for text and multimedia. Apart from Zenith, the American leaders in the
Grand Alliance are AT&amp;T, General Instrument Corp., MIT, Sarnoff Laboratories
and GE-NBC. All but MIT capitulated to pressure from foreign TV interests
such as Sony, Thomson Corp. and Philips Electronics to betray the American
computer and newspaper industries by adopting a display scheme unsuited
for the multimedia and text programs central to the next computer revolution.<BR>
<BR>
Without text and multimedia capabilities, high-resolution images can open
virtually no markets not already served by current &quot;digitally enhanced&quot;
improved-definition television displays. Limiting the teleconferencing market,
for example, is not the resolution of the screens but the bandwidth of the
network. Without computer capabilities, digital TV is likely to be a large
disappointment.<BR>
<BR>
Claiming to set a standard that can survive deep into the next century,
the Grand Alliance is focusing on short-term economies for manufacturing
TVs tomorrow. These executives are all missing the point and the promise
of the era in which they live. The Information Age is not chiefly about
kicks and thrills, offering games for kids and so-called dildonics for &quot;adults.&quot;
Markets for educational programs and on-line information services are already
growing much faster than game markets. In 1992 in the computer business,
according to the Software Publishers Association, entertainment software
revenues rose some 29 percent to a level of $342 million. Educational software
for the home rose some 47 percent to $146 million. Meanwhile, sales of computers
with modems are rising at about 1,000 percent a year, hugely faster than
the sales of TVs. Online services like America Online and Prodigy have been
growing almost 500 percent per year since 1988. According to current projections
based on microprocessor CPU sales, some 50 million PCs may be sold over
the next 12 months, and perhaps three-quarters of them will contain either
on-board modems or networking systems.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate reason that the newspapers will prevail in the Information
Age is that they are better than anyone else at collecting, editing, filtering
and presenting real information, and they are allying with the computer
juggernaut to do it. The newspapers are pursuing the fastest expanding current
markets rather than rearview markets. They are targeting adults with real
interests and ambitions that generate buying power rather than distracting
children from more edifying pursuits. In the computer age, follow the microcosm
and you will find the money, too.

The world of networks breaks into two polar paradigms. Most familiar is
the Public Switched Telephone Network. From the tiniest transistor flip-flop
on a modem chip through labyrinthine layers of rising complexity on up to
a 4ESS supercomputer switch linking 107,520 telephone trunk lines (itself
consisting of millions of interconnected transistors), the public network
is a vast, deterministic web of wires and switches. Once you are connected
in the public network, your message is guaranteed to get through.<BR>
<BR>
In the public network, bandwidth constantly expands as you rise in the hierarchy.
At the bottom are the twisted-pair copper wires of your telephone that function
at four kilohertz (thousands of cycles per second). At the top are fiber-optic
trunk lines that function at rates close to the 2.9-gigahertz speeds of
the electronic transistors that feed the glass wires. In The Geodesic Network,
writer Peter Huber has described the five tiers of the telephone switching
system as a structure with &quot;the solidity, permanence and inflexibility
of the Great Pyramid of Cheops, which on paper it resembled.&quot; Although
the pyramid has suffered erosion and change in recent years, it remains
mostly in place today: the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
That is one network paradigm. The other paradigm is Robert Metcalfe's. It
germinated in his mind in 1970 as he read a paper by Norman Abramson of
the University of Hawaii given at a computer conference that year. Abramson
told of another paradigm. He called it Aloha. With Aloha, there were no
guarantees.<BR>
<BR>
AlohaNet was a packet radio system used for data communications among the
Hawaiian Islands. Packets are collections of bits led by a header, which
is a smaller collection of bits, bearing an address; they proceed through
a communications system rather like envelopes through a postal system. The
key feature of AlohaNet was that anyone could send packets to anyone else
at any time. You just began transmitting. If you didn't get an acknowledgment
back, you knew the message had failed to get through. Presumably your packets
had collided with others. In Metcalfe's words, &quot;They were lost in the
ether.&quot; At that point, you would simply wait a random period (to avoid
a repeat collision as both parties returned to the channel at once). Then
you would retransmit your message.<BR>
<BR>
To Metcalfe, AlohaNet seemed a beautifully simple network. But Abramson
showed that, because of collisions and other problems, it could exploit
only 17 percent of its potential capacity. A student of computer science
searching for thesis ideas, Metcalfe believed that by using a form of advanced
mathematics called queuing theory he could drastically improve the performance
of AlohaNet without damaging its essential elegance and simplicity. What
Metcalfe, then a graduate student at Harvard, eventually discovered would
bring such networks up toward 90 percent of capacity and make the Aloha
concept a serious threat to the entire structure of the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's discovery is known as Ethernet. Twenty years later, Ethernet
is the world's dominant local area network and, at 47, Metcalfe is known
and celebrated as its inventor. He was also founder in 1981 of 3Com Corp.
of Santa Clara, Calif., the leading producer of Ethernet adapter cards and
a major communications products company. In this era of networking, he is
the author of what I will call Metcalfe's law of the telecosm, showing the
magic of interconnections: connect any number, &quot;n,&quot; of machines
- whether computers, phones or even cars - and you get &quot;n&quot; squared
potential value. Think of phones without networks or cars without roads.
Conversely, imagine the benefits of linking up tens of millions of computers
and sense the exponential power of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the power of the telecosm reproduces on a larger scale - by interconnecting
computers - the exponential yield of the microcosm, a law describing the
near magical effect of interconnecting transistors on chips of silicon:
As increasing numbers of transistors are packed ever closer together, the
transistors run faster, cooler, cheaper and better. Metcalfe's law suggests
that a similar spiral of gains is available in the telecosm of computer
communications.<BR>
<BR>
Already the world economy is beginning to reap these gains. Ethernet now
links more than half of the world's 40 million networked computers, extending
Metcalfe's paradigm and his law. Indeed, the law would suggest that in addition
to his some $20 million of personal net worth from 3Com, Metcalfe's concept
has fostered scores of billions of dollars in global wealth. Led by Novell
Inc., with an equity capitalization of more than $8 billion, the top 15
publicly traded computer networking companies have a total market value
of some $22 billion. Add to that sum the productivity value derived from
the world's 100 million computers as they are increasingly linked in networks,
and you may sense the power of the Metcalfe paradigm.<BR>
<BR>
Today, 20 years after Metcalfe conceived it at Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Center, Ethernet is still gathering momentum, gaining market share and generating
innovations. Between 1989 and 1993, the percentage of America's computers
on LANs rose from less than 10 to more than 60, and most of these gains
were in Ethernets.

Ether Moves to Cable
</B></PRE>
The telecosm's powers could end up saving the American economy from itself.
In an era when the new payroll taxes and regulations of Clintonomics could
end up driving millions of mind workers back into their homes, Digital Equipment
Corp. is now extending Ethernet's range from its current two-mile limit
to some 70 miles. Called Channelworks, the DEC system can run Ethernet on
the some 50 million miles of cable television coax. This will enable potential
scores of millions of telecommuters to access their familiar office LAN,
tap their company E-mail and their corporate databases, and generally make
themselves feel at work while at home. Deployed at a profit and extended
to customers at a flat monthly rate, Ethernet in the neighborhood could
become a massive growth business for the cable industry over the next decade.<BR>
<BR>
As Ethernet spreads and faces the challenge of remote work teams using digital
images, simulations, maps, computer-assisted design schematics, visualizations,
high-fidelity sounds and other exotic forms of data, the system is constantly
adapting. From 3Com spin-offs Grand Junction Networks and LAN Media Corp.
to smart hubmaker David Systems, from Kalpana to Synernetics, from National
Semiconductor to Hewlett Packard, from Cabletron to SynOptics, from AT&T even
to Token Ring leader IBM, scores of companies are pushing Ethernet into
new functions and performance levels. It is emerging in full-duplex, multimedia,
fast, fiber- optic, shielded, unshielded, twisted, thin, thick, hubbed,
collapsed, vertebrate, invertebrate, baseband, broadband, pair, quartet,
coaxial and wireless versions. It now can run at 2.9, 10, 20 and 100 megabits
per second. It has moved from 2.9 megabits per second to 100 megabits per
second and from a few hundred to several million users in some 10 years.
At its present pace of progress, Ethernet will someday run isochronous (real-time)
gigabits per second on linguine.

Aloha ATM, Gushing Cash
</B></PRE>
So why is its boyish-looking inventor - over Metcalfe's anguished protests,
think of Ted Kennedy some 10 years ago - giving up on his baby just as it
enters its roaring 20s? Why is he ready to abandon his basic paradigm in
favor of a return to the public network vision of massive, intelligent switching
systems? Why is he now talking of Ethernet as a &quot;legacy LAN&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
Discoursing this summer from a deck chair on his yacht (a converted lobster
boat) as he breezed down from his Maine retreat to a dock on the Charles
River for his 25th MIT reunion, Metcalfe has the air of an elder statesman.
Though humbly grateful for the benisons of Ethernet, he has seen the future
in a poll of experts prophesying the universal triumph of a powerful new
switching system called asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). &quot;I have found,&quot;
Metcalfe solemnly intones, &quot;an amazing consensus among both telephone
industry and computer networking experts that ATM is the future of LANs.&quot;
Aloha, ATM.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe is not alone among Ethernet pioneers flocking back to Ma Bell's
pyramid of switches. Also leaving Ethernet behind is his onetime nemesis,
Leonard Kleinrock of UCLA, a leading guru of gigabit networks who helped
define the mathematical limits of Ethernet, and is given credit (or is it
blame?) for naming its Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection
protocol (CSMA/CD). Preparing to defect to ATM is Ronald Schmidt, the brilliantly
ebullient technical director of SynOptics, who created the latest Ethernet
rage - sending the signals over telephone wire under the 10baseT standard
(10 megabits of baseband data over twisted pair).<BR>
<BR>
There has not been such a stampede to a new standard since the global rush
to ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) in the early 1980s. Offering
digital phone lines at 144 kilobits per second, ISDN is just now coming
on-line in time to be aced by the megabits per second of Ethernet over cable.<BR>
<BR>
In a prophetic memo launching the concept in 1973, Metcalfe foreshadowed
the secret of Ethernet's success. He wrote: &quot;While we may end up using
coaxial cable trees to carry our broadcast transmissions, it seems wise
to talk in terms of an ether, rather than `the cable'.... Who knows what
other media will prove better than cable for a broadcast network: maybe
radio or telephone circuits, or power wiring, or frequency-multiplexed cable
TV or microwave environments, or even combinations thereof. The essential
feature of our medium - the ether - is that it carries transmissions, propagates
bits to all stations.&quot; In other words, it is the stations, rather than
the network, that have to sort out and &quot;switch&quot; the messages.<BR>
<BR>
The word Ethernet may be capitalized to signify the official standard of
CSMA/CD. Or it may be lowercased to suggest a medium without switches, routers
and other intelligence. In either case, the word &quot;ether&quot; conveys
the essence of the ethernet. An ether is a passive, omnipresent, homogeneous
medium. Long believed essential for the propagation of electromagnetic waves,
the literal existence of an ether was disproven in the late 19th century
by the famous experiments of Albert Michelson and Edward Morley. But the
concept of a figurative ether - a dumb medium of propagation - survives
in modern communications.<BR>
<BR>
The enduring magic of ethernets stems from the law of the microcosm, favoring
distributed terminals over centralized hierarchies, peer networks of PCs
over mainframe pyramids. The microcosm's relentless price/performance gains
on chips have endowed Metcalfe's peer-to-peer scheme with ever more powerful
peers, at ever lower prices. Medium-independent from the outset, the Metcalfe
systems do not require central switching. In an ethernet system the intelligence
is entirely in the terminals, not in the network itself, and most of the
bandwidth is local (where some 80 percent of traffic resides).<BR>
<BR>
Although this ATM is expected to gush jackpots of cash for gaggles of network
companies and investors, it is unrelated to its acronymic twin, automatic
teller machines. Think of ATM rather as an automated postal center that
takes messages (of any size or addressing scheme), chops them up, puts them
into standardized little envelopes and figures the best routes to their
destinations in billionths of a second. The magic of ATM comes from restricting
its services to those uniform envelopes (called cells) of 53 bytes apiece
(including a five-byte address) and creating for each envelope what is called
a virtual circuit through the network. These features make it unnecessary
for intermediate switches in the network to check the address; the cell
flashes through the system on a precomputed course.<BR>
<BR>
A compromise defined by phone companies as the longest packet size that
can handle voice in real time, 53-byte cells are also short enough to be
entirely routed and switched in cheap hardware; i.e., microchips. This means
that the ATM postal center can function at speeds of up to 155 megabits
per second or even higher. Perhaps most attractive of all, ATM can handle
multimedia data, such as digital movies or teleconferences, with voice,
text and video that must arrive together at the same time in perfect sync.
As the world moves toward multimedia, the industry is flocking toward ATM,
the innovation that can make it possible. 
<PRE><B>


Ethernet: A Legacy LAN?
</B></PRE>
By contrast, Ethernet seems old and slow: the vacuum tube of computer communications.
Think of it, crudely, as a system where all the messages are cast into the
ocean and picked up by terminals on the beach which scan the tides for letters
addressed to them. Obviously, this system would work only if the beach terminals
could suck up and filter tremendous quantities of sea water. The magic of
ethernet comes from the ever growing power of computer terminals. The microcosm
supplies sufficiently powerful filtering chips - chiefly digital signal
processors improving their powers some tenfold every two years - to sort
mail and messages in the vasty deep. This is quite a trick. To the experts,
it seems unlikely to prevail for long against the fabulously swift switching
of ATM.<BR>
<BR>
True, there is some confusion about just how, where and when this miracle
cure will arrive. The industry's leading intellectual, Robert Lucky of Bellcore
- a paragon of long- distance networks - predicts that ATM will come first
in local area networks, while Metcalfe, of local area network fame, thinks
it will come first in wide area networks. James Chiddix of Time- Warner
Cable is probably right in predicting digital cable pay- per-view as the
first big ATM customer, using it for broadcasting films in his 500-channel
digital cable TV project in Orlando. But most experts agree that one way
or another ATM will blow away Ethernet during the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, as usual, conventional wisdom is wrong. Ethernet is quietly
preparing for a new era of hegemony in the marketplace for computer connections.<BR>
<BR>
The reason Ethernet prevailed in the first place is that, in the words of
Ronald Schmidt, &quot;it was incredibly simple and elegant and robust.&quot;
In other words, it is cheap and simple for the user. Customers can preserve
their installed base of equipment while the network companies innovate with
new transmission media. When the network moves to new kinds of copper wires
or from one mode of fiber optics to another, Ethernet still looks essentially
the same to the computers attached to it. Most of the processing - connecting
the user to the network, sensing a carrier frequency on the wire and detecting
collisions - can be done on one Ethernet controller chip that costs a few
dollars.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe described the conception of this technology in 1981, &quot;I
explored the advantages of moving the transceiver down out of the ceiling
onto the adapter board in the host computer. I had seen many actual Ethernet
installations in which our brick transceivers were not up in the ceiling
tapping into the ether cable, as they were supposed to be...but instead
were on floors behind computers, dropped in the centers of neatly coiled
transceiver cables.... We were discovering that the people buying personal
computers and workstations in those days were not generally the same kind
of people who were allowed to remove ceiling tiles and string cables through
conduits.... The personal computer revolution was taking place in organizations
from the bottom up.... It was time for Ethernet to be re- invented for bottom-up
proliferation among the personal computer work group revolutionaries.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Using &quot;silicon compiler&quot; design tools to radically reduce the
time to market, Seeq Technology created an Ethernet chip for PCs in time
for a single-board version of the interface unit. Putting the transceiver
on the adapter board eliminated a special transceiver cable and drastically
simplified the system. There is no bulky connection between the coding device
preparing information for the network and the transceiver sending or receiving
the signals on the net. All this processing is done in the computer, on
one printed circuit board, now reduced to the size of a credit card. While
its rival from IBM - Token Ring - requires a mostly proprietary array of
token-passing managers, clocking assignments and other complexities, Ethernet
is an open system. Relative to the alternatives, it offers the possibility
of something near plug-and-play. So advantaged, Ethernet has overcome IBM's
Token Ring, 20 million nodes to 8 million in installed base.<BR>
<BR>
But this does not persuade Ethernet pioneers Bob Metcalfe, Leonard Kleinrock
and Ronald Schmidt. Because ATM can handle all kinds of data fast, Metcalfe
sees it as the &quot;grand unifier&quot; bringing together WANs and LANs
and effecting a convergence of television, telephony and computing in turbulent
multimedia bit streams bursting into our lives early next century. &quot;And
of all the variations of multimedia,&quot; he writes in Infoworld - Metcalfe
is now its publisher - &quot;the one that will drive ATM is personal computer
video conferencing - interactive, two-way, real-time, integrated digital
voice, video and data.&quot; Although Ethernet will persist as a &quot;legacy
LAN,&quot; he says, it cannot compete with ATM in these crucial new roles.
Schmidt makes the same essential case, stressing the need for switch-based
architectures in a world of exotic new media. 
<PRE>
<B>

Kleinrock's Formula
</B></PRE>
Why the pessimism on Ethernet? Bringing mathematics to bear on the argument,
Kleinrock declares that the collision-detecting functions of Ethernet bog
down with large bandwidths, short packets and long distances. Thus, the
system must fail with the onset of fiber highways across the land. The oceans
of Ethernet will simply grow too large to allow efficient detection of collisions
in its depths. With large bandwidths, more packets can be pumped into the
wire or glass before a collision is detected; by that time, most of the
transmission is finished. When the distances get too long, collisions can
occur far from the transmitting computer and take longer to be detected.
The shorter the packets, the worse these problems become.<BR>
<BR>
As Kleinrock computes these factors, the efficiency of Ethernet is roughly
a function (a), computed as five times the length of the line in kilometers
times the capacity of the system in megabits per second, divided by the
packet size in bits. When a exceeds a certain level (Kleinrock sets it at
0.05), Ethernet's efficiency plummets.<BR>
<BR>
With ATM packet sizes needed for voice traffic - or even at the minimum
Ethernet packet size of 72 bytes - any Ethernet with a capacity much higher
than 10 megabits per second exceeds this tipping point. Therefore, high-speed
Ethernets must either use packets too long for voice or shrink in extent
to far less than three kilometers. This is what Howard Charney's Grand Junction
and its rival LAN Media propose with Fast Ethernet. Noticing that 10baseT
hubs have reduced the length of Ethernet connections by a factor of 10,
Ron Crane, founder of LAN Media, suggests that this change allows acceleration
of the system by an equal amount: to 100 megabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
But this seems a one-time fix that fails to address the multigigabit world
of fiber optics. At some point, Kleinrock, Schmidt and Metcalfe agree, ad
hoc fixes will begin to fail and ATM (or possibly some other system) will
begin to prevail. Using Kleinrock's formula, that point is here today, with
100-megabit- per-second Ethernet lines.<BR>
<BR>
As an increasing share of network traffic takes the form of pictures, sounds,
simulations, three-dimensional visualizations, collaborative work sessions,
video teleconferences and high- resolution medical images, the Ethernet
model already seems to be foundering, according to many expert projections.
The triumph of ATM, so it would seem, is just a matter of time.<BR>
<BR>
Time, however, is precisely what is absent from all these projections. Ethernet
is a system based on the intelligence of terminals; ATM is a system based
on the intelligence of switches and networks. All the arguments for ATM
miss the law of the microcosm: the near annual doubling of chip densities,
the spiraling increase of computer power surging on the fringes of all networks
as transistor sizes plummet over the next decade. 
<PRE>
<B>

The Power of Exponents
</B></PRE>
Amazingly, most technology prophets fail to come to terms with the power
of exponents. You double anything annually for long - whether deforestation
in ecological nightmares or transistors on silicon in the awesome routine
of microchip progress - and you soon can ignite a sudden moment of metamorphosis:
a denuded world or a silicon brain.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after the year 2000, semiconductor companies will begin manufacturing
microchips with more than a billion transistors on them - first as memories,
and soon after as processors. A billion transistors could accommodate the
central processing units of 1,000 Sun workstations or 16 Cray supercomputers.
This means roughly a millionfold rise in the cost-effectiveness of computing
hardware over the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Intelligence in terminals is a substitute for intelligence in networks;
switching and routing functions migrate from the center of the web to the
increasingly powerful computers on its fringe. Looming intelligence on the
edge of the network will relieve all the current problems attributed to
ethernets and will render the neatly calculated optimizations of ATM irrelevant.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the law of the telecosm is launching a similar spiral of performance
in transmission media, ultimately increasing their bandwidth, also by a
factor of millions. Bandwidth is a replacement for switches. If you can
put enough detailed addressing, routing, prioritization and other information
on the packets, you don't have to worry about channeling the data through
ATM switches. The emergence of dumb, passive all-optical networks with bandwidths
some ten- thousandfold larger than existing fiber optics will obviate much
of the pressure on switches. Combining microcosm and telecosm in explosive
convergence makes it nothing short of ridiculous to expect a system optimized
for 1995 chip densities and fiber capacities to remain optimal in 2013,
when Metcalfe foresees the final triumph of ATM, or even in 2001.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, ATM will be useful in various applications before then. Sun and
SynOptics envisage putting ATM ports in future workstations where ISDN ports
mostly languish today. AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint and Wiltel will incorporate
ATM switches in their long- distance networks. Time-Warner may indeed use
them for distributing movies. In general, however, companies that rely on
an apparent trend toward centralized switches will be disappointed.<BR>
<BR>
Cable firms will do better by sticking to the ethernet paradigm of dumb
bandwidth that has made them the envy of all in the emerging era of digital
video. IBM and other computer firms with powerful ethernet and fiber technologies
should not rush to adopt the public network paradigm. Telephone companies
in particular should maintain an acute interest in their ongoing experiments
with all-optical networks and other passive optical technologies. Any near-term
successes of ATM, afflicted with the many glitches and growing pains of
any new technology, are likely to come too slowly to deflect the continuing
onrush of ethernets.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet prevails because it is dumb. In the old world of dumb terminals
- whether phones, IBM displays or boob tubes - a network had to be smart.
There was time even to put human operators into the loop, and a need to
concentrate programming at one central location. But in the emerging world
of supercomputers in your pocket or living room, networks will have to be
dumb bandwidth pipes. What the coming array of desktop supercomputers and
cheap massively parallel servers will need is passive dark fiber, mostly
unlit by switching intelligence. Dark fiber can allow for the huge variety
of data forms and functions, protocols and modulation schemes that is emerging
in the new era of convergence between phones and computers.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet is the protocol for a dumb pipe, a passive ether. That is why it
fits so well on a cable TV line and why it will fit even into the multigigabit
world of a multimedia future. 
<PRE><B>


The Return of Aloha
</B></PRE>
The dumb networks of the fibersphere will be ethernets. These all-optical
links that have been made possible by the creation of erbium-doped amplifiers
and other passive devices give access to the full 25,000-gigahertz bandwidth
of fiber optics (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; December 7, 1992).
In these networks, fiber changes from a substitute for copper to a substitute
for air. Just as the microcosm put entire computer systems on single slivers
of silicon, the telecosm will put entire communications systems on seamless
webs of silica. Terminals will tune into the infrared colors of the fibersphere
like radios tuning into the frequencies of AM or FM.<BR>
<BR>
As chips and fiber are hugely expanding their performance and bandwidth,
information traffic is rapidly migrating from the wires to the air. Although
many experts contend that the radio frequencies in the air - the electromagnetic
spectrum - are running out, communications systems now use only a tiny sliver
of spectrum, well under one percent of the usable span. As shown by Cellular
Vision's success in sending cable TV signals over the air at 28 gigahertz,
it is now possible to move up the spectrum into the vast domains of microwaves;
other experiments show that network traffic in these portions of the spectrum
can be accommodated with error rates of less than one in a billion, enough
to avoid extensive error correcting.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, the replacement of today's 30-mile cells with tomorrow's
closely packed microcells means an exponential rise in available spectrum
and an exponential reduction in power usage. The replacement of analog systems
with digital systems using code division multiple access (CDMA) will allow
the reuse of all frequencies in every cell, thus further expanding available
spectrum (see &quot;New Rules of Wireless,&quot; March 29, 1993). A company
called ArrayCom in Santa Clara, Calif., is developing a new system, called
spatial division multiple access (SDMA), based on smart antennas that can
follow an individual communicator as it moves through a cell. This technology
would allow the use of all the available spectrum by each &quot;phone.&quot;
<PRE>
<B>

Back to the Real &quot;Ether&quot; Net
</B></PRE>
Inspired by a radio network, ethernet is well adapted for this new world
of wireless. The increasing movement of data communications into the air
- the real ether - will give new life to Metcalfe's media-independent system.
Cellular systems already operate with protocols similar to CSMA/CD. As microcells
fill up with digital wireless traffic, all networks will increasingly resemble
the most popular computer networks. In the ether, links will resemble ethernets
far more than ATMs.<BR>
<BR>
The coming age of bandwidth abundance in glass and in air converges with
an era of supercomputer powers in the sand of microchips. We should build
our systems of the future - the cathedrals of the Information Age - on this
foundation of sand. It will not disappoint us.<BR>
<BR>
Whether in glass or in air, the basic protection of Ethernet is not smarts
but statistics. Ethernet is a probabilistic system. This fact has caused
endless confusion. Because a probabilistic system cannot guarantee delivery
of data on a specific schedule, or at all, many experts have concluded that
Ethernet is unsuited for critical functions, or for isochronous data inherent
in multimedia - with voice and video that must arrive in real time. When
and whether anything arrives is a stochastic matter.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, if there is enough bandwidth for the application, ethernets
work just as reliably and well as their deterministic rivals, even for advanced
video traffic. As Kleinrock observes, for many image applications, very
long packets can be as effective as very short ones. The long packets become
a virtual circuit connection, somewhat like a phone call. It is likely that
perhaps 80 percent of all multimedia will be sent in burst mode, with a
store-and-forward protocol, rather than isochronously in real time. Broadband
ethernets will be better for burst mode than ATM's short packets.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, the combination of intelligence at the terminals and statistics
in the network is more robust than the mechanistic reliability of Token
Rings or ATM switches. As Metcalfe points out in explaining the triumph
of his vision over Token Ring, Ethernet is a simple system that is stabilized
by its own failures. The CSMA/CD algorithm uses collision detection in a
negative feedback loop that delays retransmission in exponential proportion
to the number of collisions, which is a reliable index of the level of traffic.
Thus thriving on a worst- case assumption of frequent failure, Ethernet
has outpaced all rivals that guarantee perfect performance and depend on
it.

Metcalfe's Law: Transcending His Own Doubts
</B></PRE>
Now, in ATM, Ethernet is faced with a new paragon of determinism offering
high speeds and rigorous guarantees, a new version of the public network
paradigm, a new pyramid of switching power. But Metcalfe's law and legacy
may well win again, in spite of his own defection.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe explains, &quot;Ethernet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;
The same could be said of all the devices of the microcosm and telecosm.
Both of the supreme sciences that sustain computer and communications technology
- quantum theory and information theory - are based on probabilistic rather
than deterministic models. They offer the underpinnings for an age of individual
freedom and entrepreneurial creativity.<BR>
<BR>
Humankind's constant search for deterministic assurance defies the ascendant
science of the era, which finds nature itself as probabilistic. To Einstein's
disappointment, God apparently does throw dice. But chance is the measure
of human ignorance and the mark of divine knowledge. Chance thus is the
paradoxical root of both fate and freedom.<BR>
<BR>
Nations and networks can win by shunning determinism and finding stability
in a constant shuffle of collisions and contentions in ever expanding arenas
of liberty.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an acceptance of setbacks, capitalist markets are more robust
than socialist systems that plan for perfection. In the same way, successful
people and companies have more failures than failures do. The successes
use their faults and collisions as sources of new knowledge. Companies that
try to banish chance by relying on market research and focus groups do less
well than companies that freely make mistakes and learn from them.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an ability to absorb shocks, stochastic systems in general are
more stable than deterministic ones. Listening to the technology, we find
that ethernets resonate to the deepest hymns and harmonies of our age.

</H3>
<HR>In the spring of 1989 when Michael Bookey first visited the Middle School
in Issaquah, Wash., to help the school system with its computers, he was
reminded of his early ventures into Communist China. After 20 years of working
with computer networks, to enter Issaquah seemed to me like encountering
an exotic tribe of primitives untouched by the modern world.<BR>
<BR>
The only sign of modern technology was a forlorn computer room full of Radio
Shack TRS-80 machines, most of which had broken down. Then he learned that
as a remedy for this problem, the district had recently voted a levy of
$2.7 million for outlays on high technology.<BR>
<BR>
Lacking any better ideas, the school system had decided to distribute the
money equally among the teachers, to spend as they wanted. What they wanted
turned out to be VCRs, incompatible CD- ROM drives and a random selection
of computers, printers and other gear to be scattered through the schools
under the influence of a flock of computer salespeople attracted to the
site by the pool of mandated money.<BR>
<BR>
To Bookey, this remedy seemed worse than the disease. It meant that the
bulk of the money would be wasted, further estranging both taxpayers and
students from the most powerful technologies of their era. Bookey wanted
school officials to know that the most powerful technology is not computers,
but computers joined in networks.<BR>
<BR>
Explaining the magic of networks, Bookey asks you to imagine a car plumped
down in the jungle. Checking it out, you might find it a very useful piece
of equipment indeed. A multipurpose wonder, it would supply lights, bedding,
radio communications, tape player, heat, air conditioning, a shield against
arrows and bullets, and a loud horn to frighten away fierce animals. In
awe of the features of this machine, you might never realize that the real
magic of a car comes in conjunction with asphalt.<BR>
<BR>
For the first 10 years of the personal computer era, according to Bookey,
we have used our computers like cars in the jungle. We have plumbed their
powers for processing words and numbers. All too often, home computers have
ended up in the closet unused. We have often failed to recognize that most
of the magic of computing stems from the exponential benefits of interconnection.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, the interconnections come on individual chips, as ever
smaller transistors crammed ever closer together work faster, cooler and
cheaper, enhancing both the capability and the speed of the processor. The
microcosm strewed some 100 million personal computers around the world and
endowed individuals at workstations with the creative power of factory owners
of the Industrial Age.<BR>
<BR>
Just as the microcosm generates exponential gains from increasing connections
on chips, the telecosm generates exponential gains by increasing connections
between chips, powerful microcomputers in themselves. These links between
increasingly potent microchips will soon dominate the world of communications.<BR>
<BR>
The networking industry therefore faces a drastic transition from a people-to-people
regime to computer-to-computer. This change is so radical that it resembles
a mutation that creates a new species. People communicate in domains of
time and space entirely alien to the world of computers. To a person, a
one- second delay on a voice line seems hardly noticeable; to a computer,
one second may mean a billion computations that would take hundreds of human
lifetimes to accomplish by hand.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, people can transmit or receive only a small stream of information
at a time. They want relatively narrow bandwidth connections for a relatively
long period, a 64-kilobit- per-second voice link, for example, for a 10-minute
phone call.<BR>
<BR>
Computers, on the other hand, can handle hundreds of millions or even billions
of bits a second. They often need many millions of bits of bandwidth for
a short time fractions of seconds. As industry shifts from a human scale
of time and space to a computer scale, the systems and structures in existing
telephone and broadcast networks become almost irrelevant. Essentially,
all other forms of networks: voice, text, video and sound, are rapidly giving
way to various new forms of multimedia computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Driving this overwhelming force of change is the alchemy of interconnections,
working in the telecosm with the same logic and feedback loops as connections
in the microcosm. hile dumb terminals such as phones and TVs use up bandwidth
without giving anything back, computers are contributors to bandwidth, not
consumers of it.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the more computers, the more bandwidth. Not only is the network
a resource for each new computer attached to it, but each new computer is
also a resource for the network. Each new computer expands the potential
switching and processing capacity of the system by a large multiple of the
increasing demands it makes on other switches and processors.<BR>
<BR>
As ever more powerful computers are linked ever more closely, whether in
digital cellular microcells or in webs of fiber and coaxial cable, usable
bandwidth expands explosively. Governing the expansion of networks, the
law of the telecosm is just as potent as the law of the microcosm. Indeed,
in enhancing the productivity of organizations, the telecosm consummates
the microcosmic miracle.

Microsoft Windows for Jungle Cars</B></PRE>
The creator in the early 1970s of what may have been the world's first fully
functioning system of corporate electronic mail, Bookey was quick to foresee
this radical shift from person- to-person to computer-to-computer communications.
Pursuing his vision of networks, Bookey in 1982 spurned a possible job at
Microsoft on the grounds that the company was outfitting cars for the jungle,
a decision that probably cost him several million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Instead, he joined Seafirst Bank in Seattle, where he made history (in the
form of a reference in John Sculley's autobiography, Odyssey) by pushing
the purchase of a thousand Macintosh computers for bank networks at a crucial
time for Apple.<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 Bookey left the bank to join Doelz Co., a startup in Irvine, Calif.,
that built advanced computer network equipment that he had used at Seafirst.
For Doelz, Bookey designed software and spearheaded marketing. A so-called
cell-based network, the Doelz system broke up a stream of data into short,
equal-sized packets, each with its own address, to be sent through the nodes
of the net in nanoseconds, like letters accelerated a trillionfold through
the branches of the post office.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey was not necessarily wrong in choosing this technology over Microsoft's.
In the form of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) systems, this essential
approach, based on short, uniform packets that can be switched at gigabit
speeds in hardware, is now the rage of planners in the computer networking
industry.<BR>
<BR>
ATM is seen as the crucial enabler for digital networks combining voice,
data and video in so-called multimedia applications. Bill Gates now calls
multimedia the future of his industry. Although many observers still see
ATM as a futuristic technology, Bookey believes its future is nearly now.
From the humblest personal digital phone to the most advanced supercomputer,
computer-to-computer links will dominate the entire universe of telecommunications,
and ATM will dominate network switching.<BR>
<BR>
Doelz, however, was ahead of its time and failed to survive a tangled legal
imbroglio with AT&T in 1988. So Bookey took a big profit on his California
residence and returned with his wife Robin and daughter Erin to Seattle,
where he had grown up and set records in the mile on the track at the University
of Washington. He bought his dream house on the top of Cougar Mountain in
Issaquah, with a view of the very Twin Peaks made famous in the television
series and put out his shingle as a network consultant under the name Digital
Network Architects (DNA). Almost as an afterthought, the Bookeys sent Erin
to Issaquah Middle School.<BR>
<BR>
Having designed networks around the world, Bookey had often seen their powerful
impact on business organizations, such as banks. Bookey believed that networks
could have a similar revitalizing impact on schools. Like banks, schools
are essentially information systems that have brought their Industrial Age
hierarchy into the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
Creating networks in schools, however, posed many special problems. Most
school systems, like Issaquah, were largely unaccustomed to managing technology.
The system would need to create a large MIS (management information services)
organization just to keep the network functioning. Then, as the teachers
at Issaquah hastened to point out to Bookey, there was the problem of students.
Impulsive, mischievous and messy, they in no way resembled the disciplined
employees of a corporation. Speaking from grim experience, some of the teachers
told Bookey that his network plans would succeed only if the computers were
reserved exclusively for teachers and if students were barred entirely.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey, however, thought there had to be a way to bring the magic of networks
to America's increasingly troubled school systems. The secret would be to
recognize that, just as computers are not consumers of but contributors
to bandwidth, students should be seen not as a problem, but as a precious
resource in launching the networks that inform the Information Age.

Networks as Productivity Engines</B></PRE>
Ever since Adam Smith first maintained that the division of labor, the spread
of specialization, is the catalyst of the wealth of nations, economists
have seen the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and specialties as
the driver of efficiency and growth. The key force expanding specialization
in the contemporary capitalist economy is networks. Indeed, networks, by
their nature and purpose, refine the division of labor.<BR>
<BR>
In the financial industry, for example, networks allowed the proliferation
of specialized institutions. In the ever-shifting kaleidoscopes of American
finance, some institutions went local, some global. Some managed car loans,
credit cards or other consumer services; some handled mortgages, mutual
funds or real estate trusts; still others stressed computer leases, junk
bonds, venture capital or large corporate accounts.<BR>
<BR>
The pell-mell fragmentation of American finance during the 1980s into an
ever more refined division of labor enabled the U.S. to lead the world in
levels of capital efficiency, with more economic growth per dollar of savings
than any other country. Each financial business did not have to repeat all
the work of all the rest, and each became more efficient at a particular
task.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey believes that networks can have a similar effect on that other great
information-processing industry: education. Why should every school have
an all-purpose library and a French teacher and a calculus scholar and a
health center and an administrative office? Why should every school have
an entire complement of buildings?<BR>
<BR>
With all the schools on networks, individual schools could specialize in
particular subjects, functions and resources, as financial companies do.
Education would not have to happen exclusively, or even mostly, in schools.
The explosive spread of networks is now the prime mover of the U.S. economy,
allowing all industries to break down into patterns of specialization unbound
by place and time. And now the government wants to get into the act.

Superhighways in the Sky</B></PRE>
Zoom through tax-hike tollgates and glide out onto data superhighways; this
is the new mantra of American industrial policy. Add the further fillip
of investment for educational infrastructure and you can sweep up the ramp
toward the federal treasury and drive out with a bonanza.<BR>
<BR>
In this new era of the big bands, there are now some 10 bills before Congress
to foster vast new networks with large bandwidth, or communications capacity.
Some $2 billion has already been authorized and $765 million appropriated
this year for various programs related to a National Research and Educational
Network (NREN).<BR>
<BR>
Candidate Bill Clinton presented the concept of NREN as Ra national information
network to link every home, business, lab, classroom and library by the
year 2015. President Bill Clinton, vice-president Albert Gore and a raft
of advisors all celebrate the highway as the metaphor for the future information
economy. Gore points out that his father was a leader in building the Interstate
Highway System in the early 1950s; Albert Jr., wants to play a key role
in building the information highways of the 1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, data superhighways would seem to be the fulfillment of the fibersphere;
the way to create the vast new infrastructure of fiber-optic lines that
will bring the full promise of digital video and multimedia communications
to all citizens.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, is Mike Bookey so worried? He would seem to be the perfect NREN
champion. Bookey has pursued networks through most of his career and now
is focusing on networks for education. In explaining the importance of computer
connections, he has even long used Gore's favored highway metaphor. Bookey
thinks that the federal superhighwaymen do not grasp the nature of networks
and how they grow. In systems work we have a rule: You design top down,
but you build bottom up.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey sees the creation of networks as an organic process, driven by public
demand, shaped by human needs and rooted in a moral universe of growth through
sharing. It is the experience of building the network that creates the expertise
to maintain and use it. In all these processes, big government is nearly
irrelevant.

None of the Above</B></PRE>
For the past 10 years, Washington, D.C. experts have been wringing their
hands over the supposedly unbearable costs of building broadband networks
and the urgent need for large federal funding. Analysts have been ruminating
over the question of who would spearhead the creation of broadband nets;
the phone companies, the cable television companies or the government.<BR>
<BR>
Before any of these forces could act, however, it became clear that the
answer would be none of the above. The hardest part of the job was accomplished,
with astonishing speed, by computer and networking companies. The rest of
the work is well under way, as cable and phone companies adopt the computer
technologies.<BR>
<BR>
As recently as 1989, only seven percent of America's personal computers
were connected to local area networks. By 1991 45 percent were connected,
and by 1993, close to two-thirds were linked to LANs. Growing even faster
than LANs is the internetworking business: the interconnection of existing
local area nets in wide area networks.<BR>
<BR>
Building internetworking gear or accessories, such companies as Cisco Systems,
Cabletron, Wellfleet, 3Com and SynOptics are among the highest flyers in
the technology stock market boom. Cisco, for example, is growing some 50
percent a year and commands a market value of almost $6 billion, comparable
to that of Digital Equipment Corp. Cabletron has hiked its revenues some
16-fold in the last five years.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these connections run at some 10 megabits per second, enough for
high-resolution digital video, but inadequate for the more exotic traffic
in images predicted for use later in the decade. Increasingly, however,
the connections are fiber- optic lines or are broadband coax, which is nearly
as good as fiber for short-distance transport. The potential of fiber is
almost unlimited (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; Forbes ASAP, December
7, 1992).<BR>
<BR>
Although moving more slowly than the computer firms, telephone and cable
companies are rushing to lay fiber ever deeper into the nation's neighborhoods.
Spending some $2 billion (as much as NREN), Telecommunications Inc. (TCI)
vows, according to CEO John Malone, to have 90 percent of its subscriber
households served by fiber to the curb by 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Bringing fiber into the local loop at a slower pace, the telephone companies,
led by Bell Atlantic, also are forging ahead with ingenious new ways to
make their twisted-pair copper connections carry as much as six megabits
per second of digital information. Wireless technology is also moving into
the local loop for video delivery (see &quot;The New Rule of Wireless,&quot;
Forbes ASAP, March 29, 1993).<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. networking industry is not in need of fixing. The U.S. currently
commands some three-fourths of all the world's LANs and perhaps 85 percent
of its internetworks. Although Gore and others justify their industrial
policies by referring to the imperious plans of Japan, the U.S. currently
commands about three times the computer power per capita as Japan, some
10 times as many computers attached to networks, and an installed base of
broadband fiber and cable nearly 10 times as large. The remarkable thing
is that the U.S. government is so eager to fix a fabulously flourishing
system that is the envy of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The electronic and photonic networking industries actually resemble highways
in only the most superficial way. The highway construction trade has not
advanced substantially in 50 years. By contrast, the networking trade is
the fastest-moving part of the ever-accelerating computer industry and doubles
its cost- effectiveness every year. Although interconnecting government
laboratories, contractors and supercomputer centers with fiber is desirable,
a massive government network is not. Issaquah offers better guidance for
the future.... But first it will be necessary to deal with the abiding menace
of the student problem. 
<PRE>

Overcoming the Student Problem</B></PRE>
&quot;What do you think you are doing? Answer me,&quot; the voice insisted
with the I've-got-you-squirming-now confidence of a teacher who has caught
a pupil red-handed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just lookin' around,&quot; grumbled Lee Dumas, the red-headed 13-
year-old, trying to sound natural. Glimpsing a telltale red screen of network
management among the array of blue displays used in the keyboarding class,
the teacher had walked up silently behind Dumas as he broke into the student
lists, software programs and grades, and was on the verge of entering the
administrative server.<BR>
<BR>
Dumas was a bad kid. No one at Maywood Middle School (one of the 16 campuses
in Issaquah) doubted that. His teachers called him &quot;obnoxious&quot;
or even &quot;brain-dead.&quot; He set what he believes was an all-time
record at Maywood by being detained after class some 60 times for insubordination.
Using the approved psychobabble, he says, &quot;I had problems with authority.
I couldn't accept teachers ordering me around.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
After being caught breaking into the computer system, Dumas was dragged
up to the principal's office. Neither the teacher nor the principal could
figure out the nature of the crime or judge its seriousness. For help, they
summoned Don Robertson, the administrator assigned to Issaquah's Technology
Information Project (TIP). He considered the situation gravely and recommended
severe punishment. Toward the end of the meeting, however, he turned to
Dumas and said, &quot;With your talent, you should become the sheriff rather
than the outlaw. Why don't you come down and join TIP?&quot; Since no one
had previously detected any talent in Dumas, this comment made a sharp impression.<BR>
<BR>
About a week later, he showed up sheepishly at Robertson's door. To school
administrators, kids like Dumas might be a problem, but to Bookey, Issaquah's
9,000 students seemed a wonderfully cheap resource. By training the students
to build and maintain the networks, he could make the $2.7 million the foundation
of an enduring educational resource.<BR>
<BR>
In the end, the Issaquah network was almost entirely built by students between
the ages of 12 and 17. Using students to solve the problems of network maintenance
and support and thus reduce the real costs by some 80 percent was Mike Bookey's
solution to the perplexing problem of computers in schools.<BR>
<BR>
The first step in the Issaquah networking venture, in the spring of 1990,
cost no money and arose from pure necessity. Just as in businesses across
the country, the initial motive for networking was the arrival of laser
printers from Hewlett Packard. Bookey began by giving his 10-person TIP
team a pile of manuals and having them install a basic network connecting
two PCs, an Apple II and a Macintosh to a laser printer. This step enhanced
the value of all the computers at a small fraction of the cost of buying
new dot-matrix printers for each. Four of the ten students managed to cobble
together the network in about a month. They learned the intricacies of pulling
twisted-pair wiring for 10baseT Ethernet computer connections running at
the standard rate of 10 million bits (megabits) per second.<BR>
<BR>
The next step was to add a hard disk containing school files and software
programs. Using both Apples and IBM PCs, the Issaquah network from the beginning,
had to handle a variety of communications protocols. If the network was
to connect to anything outside itself to the school's administration building
or the school system's libraries, for example, Issaquah would have to install
equipment that could sort out messages from different computers. This meant
Issaquah joined the market for multiprotocol routers. A router is a device
that sits on a computer network and reads the addresses on all the message
packets that pass by. If the address is on another network with a different
protocol, the router creates a new envelope for the packet and sends it
to the other network.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with all their routers and Ethernet wiring, the Issaquah networks
slowed to a crawl as soon as they had to connect outside a building. There,
they had to depend on what is known as the Public Switched Telephone Network,
where everything turns to analog and drowses down to some 2,400 bits per
second.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey demonstrated that the school could save money on its voice communications
by buying a digital T-1 line that multiplexes 24 phone circuits onto a 1.544-megabit-per-second
system. Since 12 of the 24 circuits would be enough to satisfy the school's
internal voice needs, the rest of the T-1 line, some 760 kilobits per second,
could be devoted to the data communications needs created by the school's
new Ethernets. Thus, while getting a cheaper solution for its voice traffic,
the school increased its data bandwidth by some sevenfold for free.<BR>
<BR>
Once these connections were in place, the students acquired a Microsoft
Mail program to incorporate E-mail in the system. Soon, this became the
heart of the network, with both students and teachers using it constantly
to handle papers, consult teachers in other schools in the system, make
reports to the state and interact with parents and students. E-mail became
so central to the functioning of Issaquah that when the computers were down
teachers would talk of canceling classes.<BR>
<BR>
To E-mail were added connections to Internet, the global research and education
network launched some 33 years ago as DARPA Net (the Pentagon's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency). Since Internet was civilianized in 1983,
adopting the TCP/IP networking standard, it has been expanding its traffic
at a pace of some 15 percent per month. Between 1981 and 1992 the number
of computers connected to Internet rose from 281 to 1.1 million. Through
Internet, the students could search through a variety of databases for material
for a paper or connect to Japan for help in learning Japanese.<BR>
<BR>
Along with several other Issaquah students, Aaron Woodman, Jr., a burly
boy with his long blonde hair in a ponytail, became so adept at using Internet
that he now gives speeches to national conferences on the subject. The speechmaking
needs that grew out of the Issaquah project have imparted valuable lessons
in English communications for the students.<BR>
<BR>
All these developments did not occur without administrative resistance.
But the administration eventually became a prime beneficiary. Soon, the
computer networks in the Issaquah system were connected by a T-1 line to
the Washington Schools Information Processing Cooperative (WSIPC) 20 miles
north in Redmond, where attendance and other student records were kept for
the entire state.<BR>
<BR>
To make these WSIPC services more readily available to schools across the
state, Bookey proposed the creation of a statewide educational network running
on T-3 lines (45 megabits per second), now known as WEDNET. This provides
links all over Washington, from Shaw Island and Stehekin to Seattle and
Issaquah, with a rogue line down to Portland, Oreg.<BR>
<BR>
As for Lee Dumas, according to his mother, his situation has changed completely,
&quot;both in his attitude toward school and in the school's attitude toward
him.&quot; After joining TIP, Dumas became one of its most active and enthusiastic
members. Last summer, he got a job at the Computer Store in Seattle teaching
the Macintosh HyperCard program to a student body consisting, yes, of public
school teachers. According to Dumas, they had no problem accepting his authority
as a fledgling computer guru.<BR>
<BR>
No longer one of the outlaws, Dumas became an official beta tester for the
new Microsoft DOS 6.0 and Windows NT operating systems, specializing in
their security procedures. Following the path of another student who found
the &quot;Issaquah bug&quot; in Microsoft's LAN Manager program, Dumas believes
he found three or four bugs in NT.<BR>
<BR>
Having just finished his sophomore year, Dumas has gone to work this summer
at Microsoft for the company's network development chief, Brian Valentine,
who regards this once brain- dead punk as a valued employee with high promise
for the future. This student who floundered in the usual educational system
flourished when his individual specialization was discovered. The Issaquah
economy released his energies, just as the national economy releases its
own energies through the specialization and division of labor in computer
networks.<BR>
<BR>
Since there are millions of Lee Dumases in the schools of America, many
of them being given up for lost by analysts such as Labor Secretary Robert
Reich, because they are not adept at the usual curriculum for &quot;symbolic
analysts,&quot; Dumas' redemption by technology bears crucial lessons. The
lessons are Bookey's: Students are a resource, not a rabble; specialized
practical experience is more edifying than most textbook learning; networks
are the critical technology both for economic growth and for educational
renewal.<BR>
<BR>
To these insights should be added Lewis Perelman's view, in his book &quot;School's
Out&quot; (1992, Morrow), that teachers should increasingly abandon their
role as a &quot;sage on the stage&quot; in favor of service as a &quot;guide
on the side,&quot; steering their students through a global cornucopia of
educational resources.

Education as a Network Driver</B></PRE>
It may seem peculiar that Bookey, a network guru for large corporations
like U.S. West, should focus his attentions on such problems as interconnecting
school children in Issaquah with libraries in Bellevue, parents on Squaw
Mountain, teachers across town and administrators at the Washington State
Information Processing Cooperative. Yet Bookey believes that the educational
application may well drive the creation of a true national infrastructure
of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The networking problems of schools closely resemble the networking problems
of a nation full of diverse systems. To achieve their full promise, school
networks must link computers of many varieties owned by parents, students
and teachers, to administrative servers owned by state and local governments,
to printers, libraries and databases. School networks must connect LANs
to IBM SNA (Systems Network Architecture) links, to a variety of telephone
technologies, from T-1 lines of 1.5 megabits per second to T-3 lines at
45 megabits per second and, soon, to ATM switches and other potential gigabit
systems. In all its dimensions, including an acute financial constraint,
this challenge is altogether as difficult as interconnecting supercomputers
over fiber in an NREN.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey relished this challenge at Issaquah. Advocates of NREN might disparage
Issaquah as a relatively low-grade network. After all, it currently has
no fiber outside of the fiber links in the telephone network that it uses.
Without fiber, the network will not be able to accommodate collaborative
learning in multimedia forms across the country. Bookey demurs. Buying a
fiber-optic network before personal computer technology can manage broadband
flows of data is premature. In five years, fiber-optic links will probably
cost about one-fifth of what they cost today. When the network is needed,
Issaquah will be able to purchase it and, more important, also use it. Moreover,
TCI recently offered to install fiber throughout the Issaquah school system
for nothing as part of its general program of fiber to the curb.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that big-band technology will come to Issaquah in due course,
with or without NREN money. Critics, of course, will carp that Issaquah
is a special case &quot;a relatively rich community&quot; that could afford
to levy $2.7 million for technology. Yet the Issaquah example is galvanizing
schools across the state of Washington and even in California and Arkansas,
where Bookey and his colleague Mason Conner have been consulting with education
officials. Emulating Issaquah, other districts in Washington have since
raised some $140 million for network ventures.

Glass Ceiling for Networks?</B></PRE>
The lesson of Issaquah is that data highways and superhighways, driven by
the convergence of microcosm and telecosm, are indeed emerging in America,
and at an astonishing pace. They already are revitalizing the economy and
society, and are helping to reform the system of education. The only federal
initiatives that will significantly assist the process are lower taxes,
accommodation of Internet growth and use, and further deregulation of telecommunications.
Communication must begin locally, with access to the community. From these
local roots can emerge the great branching systems that can interconnect
an information economy.<BR>
<BR>
By starting from the top, the government risks paving over the pullulating
fabric of networking enterprise with a glass ceiling of expensive and misplaced
fiber. In 1993 an estimated 37 million personal computers will be sold worldwide.
The same forces that impelled the networks of Issaquah will drive the owners
of these new PCs to interconnect them to other networks and will induce
the owners of the networks to link them together.<BR>
<BR>
As the centrifugal force of the microcosm, multiplying and distributing
intelligence through the world, converges with the integrating power of
the telecosm, the exponential miracles of specialization and growth will
gain new momentum. How far can this spiral reach? Internet will soon approach
some interesting limits. According to International Data Group, the number
of users has risen from 9,800 in 1986, all in the United States, to 4.7
million around the world today.<BR>
<BR>
At this pace, Internet will embrace the entire world population by the year
2001. That's one limit. As the system's trunking backbone rises to 45 megabits
per second on T-3 lines and above, the sky is the limit for the amount of
message traffic. In the first month after the enlargement to T-3 lines in
October 1992, usage rose from 3.5 trillion bytes to 4 trillion bytes. All
these networks are dominated by text and still pictures. But the miracles
of Internet and Issaquah are about to be joined with a new miracle of growth
in digital video connections in the local loop.

Bombshell from Time-Warner</B></PRE>
How soon can this happen? Advocates of NREN speak of this technology being
consummated in 2015. But to most politicians and businessmen, a projected
date more than five years ahead is essentially a synonym for never-never
land; a way of saying, &quot;Forget about it. I'll be retired.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that a widespread system of two-way broadband networks reaching
most American homes, schools and offices is less than five years away. All
U.S. business planners must come to terms with this transforming reality.
Announcements this spring from leading cable, telephone and computer companies;
from TCI and U.S. West to IBM and Silicon Graphics; bring the shape of this
network into clear focus.<BR>
<BR>
Exemplary among plans announced by a variety of firms is Time-Warner's projected
system in Orlando. As described by Jim Chiddix, the company's college-dropout
technical guru, the Time- Warner showcase venture will be a giant client/server
computer network, suggestive of the arrangements now ubiquitous in corporate
computing. The wires will be a combination of fiber to the curb and coax
to the home. Much of the system's hardware and software will be supplied
by computer companies (allegedly including IBM and Silicon Graphics). The
&quot;client&quot; computers will be digitized TVs or teleputers linked
to powerful database computers that use a parallel-processing architecture
to access hierarchical memory systems, from DRAM caches to optical disk
archives. These memories will contain terabytes (trillions of bytes) of
digital video movies, games, educational software and other programming.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the most dramatic breakthrough, though, will come in the switches.
While much of the computer and telephone world continues to dither about
the future of ATM (many consigning it to the pits of 2015), Time-Warner
is committed to installing ATM switches, built by AT&amp;T, beginning next
year in Orlando. The ATM system will allow Time-Warner to offer telephone,
teleputer and multimedia services together, as soon as the regulators allow
it. Chiddix predicts that ATM will soon gravitate to local area networks
and ultimately become ubiquitous.<BR>
<BR>
But the most portentous announcements of all have come from the telephone
companies, who have the most to lose from this cable-oriented network design.
Both U.S. West and Pacific Bell have disclosed that they are adopting a
combination architecture of fiber and coaxial cable closely resembling the
Time-Warner and TCI projects. This unexpected action by two leading Baby
Bells, of turning their backs on their millions of miles of twisted-pair
copper wires shows both the boldness of the new telephone company leadership
and the imperious power of this digital technology.<BR>
<BR>
From all sides the telecommunications and computer industries are converging
on one essential configuration of advanced parallel-processing hardware,
client/server database software and ATM switching. As microcosm and telecosm
converge in the living room, with interactive digital video and supercomputer
image processing, the leading edge of the digital revolution moves from
millions of offices toward billions of homes. Just as Michael Milken, then
of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and the late William McGowan of MCI in 1983 rescued
long-distance fiber optics from the never-never lands of the year 2015 to
which AT&amp;T had consigned it, John Malone of TCI, Gerald M. Levin of
Time-Warner and Richard D. McCormick of U.S. West in 1993 have burst open
the floodgates for fiber and ATM in the local loop.<BR>
<BR>
Again, the force behind this revolutionary development was fierce business
and technical rivalry in the marketplace. In the real world the ruling principle
of network development is not imposed standardization by government but
spontaneous order. It springs from the interplay of human creativity and
entrepreneurship with the inexorable laws of physics and technology.<BR>
<BR>
These dynamics of interconnection in the Information Age will continue well
into the next century. The microcosm will yield chips containing billions
of transistors, equivalent to scores of supercomputers on single slivers
of silicon. The telecosm will yield bandwidth exploding into the terahertz
of all- optical networks and the gigahertz of millimeter waves in the air.<BR>
<BR>
Provided that rulers and regulators do not stifle this spiral of opportunity,
the human spirit &quot;emancipated and thus allowed to reach its rarest
talents and aspirations&quot; will continue to amaze the world with heroic
surprises. The Issaquah miracle of Mike Bookey and Lee Dumas and all the
others, and the continuing miracle of American networks, which was entirely
unexpected by the world, will repeat themselves again and again in new forms
of entrepreneurship and technology.

<HR>At first glance, Vahak Hovnanian, a homebuilding tycoon in New Jersey,
would<B> </B>seem an unlikely sort to be chasing rainbows. Yet in the converging
realms of computers and communications that we call the telecosm, rainbows
are less a matter of hue and weather than they are a metaphor for electromagnetism:
the spectrum of wavelengths and frequencies used to build businesses in
the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
An Armenian Christian from Iraq, Hovnanian ran a business building high-quality
&quot;affordable&quot; housing. His first coup came on Labor Day in 1958
when, together with his three older brothers, he bought an apparently undesirable
property near the waterfront in Tom's River for $20,000. From this modest
beginning has arisen not only one of the nation's largest homebuilding enterprises
(divided among the four immigrant brothers), but also a shattering breakthrough
on some seemingly bleak frontiers of the electromagnetic spectrum. Together
with maverick inventor Bernard Bossard, Hovnanian has launched a wireless
cellular TV business in frequencies once thought usable only in outer space.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the reason Hovnanian feels comfortable today pioneering on the shores
of the telecosm is that some 35 years ago he was an engineer at Philco Semiconductor
following in the theoretical steps of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories titan William
Shockley. Shockley led the team that plunged into the microcosm of solid-state
physics and invented the transistor. At the heart of all-digital electronics,
this invention still reverberates through the world economy and imposes
its centrifugal rules of enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
This law of the microcosm dictates exponential rises in computer efficiency
as transistors become smaller. It is this law that drives the bulk of the
world's computations to ever- cheaper machines and pushes intelligence from
the center to the fringes of all networks. Today the microcosm is converging
with the telecosm and igniting a new series of industrial shocks and surprises.<BR>
<BR>
The convergence of microcosm and telecosm in an array of multimedia industries
- from personal intelligent communicators to video teleputers to digital
films and publishing - is now the driving force of world economic growth.
John Sculley, chairman and CEO of Apple Computer, has projected that by
2002 there will be a global business in multimedia totaling some $3.5 trillion
- close to the size of the entire U.S. economy in the early 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
This new world of computer communications will break down into two domains
- the fibersphere and the atmosphere. The fibersphere is the domain of all-optical
networks, with both communications power - bandwidth - and error rate improving
by factors in the millions. In &quot;Into the Fibersphere&quot; (Forbes
ASAP, December 7, 1992), we saw that the potential capacity for communications
in the fibersphere is 1,000 times greater than all the currently used frequencies
in the air - and so radically error-free that it mandates an entirely new
model of wired telecommunications. Now we will discover that the atmosphere
will offer links as mobile and ubiquitous as human beings are. It thus will
force the creation of an entirely new model of wireless networks.<BR>
<BR>
In one sense, Sculley's $3 5 trillion dream can be seen as the pot of gold
at the end of Maxwell's rainbow. In 1865, in a visionary coup that the late
Richard Feynman said would leave the American Civil War of the same decade
as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by comparison, Scottish physicist
James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic spectrum. Encompassing
nearly all the technologies imagined by Sculley, Maxwell's rainbow reaches
from the extremely low frequencies (and gigantic wavelengths) used to communicate
with submarines all the way through the frequencies used in radio, television
and cellular phones, on up to the frequencies of infrared used in TV remotes
and fiber optics, and beyond that to visible and ultraviolet light and X-
rays. In a fabulous feat of unification, Maxwell reduced the entire spectrum
to just four equations in vector calculus. He showed that all such radiations
move at the speed of light - in other words, the wavelength times the frequency
equals the speed of light. These equations pulse at the heart of the information
economy today.<BR>
<BR>
Virtually all electromagnetic radiation can bear information, and the higher
the frequencies, the more room they provide for bearing information. As
a practical matter, however, communications engineers have aimed low, thronging
the frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum, comprising far less than
one percent of the total span.<BR>
<BR>
The vast expansion of wireless communications forecast by Sculley, however,
will require the use of higher frequencies far up Maxwell's rainbow. This
means a return to the insights of another great man who walked the halls
of Bell Labs in the late 1940s at the same time as future Nobel laureate
William Shockley, and who left the world transformed in his wake.<BR>
<BR>
In 1948, the same year that Shockley invented the transistor, Claude Shannon
invented the information theory that underlies all modern communications.
At first encounter, information theory is difficult for nonmathematicians,
but computer and telecom executives need focus on only a few key themes.
In defining how much information can be sent down a noisy channel, Shannon
showed that engineers can choose between narrowband high-powered solutions
and broadband low-powered solutions. 
<PRE>


<B>


From Long & Strong to Wide & Weak
</B></PRE>
Assuming that usable bandwidth is scarce and expensive, most wireless engineers
have strived to economize on it. Just as you can get your message through
in a crowded room by talking louder, you can overcome a noisy channel with
more powerful signals. Engineers therefore have pursued a strategy of long
and strong: long wavelengths and powerful transmissions with the scarce
radio frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum.<BR>
<BR>
Economizing on spectrum, scientists created mostly analog systems such as
AM radios and televisions. Using every point on the wave to convey information
and using high power to overcome noise and extend the range of signals,
the long and strong approach seemed hugely more efficient than digital systems
requiring complex manipulation of long strings of on-off bits.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, however, the long and strong policy of economizing on spectrum
led to using it all up. When everyone talks louder, no one can hear very
well. Today, the favored regions at the bottom of the spectrum are so full
of spectrum- hogging radios, pagers, phones, television, long-distance,
point- to-point, aerospace and other uses that heavy-breathing experts speak
of running out of &quot;air.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's theories reveal the way out of this problem. In a counterintuitive
and initially baffling redefinition of the nature of noise in a communications
channel, Shannon showed that a flow of signals conveys information only
to the extent that it provides unexpected data - only to the extent that
it adds to what you already know. Another name for a stream of unexpected
bits is noise. Termed Gaussian, or white, noise, such a transmission resembles
random &quot;white&quot; light, which cloaks the entire rainbow of colors
in a bright blur. Shannon showed that the more a transmission resembles
this form of noise, the more information it can hold.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's alternative to long and strong is wide and weak: not fighting
noise with electrical power but joining it with noiselike information, not
talking louder but talking softer in more elaborate codes using more bandwidth.
For example, in transmitting 40 megabits per second - the requirement for
truly high-resolution images and sounds - Shannon showed some 45 years ago
that using more bandwidth can lower the needed signal-to- noise ratio from
a level of one million to one to a ratio of 30.6 to one. This huge gain
comes merely from increasing the bandwidth of the signal from two megahertz
(millions of cycles per second) to eight megahertz. That means a 33,000-fold
increase in communications efficiency in exchange for just a fourfold increase
in bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Such an explosion of efficiency radically limits the need to waste watts
in order to overcome noise. More communications power comes from less electrical
power. Thus, Shannon shows the way to fulfill Sculley's vision of universal
low-powered wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
This vision of wide and weak is at the heart of the most promising technologies
of today, from the advanced digital teleputer sets of American HDTV to ubiquitous
mobile phones and computers in so-called personal communications networks
(PCNs). Shannon's theories of the telecosm provide the basic science behind
both Sculley's dream and Hovnanian's video spectrum breakthrough.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's world, however, is not nirvana, and there is no free lunch. Compensating
for the exponential rise in communications power is an exponential rise
in complexity. Larger bandwidths mean larger, more complex codes and exponentially
rising burdens of computation for the decoding and error-correcting of messages.
In previous decades, handling 40 megabits per second was simply out of the
question with existing computer technology. For the last 30 years, this
electronic bottleneck has blocked the vistas of efficient communication
opened by Shannon's research.<BR>
<BR>
In the 1990s, however, the problem of soaring complexity has met its match
- and then some - in exponential gains of computer efficiency. Not only
has the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology been doubling every 18
months but the pace of advance has been accelerating into the 1990s. Moreover,
the chips central to digital communications - error correction, compression,
coding and decoding - are digital signal processors. As we have seen, the
cost-effectiveness of DSPs has been increasing - in millions of computer
instructions per second (MIPS) per dollar - some tenfold every two years.<BR>
<BR>
This wild rush in DSPs will eventually converge with the precipitous plunge
in price-performance ratios of general-purpose microprocessors. Led by Silicon
Graphics' impending new TFP Cray supercomputer on a chip, Digital Equipment's
Alpha AXP device and Hewlett Packard's Precision Architecture 7100, micros
are moving beyond 100-megahertz clock rates. They are shifting from a regime
of processing 32-bit words at a time to a regime of processing 64-bit words.
This expands the total addressable memory by a factor of four billion. Together
with increasing use of massively parallel DSP architectures, these gains
will keep computers well ahead of the complexity problem in broadband communications.<BR>
<BR>
What this means is that while complexity rises exponentially with bandwidth,
computer efficiencies are rising even faster. The result is to open new
vistas of spectrum in the atmosphere as dramatic as the gains of spectrum
so far achieved in the fibersphere. 
<PRE>


<B>


Attacking Through the Air
</B></PRE>
Hovnanian's campaign into the spectrum began when a cable company announced
one day in 1985 that under the Cable Act of 1984 and franchise rights granted
by local governments, it had the right to wire one of his housing developments
then under construction. Until that day, Hovnanian's own company could package
cable with his homes through what are called satellite master antenna TV
systems. In essence, each Hovnanian development had its own cable head end
where programs are collected and sent out to subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
When the cable company, now Monmouth Cable Vision, went to court and its
claim was upheld by a judge, Hovnanian sought alternatives. First he flirted
with the idea of having the phone company deliver compressed video to his
homes. In 1986, in the era before FCC Commissioner Alfred Sikes, that was
both illegal and impractical. Then he met Bernard Bossard and decided to
attack through the air. An early pioneer in microchips who had launched
a semiconductor firm and eventually sold it to M/A COM, Bossard was familiar
with both the soaring power of computers and the murky problems of broadband
noise that have long restricted the air to a small number of broadcast AM
TV stations.<BR>
<BR>
Air delivery of cable television programming had long seemed unpromising.
Not only was there too little spectrum available to compete with cable,
but what spectrum there was, was guarded by the FCC and state public utilities
commissions. Nonetheless, in the early 1990s &quot;wireless cable&quot;
did become a niche market, led by Microband Wireless Cable and rivals and
imitators across the land. Using fragments of a frequency band between 2.5
and 2.7 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second), Microband, after some
financial turmoil, now profitably broadcasts some 16 channels to 35,000
New York City homes in line of sight from the top of the Empire State Building.
As long as they are restricted to a possible maximum of 200 megahertz and
use AM, however, wireless firms will not long be able to compete with the
cable industry. Cable companies offer an installed base of potential gigahertz
connections and near universal coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Having spent much of his life working with microwaves for satellites and
the military, Bossard had a better idea. He claimed he could move up the
spectrum and pioneer on frontiers of frequency between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz,
previously used chiefly in outer space. That would mean he could command
in the air some half a million times the communications power, or bandwidth,
of typical copper telephone links, some ten times the bandwidth of existing
wireless cable, some four times the bandwidth of the average cable industry
coaxial connection, and twice the bandwidth of the most advanced cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
The conventional wisdom was that these microwaves (above about 12 gigahertz)
are useless for anything but point-to-point transmissions and are doubtful
even for these. For radio communication, the prevailing folklore preferred
frequencies that are cheap to transmit long distances and that can penetrate
buildings and tunnels, bounce off the ionosphere or scuttle across continents
along the surface of the earth. The higher the frequency, the less it can
perform these feats essential to all broadcasting - and the less it can
be sent long distances at all.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it was believed, these millimeter-sized microwaves not only would
fail to penetrate structures and other obstacles but would reflect off them
and off particles in the air in a way that would cause hopeless mazes of
multipath. Multipath would be translated into several images, i.e., ghosts,
on the screen.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, there was the real show-stopper. Everyone knew that these frequencies
are microwaves. The key property of microwaves, as demonstrated in the now
ubiquitous ovens, is absorption by water. Microwaves cook by exciting water
molecules to a boil. Microwave towers are said to kill birds by irradiating
their fluids. Microwave radar systems won't work in the rain. Mention microwaves
as a possible solution to the spectrum shortage, and everyone - from editors
at Forbes to gurus at Microsoft, from cable executives to Bell Labs researchers
- laughs and tells you about the moisture problem.<BR>
<BR>
So it was no surprise that when in 1986 Bossard went to M/A COM and other
companies and financiers with his idea of TV broadcasting at 28 gigahertz,
he was turned down flat. Amid much talk of potential &quot;violations of
the laws of physics,&quot; jokes about broiling pigeons and warnings of
likely resistance from the FCC, he was spurned by all. In fairness to his
detractors, Bossard had no license, patent or prototype at the time. But
these holes in his plan did not deter Vahak Hovnanian and his son Shant
from investing many millions of dollars in the project. It could be the
best investment the Hovnanian tycoons ever made.

New Rule of Radio
</B></PRE>
For 35 years, the wireless communications industry has been inching up the
spectrum, shifting slowly from long and strong wavelengths toward wide and
weak bands of shorter wavelengths. Mobile phone services have moved from
the 1950s radio systems using low FM frequencies near 100 megahertz, to
the 1960s spectrum band of 450 megahertz, to the current cellular band of
900 megahertz accommodating more than 10 million cellular subscribers in
the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1990s, this trend will accelerate sharply. Accommodating hundreds
of millions of users around the world, cellular communications will turn
digital, leap up the spectrum and even move into video. Shannon's laws show
that this will impel vast increases in the cost-effectiveness of communications.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the new rule of radio is the shorter the transmission path,
the better the system. Like transistors on semiconductor chips, transmitters
are more efficient the more closely they are packed together. As Peter Huber
writes in his masterly new book, The Geodesic Network 2, the new regime
favors &quot;geodesic networks,&quot; with radios intimately linked in tiny
microcells. As in the law of the microcosm, the less the space, the more
the room.<BR>
<BR>
This rule turns the conventional wisdom of microwaves upside down. For example,
it is true that microwaves don't travel far in the atmosphere. You don't
want to use them to transmit 50,000 watts of Rush Limbaugh over 10 midwestern
states, but to accommodate 200 million two-way communicators will require
small cells; you don't want the waves to travel far. It is true that microwaves
will not penetrate most buildings and other obstacles, but with lots of
small cells, you don't want the waves to penetrate walls to adjacent offices.<BR>
<BR>
Microwaves require high-power systems to transmit, but only if you want
to send them long distances. Wattage at the receiver drops off in proportion
to the fourth power of the distance from the transmitter. Reducing cell
sizes as you move up the spectrum lowers power needs far more than higher
frequencies increase them. Just as important, mobile systems must be small
and light. The higher the frequency, the smaller the antenna and the lighter
the system can be.<BR>
<BR>
All this high-frequency gear once was prohibitively expensive. Any functions
over two gigahertz require gallium arsenide chips, which are complex and
costly. Yet the cost of gallium arsenide devices is dropping every day as
their market expands. Meanwhile, laboratory teams are now tweaking microwaves
out of silicon. In the world of electronics - where prices drop by a third
with every doubling of accumulated sales - any ubiquitous product will soon
be cheap.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm dictates that the higher the frequency, the shorter
the wavelength, the wider the bandwidth, the smaller the antenna, the slimmer
the cell and ultimately, the cheaper and better the communication. The working
of this law will render obsolete the entire idea of scarce spectrum and
launch an era of advances in telecommunications comparable to the recent
gains in computing. Transforming the computer and phone industries, the
converging spirits of Maxwell, Shannon and Shockley even pose a serious
challenge to the current revolutionaries in cellular telephony.

The New PC Revolution: PCN
</B></PRE>
Many observers herald the huge coming impact of wireless on the computer
industry, and they are right. But this impact will be dwarfed by the impact
of computers on wireless.<BR>
<BR>
In personal communications networks (PCN), the cellular industry today is
about to experience its own personal computer revolution. Just as the personal
computer led to systems thousands of times more efficient in MIPS per dollar
than the mainframes and minicomputers that preceded it, PCNs will bring
an exponential plunge of costs. These networks will be based on microcells
often measured in hundreds of meters rather than in tens of miles and will
interlink smart digital appliances, draining power in milliwatts rather
than dumb phones using watts. When the convulsion ends later this decade,
this new digital cellular phone will stand as the world's most pervasive
PC. As mobile as a watch and as personal as a wallet, these PICOs will recognize
speech, navigate streets, take notes, keep schedules, collect mail, manage
money, open the door and start the car, among other computer functions we
cannot imagine today.<BR>
<BR>
Like the computer establishment before it, current cellular providers often
seem unprepared for this next computer revolution. They still live in a
world of long and strong - high- powered systems at relatively low frequencies
and with short- lived batteries - rather than in a PCN world of low-power
systems at microwave frequencies and with batteries that last for days.<BR>
<BR>
Ready or not, though, the revolution will happen anyway, and it will transform
the landscape over the next five years. We can guess the pattern by considering
the precedents. In computers, the revolution took 10 years. It began in
1977 when large centralized systems with attached dumb terminals commanded
nearly 100 percent of the world's computer power and ended in 1987 with
such large systems commanding less than one percent of the world's computer
power. The pace of progress in digital electronics has accelerated sharply
since the early 1980s. Remember yesterday, when digital signal processing
(DSP) - the use of specialized computers to convert, compress, shape and
shuffle digital signals in real time - constituted an exorbitant million-dollar
obstacle to all-digital communications? Many current attitudes toward wireless
stem from that time, which was some five years ago. Today, digital signal
processors are the fastest-moving technology in all computing. Made on single
chips or multichip modules, DSPs are increasing their cost- effectiveness
tenfold every two years. As radio pioneer Donald Steinbrecher says, &quot;That
changes wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thus, we can expect the cellular telephone establishment to reach a crisis
more quickly than the mainframe establishment did. The existing cellular
infrastructure will persist for vehicular use.<BR>
<BR>
As the intelligence in networks migrates to microcells, the networks themselves
must become dumb. A complex network, loaded up with millions of lines of
software code, cannot keep up with the efflorescent diversity and creativity
among ever more intelligent digital devices on its periphery. This rule
is true for the broadband wire links of fiber optics, as intelligent switching
systems give way to passive all-optical networks. It is also true of cellular
systems.<BR>
<BR>
Nick Kauser, McCaw Cellular Communications' executive vice- president and
chief of technology, faced this problem early in 1991 when the company decided
to create a North American Cellular Network for transparent roaming throughout
the regions of Cellular One. &quot;The manufacturers always want to sell
switches that do more and more. But complex switches take so long to program
that you end up doing less and less,&quot; says Wayne Perry, McCaw vice-chairman.
Each time Kauser tried to change software code in one of McCaw's Ericsson
switches, it might have taken six months. Each time he wanted to add customer
names above a 64,000 limit, Ericsson tried to persuade him to buy a new
switch. The Ericsson switches, commented one McCaw engineer, offer a huge
engine but a tiny gas tank. The problem is not peculiar to Ericsson, however;
it is basic to the very idea of complex switch- based services on any supplier's
equipment.<BR>
<BR>
When McCaw voiced frustration, one of the regional Bell operating companies
offered to take over the entire problem at a cost of some $200 million.
Instead, Kauser created a Signaling System 7 (SS-7) network plus an intelligent
database on four Tandem fault-tolerant computers, for some $15 million.
Kauser maintains that the current services offered by North American Cellular
could not be duplicated for 10 times that amount, if at all, in a switch-based
system. Creating a dumb network and off- loading the intelligence on computer
servers saved McCaw hundreds of millions of dollars.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm is a centrifuge, inexorably pushing intelligence
to the edges of networks. Telecom equipment suppliers can no more trap it
in the central switch than IBM could monopolize it in mainframes.<BR>
<BR>
Kauser should recognize that this rule applies to McCaw no less than to
Ericsson. His large standardized systems with 30- mile cells and relatively
dumb, high-powered phones resemble big proprietary mainframe networks. In
the computer industry, these standardized architectures gave way to a mad
proliferation of diverse personal computer nets restricted to small areas
and interlinked by hubs and routers. The same pattern will develop in cellular.

Could &quot;Charles&quot; Upend McCaw?
</B></PRE>
Together with GTE and the regional Bell operating company cellular divisions,
McCaw is now in the position of DEC in 1977. With its new ally, AT&amp;T,
McCaw is brilliantly attacking the mainframe establishment of the wire-line
phone companies. But the mainframe establishment of wires is not McCaw's
real competition. Not stopping at central switches, the law of the microcosm
is about to subvert the foundations of conventional cellular technology
as well. Unless McCaw and the other cellular providers come to terms with
the new PC networks that go by the name of PCNs, they will soon suffer the
fate of the minicomputer firms of the last decade. McCaw could well be upended
by its founder's original vision of his company - a PICO he called &quot;Charles.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Just as in the computer industry in the late 1970s, the fight for the future
is already under way. Complicating the conflict is the influence of European
and Japanese forces protecting the past in the name of progress. Under pressure
from EEC industrial politicians working with the guidance of engineers from
Ericsson, the Europeans have adopted a new digital cellular system called
Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) after the commission that conceived it.<BR>
<BR>
GSM is a very conservative digital system that multiplies the number of
users in each cellular channel by a factor of three. GSM uses an access
method called time-division multiple access (TDMA). Suggestive of the time-sharing
methods used by minicomputers and mainframes to accommodate large numbers
of users on centralized computers, TDMA stems from the time-division multiplexing
employed by phone companies around the world to put more than one phone
call on each digital line. Thus, both the telephone and the computer establishments
are comfortable with time division.<BR>
<BR>
Under pressure from European firms eager to sell equipment in America, the
U.S. Telephone Industry Association two years ago adopted a TDMA standard
similar to the European GSM. Rather than creating a wholly new system exploiting
the distributed powers of the computer revolution, the TIA favored a TDMA
overlay on the existing analog infrastructure. Under the influence of Ericsson,
McCaw and some of the RBOCs took the TDMA bait.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it was in the name of competitiveness and technological progress,
and of keeping up with the Europeans and Japanese, that the U.S. moved to
embrace an obsolescent cellular system. It made no difference that the Europeans
and Japanese were technologically well in our wake. Just as in the earlier
case of analog HDTV, however, the entrepreneurial creativity of the U.S.
digital electronics industry is launching an array of compelling alternatives
just in time.<BR>
<BR>
Infusing cellular telephony with the full powers of wide and weak - combining
Shannon's vision with computer advances - are two groups of engineers from
MIT who spun out to launch new companies. Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego, is
led by former professor Irwin Jacobs and telecom pioneer Andrew Viterbi.
A Shannon disciple whose eponymous algorithm is widely used in digital wire-line
telephony, Viterbi now is leading an effort to transform digital wireless
telephony. The other firm, Steinbrecher Corp. of Woburn, Mass., is led by
an inventor from the MIT Radio Astronomy Lab named Donald Steinbrecher.<BR>
<BR>
Like Bernie Bossard and Vahak Hovnanian, the leaders of Qualcomm and Steinbrecher
received the ultimate accolade for an innovator: They were all told their
breakthroughs were impossible. Indeed, the leaders at Qualcomm were still
contending that Steinbrecher's system would not work just weeks ago when
PacTel pushed the two firms together. Now they provide the foundations for
a radical new regime in distributed wireless computer telephony. 
<PRE>


<B>


Signals in Pseudonoise
</B></PRE>
Ten years ago at Linkabit, the current leaders of Qualcomm conceived and
patented the TDMA technology adopted as the U.S. standard by the Telephone
Industry Association. Like analog HDTV, it was a powerful advance for its
time. But even then, Viterbi and Jacobs were experimenting with a Shannonesque
technology.<BR>
<BR>
A classic example of the efficacy of wide and weak, CDMA exploits the resemblance
between noise and information. The system began in the military as an effort
to avoid jamming or air- tapping of combat messages. Qualcomm brings CDMA
to the challenge of communications on the battlefronts of big-city cellular.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than compressing each call into between three and 10 tiny TDMA time
slots in a 30-kilohertz cellular channel, Qualcomm's CDMA spreads a signal
across a comparatively huge 1. 25-megahertz swath of the cellular spectrum.
This allows many users to share the same spectrum space at one time. Each
phone is programmed with a specific pseudonoise code, which is used to stretch
a low-powered signal over a wide frequency band. The base station uses the
same code in inverted form to &quot;despread&quot; and reconstitute the
original signal. All other codes remain spread out, indistinguishable from
background noise.<BR>
<BR>
Jacobs compares TDMA and CDMA to different strategies of communication at
a cocktail party. In the TDMA analogy, each person would restrict his or
her talk to a specific time slot while everyone else remains silent. This
system would work well as long as the party was managed by a dictator who
controlled all conversations by complex rules and a rigid clock. In CDMA,
on the other hand, everyone can talk at once but in different languages.
Each person listens for messages in his or her own language or code and
ignores all other sounds as background noise. Although this system allows
each person to speak freely, it requires constant control of the volume
of the speakers. A speaker who begins yelling can drown out surrounding
messages and drastically reduce the total number of conversations that can
be sustained.<BR>
<BR>
For years, this problem of the stentorian guest crippled CDMA as a method
of increasing the capacity of cellular systems. Spread spectrum had many
military uses because its unlocalized signal and cryptic codes made it very
difficult to jam or overhear. In a cellular environment, however, where
cars continually move in and out from behind trucks, buildings and other
obstacles, causing huge variations in power, CDMA systems would be regularly
swamped by stentorian guests. Similarly, nearby cars would tend to dominate
faraway vehicles. This was termed the near-far problem. When you compound
this challenge with a static of multipath signals causing hundreds of 10,000-to-
1 gyrations in power for every foot traveled by the mobile unit - so-called
Rayleigh interference pits and spikes - you can comprehend the general incredulity
toward CDMA among cellular cognoscenti. Indeed, as recently as 1991, leading
experts at Bell Labs, Stanford University and Bellcore confidently told
me the problem was a show-stopper; it could not be overcome.<BR>
<BR>
Radio experts, however, underestimate the power of the microcosm. Using
digital signal processing, error correction and other microcosmic tools,
wattage spikes and pits 100 times a second can be regulated by electronic
circuitry that adjusts the power at a rate of more than 800 times a second.<BR>
<BR>
To achieve this result, Qualcomm uses two layers of controls. First is a
relatively crude top layer that employs the automatic gain control device
on handsets to constantly adjust the power sent by the handset to the level
of power received by it from the base station. This rough adjustment does
not come near to solving the problem, but it brings a solution into reach
by using more complex and refined techniques.<BR>
<BR>
In the second power-control step, the base station measures the handset's
signal-to-noise and bit-error ratios once every 1.25 milliseconds (800 times
a second). Depending on whether these ratios are above or below a constantly
recomputed threshold, the base station sends a positive or negative pulse,
either raising or lowering the power some 25 percent. 
<PRE>


<B>


Dynamic Cells
</B></PRE>
Passing elaborate field tests with flying colors, this power- control mechanism
has the further effect of dynamically changing the size of cells. In a congested
cell, the power of all phones rises to overcome mutual interference. On
the margin, these high- powered transmissions overflow into neighboring
cells where they may be picked up by adjacent base station equipment. In
a quiet cell, power is so low that the cell effectively shrinks, transmitting
no interference at all to neighboring cells and improving their performance.
This kind of dynamic adjustment of cell sizes is impossible in a TDMA system,
where adjacent cells use completely different frequencies and fringe handsets
may begin to chirp like Elmer Fudd.<BR>
<BR>
Once the stentorian voice could be instantly abated, power control changed
from a crippling weakness of CDMA into a commanding asset. Power usage is
a major obstacle to the PCN future. All market tests show that either heavy
or short-lived batteries greatly reduce the attractiveness of the system.
Because the Qualcomm feedback system keeps power always at the lowest feasible
level, batteries in CDMA phones actually are lasting far longer than in
TDMA phones. CDMA phones transmit at an average of two milliwatts, compared
with 600 milliwatts and higher for most other cellular systems.<BR>
<BR>
A further advantage of wide and weak comes in handling multipath signals,
which bounce off obstacles and arrive at different times at the receiver.
Multipath just adds to the accuracy of CDMA. The Qualcomm system combines
the three strongest signals into one. Called a rake receiver and co- invented
by Paul Green, currently at IBM and author of Fiber Optic Networks (Prentice
Hall, 1992), this combining function works even on signals from different
cells and thus facilitates hand-offs. In TDMA, signals arriving at the wrong
time are pure interference in someone else's time slot; in CDMA, they strengthen
the message.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, CDMA allows simple and soft hand-offs. Because all the phones are
using the same spectrum space, moving from one cell to another is easy.
CDMA avoids all the frequency juggling of TDMA systems as they shuffle calls
among cells and time slots. As the era of PCN microcells approaches, this
advantage will become increasingly crucial. Cellular systems that spurn
Qualcomm today may find themselves in a quagmire of TDMA microcells tomorrow.
Together, all the gains from CDMA bring about a tenfold increase over current
analog capacity. In wireless telephony above all, wide and weak will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
Like any obsolescent scheme challenged by a real innovation - and like minicomputers
and mainframes challenged by the PC - TDMA is being sharply improved by
its proponents. The inheritors of the Linkabit TDMA patents at Hughes and
International Mobile Machines Corp. (IMMC) have introduced extended TDMA,
claiming a 19-fold advance over current analog capacity. Showing a conventional
cellular outlook, however, E-TDMA fatally adopts the idea of increasing
capacity by lowering speech quality. This moves in exactly the wrong direction.
PCN will not triumph through compromises based on a scarce-spectrum mentality.
PCN will multiply bandwidth to make the acoustics of digital cellular even
better than the acoustics of wire-line phones, just as the acoustics of
digital CDs far excel the acoustics of analog records.<BR>
<BR>
Riding the microcosmic gains of digital signal processing, CDMA inherently
offers greater room for improvement than TDMA does. Bringing the computer
revolution to cellular telephony, CDMA at its essence replaces frequency
shuffling with digital intelligence. Supplanting the multiple radios of
TDMA - each with a fixed frequency - are digital-signal-processing chips
that find a particular message across a wide spectrum swath captured by
one broadband radio.<BR>
<BR>
With the advance in digital electronics, the advantage of CDMA continually
increases. As the most compute-intensive system, CDMA gains most from the
onrushing increases in the cost- effectiveness of semiconductor electronics.
Qualcomm recently announced that it has reduced all the digital signal processing
for CDMA into one application-specific chip.<BR>
<BR>
For all the indispensable advances of CDMA, however, Qualcomm cannot prevail
alone. It brilliantly executes the move to digital codes, but proprietary
mainframe computer networks are digital, too. As presently conceived, CDMA
still aspires to be a cellular standard using the same mainframe architecture
of mobile telephone switching offices that now serve the analog cellular
system. In itself the Qualcomm solution does little to move cellular toward
the ever cheaper, smaller and more open architectures that now dominate
network computing and will shape PCN.

Hearing Feathers Crash Amid Heavy Metal
</B></PRE>
Consummating the PCN revolution - with its millions of microcells around
the globe and its myriad digital devices and frequencies - will require
a fundamental breakthrough in cellular radio technology. In the new Steinbrecher
minicell introduced early this month at the Cellular Telephone Industry
Association show, that breakthrough is at hand. The first true PC server
for PCN, this small box ultimately costing a few thousand dollars will both
replace and far outperform a 1,000-square-foot base station costing more
than a million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, in an entrepreneurial economy, crucial innovations come as an
utter surprise to all the experts in the field. Donald Steinbrecher began
in the Radio Astronomy Lab at MIT in the 1960s and early 1970s, creating
receivers that could resolve a random cosmic ray among a mass of electromagnetic
noise. This required radios with huge dynamic range - radios that could
hear a feather drop at a heavy metal rock concert. He and his students solved
this intractable problem by creating unique high-performance receivers and
frequency &quot;Mixers.&quot; These could process huge spans of spectrum
with immense variations of power and translate them without loss into intermediate
frequencies. Then, computer systems convert the signals from analog to digital
and analyze them with digital signal processors.<BR>
<BR>
Moving out to begin his own company in 1973, Steinbrecher and his colleagues
made several inventions in the fields of radar and digital signal analysis.
At first, most of their customers were national security contractors in
the intelligence field. For example, Steinbrecher supplied the radios for
the ROTHR (remote over the horizon radar) systems that became famous for
their role in the war against airborne drug traffic. Then in 1986, the company
was asked if its equipment could work in the cellular band.<BR>
<BR>
After cosmic rays and battlefield radar, the cellular band was easy. When
he saw that the digital signal processors at the heart of his systems were
dropping in price tenfold every two years, Steinbrecher knew that his esoteric
radios could become a consumer product.<BR>
<BR>
Translated to cellular, this technology opens entire new frontiers for wireless
telephony. Rather than tuning into one fixed frequency as current cellular
radios do, Steinbrecher's cells can use a high-dynamic-range digital radio
to down-convert and digitize the entire cellular band. TDMA, CDMA, near
or far, analog cellular, video, voice or data, in any combination, it makes
no difference to the Steinbrecher system. His minicell converts them all
at once to a digital bit stream. The DSPs take over from there, sorting
out the TDMA and CDMA signals from the analog signals and reducing each
to digital voice. To the extent the Steinbrecher system prevails, it would
end the need for hybrid phones and make possible a phased shift to PCN or
a variety of other digital services.<BR>
<BR>
Hoping to use Qualcomm chipsets and other technology, Steinbrecher could
facilitate the acceptance of CDMA. For CDMA, the minicell provides a new,
far cheaper radio front end that offers further relief to the near-far problem
and is open to the diverse codes and fast-moving technologies of PCN. For
the current cellular architecture, however, Steinbrecher offers only creative
destruction, doing for large base stations what the integrated circuit did
for racks of vacuum tubes in old telephone switches.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the new minicell replaces a rigid structure of giant analog
mainframes with a system of wireless local area networks. Reconciling a
variety of codes and technologies, the Steinbrecher devices resemble the
smart hubs and routers from SynOptics Communications and Cisco Systems that
are transforming the world of wired computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Best of all, at a time when the computer industry is preparing a massive
invasion of the air, these wide and weak radios can handle voice, data and
even video at the same time. Further, by cheaply accommodating a move from
scores of large base stations to scores of thousands of minicells per city
- on poles, down alleys or in elevator shafts - the system fulfills the
promise of the computer revolution as a spectrum multiplier. Since each
new minicell can use all the frequencies currently used by a large cell
site, the multiplication of cells achieves a similar multiplication of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the Steinbrecher receivers can accommodate the coming move into
higher frequencies. Banishing once and for all the concept of spectrum scarcity,
these high-dynamic-range receivers can already handle frequencies up to
the &quot;W band&quot; of 90 gigahertz and more. 
<PRE>


<B>


Boundless Bandwidth
</B></PRE>
The future of wireless communications is boundless bandwidth, accomplished
through the Shannon strategy of wide and weak signals, moving to ever smaller
cells with lower power at higher frequencies. The PCN systems made possible
by Qualcomm and Steinbrecher apply this approach chiefly to voice and data.
Recent announcements by Bossard and Hovnanian extend the concept to television
video as well. Last December, they disclosed that their company, Cellular
Vision, was already wirelessly delivering 49 cable television channels to
350 homes near Brighton Beach, Long Island, in the 28-gigahertz band. They
declared a plan to soon sign up some 5,000 new customers a month all over
New York.<BR>
<BR>
Among engineers in cellular and cable firms, Cellular Vision evokes the
same responses of incredulity and denial familiar at Qualcomm and Steinbrecher.
Like them, Bossard is resolutely on the right side of the Shannon and Shockley
divide. In answer to the multitude of qualms and objections and demurrals,
all three companies cite the huge benefits of more bandwidth. Qualcomm can
assign some 416 times as much bandwidth to each call as a current cellular
or TDMA system. Steinbrecher's minicell receivers can process 4,160 times
as much bandwidth as an analog cell site or TDMA radio.<BR>
<BR>
Hovnanian achieves some 300 times the bandwidth of a broadcast TV station
and some three times the bandwidth of even a typical cable head end. For
Hovnanian's so-called multipoint local distribution system, the FCC has
allocated a total of two gigahertz between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz - one
gigahertz for TV and one gigahertz for experimental data and phone service.
This large swath of spectrum allows Cellular Vision to substitute bandwidth
for power. Using FM rather than the AM system of cable, Cellular Vision
gains the same kind of increased fidelity familiar in FM radio. Assigning
20 megahertz to each channel - three times the six megahertz of an analog
system - Cellular Vision proves the potency of wide and weak by getting
20 decibels - some 10 times - more signal quality. These extra decibels
come in handy in the rain.<BR>
<BR>
With a radius of three miles, Cellular Vision cells are about 100 times
smaller than telephone cells. Transmitting only 10 milliwatts per channel
over a three-mile radius, the system gets far better signal-to-noise ratios
than the three-watt radios of cellular phones or the multikilowatt systems
of AM radio or television broadcasts. The millimeter wavelengths at 28 gigahertz
allow narrowband high-gain antennas that lock onto the right signal and
isolate it from neighboring cells. At 28 gigahertz, small antennas command
the performance of much larger ones (for example, a six-inch antenna at
28 gigahertz is equivalent to a three-foot antenna at 4 gigahertz or a 300-foot
antenna at broadcast television frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
In Brighton Beach the receiving antennas, using a fixed- phased-array technology,
are just four inches square, and the transmitting antennas deliver 49 channels
from a one-inch omnidirectional device on a box the size of a suitcase.
Between cells, these transmitters can send programming and other information
through a conventional point-to-point microwave link. 
<PRE>


<B>


Singing in the Rain
</B></PRE>
So what happens in the rain? Well, it seems that Cellular Vision does better
than conventional cable. When you have small cells in geodesic low-power
wireless networks using the full computational resources of modern microchips,
you have plenty of extra decibels in your signal-to-noise budget to endure
the most violent storms. Indeed, the 350 Brighton Beach customers of Cellular
Vision received continuous service during the November 1992 near hurricane
in New York, which brought floods that interrupted many cable networks for
hours. One competitive advantage of Cellular Vision over cable seems to
be less vulnerability to water.<BR>
<BR>
Moving television radically toward the regime of wide and weak, Bossard
and the Hovnanians have changed the dimensions of the air. However, they
cannot escape the usual burdens of the innovator. Any drastic innovation
must be some 10 times as good as what it replaces. Otherwise, the installed
base, engineering momentum and customer loyalty of the incumbents will prevail
against it.<BR>
<BR>
Cellular Vision faces a wired cable system with some $18 billion in installed
base. Already deploying fiber at a fast pace, cable companies plan to move
within the next year toward digital compression schemes that increase capacity
or resolution by a factor of between six and 10 (depending on the character
of the programming). That means some 500 digital channels or more. TCI,
the leading cable company, has ordered some one million cable converter
and decompression boxes from General Instruments' Jerrold subsidiary for
delivery late in 1993. In the U.S. cable industry, Hovnanian faces an aggressively
moving target. Most cable experts doubt he can make much of a dent.<BR>
<BR>
This view may be shortsighted. Clearly, Cellular Vision - and its likely
imitators - can compete in the many areas with incompetent cable systems,
in areas yet unreached by cable or in new projects launched by developers
such as the Hovnanians. In the rest of the world, cable systems are rare.
Cellular Vision is finding rich opportunities abroad, from Latvia to New
Zealand. Most of all, as time passes, Cellular Vision might find itself
increasingly well positioned for a world of untethered digital devices.<BR>
<BR>
Such a cellular system could be adapted to mobile telephone or computer
services. With a bit-error rate of one in 10 billion, it could theoretically
transmit computer data without error correction. With one gigahertz of bandwidth,
the system could function easily as a backbone for PCN applications, collecting
calls from handsets operating at lower frequencies and passing them on to
telephone or cellular central offices or to intelligent network facilities
of the local phone companies.<BR>
<BR>
The future local loop will combine telephone, teleputer and digital video
services, together with speech recognition and other complex features, in
patterns that will differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Easily customizable
from cell to cell, a system like Bossard's might well offer powerful advantages.<BR>
<BR>
In an era of bandwidth abundance, the Negroponte switch - with voice pushed
to the air and video onto wires - may well give way to this division between
fibersphere and atmosphere. With the fibersphere offering virtually unlimited
bandwidth for fixed communications over long distances, the local loop will
be the bottleneck, thronged with millions of wireless devices. Under these
conditions, a move to high-frequency cellular systems is imperative to carry
the increasing floods of digital video overflowing from the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, led by Qualcomm, Steinbrecher and Cellular Vision, a new generation
of companies is emerging to challenge the assumptions and structures of
the existing information economy. All these companies are recent startups,
with innovations entirely unexpected by international standards bodies,
university experts and government officials. They are the fruit of an entrepreneurial
America, guided by the marketplace into the microcosm and telecosm. 
<PRE>

Why Imitate European Failures?
</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, the European and Japanese experiences with government-guided
strategies should give pause to proponents of similar policies here. Thirty
years of expensive industrial policy targeting computers has left the Europeans
with no significant computer firms at all. The Japanese have done better,
but even they have been losing market share across the board to the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
In the converging crescendos of advance in digital wireless telephony and
computing, progress is surging far beyond all the regulatory maps and guidebooks
of previous years. If the entire capacity of the 28-gigahertz band, renewed
every three miles, is open to telephony and video, bandwidth will be scarcely
more limiting in wireless than it is in glass.<BR>
<BR>
In this emerging world of boundless bandwidth, companies will prevail only
by transcending the folklore of scarcity and embracing the full promise
of the digital dawn. In an era of accelerating transition, the rule of success
will be self- cannibalization. Wire-line phone companies are not truly profitable
today; their reported earnings all spring from slow depreciation of installed
plant and equipment that are fast becoming worthless. As George Calhoun
of IMMC demonstrates in his superb new book, Wireless Access and the Local
Telephone Network (Artech, 1992), new digital wireless connections are already
less than one-third the cost of installing wire-line phones. For the RBOCs,
aggressively attacking their own obsolescent enterprises is their only hope
of prosperity.<BR>
<BR>
As Joseph Schlosser of Coopers & Lybrand observes, self- cannibalization
will not appear to be in the financial interests of the established firms;
it will not prove out in net-present- value terms. There will be no studies
to guarantee its success. Executives will have to earn their pay by going
with their gut. As semiconductor and computer companies have already learned,
phone and cable companies will discover that self-cannibalization is the
only way to succeed in this era - the only way to stop others from capturing
the heart of your business.<BR>
<BR>
This is the lesson of the last decade. When Craig McCaw sold his cable properties
and plunged into cellular telephony and $2 billion of Michael Milken's junk
bond debt, there was no way to prove him right. Today AT&T is preparing
to launch him as a rival to Bill Gates as the nation's richest man. Yet
McCaw cannot rest on his laurels; the hour of the cannibal is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
In theory, the transition should not be difficult for this resourceful and
ingenious entrepreneur, who has long been a leading prophet of ubiquitous
wireless phones and computers - his predicted personal digital assistant,
&quot;Charles.&quot; But a company that has paid billions for its 25-megahertz
national swath of long and strong frequencies faces especially acute dilemmas
in moving toward a regime of wide and weak. As a man - and company - that
has made such transitions before, McCaw is favored by history and by AT&amp;T.
As a giant pillar of the new establishment, though, McCaw may find it as
difficult to shift gears as did the computer establishment before him. The
stakes are even higher. The next decade will see the emergence of fortunes
in ever- changing transmutations of PCN, digital video, multimedia and wireless
computers that dwarf the yields of cable and cellular. The window of opportunity
opens wide and weak.

Philip Hope, divisional vice president for engineering systems of EDS,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has an IQ problem. His chief client and owner, General Motors, wants to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
interconnect thousands of 3-D graphics and computer aided engineering (CAE)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
workstations with mainframes and supercomputers at Headquarters, with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
automated assembly equipment at factories in Lordstown, Indiana, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Detroit, with other powerful processors at their technical center in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Warren, Michigan, with their Opel plant in Ruesselheim, Germany, and with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their design center outside San Diego. On behalf of another client, Hope<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wants to link multimedia stations for remote diagnostics, X-ray analysis,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and pharmaceutical modeling in hospitals and universities across the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
country.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any function involving 3-D graphics, CAE, supercomputer visualization,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lossless diagnostic imaging, and advanced medical simulations demands large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth or communications power. Graphics workstations often operate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
screens with a million picture elements (pixels), and use progressive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
scanning at 60 frames or images a second. Each pixel may entail 24 bits
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
color. That adds up fast to billions of bits (gigabits) a second. And<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that's for last year's technology in a computer industry that is doubling<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
its powers and cost effectiveness every year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Hope needs is bandwidth and connections. The leading bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and connections people have always been the telephone companies. But when<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope goes to the telephone companies, they want to tell him about<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligence: their Advanced Intelligent Network which will be coming on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
line over the next decade or so and will solve all his problems. For now,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they have what they call DS-3 services available in many areas, operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
T-3 lines at 45 megabits (million bits) a second. These facilities are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ample for most computer uses and working together with several different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), Hope should be able to acquire<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
these services in time for a General Motors takeover by Toyota.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope has been through this before. In the early 1980s, he actually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wanted D-3 services. Then he was interconnecting facilities in Southeast,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Michigan, with plants in Indiana and Ohio. But Michigan Bell could not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply the lines in time. EDS had to build a network of microwave towers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to bear the 45 megabit traffic. Later in the decade, the phone companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have even offered him higher capacity fiber optic lines, with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
requirement that the optical bits be slowed down and run periodically<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through an electronic interface so the telco could count the number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;equivalent channels&quot; being used.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Hope and others in the systems integration business need is not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligent networks tomorrow but dumb bandwidth that they can deliver to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their customers flexibly, cheaply, and now. To prepare for future demand,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they want the network to use fiber optics. It so happens that America's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies have some two million miles of mostly unused fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines in the ground today, kept as redundant capacity for future needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope would like to be able to tap into this &quot;dark fiber&quot; for his
own<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a leader in the rapidly expanding field of computer services, EDS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
epitomizes the needs of an information economy. With a backlog of 22<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollars in already contracted business, EDS is currently a seven<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollar company growing revenues at an annual rate of 15 percent,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some three times as fast as the phone companies. EDS will add a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollars or so in new sales in 1992 alone. If the company is to continue
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply leading edge services to its customers, it must command leading edge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications. To EDS, that means dumb and dark networks.<BR>

The &quot;Dark Fiber&quot; Case<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That need has driven EDS into an active role as an ex parte pleader in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Case 911416, currently bogging down in the District of Columbia<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Court of Appeals as the so-called &quot;dark fiber&quot; case. On
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
surface, the case, known as Southwestern Bell et al versus the Federal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Communications Commission and the U.S. Justice Department, pits four<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell telephone companies against the FCC. But the legal maneuvers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
actually reflect a rising conflict between the Bells and several large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
corporate clients over the future of communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond all the legal posturing, the question at issue is whether fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks should be dumb and dark, and cheap, the way EDS and other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers like them. Or whether they should be bright and smart, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;strategically&quot; priced, the way the telephone companies want them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the side of intelligence and light are the phone companies;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southwestern Bell, U.S. West, Bell South, and Bell Atlantic. The forces
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
darkness include key officials at the FCC and such companies as Shell Oil,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the information services arm of McDonald Douglas, long distance network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider Wiltel, as well as EDS.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For most of the four year course of the struggle, it has passed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unnoticed by the media. In summary, the issue may not seem portentous.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The large corporate customers want dark fiber; the FCC mandates that it
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplied; the Bells want out of the business. But for all their obscurity,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the proceedings raise what for the next twenty years will be the central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
issue in communications law and technology. The issue, if not the possible<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trial itself, will shape the future of both the computer and telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries during a period when they are merging to form the spearhead of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Dark fiber&quot; is simply a glass fiber optic thread with nothing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
attached to it, (ie. no light being sent through it). In this &quot;unlit&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
condition, it is available for use without the intermediation of phone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company electronics or intelligent services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the mid-1980s, the Bells leased some of their dark fiber lines to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
several large corporations on an individual case basis. These companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
learned to love dark fiber. But when they tried to renew their leases with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the Bells, the Bells clanged no! Why don't you leave the interconnections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and protocols to us? Why don't you use our marvellous smart network with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the acronyms and intelligent services? Why don't you let us meter your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
use of the fiber and send you a convenient monthly bill for each packet
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bits you send?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EDS and the other firms rejected the offer; they preferred that dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber to the intelligent network. When the Bells persisted in an effort
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
deny new leases, the companies went to the FCC to require the Bells, as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
regulated &quot;common carrier&quot; telephone companies, to continue supplying
dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the fall of 1990, the FCC ruled that the phone companies would have<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to offer dark fiber to all comers under the rules of common carriage.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than accept this new burden, the phone companies petitioned to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
withdraw from the business entirely under what is called a rule 214<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
application. Since the FCC has not acted on this petition, the Bells are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
preparing to go to court to force the issue. Their corporate customers are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ready to litigate as well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is safe to say that none of the participants fully comprehend the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
significance of their courthouse confrontation. To the Bells, after all
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
said and done, the key problem is probably the price. Under the existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
tariff, they are required to offer this service to anyone who wants it for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an average price of approximately $150 per strand of fiber per month. As<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an offering that competes with their T-3 45 megabit (millions of bits) a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second lines and other forthcoming marvels, dark fiber threatens to gobble<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
up their future as vendors of broadband communications to offices, even
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cable TV preempts them as broadband providers to homes. Since the Bells'<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
profits on data are growing some 10 times as fast as their profits on voice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephony, they see dark fiber as a menace to their most promising markets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The technological portents, however, are far more significant even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than the legal and business issues. The coming triumph of dark fiber will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mean not only the end of the telephone industry as we know it but also the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
end of the telephone industry as they plan it: a vast intelligent fabric<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of sophisticated information services. It also could mean a thoroughgoing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restructuring of a computer industry increasingly dedicated to supplying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;smart networks.&quot; Indeed, for most of the world's communications
companies,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
professors of communications theory, and designers of new computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, the triumph of dark and dumb means &quot;back to the drawing board,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
if not back to the dark ages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the new dark ages cannot be held back.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Springing out the depths of IBM's huge Watson Laboratories is a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powerful new invention: the all optical network, that will soon relegate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all bright and smart executives to the Troglodyte file and make dumb and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dark the winning rule in communications.<BR>

The Wringer Effect<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From time to time, the structure of nations and economies goes through<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a technological wringer. A new invention radically reduces the price of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
key factor of production and precipitates an industrial revolution. Before<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
long, every competitive business in the economy must wring out the residue<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the old costs and customs from all its products and practices.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The steam engine, for example, drastically reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
physical force. Power once wreaked at great expense from human and animal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
muscle pulsed cheaply and tirelessly from machines burning coal and oil.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the world, dominance inexorably shifted to businesses and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nations that reorganized themselves to exploit the suddenly cheap resource.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eventually every human industry and activity, from agriculture and sea<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transport to printing and war, had to centralize and capitalize itself to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
take advantage of the new technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Putting the world through the technological wringer over the last<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
three decades has been the integrated circuit, the IC. Invented by Robert<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Noyce of Intel and Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments in 1959, the IC put<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire systems of tiny transistor switches, capacitors, resistors, diodes,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and other once costly electronic devices on one tiny microchip. Made<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chiefly of silicon, aluminum, and oxygen, three of the most common<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
substances on earth, the microchip eventually reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic circuitry by a factor of a million.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As industry guru Andrew Rappaport has pointed out, electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
designers now treat transistors as virtually free. Indeed, on memory<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chips, they cost some 400 millionths of a cent. To waste time or battery<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power or radio frequencies may be culpable acts, but to waste transistors<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is the essence of thrift. Today you use millions of them slightly to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enhance your TV picture or to play a game of solitaire or to fax Doonsbury<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to Grandma. If you do not use transistors in your cars, your offices, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone systems, your design centers, your factories, your farm gear,
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your missiles, you go out of business. If you don't waste transistors,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your cost structure will cripple you. Your product will be either too<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive, too slow, too late, or too low in quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Endowing every information age engineer or PC hacker with the creative<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
potential of a factory owner of the industrial age, the microchip reversed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the centralizing thrust of the previous era. All nations and businesses<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had to adapt to the centrifugal law of the microcosm, flattening<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hierarchies, outsourcing services, liberating engineers, shedding middle<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
management. If you did not adapt your business systems to the new regime,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you would no longer be a factor in the world balance of economic and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
military power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During the next decade or so, industry will go through a new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology wringer and submit to a new law: the law of the telecosm. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new wringer, the new integrated circuit, is called the all optical network.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is a communications system that runs entirely in glass. Unlike existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optic networks, which convert light signals to electronic form in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
order to amplify or switch them, the all optical network is entirely<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
photonic. From the first conversion of the signal from your phone or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer to the final conversion to voice or data at the destination, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
message flies through glass on wings of light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the old integrated circuit put entire electronic systems on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single slivers of silicon, the new IC will put entire communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems on seamless webs of silica. Wrought in threads as thin as a human<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hair, this silica is so pure that you could see through a window of it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seventy miles thick. But what makes the new wringer roll with all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
force of the microchip revolution before it is not the purity but the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
price. Just as the old IC made transistor power virtually free, the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, the all optical network, will make communications power virtually free.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Another word for communications power is bandwidth. Just as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire world had to learn to waste transistors, the entire world will now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to learn how to waste bandwidth. In the 1990s and beyond, every<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry and economy will go through the wringer again.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The impact on the organization of companies and economies, however,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has yet to become clear. What is the law of the telecosm? Will the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology reverse the centrifugal force of the microchip revolution...or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
consummate it? To understand the message of the new regime, we must follow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the rule of microcosmic prophet Carver Mead of Caltech: &quot;Listen to
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology...and find out what it is telling us.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
The Shannon-Shockley Regime<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The father of the all-optical-network, the man who coined the phrase,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
built the first fully functional system, and wrote the definitive book on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the subject, is Paul E. Green, Jr. of Watson Laboratory at IBM. Now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
standing directly in the path of Green's wringer is Robert Lucky, who some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seven years ago at a conference at Cornell first gave Green the idea that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an all optical network might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The leading intellectual in telephony, Lucky recently shocked the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry by shifting from AT&amp;T's Bell Labs, where he was executive director<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of research, to Bellcore, the laboratory of the Regional Bell Operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies (RBOCs). There he will soon have to confront the implications
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's innovation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplating the new technology, Lucky recalls a course on data<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks that he used to teach many years ago with Green. As a computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
man, Green relished the contrast between the onrushing efficiencies in his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology and the relative dormancy in communications. Indeed, for some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twenty five years, while computer powers rose a millionfold, network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacities increased about a thousandfold. It was not until the late 1980s<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that most long distance data networks much surpassed the Pentagon's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;ARPANET&quot; running at 50 kilobits (thousands of bits) per second
since the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mid sixties.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This was the era dominated by the powerful mathematic visions and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
theories of Claude Shannon of MIT and Bell Labs. Shannon was the reclusive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
genius who invented Information Theory to ascertain the absolute carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity of any communications channel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Whether wire or air, channels were assumed to be narrow and noisy, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way God made them (sometimes with help from AT&amp;T). Typical were the
copper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone lines that still link every household to the telephone network and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the air waves that still bear radio and television signals and static.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all-purpose remedy for these narrow, noisy channels was powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Invented at Bell Laboratories by a team headed by William<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Shockley and then developed by Robert Noyce and other Shockley proteges
in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Silicon Valley, silicon transistors and integrated circuits engendered a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
constant exponential upsurge of computing power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throwing ever more millions of ever faster and cheaper transistors at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every problem, engineers created fast computers, multiplexors, and switches<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that seemed to surmount and outsmart every limit of bandwidth or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restriction of wire. This process continues today with heroic new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression tools that allow the creation of full video conferences over
64<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilobit telephone connections. Scientists at Bellcore are now even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
proposing new ways of using the Motion Picture Engineering Group (MPEG)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression standard to send full motion movies at 1.5 megabits a second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
over the 4 kilohertz twisted pair copper wires to the home. Using ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
faster computers, the telephone company is saying it can give you pay-per-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
view movies without installing fiber, or even coaxial cable, to the home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Shannon-Shockley era, the communications might be noisy and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
error prone, but smart electronics could encode and decode messages in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
complex ways that allowed efficient identification and correction of all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
errors. The Shannon channel might be narrow, but fast multiplexors allowed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it to be divided into time slots accommodating a large number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simultaneous users in a system called time division multiplexing. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
channel might clog up when large numbers of users attempted to communicate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with each other at once, but collision detectors or token passers could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sort it all out in nanoseconds. Graphics and video might impose immense<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods of bits on the system, but compression technology could reduce the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods to a manageable trickle with little or no loss of picture quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If all else failed, powerful electronic switches could compensate for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
almost any bandwidth limitations. Switching could make up for the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inadequate bandwidth at the terminals by relieving the network of the need<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to broadcast all signals to every destination. Instead, the central switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could receive all signals and then route them to their appropriate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
addresses.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To this day, this is the essential strategy of the telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies: compensate for narrow noisy bandwidth with ever more powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and intelligent digital electronics. Their &quot;core competence,&quot;
the Bells<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hasten to tell you, is switching. They make up for the shortcomings of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
copper wires by providing smart, powerful digital switches.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Their vision for the future is to join the computer business all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way, making these switches the entering wedge for ever more elaborate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information services. Switches will grow smarter and more sophisticated<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
until they provide an ever growing cornucopia of intelligent voice and fax<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
features, from caller ID and voice mail to personal communications systems<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that follow you and your number around the world from your car commute to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your vacation beach hideaway. In the end, these intelligent networks could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply virtually all the world's information needs, from movies, games and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
traffic updates to data libraries, financial services, news programs, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
weather reports, all climaxing with yellow pages that exfoliate into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigantic global mall of full motion video where your fingers walk (or your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
voice commands echo) from Harrods, to Jardines, to Akihabara, to Century
21<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
without you leaving the couch.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the time when Green and Lucky taught their course, this strategy<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for the future was only a glimmer in the minds of telephone visionaries.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the essence of it was already in place. As Green pointed out,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies' response to sluggishness in communications was to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enter the computer industry, where progress was faster. The creativity of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
digital electronics would save the telephone industry from technical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stagnation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky, however, protested to Green that it was unjust to compare the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two fields. Computers and telecom, as Lucky explained it, operate on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entirely different scales. Computers work in the microscale world of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, putting ever more thousands of wires and switches on single slivers
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
silicon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, telecommunications functions in the macroworld, laying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
out wires and switches across mostly silicon landscapes and seabeds. It<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
necessarily entails a continental, or even intercontinental stretch of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cables, microwave towers, switches, and poles. &quot;How was it possible,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky asked, &quot;to make such a large scale system inexpensive?&quot;
Inherent in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the structure and even the physics of computers and telecommunications,
so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it seemed to Lucky two decades ago, was a communications bottleneck.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Lucky remembers it, Green was never satisfied with Lucky's point.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green believed that someday communications could achieve miracles<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to the integrated circuit in computing....<BR>

The Bandwidth Scandal<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, as Lucky was the first to announce, fiber optics has utterly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
overthrown the previous relationship between fast computers and slow wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now it is computer technology that imposes the bottleneck on the vast<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vistas of dark fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A silicon transistor can change its state some 2.5 billion times a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second in response to light pulses (bundles of photons) hitting a photo-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
detector. Since it would take a human being a thousand years or so of 10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hour workdays even to count to two billion, two billion cycles in a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second (two gigahertz) might seem a sprightly pace. But in the world of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optics running at the speed and frequencies of light, even a rate
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two billion cycles a second is a humbling bow to the slothful pace of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Since optical signals still have to be routed to their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
destinations through computer switches, communications now suffers from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what is known as the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is this electronic bottleneck, the entire Bell edifice of Shannon<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and Shockley, that Paul Green plans to blow away with his all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks. Green is targeting what is a secret scandal of modern<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecommunications: the huge gap between the real capacity of fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and the actual speed of telephone communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In communications systems, the number of waves per second (or hertz)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
represents a rough measure of its potential bandwidth or ultimate carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity. The bandwidth of a radio system, for example, is determined by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the frequency of each station or channel and by the number of stations that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
can fit within the band. Your AM dial, for example, runs from around 535<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand hertz (kilohertz) to 1705 kilohertz and each station uses some
10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilohertz. With an ideal receiver, the AM passband might carry 117<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the intrinsic bandwidth of one strand of dark fiber is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some 25 thousand gigahertz in each of three groups of frequencies (three<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands) through which fiber can transmit light over long distances. At<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a gigahertz per terminal, this bandwidth might accommodate some 25,000<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supercomputer &quot;stations&quot; (or 2.5 billion AM stations). Using what
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
called dispersion shifted fiber, it may be possible to use two of these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands at once: a total of some 40 or 50 thousand gigahertz. For<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparison, consider all the radio frequencies currently used in the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for radio, television, microwave, and satellite communications and multiply<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by two thousand. The bandwidth of one fiber thread could carry more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two thousand times as much information as all these radio and microwave<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies that currently comprise the &quot;air.&quot; One fiber thread
could bear<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twice the traffic on the phone network during the peak hour of Mothers'
Day<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
in the U.S. (the heaviest load currently managed by the phone system).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yet even for point-to-point long distance links, let alone connections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to homes, telephone and computer network engineers now turn their backs
on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
this immense capacity and use perhaps one or two fifty thousandths it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Deferring to the electronic bottleneck, the telephone industry uses fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
merely as a superior replacement for the copper wires, coaxial cables,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
satellite links, and microwave towers that connected the local central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
office switches to one another for long distance calls.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last 15 years, the Bell Laboratory record for fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication has run from 10 megabits per second over a one kilometer span<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to some 10 gigabits per second over nearly one thousand kilometers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the heroic advances in point-to-point links between central offices<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
continued to use essentially one frequency on a fiber thread, while<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ignoring its intrinsic power to accommodate thousands of useful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In a world of all optical networks, this strategy is bankrupt. No<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
longer will it be possible to throw more transistors, however cheap and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fast, at the switching problem. Electronic speeds have become an<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
insuperable bottleneck obstructing the vast vistas of dark fiber beyond.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So called gigabit networks planned by the telephone and computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies will not do. What is needed is not a gigabit spread among many<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals, but a large network functioning at a gigabit per second per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demands of EDS offer a hint of the most urgent business needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Added to them will be consumer demands. True high definition television,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to movies in resolution, requires close to gigabit-a-second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, particularly if the program is dispatched to the viewer in burst<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mode all at once in a few seconds down the fiber, or if the user is given
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chance to shape the picture, choose a vantage point, window several images<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at once, or experience three dimensions. When true broadband channels<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
become available, there will be a flood of new applications comparable to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the thousands of new uses of the IC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No foreseeable progress in electronics can overcome the electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bottleneck. To do that, we need an entirely new communications regime. In<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the form of the all optical network, this regime is now at hand.<BR>
<BR>

Law Of The Telecosm: Networks Dumb As A Stone<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime will use fiber not as a replacement for copper wires<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but as a new form of far more capacious and error-free air. Through a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
system called wavelength division multiplexing and access, computers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephones will tune into desired messages in the fibersphere the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios now tune into desired signals in the atmosphere. The fibersphere<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be intrinsically as dumb and dark as the atmosphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime overcomes the electronic bottleneck by altogether<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
banishing electronics from the network. But, ask the telcos in unison,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what about the switches? As long as the network is switched, it must be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
partly electronic. Unless the network is switched, it is not a true any-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to-any network. It is a broadcast system. It may offer a cornucopia of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services. But it cannot serve as a common carrier like the phone network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
allowing any party to reach any other. Without intelligent switching it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cannot provide personal communications nets that can follow you wherever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you go. Without intelligent switching, the all optical network, so they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
say, is just a glorified cable system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These critics fail to grasp a central rule of the telecosm: bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is a nearly perfect substitute for switching. With sufficient physical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it is possible to simulate any kind of logical switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
whatsoever. Bandwidth allows creation of virtual switches that to the user<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seem to function exactly the way physical switches do. You can send all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
messages everywhere in the network, include all needed codes and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
instructions for correcting, decrypting, and reading them, and allow each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal to tune into its own messages on its own wavelength, just like
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two-way radio. When the terminals are smart enough and the bandwidth great<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enough, your all optical network can be as dumb as a stone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last several years, all optical network experiments have been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
conducted around the world, from Bellcore in New Jersey to NTT at Yokosuka,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Japan. British Telecom has used wavelength division multiplexing to link<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
four telephone central offices in London. Columbia's Telecom Center has<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launched a &quot;Teranet&quot; that lacks tunable lasers or receivers but
can<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
logically simulate them. Bell Laboratories has generated most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology but as a long distance specialist has focussed on the project
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sending gigabits of information thousands of miles without amplifiers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only fully functional system is the Rainbow created by Paul Green at IBM.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As happens so often in this a world of technical disciplines sliced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
into arbitrary fortes and fields, the large advances come from the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrators. Paul Green is neither a laser physicist, nor an optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
engineer, nor a telecommunications theorist. At IBM, his work has ranged<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
from overseeing speech recognition projects at Watson Labs to shaping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company strategy at corporate headquarters in Armonk. His most recent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
success was supervising development of the new APPN (Advanced Peer to Peer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Network) protocol. According to an IBM announcement in March, APPN will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
replace the venerable SNA (systems network architecture) that has been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
synonymous with IBM networking for more than a decade.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green took some pride in this announcement, but by that time, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
project was long in his past. He was finishing the copy editing on his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
magisterial tome on Fiber Optic Networks (published this summer by Prentice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hall). And he was moving on to more advanced versions of the Rainbow which<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
he and his team had introduced in December 1991 at the Telecom 91<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Conference in Geneva and which has been installed between the various<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
branches of Watson Laboratories in Westchester County, N.Y.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Peter Drucker points out, a new technology cannot displace an old<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
one unless it is proven at least 10 times better. Otherwise the billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of installed base and thousands of engineers committed
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
improving the old technology will suffice to block the new one. The job
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Paul Green's 15 man team at IBM is to meet that tenfold test.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's all optical network creates a fibersphere as neutral and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passive as the atmosphere. It can be addressed by computers the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios and television sets connect to the air. Consisting entirely of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unpowered glass and passive spitters and couplers, the fibersphere is dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dumb. Any variety of terminals can interconnect across it at the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
time using any protocols they choose.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as radios in the atmosphere, computer receivers connected to the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere do not find a series of bits in a message; they tune into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wavelength or frequency. Because available Fabry Perot tunable filters<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
today have larger bandwidth than tunable lasers, Green chose to locate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rainbow's tuning at the receiver and have transmitters each operate at a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fixed wavelength. But future networks can use any combination of tunable<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
equipment at either end.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Green began the project in 1987, the industry stood in the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
general position as the pioneers of radio in the early years of that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry. They had seemingly unlimited bandwidth before them, but lacked<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters and receivers powerful enough to use it effectively. Radio<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters suffered &quot;splitting losses&quot; as they broadcast their
signals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
across the countryside. Green's optical messages lose power everytime they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are split off to be sent to another terminal or are tapped by a receiver.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The radio industry solved this problem by the development of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
audion triode amplifier. Green needed an all optical amplifier to replace<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the optoelectronic repeaters that now constitute the most widespread<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic bottleneck in fiber. Amplifiers in current fiber networks first<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert the optical signal to an electronic signal, enhance it, and then<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert it back to photons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like the pioneers of radio, Green soon had his amplifier in hand.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following concepts pioneered by David Payne at the University of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southhampton in England, a Bell Laboratories group led by Emmanuel<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Desurvire and Randy Giles developed a workable all optical device. They<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
showed that a short stretch of fiber doped with erbium, a rare earth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mineral, and excited by a cheap laser diode, can function as a powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier over the entire wavelength range of a 25,000 gigahertz system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today such photonic amplifiers enhance signals in a working system of links<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between Naples and Pomezia on the west coast of Italy. Manufactured in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
packages between two and three cubic inches in size, these amplifiers fit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
anywhere in an optical network for enhancing signals without electronics.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This invention overcame the most fundamental disadvantage of optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks compared to electronic networks. You can tap into an electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
network as often as desired without weakening the voltage signal. Although<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
resistance and capacitance will weaken the current, there are no splitting<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
losses in a voltage divider. Photonic signals, by contrast, suffer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
splitting losses every time they are tapped; they lose photons until<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
eventually there are none left. The cheap and compact all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier solves this problem.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Not only did Green and his IBM colleagues create working all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, they also reduced the interface optoelectronics to a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microchannel plug-in card that can fit in any IBM PS/2 level personal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer or R6000 workstation. Using off-the-shelf components costing a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
total of $16,000 per station, Rainbow achieved a capacity more than 90<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
times greater than FDDI at an initial cost merely four times as much.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Jack Kilby's first ICs were not better than previous adders<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and oscillators, the Rainbow I is not better in some respects than rival<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks based on electronics. At present it connects only 32 computers
at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a speed of some 300 megabits per second, for a total bandwidth of 9.5<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigabits. This rate is huge compared to most other networks, but it is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
still well below the target of a system that provides gigabit rates for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A more serious limitation is the lack of packet switching. Rather<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than communicating down a dedicated connection between two parties, like<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phones do, computer networks send data in small batches, called packets,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
each bearing its own address. This requires switching back and forth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between packets millions of times a second. Neither the current Rainbow's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lasers nor its filters can tune from one message to another more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of times a second. This limitation is a serious problem for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
links to mainframes and supercomputers that may do many tasks at once in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
different windows on the screen and with connections to several other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Green shows, however, all these problems are well on the way to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
solution. A tide of new interest in all optical systems is sweeping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the world's optical laboratories. The Pentagon's Defense Advanced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Projects Agency (DARPA) has launched a program for all optical networking.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Green installed as the new President of the IEEE Communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Society, the technical journals are full of articles on new wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division technology. Every few months brings new reports of a faster laser<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with a broader bandwidth, or filter with faster tuning, or an ingenious
new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way to use bandwidth to simulate packet switching. Today lasers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
receivers can switch fast enough but they still lack the ability to cover<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the entire bandwidth needed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key point, however, is that as demonstrated both in Geneva and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Armonk, the Green system showed the potential efficiency of all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Even in their initial forms they are more cost effective in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth per dollar than any other network technology. Scheduled for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
introduction within the next two years, Rainbow III will comprise a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand stations operating at a gigabit a second, with the increasingly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
likely hope of fast packet switching capability. At that point, the system<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be a compelling commercial product at least hundreds of times more<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost effective than the competition.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Without access to dark fiber, however, these networks will be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
worthless. If the telephone companies fail to supply it, they risk losing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
most of the fastest growing parts of their business: the data traffic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
which already contributes some 50 percent of their profits. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
also a possibility that they will lose much of their potential consumer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
business as well: the planned profits in pay-per-view films and electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
yellow pages. This is the message of a second great prophet of dark fiber,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Will Hicks of Southbridge, Massachusetts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A venerable inventor of scores of optical products, Hicks believes<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that Green's view of the future of fiber is too limited. Using wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division, Hicks can see the way to deliver some 500 megahertz two-way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
connections to all the homes in America for some $400 per home. That is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fifty times the 10 megahertz total capacity of an Ethernet (with no one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
else using it) for some 20 percent of the cost. That is capacity in each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
home for twenty digital two-way HDTV channels at once at perhaps half the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost of new telephone connections. Then, after a large consumer market<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
emerges for fiber optics, Hicks believes, Green's sophisticated computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services will follow as a matter of course.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The consumer market, Hicks maintains, is the key to lowering the cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the components to a level where they can be widely used in office<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks as well. He cites the example of the compact disk laser diode.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once lasers were large and complex devices, chilled with liquid nitrogen,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and costing thousands of dollars; now they are as small as a grain of salt,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cheap as a box of cereal, and more numerous than phonograph needles. An<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
executive at Hitachi told Hicks that Hitachi could work a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation on laser diodes and amplifiers for all optical networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just tell me what price you want to pay and I'll tell you how many
you<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to buy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The divergence of views between the IBM executive and the wildcat<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inventor, however, is far less significant than their common vision of dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber as the future of communications. By the power of ever cheaper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it will transform all industries of the coming information age<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
just as radically as the power of cheaper transistors transformed the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries of the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the telephone companies, the age of ever smarter terminals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mandates the emergence of ever dumber networks. This is a major strategic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge; it takes a smart man to build a dumb network. But the telcos<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have the best laboratories and have already developed nearly all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
components of the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Telephone companies may complain of the large costs of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation of their system, but they command capital budgets as large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as the total revenues of the cable industry. Telcos may recoil in horror<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at the idea of dark fiber, but they command webs of the stuff ten times<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
larger than any other industry. Dumb and dark networks may not fit the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company self-image or advertising posture. But they promise larger<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
markets than the current phone company plan to choke off their future in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the labyrinthine nets of an &quot;intelligent switching fabric&quot; always
behind<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
schedule and full of software bugs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telephone companies cannot expect to impose a uniform network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
governed by universal protocols. The proliferation of digital protocols<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and interfaces is an inevitable effect of the promethean creativity of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer industry. Green explains, &quot;You cannot fix the protocol zoo.
You<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
must use bandwidth to accommodate the zoo.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Robert Pokress, a former switch designer at Bell Labs now head of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unifi Corporation, points out, telephone switches (now 80 percent software)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are already too complex to keep pace with the efflorescence of relatively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simple computer technology on their periphery. While computers become ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more lean and mean, turning to reduced instruction set processors, networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
need to adopt reduced instruction set architectures. The ultimate in dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dark is the fibersphere now incubating in their magnificent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laboratories.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The entrepreneurial folk in the computer industry may view this<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wrenching phone company adjustment with some satisfaction. But the fact
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that computer companies face a strategic reorientation as radical as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telcos do. In a world where ever smarter terminals require ever dumber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications, computer networks are as gorged and glutted with smarts
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company networks and even less capacious. The nation's most<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
brilliant nerds, commanding the 200 MIPS Silicon Graphics superstations
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mac Quadra multimedia power plants, humbly kneel before the 50 kilobit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines of the Internet and beseech the telcos to upgrade to 64 kilobit basic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ISDN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now addicted to the use of transistors to solve the problems of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limited bandwidth, the computer industry must use transistors to exploit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the opportunities of nearly unlimited bandwidth. When home-based machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are optimized for manipulating high resolution digital video at high<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speeds, they will necessarily command what are now called supercomputer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powers. This will mean that the dominant computer technology will emerge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
first not in the office market but in the consumer market. The major<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge for the computer industry is to change its focus from a few<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hundred million offices already full of computer technology to a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
living rooms now nearly devoid of it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies possess the advantage of already owning dumb networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
based on the essentials of the all optical model of broadcast and select--<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of customers seeking wavelengths or frequencies rather than switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
circuits. Cable companies already provide all the programs to all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals and allow them to tune in to the desired messages. Uniquely in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the world, U.S. cable firms already offer a broadband pipe to ninety<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
percent of American homes. These coaxial cables, operating at one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigahertz for several hundred feet, provide the basis for two way broadband<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services today. But the cable industry cannot become a full service<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplier of telecommunications until it changes its self-image from a cheap<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider of one way entertainment services into a common carrier of two
way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information. Above all, the cable industry cannot succeed in the digital<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
age if it continues to regard the personal computer as an alien and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
irrelevant machine.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Analogous to the integrated circuit in its economic power, the all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optical network is analogous to the massively parallel computer in its<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technical paradigm. In the late 1980s in computers, the effort to make one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor function ever faster on a serial stream of data reached a point<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of diminishing returns. Superpipelining and superscalar gains hit their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limits. Despite experiments with Josephson Junctions, high electron<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mobility, and cryogenics, usable transistors simply could not made to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
switch much faster than a few gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Computer architects responded by creating machines with multiple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processors operating in parallel on multiple streams of data. While each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor worked more slowly than the fastest serial processors, thousands<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of slow processors in parallel could far outperform the fastest serial<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Measured by cost effectiveness, the massively parallel machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dwarfed the performance of conventional supercomputers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The same pattern arose in communications and for many of the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
reasons. In the early 1990s the effort to increase the number of bits that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could be time division multiplexed down a fiber on a single frequency band<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had reached a point of diminishing returns. Again the switching speed of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transistors was the show stopper. The architects of all optical networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
responded by creating systems which can use not one wavelength or frequency<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but potentially thousands in parallel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Again, the new systems could not outperform time division multiplexing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
on one frequency. But all optical networks opened up a vast vista of some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
75 thousand gigahertz of frequencies potentially usable for communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That immense potential of massively parallel frequencies left all methods<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of putting more bits on a single set of frequencies look as promising as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launching computers into the chill of outer space in order to accelerate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their switching speeds.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the law of the microcosm made all terminals smart,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
distributing intelligence from the center to the edges of the network, so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the law of the telecosm creates a network dumb enough to accommodate the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
incredible onrush of intelligence on its periphery. Indeed, with the one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chip supercomputer on the way, manufacturable for under a hundred dollars<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
toward the end of the decade, the law of the microcosm is still gaining<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
momentum. The fibersphere complements the promise of ubiquitous computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power with equally ubiquitous communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What happens, however, when not only transistors but also wires are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nearly free? As Robert Lucky observes in his forward to Paul Green's book,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many of us have been conditioned to think that transmission is inherently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive; that we should use switching and processing wherever possible
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
minimize transmission.&quot; This is the law of the microcosm. But as Lucky<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speculates, &quot;The limitless bandwidth of fiber optics changes these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assumptions. Perhaps we should transmit signals thousands of miles to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
avoid even the simplest processing function.&quot; This is the law of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecosm: use bandwidth to simplify everything else.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Daniel Hillis of Thinking Machines Corporation offers a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vision, adding to Lucky's insight the further assertion that massively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
parallel computer architectures are so efficient that they can overthrow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the personal computer revolution. Hillis envisages a powerplant computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
model, with huge Thinking Machines at the center tapped by millions of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively dumb terminals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these speculations assume that the Law of the Telecosm usurps the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Law of the Microcosm. But in fact the two concepts function in different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ways in different domains.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Electronic transistors use electrons to control, amplify, or switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons. But photonics differ radically from electronics. Because<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moving photons do not affect one another on contact, they cannot readily
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
used to control, amplify, or switch each other. Compared to electrons,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moreover, photons are huge: infrared photons at 1550 or 1300 nanometers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are larger than a micron across. They resist the miniaturization of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microcosm. For computing, photons are far inferior to electrons. With<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single electron electronics now in view, electrons will keep their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
advantage. For the foreseeable future, computers will be made with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What are crippling flaws for photonic computing, however, are huge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assets for communicating. Because moving photons do not collide with each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
other or respond to electronic charges, they are inherently a two way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
medium. They are immune to lightning strikes, electromagnetic pulses, or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrical power surges that destroy electronic equipment. Virtually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
noiseless and massless pulses of radiation, they move as fast and silently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Listening to the technology, as Caltech prophet Carver Mead<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
recommends, one sees a natural division of labor between photonics and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Photonics will dominate communications and electronics will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dominate computing. The two technologies do not compete; they are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
beautiful complements of each other.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm makes distributed computers (smart terminals)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more efficient regardless of the cost of linking them together. The law
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the telecosm makes dumb and dark networks more efficient regardless of how<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
numerous and smart are the terminals. Working together, however, these two<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laws of wires and switches impel ever more widely distributed information<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is the narrow bandwidth of current phone company connections that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
explains the persistence of centralized computing in a world of distributed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Narrowband connections require smart interfaces and complex<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
protocols and expensive data. Thus you get your online information from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only a few databases set up to accommodate queries over the phone lines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You limit television broadcasting to a few local stations. Using the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively narrowband phone network or television system, it pays to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
concentrate memory and processing at one point and tap into the hub from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of remote locations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Using a broadband fiber system, by contrast, it will pay to distribute<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
memory and services to all points on the network. Broadband links will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
foster specialization. If the costs of communications are low, databases,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
libraries, and information services can specialize and be readily reached<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by customers from anywhere. On line services lose the economies of scale<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that lead a firm such as Dialog to attempt to concentrate most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
world's information in one set of giant archives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By making bandwidth nearly free, the new integrated circuit of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere will radically change the environment of all information<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries and technologies. In all eras, companies tend to prevail by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
maximizing the use of the cheapest resources. In the age of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere, they will use the huge intrinsic bandwidth of fiber, all 25<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand gigahertz or more, to replace nearly all the hundreds of billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of switches, bridges, routers, converters, codecs,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compressors, error correctors, and other devices, together with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trillions of lines of software code, that pervade the intelligent switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fabric of both telephone and computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The makers of all this equipment will resist mightily. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
no chance that the old regime can prevail by fighting cheap and simple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optics with costly and complex electronics and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical network will triumph for the same reason that the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrated circuit triumphed: it is incomparably cheaper than the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
competition. Today, measured by the admittedly rough metric of MIPS per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollar, a personal computer is more than one thousand times more cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
effective than a mainframe. Within 10 years, the all optical network will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
be millions of times more cost effective than electronic networks. Just
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the electron rules in computers, the photon will rule the waves of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical ideal will not immediately usurp other technologies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Vacuum tubes reached their highest sales in the late 1970s. But just as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the IC inexorably exerted its influence on all industries, the all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology will impart constant pressure on all other communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Every competing system will have to adapt to its cost structure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, almost all electronic communications will go through the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wringer and emerge in glass.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is the real portent of the dark fiber case wending its way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the courts. The future of the information age depends on the rise<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dumb and dark networks to accommodate the onrush of ever smarter<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Ultimately at stake is nothing less than the future of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer and communications infrastructure of the U.S. economy, its<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
competitiveness in world markets, and the consummation of the age of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information. Although the phone companies do not want to believe it, their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
future will be dark.

Dear Senator:


As a small business owner and taxpayer, I strongly encourage
you to support efforts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act.  This 
outdated, discriminatory act has cost hard working taxpayers 
billions, and inhibited the opportunities of small 
construction firms and unskilled (mostly minority) workers.

Davis-Bacon is an example of what's wrong with Washington. 
This anti-market law has no place in our government, yet 
lawmakers elected for change have been unable to repeal it.
I am shocked to hear that some Members of Congress actually
want to "reform" Davis-Bacon by expanding it.

When the Republicans pulled Davis-Bacon out of the budget 
reconciliation bill they sent a signal to voters.  Such 
activity told the public the majority party wasn't willing 
to aggressively support bold regulatory and fiscal reform.  
The confidence I had in Congress since the '94 election is 
being eroded by the failures of this Congress to enact bold 
reforms.  This failure only benefits special interests at 
the expense of all taxpayers and our system of free 
enterprise.

As a member of the Small Business Survival Committee, I 
understand the implications of keeping a law like Davis-
Bacon on the books.  Time should have run out for Davis-
Bacon, and Members of Congress should repeal this harmful 
law.

Sincerely,

Black Conservatives</CENTER>

<P><CENTER><B>by Bruce Chapman</B></CENTER>
<P><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
	Question : What do Anthony Lowe, the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney of King
County, Washington who is running for State Insurance Commissioner, Teresa
Doggett, the international banker running for Congress from Austin, Texas
and Danny Covington of Vicksburg, Mississippi, another Congressional hopeful,
have in common?<BR>
<BR>
	 Answer: they all are  conservative black Republicans who are likely to
seek support from BAMPAC--&quot;Black America's Political Action Committee.&quot;
 Expecting to raise over $1 million this year from a membership list of
37,000, BAMPAC is cited by Hill Magazine in Washington, D.C. as the fastest
growing new political action committee in the country. Its founder was the
principled and charismatic former Reagan Administration Ambassador, Alan
Keyes, who ran for president in the GOP primaries last spring.<BR>
<BR>
	A few years ago, black Republican candidates were  rarities, especially
in predominantly white districts. They did run in black districts, but were
considered little more than sacrificial lambs. Therefore, when 11 blacks
ran for Congress on the GOP line in 1990, most observers considered the
development significant. Six years later there are at least 24 black GOP
Congressional candidates--now including two incumbents, Gary A.Franks of
Connecticut and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. As happened to blacks on the Democratic
ticket in the '70's, there suddenly are black Republicans showing up in
state offices, such as Secretary of State Victoria Buckley of Colorado and
Ohio State Treasurer J. Kenneth Blackwell. <BR>
<BR>
	Moreover, more Republican blacks are contesting Democrats in predominately
black areas. Mississippi's Danny Covington, a former parole officer and
Congressional aide with a  conservative social message, is the first black
to win a Republican primary in that state since Reconstruction days, over
a century ago. The state's US Senators, both Republicans, strongly supported
Covington against a white primary challenger.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, the Repbublican party could only go up in terms of  black support.
Just 10 percent identify today with the party of Lincoln. But there are
ocassional races where GOP candidates receive up to 40 percent black support,
and that edge often proves decisive.<BR>
<BR>
	The first black US Senator since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts
in the 1970's, was a Repbublican--one of the rarities. But Brooke was a
liberal Republican, as were many of the appointed officials advanced by
Republican presidents until Reagan. They not only backed the civil rights
gains of the '60's--as did most Republican then, and almost all by the next
decade--but also the more controversial programs, such as racial set-asides
and quotas. Their closest prominent counterpart today would be Gen. Colin
Powell, who supports &quot;affirmative action,&quot; while opposing &quot;preferences,&quot;
a fine distinction.<BR>
<BR>
	In any case, most newer black Republican elective officials are more conservative.
In this they are closest to the top black legal official in the land, Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas. They like to point out that while the Republican
party, as such, is not popular among blacks, there are strong conservative
currents running in the overall black electorate.<BR>
<BR>
	A 1992 survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a
generally liberal think tank, confirms that more blacks call themselves
conservative than liberal (33 percent to 29 percent). A more recent poll
by the center provides a fascinating breakdown of these averages, showing
that younger black voters, 18-25, were nearly twice as likely to identify
with the Republicans as were older ones (18 percent versus 8 percent) and
to call themselves conservatives (34 percent versus 22 percent). <BR>
<BR>
	Overall, black voters supported the death penalty 58 percent to 42 percent,
backed a two year limit on welfare by 58 percent also, by nearly 75 percent
backed mandatory sentences for drug dealers, and by 61 percent agreed that
black leaders were too quick to cite racism as an excuse for black crime.<BR>
<BR>
	The Gallup survey, similarly, found 53 percent disapproval of mandatory
busing among black voters, 48 percent pro-life sentiment and 77 percent
opposition to preferential treatment to make up for past discrimination.
Some 92 percent of blacks believe in God, a figure higher than for the population
as a whole (about 85 percent).<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, these surveys do not predict voter behavior and, moreover, wording
(for example, &quot;affirmative action&quot; versus &quot;preferential treatment&quot;)
can change poll outcomes for all groups in society. Just as Southern whites
agreed with Republicans in such polls for many years and still voted overwhelmingly
Democratic, there is little sign yet of political reallignment among black
voters nationally.<BR>
<BR>
	Yet it could come; and even a rise to 20  or 30 percent Republican support
would  transform the political landscape. Likewise, an increase of black
Republicans in Congress from two to, say, six, effectively would end the
monolithic Democratic support the media and other observers expect of black
Americans. It also might end the recent tendency of the Democratic party
to take black voters for granted. <BR>
<BR>
	However, white Republicans, too, should pay close attention to what black
members of their party are telling them. The old government solutions to
social and economic problems have failed, but, as General Powell stated
at the GOP convention, there is still a demand for solutions of some kind.
Economic opportunity is crucial. Within the party, personal or political
slights are as unwelcome as ever. Unconscious white discrimination burns
the hearts of  conservative as well as liberal blacks.<BR>
<BR>
	It's just that black conservatives, stressing family, entrepreneurism and
community self-help, believe they have found a better way of moving forward.<BR>

<P>
STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:
<P>
While attending college, plaintiffs Ernest A. Tuckett III and
William Demps, Jr. also worked as &quot;testers&quot; for the
Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington. In December 1990,
both Tuckett and Demps, who are black, were paired with white
testers also employed by the Council. On successive days, the
two pairs of testers--equipped with fake credentials intended
to be comparable--sought employment referrals from BMC Marketing
Corporation, which runs an employment agency in the District of
Columbia. Both times the white tester received a referral and
the black tester did not; indeed, BMC allegedly refused even to
accept an application from one of the two black testers. On the
basis of these tests, the Council and the two black testers sued
BMC in federal district court, alleging that BMC has &quot;a pattern,
practice and policy of employment discrimination on the basis
of race&quot;. The plaintiffs asserted claims under two different
federal statutes--42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e--and
one local statute. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief
as well as damages of various sorts.
<P>
BMC moved to dismiss the complaint for want of standing. The district
court denied the motion but granted BMC leave to take an interlocutory
appeal under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b), 829 F.Supp. 402; we permitted
the appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part. While the Fair
Employment Council can maintain a portion of its suit, the individual
testers cannot.
<P>
I. The Individual Testers
<P>
A. Federal Claims
<P>
Neither of the federal statutes that they invoke gives the tester
plaintiffs a cause of action for damages, and they lack standing
to seek the other forms of relief requested.
<P>
1. Claims for Damages
<P>
a. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981
<P>
Section 1981 gives all citizens of the United States &quot;the
same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts
... as is enjoyed by white citizens&quot;, language that the Supreme
Court has interpreted to prohibit not only racially discriminatory
government interference with private contracting but also purely
private discrimination in contracts. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S.
160, 168, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2593, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976); Patterson
v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 171-75, 109 S.Ct. 2363,
2369-72, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989). The testers assert that BMC violated
their rights under this statute in two distinct ways: it deprived
them of the opportunity to enter into contracts with BMC for employment
referrals, and it deprived them of the opportunity to enter into
employment contracts on referral by BMC. In the context of this
case, however, neither assertion states a valid claim under Sec.
1981.
<P>
As for the first assertion, BMC denies that it enters into contracts
with the people who seek referrals from it. The plaintiffs respond
that this argument assumes factual matters that should be dealt
with in further proceedings. But even if BMC sometimes does enter
into contracts with job-seekers, the testers here made conscious
and material *1271 misrepresentations of fact by deceiving BMC
about their intentions and by presenting BMC with fictitious credentials.
Any resulting contracts between the tester plaintiffs and BMC
would have been voidable at BMC's option, as the plaintiffs appear
to recognize. See, e.g., Rest. (2d) of Contracts Sec. 164(1) (1981).
Even on the plaintiffs' argument, then, BMC did not deny the testers
the opportunity to enter into a contract that they could have
enforced.
<P>
Certainly the loss of the opportunity to enter into a void contract--i.e.,
a contract that neither party can enforce--is not an injury
<P>
cognizable under Sec. 1981, for a void contract is a legal nullity.
From the perspective of the party who obtains a contract through
misrepresentations, however, it is generally worse for the contract
to be voidable than for it to be void; in the absence of any kind
of ratification, a voidable contract simply gives the other party
an option. In any event, the rule that contracts obtained through
misrepresentations are merely voidable rather than void seems
designed entirely to protect the target of the misrepresentations.
We conclude, therefore, that the loss of the opportunity to enter
into a contract voidable at the other party's will is not cognizable
under Sec. 1981. Cf., e.g., Kawitt v. United States, 842 F.2d
951, 953 (7th Cir.1988) (job obtained by material misrepresentation
is not a property right on which constitutional suit may be founded).
<P>
The plaintiffs' second assertion fails because the testers concededly
had no interest in securing a job through BMC. Indeed, they had
promised the Council to refuse any offer of employment that they
received in conjunction with their testing activities. See Plaintiffs'
Rule 108(h) Statement of Genuine Factual Issues (Sept. 18, 1992)
at 17; Defendant Snelling &amp; Snelling, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss
and/or for Summary Judgment (June 23, 1992) tab 14 at 17. In depositions,
both of the tester plaintiffs confirmed that they would have rejected
any job offer obtained through a referral from BMC. Plaintiffs'
Statement tab 20 at 92 (Tuckett); Snelling's Motion tab 16 at
233-34 (Demps). At most, then, BMC deprived the tester plaintiffs
of the opportunity to refuse to enter into an employment contract
with BMC's clients. This too is not an injury cognizable under
Sec. 1981.
<P>
Our conclusion that the tester plaintiffs are not entitled to
damages under Sec. 1981 arguably conflicts with decisions of the
Third and Eleventh Circuits, but the analysis in those decisions
is not directly on point. In Meyers v. Pennypack Woods Home Ownership
Ass'n, 559 F.2d 894 (3d Cir.1977), overruled on other grounds
by Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 777 F.2d 113 (3d Cir.1985), aff'd,
482 U.S. 656, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987), the Third
Circuit held that fair-housing testers had standing to sue under
Sec. 1981 and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1982, a parallel provision that guarantees
all citizens &quot;the same right, in every State and Territory,
as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof&quot; to engage in a variety
of transactions involving property. Meyers, however, addressed
exclusively the proposition that a plaintiff's standing is not
defeated by the fact that he subjected himself to legal injury
solely for the purpose of determining whether his rights would
be violated, with the intent to bring suit if they were. Cf.,
e.g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 558, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1219-20,
18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); Evers v. Dwyer, 358 U.S. 202, 79 S.Ct.
178, 3 L.Ed.2d 222 (1958) (per curiam). Meyers did not address
whether the testers had in fact suffered any legal injury within
the meaning of Secs. 1981 or 1982. At most, it simply assumed
that the testers had a cause of action under those provisions,
and it may not have considered the issue at all. See Meyers, 559
F.2d at 898.
<P>
Watts v. Boyd Properties, 758 F.2d 1482 (11th Cir.1985), is similarly
unpersuasive. Though the Eleventh Circuit did indicate that fair-housing
testers have a cause of action under Sec. 1982 (and hence, presumably,
under Sec. 1981), it rested this view chiefly on Meyers.
<P>
Our conclusion that the tester plaintiffs lack a cause of action
under Sec. 1981 is perfectly consistent with Havens Realty Corp.
v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982),
which held that black fair-housing testers had standing to sue
over alleged violations of Sec. 804(d) of the Fair Housing Act
of 1968. There, Congress had *1272 clearly conferred a cause of
action on the testers; Sec. 804(d) made it unlawful &quot;[t]o
represent to any person because of race ... that any dwelling
is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling
is in fact so available&quot;, and Sec. 812 provided that &quot;[t]he
rights granted by section[ ] ... 804 ... may be enforced by civil
actions in appropriate United States district courts&quot;. See42
U.S.C. Secs. 3604(d), 3612(a). Under these statutory provisions,
it did not matter that the testers merely posed as potential renters
or purchasers; regardless of their intentions, the statute gave
them &quot;an enforceable right to truthfulinformation concerning
the availability of housing&quot;. Havens, 455 U.S.
<P>
at 373-74, 102 S.Ct. at 1121 (emphasis added). The question for
theHavens Court, then, was simply whether Congress could constitutionally
confer such a cause of action--i.e., whether the denial of truthful
information to testers caused them any &quot;injury in fact&quot;.
The Court's answer to this constitutional question has no bearing
on the proper interpretation of Sec. 1981.
<P>
b. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(b)
<P>
The tester plaintiffs also sought damages under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII declares that &quot;[i]t shall
be an unlawful employment practice for an employment agency to
fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate
against, any individual because of his race&quot;. 42 U.S.C. Sec.
2000e-2(b). After exhausting certain administrative remedies (as
the plaintiffs have done), &quot;a person claiming to be aggrieved&quot;
by any such practice may sue the offending employment agency in
court. Id. Sec. 2000e-5(b), (c), (f)(1). This statutory scheme
is much more analogous than Sec. 1981 to the provisions of the
Fair Housing Act that were at issue in Havens. (FN1) For our purposes,
however, the available remedies are critically different.
<P>
Had the tester plaintiff in Havens proved her claims, the district
court could have awarded her damages. See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 3612(b);
cf. United States v. Balistrieri, 981 F.2d 916, 932-33 (7th Cir.1992).
At the time of the alleged discrimination against the testers
here, however, only equitable remedies were available under Title
VII. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(g); see also United States v. Burke,
--- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1867, 1873-74, 119 L.Ed.2d 34 (1992)
(contrasting &quot;the circumscribed remedies available under
Title VII&quot; with the remedies available under the Fair Housing
Act). The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the remedies available
under Title VII, see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981a, but the new remedial
provisions cannot be applied to conduct occurring before the enactment
of the 1991 statute. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, --- U.S. ----,
114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).
<P>
2. Claims for Prospective Relief
<P>
Since the tester plaintiffs have no cause of action for damages
under either Sec. 1981 or Title VII, their federal claims reduce
to their request for injunctive or declaratory relief. Yet under
City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75
L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), they lack standing to seek such prospective
relief, for they have not made sufficient allegations that they
are threatened with any future illegality.
<P>
The plaintiff in Lyons alleged that Los Angeles police, without
provocation, had subjected him to a chokehold that had knocked
him unconscious and injured his larynx. In addition to damages,
he sought an injunction barring the police from applying such
chokeholds in the future. But the Supreme Court held that he had
no standing to seek injunctive relief. Despite his allegations
of past injury, his standing to seek the injunction &quot;depended
on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use
of the chokeholds by police officers&quot;. Id. at 105, 103 S.Ct.
at 1667 (emphasis added). While conceding the possibility that
&quot;there will be certain instances *1273 in which strangleholds
will be illegally applied and injury ... unconstitutionally inflicted
upon the victim&quot;, the Court thought it &quot;no more than
speculation to assert ... that Lyons himself will again be involved
in one of those unfortunate instances&quot;. Id. at 108, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668. In short, while Lyons could maintain a suit for damages,
he could not maintain his suit for an injunction because he &quot;has
made no showing that he is realistically threatened by a repetition
of his experience&quot;. Id. at 109, 103 S.Ct. at 1669. The same
rationale, we have observed, would also have kept him from bringing
a suit for declaratory relief. Haase v. Sessions, 835 F.2d 902,
911 (D.C.Cir.1987); see also, e.g., Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S.
103, 108-10, 89 S.Ct. 956, 959-61, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969); City
of Houston v. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Dev't, 24 F.3d
1421, 1429 n. 6 (D.C.Cir.1994).
<P>
Here, the tester plaintiffs made several different references
to future injury in their complaint. In general, however, these
future injuries spring entirely from BMC's past conduct. See,
e.g., Second Amended Complaint p 44 (suggesting that testers will
continue to feel embarrassment and humiliation over their treatment
during the tests); id. p 7. To pursue an injunction or a declaratory
judgment, the tester plaintiffs must allege a likelihood of future
violations of their rights by BMC, not simply future effects from
past violations. Lyons is directly on point, for the Court there
denied standing despite the plaintiff's allegation that he continued
to fear that he would suffer a fatal chokehold in a future encounter
with the police. &quot;The emotional consequences of a prior act&quot;,
the Court observed, &quot;simply are not a sufficient basis for
an injunction absent a real and immediate threat of future injury
by the defendant.&quot; Lyons, 461 U.S. at 107 n. 8, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668 n. 8.
<P>
Only once in their complaint do the tester plaintiffs even come
close to alleging that they will suffer any future illegality
at BMC's hands. In their Sec. 1981 count (though not in their
Title VII count), they assert that &quot;[u]nless restrained by
this Court, defendants will continue to deny, on the basis of
race, said plaintiffs and third parties who may be unaware of
the defendants' discriminatory conduct[ ] the right to make and
enforce contracts for employment.&quot; Second Amended Complaint
p 50. The reference to third parties, of course, does not help
the tester plaintiffs establish standing; to satisfy the requirements
of Article III, they must allege that they themselves are likely
to suffer future injury. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 108-09, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668-69. Nonetheless, the quoted passage constitutes the only
conceivable support for the plaintiffs' argument that the complaint
contains the requisite claims of future injuries, which they sort
into two distinct types.
<P>
First, the plaintiffs assert standing on the basis of &quot;BMC's
continuing failure to refer Mr. Demps or Mr. Tuckett for employment
on account of their race&quot;. Appellees' Brief at 36. This allegation,
however, does the tester plaintiffs no good; as we explained above,
see supra part I.A.1.a., BMC's refusal to act on the testers'
applications does not violate Sec. 1981. And even if we import
the same allegation into the plaintiffs' Title VII count, the
facts as alleged by the plaintiffs would not make out a continuing
violation of Title VII either. The tester plaintiffs sought referrals
from BMC solely on the basis of their fictitious credentials and
their misrepresentations about their desire for jobs. Now that
BMC is aware of the deception, it surely has no duty to continue
to consider the testers for employment referrals.
<P>
The plaintiffs also claim that their complaint, fairly read, raises
&quot;the possibility that as people entering the job market or
as testers they will in the future seek job referrals from BMC&quot;.
Appellees' Brief at 36. But nowhere does the complaint assert
that the tester plaintiffs are likely ever to return to BMC seeking
employment referrals, let alone that they will do so at any point
&quot;in the reasonably near future&quot;. Cf. Lyons, 461 U.S.
at 108, 103 S.Ct. at 1668-69; see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,
--- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2138, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)
(rejecting standing for want of sufficiently &quot;imminent&quot;
future injury). Even now, in fact, the plaintiffs do not suggest
that there is any likelihood that the two testers will re-initiate
contact with BMC; they refer only to the &quot;possibility&quot;
of this event. That *1274 possibility seems remote indeed. Their
usefulness as testers is minimal because they are now known to
BMC, and indeed it does not appear from the materials before us
that they are still employed as testers at all. Their adversarial
relationship with BMC, moreover, as well as their established
record as deceivers, make it highly implausible that they would
ever return as bona fide job seekers. Cf.United Transp. Union
v. ICC, 891 F.2d 908, 913 n. 8 (D.C.Cir.1989) (court may discredit
incredible allegations).
<P>
The district court overlooked these problems on the theory that
the plaintiffs themselves control whether they re-initiate contact
with BMC. Mem.Op. at 7. But this fact does not excuse the plaintiffs
from alleging that they plan to do so. To the contrary, the Supreme
Court has categorically rejected the proposition that a plaintiff
seeking prospective relief need assert a threat of imminent future
injury &quot;only when the alleged harm depends upon 'the affirmative
actions of third parties beyond a plaintiff's control' &quot;.
See Defenders of Wildlife, --- U.S. at ---- n. 2, 112 S.Ct. at
2139 n. 2.
<P>
In any event, the plaintiffs simply do not control whether they
will suffer any future injury, for they do not control whether
BMC would discriminate against them in any future encounter. Suppose
we could assume that the tester plaintiffs are likely to return
to BMC in the reasonably near future. Indeed, for the sake of
their Sec. 1981 claim (and possibly even their Title VII claim,
see supra at 6 n. 1), suppose we could assume that they will do
so as bona fide candidates for employment rather than as testers.
They would still appear to be in much the same position as the
plaintiff in Lyons: while he presumably could have initiated another
encounter with the Los Angeles police, he could not control whether
he would be subjected to a second illegal chokehold.
<P>
In Lyons, the Supreme Court stated that unless the plaintiff could
allege that Los Angeles ordered or authorized its police officers
to apply unprovoked chokeholds, he could &quot;establish an actual
controversy in this case&quot; only by &quot;mak[ing] the incredible
assertion ... that all police officers in Los Angeles always choke
any citizen with whom they happen to have an encounter&quot;.
Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105-06, 103 S.Ct. at 1667. This formulation
may be hyperbolic; indeed, Lyons itself said that the plaintiff's
standing to seek an injunction &quot;depended on whether he was
likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds
by police officers&quot;. Id. at 105, 103 S.Ct. at 1667 (emphasis
added); see also International Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied
Craftsmen v. Meese, 761 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C.Cir.1985) (adopting
&quot;fairly probable&quot; as standard). But see Whitmore v.
Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 1724-25, 109 L.Ed.2d
135 (1990) (indicating that plaintiff whose standing rests on
threat of future injury must show that this injury is &quot;certainly
impending&quot;); Defenders of Wildlife, --- U.S. at ---- n. 2,
112 S.Ct. at 2139 n. 2 (same); Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Espy,
23 F.3d 496, 500-01 (D.C.Cir.1994), (same). Whatever the exact
standard for judging the likelihood of future injury, however,
the tester plaintiffs here have said nothing to indicate that
future violation of their rights is even remotely probable. Indeed,
besides its oblique statement that BMC's treatment of the testers
reflects &quot;a pattern, practice and policy of employment discrimination
on the basis of race&quot;, the complaint does not even address
the likelihood that BMC may discriminate against the individual
plaintiffs in the future.
<P>
For all these reasons, the facts as alleged in the complaint do
not come close to indicating that either tester &quot;will again
be subjected to the alleged illegality&quot;. See Lyons, 461 U.S.
at 109, 103 S.Ct. at 1669. The tester plaintiffs therefore lack
standing to seek prospective relief.
<P>
B. The Possibility of Amendment
<P>
As a fallback position, the plaintiffs claim that &quot;the appropriate
course is to remand to the District Court to permit plaintiffs
an opportunity to amend and supplement their Complaint&quot;.
Appellees' Brief at 37 n. 26. In Havens, which involved a challenge
to a realty company's alleged practice of steering white customers
to white areas and black customers to black areas, the Supreme
Court followed this course with respect to two plaintiffs who
alleged that the company's actions *1275 had deprived them of
the benefits of living in an integrated community. Though the
complaint simply stated that these plaintiffs were &quot;residents
of the City of Richmond or Henrico County&quot;, the Court said
they would have standing only if they lived in neighborhoods where
the company's actions had &quot;an appreciable effect&quot;. See
Havens, 455 U.S. at 376-77, 102 S.Ct. at 1122-24. Because the
complaint was not sufficiently specific about where they lived,
it was &quot;impossible to say&quot; whether its factual allegations,
if proved, would demonstrate the requisite injury. Id. at 378,
102 S.Ct. at 1124. Citing Rule 12(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, the Court therefore remanded with instructions for
the district court to give the plaintiffs &quot;an opportunity
to make more definite the allegations of the complaint&quot;.
Id.
<P>
The Court's later decisions clarify the reasoning behind this
disposition.
<P>
Havens came to the Court on the defendant's motion to dismiss
the case on the pleadings, pursuant to Rule 12(b). Though courts
addressing such motions usually must &quot;presume[ ] that general
allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to
support the claim&quot;, Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed'n, 497
U.S. 871, 889, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3189, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990), Havens
establishes that such a presumption is unwarranted when the allegations
are too general. Even then, however, the contrary presumption
may be inappropriate; faced with such allegations, courts ruling
on a Rule 12(b) motion often should not assume that the claim
is invalid without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to make
more specific claims. (FN2)
<P>
The case before us is quite different. We do not confront a complaint
whose allegations are so general that we cannot tell whether,
if proved, they would demonstrate injury in fact. To the contrary,
the allegations plainly are not sufficient to support standing,
for they simply do not deal with the likelihood of any future
injury to the plaintiff testers. What is necessary, then, is not
the &quot;more definite statement&quot; contemplated by Rule 12(e),
but an amendment adding allegations that the present complaint
does not even touch upon. Rule 15(a) makes clear that the plaintiffs
have no automatic right to add those allegations.
<P>
On the other hand, district courts do have the discretion to permit
such amendments when considering a motion to dismiss for want
of standing. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197,
2206-07, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); see also, e.g., Gladstone, Realtors
v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 113 n. 25, 99 S.Ct. 1601,
1614 n. 25, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S.
727, 736 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1367 n. 8, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972);
Newark Branch, NAACP v. Town of Harrison, 907 F.2d 1408, 1416-17
(3d Cir.1990). Here, the district court did not consider whether
to exercise this discretion, because it erroneously believed that
no amendment was necessary. Accordingly, while we vacate the district
court's denial of BMC's motion to dismiss the individual testers'
suit, we do not order it to grant that motion; instead, we remand
the case for the district court to exercise its sound discretion
over whether to permit amendment. We see no reason why plaintiffs
who win in the district court should automatically be in a worse
position than plaintiffs whose allegations of standing have been
rightly found defective by the district court.
<P>
Of course, a plaintiff's successful effort to persuade a trial
court to take an erroneous view of the law may yield different
equities from those prevailing in the absence of such an effort.
In some circumstances, it might well be an abuse of discretion
for the district court to permit plaintiffs to add new allegations
to a complaint after their adversaries have been forced to spend
substantial time and effort litigating the adequacy of the old
allegations. Cf. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. at 897,
110 S.Ct. at 3193 (&quot;[A] *1276 litigant's failure to buttress
its position because of confidence in the strength of that position
is always indulged at the litigant's own risk.&quot;). But in
any event, the matter of amendment is in the first instance for
the district court.
<P>
C. Pendent Claims under District of Columbia Law
<P>
The tester plaintiffs have also asserted a cause of action under
the District of Columbia's Human Rights Act. That statute contains
a provision similar to Sec. 2000e-2(b), see D.C.Code Sec. 1-2512(a)(2),
and it goes further than the original Title VII by authorizing
suits for damages as well as for equitable relief, see id. Sec.
1-2556. But the testers were able to bring their claim under this
statute to federal court only because it was pendent to their
federal claims. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1367(a). As a result, even
if the plaintiffs have a cause of action for damages under D.C.
law, it will be within the district court's discretion whether
or not to dismiss this claim if it dismisses both their federal
claims. See id. Sec. 1367(c)(3); cf. Clifton Terrace Assocs. v.
United Technologies Corp., 929 F.2d 714, 723 (D.C.Cir.1991).
<P>
II. The Fair Employment Council
<P>
The other plaintiff in this action, the Fair Employment Council
of Greater Washington, fares better under our analysis. The Council
does not claim standing on behalf of any members; in fact, it
is not a membership organization. Cf. Hunt v. Washington State
Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S.
<P>
333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). It claims
instead that BMC's allegedly discriminatory actions have caused
it injury in its own right.
<P>
We agree that the Council has alleged &quot;injury in fact&quot;
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III. And, though
the Council is suing BMC over alleged violations of statutory
rights enjoyed by third parties, we conclude that Congress did
give the Council a cause of action under Title VII. We also conclude,
however, that the Council has no cause of action under Sec. 1981.
<P>
A. Article III Standing
<P>
Like the fair-housing organization that was one of the plaintiffs
in Havens, the Council has a broad goal of promoting equal opportunity
independent of merely seeking more enforcement of the civil rights
laws. Second Amended Complaint p 5. Its testing program is but
one means toward this goal; the Council also conducts &quot;community
outreach and public education, counseling, and research projects&quot;.
Declaration of Charles W. Jackson p 8 (Sept. 18, 1992). The complaint
alleges that BMC's discriminatory actions have interfered with
these efforts and programs and have also required the Council
to expend resources to counteract BMC's alleged discrimination.
Second Amended Complaint pp 45, 58, 60.
<P>
These allegations closely track the claims that the Supreme Court
found sufficient in Havens. See Havens, 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct.
at 1124-25. Fairly read, they indicate that BMC's alleged pattern
of discrimination--evidenced by the alleged treatment of the testers--has
made the Council's overall task more difficult. Discrimination
by BMC, for instance, might increase the number of people in need
of counseling; similarly, to the extent that BMC's actions have
made it harder for minorities to find jobs in greater Washington,
they may have reduced the effectiveness of any given level of
outreach efforts. If discriminatory actions taken by BMC have
&quot;perceptibly impaired&quot; the Council's programs, &quot;there
can be no question that the organization has suffered injury in
fact&quot;. Id.
<P>
In reaching this conclusion, however, we explicitly reject the
Council's suggestion that the mere expense of testing BMC constitutes
&quot;injury in fact&quot; fairly traceable to BMC's conduct.
The diversion of resources to testing might well harm the Council's
other programs, for money spent on testing is money that is not
spent on other things. But this particular harm is self-inflicted;
it results not from any actions taken by BMC, but rather from
the Council's own budgetary choices. Indeed, it is not really
a harm at all; assuming that BMC's actions did not have any other
effect on the Council's programs independent of its efforts to
increase legal pressure *1277 on possible open housing violators,
the Council and its programs would have been totally unaffected
if it had simply refrained from making the re-allocation. One
can hardly say that BMC has injured the Council merely because
the Council has decided that its money would be better spent by
testing BMC than by counseling or researching. (FN3)
<P>
We disagree with the Seventh Circuit that Havens would support
such a purely self-referential injury. In Village of Bellwood
v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521 (7th Cir.1990), the court concluded
that even when a fair-housing organization's other activities
had not been impaired by the defendant's discriminatory practices,
&quot;the only injury which need be shown ... is deflection of
the agency's time and money from counseling to legal efforts directed
against discrimination.&quot; Id. at 1526. By this logic, the
time and money that plaintiffs spend in bringing suit against
a defendant would itself constitute a sufficient &quot;injury
in fact&quot;, a circular position that would effectively abolish
the requirement altogether. Indeed, an organization devoted exclusively
to advancing more rigorous enforcement of selected laws could
secure standing simply by showing that one alleged illegality
had &quot;deflected&quot; it from pursuit of another, contrary
to such decisions as Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop
the War, 418 U.S. 208, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). Havens
did not so hold. The Court there did not base standing on the
diversion of resources from one program to another, but rather
on the alleged injury that the defendants' actions themselves
had inflicted upon the organization's programs. To be sure, the
Court did mention the &quot;drain on the organization's resources&quot;.
Yet this drain apparently sprang from the organization's need
to &quot;counteract&quot; the defendants' assertedly illegal practices,
and thus was simply another manifestation of the injury that those
practices had inflicted upon &quot;the organization's noneconomic
interest in encouraging open housing&quot;, an interest that is
quite intelligible apart from the allied efforts at increasing
legal pressure on civil-rights violators. See Havens, 455 U.S.
at 379 &amp; n. 20, 102 S.Ct. at 1124 &amp; n. 20; cf. Spann v.
Colonial Village, 899 F.2d 24, 27-29 (D.C.Cir.1990) (finding standing
because in order to offset defendant's allegedly discriminatory
advertisements, plaintiff organization had to spend more on its
educational and counseling efforts).
<P>
A corollary of our conclusion is that the Council's standing stems
from BMC's actions against bona fide employment candidates, not
from BMC's actions against the testers. The Council has adequately
alleged that BMC has a pattern or practice of discrimination,
and its treatment of the testers may be some evidence of such
a pattern. Any harm to the Council's programs, however, flows
from BMC's refusal to refer genuine job-seekers for employment.
As this case proceeds, the Council will have to provide support
for its claim that BMC's alleged discrimination has &quot;perceptibly
impaired&quot; its programs.
<P>
B. Cause of Action
<P>
Though the Council has adequately alleged an &quot;injury in fact&quot;
sufficient to meet the requirements of Article III, this does
not necessarily mean that Congress has conferred a cause of action
upon it. BMC has done nothing to impair the Council's own right
to make contracts, nor is the Council even capable of seeking
an employment referral. Instead, the Council's asserted injuries
flow from BMC's alleged violations of other people's rights under
Sec. 1981 and Title VII. This fact triggers concerns about an
aspect of the &quot;prudential&quot; limits on standing: ordinarily,
a plaintiff &quot;must assert his own legal interests, rather
than those of third parties&quot;. Gladstone, Realtors, 441 U.S.
at 100, 99 S.Ct. at 1608.
<P>
*1278 To phrase the principle this way, however, is to beg the
question. If Congress has given the Council a cause of action
to redress the injuries that it is suffering as a result of BMC's
alleged discrimination against candidates for referrals, then
the Council is indeed suing to protect its own &quot;legal interests&quot;.
Cf., e.g., Smith v. City of Cleveland Heights, 760 F.2d 720, 724
(6th Cir.1985). A more precise statement of the principle, then,
is that a statute ordinarily will not be interpreted to confer
causes of action upon people whose only injuries derive from the
violation of others' rights under the statute.
<P>
When the &quot;prudential&quot; limits on standing to raise statutory
claims are understood in this way--as a set of presumptions that
courts use in determining whether the statutes in question confer
a cause of action upon the plaintiff, see, e.g., Warth v. Seldin,
422 U.S. 490, 500-01, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205-07, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975);
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. United States Environmental
Protection Agency, 861 F.2d 277, 283 (D.C.Cir.1988)--the &quot;prudential&quot;
label seems a misnomer. These &quot;prudential&quot; rules are
simply canons of statutory interpretation, and Congress is free
to override the normal presumptions. In Havens, for instance,
the Supreme Court noted that Congress intended standing to sue
under Sec. 812 of the Fair Housing Act to extend to the full reach
permitted by the Constitution, and concluded that &quot;the courts
accordingly lack the authority to create prudential barriers to
standing in suits brought under that section&quot;. Havens, 455
U.S. at 372, 102 S.Ct. at 1120; accord Warth, 422 U.S. at 501,
95 S.Ct. at 2206-07. Statutes of this sort confer a cause of action
upon everyone who meets the Article III requirements--that is,
anyone &quot;genuinely injured by conduct that violates someone's
... rights&quot; under the statute. Gladstone, Realtors, 441 U.S.
at 103 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. at 1609 n. 9.
<P>
Our case law establishes that Title VII is such a statute. Congress
specifically permitted any &quot;person claiming to be aggrieved&quot;
by an unlawful employment practice to file suit (after exhausting
certain other potential avenues of relief). See 42 U.S.C. Sec.
2000e-5(f)(1). This language, we have held, opens the courts to
&quot;anyone who satisfies the constitutional requirements&quot;.
Gray v. Greyhound Lines, 545 F.2d 169, 176 (D.C.Cir.1976); see
also Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205,
209, 93 S.Ct. 364, 366-67, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972) (citing with
approval the Third Circuit's decision to the same effect). Accordingly,
if the Council can back up its allegations of Article III standing
with actual proof, it has a cause of action under Title VII.
<P>
Section 1981 is a different matter. A footnote in Gray indicated
that there too standing extended to the full extent permissible
under Article III. Gray, 545 F.2d at 176 n. 18. This conclusion,
however, rested on an unsustainable assumption that the Supreme
Court, in citing a snippet of Title VII's legislative history
to the effect that the remedies available under Title VII were
&quot;co-extensive&quot; with an individual's right to sue under
Sec. 1981, meant that Congress had identically resolved prudential
standing issues under the two statutes. See Johnson v. Railway
Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 459, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1719-20, 44
L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). In fact, as the Supreme Court made clear,
the committee's statement that Title VII and Sec. 1981 were &quot;co-extensive&quot;
simply meant that the two statutes co-existed, with the result
that Title VII did not pre-empt whatever rights an individual
might enjoy under Sec. 1981. Id.
<P>
Moreover, Gray 's view of Sec. 1981 flatly conflicts with the
Supreme Court's holding in Warth v. Seldin. There, an organization
whose members included residents of the town of Penfield, New
York, complained that the town's zoning ordinance excluded people
of low and moderate income in violation of those people's rights
under Sec. 1981. This exclusion, in turn, injured the organization's
members by depriving them of the benefits of living in an integrated
community. Such an injury satisfies the constitutional requirements,
and the Court accordingly has recognized it as a basis for standing
in suits under the Fair Housing Act (which confers standing to
the full extent permitted by Article III). See Trafficante, 409
U.S. at 208-10, 93 S.Ct. at 366-67. In Warth, however, the Court
held that Sec. 1981 was critically different *1279 from the Fair
Housing Act in this respect. Invoking the &quot;prudential&quot;
rule against allowing litigants &quot;to raise putative rights
of third parties&quot;, it accordingly barred the organization's
suit. Warth, 422 U.S. at 512-14, 93 S.Ct. at 2212-13.
<P>
As one would expect, then, other circuits--including our own--have
rejected Gray 's view of Sec. 1981. In Mackey v. Nationwide Insurance
Companies, 724 F.2d 419 (4th Cir.1984), an insurance agent attempted
to challenge his former employer's alleged practice of refusing
to underwrite risks in predominantly black neighborhoods. The
agent claimed that this practice had forced him to forgo the money
that he could have earned by selling policies in these areas.
But while Congress could constitutionally have conferred a cause
of action upon the agent to redress this &quot;injury in fact&quot;,
the court held that Sec. 1981 did not do so. Distinguishing Sec.
1981 from the Fair Housing Act, the court decided that standing
under Sec. 1981 is restricted to &quot;the direct victims of the
alleged discriminatory practice&quot;, at least as long as there
is no impediment to suits by those victims. Id. at 422.
<P>
We too have now explicitly embraced Mackey rather than Gray. In
Clifton Terrace Associates v. United Technologies Corp., 929 F.2d
714 (D.C.Cir.1991), the owner of a low-income housing complex
sued the Otis Elevator Company and its corporate parent for refusing
to negotiate a service contract for the elevators in the complex,
allegedly because the residents of the complex were overwhelmingly
black. The owner plainly had suffered &quot;injury in fact&quot;
as a result of this refusal, for its elevators were deteriorating;
indeed, the city government had taken action against it for violating
its duties as a landlord. Accordingly, we dealt with the owner's
Fair Housing Act claims on the merits. But we accorded a different
treatment to the owner's claims under Sec. 1981. Concluding that
&quot;the direct victims of the alleged discrimination are the
residents of Clifton Terrace&quot; rather than the owner, we invoked
Mackey to hold that the owner could not sue under Sec. 1981. Id.
at 721. (FN4) Accordingly, our law is now in accord with that
of the Supreme Court and other circuits in concluding that Sec.
1981 does not confer a cause of action on persons whose injuries
derive only from the violation of others' rights.
<P>
In arguing that the &quot;prudential&quot; barriers to standing
nonetheless do not preclude its particular suit, the Council cites
Des Vergnes v. Seekonk Water District, 601 F.2d 9 (1st Cir.1979).
Yet that case does not get it very far. Des Vergnes held simply
that Sec. 1981 confers an implied right of action &quot;against
any other person who, with a racially discriminatory intent, interferes
with [the plaintiff's] right to make contracts with nonwhites&quot;;
by the same token, the statute confers an implied right of action
&quot;against any other person who, with a racially discriminatory
intent, injures [the plaintiff] because he made contracts with
nonwhites&quot;. Id. at 14; see also Winston v. Lear-Siegler,
Inc., 558 F.2d 1266, 1270 (6th Cir.1977); DeMatteis v. Eastman
Kodak Co., 511 F.2d 306, 312, modified, 520 F.2d 409 (2d Cir.1975);
cf. Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 237, 90 S.Ct.
400, 404-05, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969) (reaching parallel result under
Sec. 1982). Implicit *1280 in Sec. 1981, these cases declare,
is a cause of action protecting people from private retaliation
for refusing to violate other people's rights under Sec. 1981,
or for exercising their own Sec. 1981 rights. The present case
simply does not implicate this principle.
<P>
The normal presumption against reading a statute to authorize
&quot;derivative&quot; causes of action--that is, causes of action
to redress injuries that derive entirely from the violation of
someone else's rights under the statute--is subject to only one
exception that is even arguably relevant here. Courts sometimes
infer that the legislature intended to authorize such causes of
action when, in their absence, no one would be able to assert
the statutory rights that the legislature created. Because of
this inference, a litigant might have a cause of action even though
his injuries flow from the violation of other people's statutory
rights, at least if both of the following conditions are met:
(1) the litigant's interests are aligned with the other people's
interests, and (2) the other people are unable to bring suit in
their own right. See, e.g., Canfield Aviation v. National Transp.
Safety Bd., 854 F.2d 745, 748 (5th Cir.1988); Flittie v. Solem,
827 F.2d 276, 280 (8th Cir.1987); In re Merrill Lynch Relocation
Management, Inc., 812 F.2d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.1987).
<P>
But even assuming that the Council's interests are aligned with
those of the direct victims of BMC's alleged discrimination, the
obstacles to suit by those victims are not serious enough to warrant
the inference that Sec. 1981 confers a cause of action upon the
Council. To be sure, the people to whom BMC denies employment
referrals may not necessarily know why their applications were
unsuccessful, and so the possible victims of BMC's alleged discrimination
may not always know who they are. But the Council itself could
remedy much of the problem simply by publicizing the results of
its tests and offering litigation assistance to people who suspect
(on the basis of this new information) that BMC has discriminated
against them. In the present case, as in Warth v. Seldin, &quot;there
is no indication that [direct victims of discrimination by BMC]
are disabled from asserting their own right in a proper case.&quot;
Warth, 422 U.S. at 510, 95 S.Ct. at 2211. Certainly they do not
face anything like the practical obstacles confronting people
excluded from a jury for discriminatory reasons, whose rights
the Court has allowed a criminal defendant to assert. See Powers
v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 414-15, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1372-73, 113 L.Ed.2d
411 (1991) (describing the &quot;daunting&quot; barriers to suit
by an excluded juror); cf. Scott v. Greenville County, 716 F.2d
1409, 1416 (4th Cir.1983) (hypothesizing preemptive discrimination
that could never be identified with any individual victims).
<P>
The Third Circuit has perceived &quot;seemingly inconsistent strains&quot;
in the Supreme Court's treatment of whether &quot;the 'obstacle'
factor&quot; is an essential prerequisite to third-party standing,
Amato v. Wilentz, 952 F.2d 742, 749 (3d Cir.1991), and has resorted
to a &quot;more flexible balancing approach&quot; in an effort
to make sense of the Court's jurisprudence. Id. at 749-50 &amp;
n. 8. But we think the cases can in fact be reconciled.
<P>
Apart from cases involving &quot;the 'obstacle' factor&quot;,
the Court generally has
<P>
allowed a litigant to assert the rights of a third party &quot;only
when the third party's rights protect that party's relationship
with the litigant&quot;. Haitian Refugee Center v. Gracey, 809
F.2d 794, 809 (D.C.Cir.1987). (FN5) In the lion's share of these
cases, the litigant seeks to challenge direct restrictions on
its own activities on the ground that enforcement of the restrictions
against it would dilute or abrogate the rights of third parties.
As the Court has summed up its jurisprudence, &quot;When ... enforcement
of a restriction against the litigant prevents a *1281. third
party from entering into a relationship with the litigant (typically
a contractual relationship), to which relationship the third party
has a legal entitlement (typically a constitutional entitlement),
third-party standing has been held to exist.&quot; United States
Dep't of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 720, 110 S.Ct. 1428,
1431, 108 L.Ed.2d 701 (1990); see also Warth, 422 U.S. at 510,
95 S.Ct. at 2211. For example, the Court has allowed beer vendors
to assert the equal-protection rights of their potential customers
in challenging a prohibition on the sale of beer to young males,
Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 195, 97 S.Ct. 451, 455, 50 L.Ed.2d
397 (1976); distributors of contraceptive devices to assert the
privacy rights of contraceptive purchasers in challenging restrictions
on the distributors, Carey v. Population Servs. International,
431 U.S. 678, 682-84, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 2014-16, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977);
and booksellers to assert the First Amendment rights of bookbuyers
in challenging the prohibition of certain commercial displays,
Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 392-93,
108 S.Ct. 636, 642-43, 98 L.Ed.2d 782 (1988). Less frequently,
the Court has allowed litigants to assert third parties' rights
in challenging restrictions that do not operate directly on the
litigants themselves, but that nonetheless allegedly disrupt a
special relationship--protected by the rights in question--between
the litigants and the third parties. See, e.g., Pierce v. Society
of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (allowing
military academy and parochial school to assert constitutional
rights of students and parents in challenging state law requiring
parents to send their children to government school); see also
Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617,
623-24 n. 3, 109 S.Ct. 2646, 2651-52 n. 3, 105 L.Ed.2d 528 (1989)
(allowing lawyers to challenge federal forfeiture laws that allegedly
violate their clients' Sixth Amendment right to counsel); Singleton
v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 113-18 &amp; n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2873-76
&amp; n. 7, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (plurality opinion) (allowing
abortion-performing doctors to complain that restrictions on Medicaid
payments for abortion violate the constitutional rights of women
seeking abortions). See generally National Cottonseed Products
Ass'n v. Brock, 825 F.2d 482, 489-92 &amp; n. 15 (D.C.Cir.1987).
<P>
Whatever the precise limits of these cases, they offer no help
to the Council. The Council certainly faces no direct restriction
on its own activities, and the Sec. 1981 rights of people who
seek referrals from BMC are unrelated to any special relationship
between those people and the Council. Under Warth v. Seldin, the
Council therefore cannot bring suit to complain about the violation
of those people's Sec. 1981 rights. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 514
n. 22, 95 S.Ct. at 2213 n. 22.
<P>
* * * * * *
<P>
To sum up, the Council lacks a cause of action under Sec. 1981.
It can proceed with its Title VII claim, but it has a cause of
action only to the extent that the effects of BMC's discrimination
have perceptibly impaired its programs. As for the individual
testers, they have not stated a cause of action under Sec. 1981,
nor have they established standing to seek the only form of relief
that might be available to them under Title VII.
<P>
We remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
<P>
So ordered.
<P>
FN1. BMC still argues that people who lack a bona fide interest
in employment--such as testers--lack any cause of action under
Sec. 2000e-2(b).
<P>
The plaintiffs, supported by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission as amicus curiae, dispute this reading of the statute.
But because we agree with BMC's alternative argument that the
tester plaintiffs cannot recover damages under Title VII and have
no standing to seek the other relief that they request, we need
not address the issue.
<P>
FN2. The rules become less forgiving as litigation moves along.
When a court confronts a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment,
&quot;[i]t will not do to 'presume' the missing facts&quot;. National
Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. at 889, 110 S.Ct. at 3189. By the
same token, after the district court has held its summary-judgment
hearing, plaintiffs certainly cannot assume that the court will
permit them to supply any requisite averments through supplemental
affidavits. See id. at 894-98, 110 S.Ct. at 3191-94.
<P>
FN3. For the same reason, we reject the district court's theory
that the money that the Council spent on the second test (if not
the money that it spent on the first one) gave it &quot;a constitutionally
cognizable injury&quot; because BMC's alleged discrimination against
the first set of testers &quot;could have been a factor&quot;
in the Council's decision to run the second test. Mem.Op. at 10-11.
BMC's treatment of the first set of testers did not impair any
of the Council's programs in any way, even though the pattern
of discrimination evidenced by such tests may have done so. The
Council simply decided that its limited resources would be better
spent on testing BMC again than on testing a different agency
or on pursuing its other programs.
<P>
FN4. This conclusion, although not our embrace of Mackey, seems
to be in tension with Gersman v. Group Health Association, 931
F.2d 1565 (D.C.Cir.1991), vacated on other grounds, --- U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 960, 117 L.Ed.2d 127 (1992), reinstated, 975 F.2d 886,
900 (D.C.Cir.1992). That case also involved a claim that the defendant
had refused to contract with one person (&quot;A &quot;) because
of a discriminatory animus against someone else (&quot;B &quot;).
But where Clifton Terrace held that A lacked standing to sue under
Sec. 1981 because any such suit would be an attempt to assert
B 's rights under the statute, Gersman took the opposite view.
Reasoning that Sec. 1981 protects the right to make contracts,
we held that B lacked standing because it was A--not B--with whom
the defendant allegedly was refusing to contract. See id. at 1567,
1569. Cf., e.g., Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 802 F.2d 111,
114 (5th Cir.1986) (recognizing cause of action under Sec. 1981
where employer allegedly fired plaintiff because her husband was
not white); Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co., 791 F.2d
888, 890 (11th Cir.1986) (similar, where company allegedly refused
to hire plaintiff because of his wife's race); Fiedler v. Marumsco
Christian School, 631 F.2d 1144, 1149 (4th Cir.1980) (recognizing
cause of action under Sec. 1981 where white students alleged that
private school had expelled them for associating with blacks);
see also Patrick v. Miller, 953 F.2d 1240, 1250 (10th Cir.1992)
(holding that such causes of action under Sec. 1981 are &quot;clearly
established&quot; *1281_ FN5. The one notable exception to this
rule is inspired by First Amendment overbreadth analysis. In Secretary
of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 956-57,
104 S.Ct. 2839, 2846-47, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984), for example, the
Court allowed a professional fundraiser to assert its clients'
First Amendment rights in challenging statutory limits on the
amount that charitable organizations can pay fundraisers. But
the Court specifically noted that &quot;outside the First Amendment
context&quot;, the fundraiser's standing would have been in doubt
because it had not shown that &quot;practical obstacles prevent
[the charities] from asserting rights&quot; on their own behalf.
Id. Even within the First Amendment realm, third-party standing
is by no means automatic. See, e.g., Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S.
312, 320, 111 S.Ct. 2331, 2338, 115 L.Ed.2d 288 (1991).

<h2>Why aren't we attacking the supply of drugs?</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
In August, 1989, the Medellin Cartel, led by Pablo Escobar, assassinated Colombian presidential candidate, Carlos Galan and publicly declared war on the Colombian government In response, Colombian-President Virgilio Barco launched an intense attack on the cocaine cartels.  Shortly after that crackdown began, the US military deployed the most extensive detection, tracking, and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from the Andean countries north.  These events produced a substantial disruption in the cocaine supply to the US from 1989 to 1991, with striking consequences for cocaine and crack addicts.  For example, during the fall of l989, and well into1991,federal law enforcement agencies reported that cocaine trafficking groups were experiencing problems securing cocaine or securing it in a timely manner, even at a higher price.<p>

Reductions in the supply of cocaine to the US market are reflected at the retail level by an increase in street prices, a decline in purity, or both, or by scarcity if the disruption is large and sudden enough.  The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) compiles data on cocaine prices throughout the nation and issues quarterly and annual reports.  The data reveal that in gram amounts (the accepted retail measure), a downward trend in prices and upward trend in purity abruptly reversed in late 1989.<p>

The magnitude of the change in availability is best represented by using a standardized price; that is, a price that reflects both price and purity changes by calculating the cost of a 100 percent-pure gram of cocaine for each year.  Not surprisingly, the reduction in the availability of cocaine coincided with a 27 percent reduction in cocaine emergency room cases between 1989 and 1990.<p>

Medical examiner reports of deaths related to cocaine use during this period also declined. Analysis initiated by the White House drug office and released in the publication "Price and Purity of Cocaine: The Relationship to Emergency Room Visits and Deaths, and to Drug Use Among Arrestees, found declines in cocaine emergency room cases, deaths, and cocaine use among arrestees for the 17 US cities for which data are available. In addition, cocaine prices increased and purity decreased.<p>

Further, the cocaine supply reduction also coincides with a decline in the estimated number of heavy cocaine users (i.e., cocaine and crack addicts) throughout the country.<p>

Even though the data are limited, the forced reduction in cocaine availability between the latter part of 1989 and the first half of 1991 seems beyond question.  That it was a key causal factor in the decline of cocaine use, particularly heavy use, is the most obvious and reasonable conclusion in light of all the evidence.<p>

In addition, we know from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse that immediately prior to and during this period casual or nonaddictive use of cocaine dropped dramatically. While non-addictive users consume a much smaller quantity of cocaine than heavy or addicted users, an almost 80 percent drop in nonaddictive users between 1985 and 1992 certainly reduced demand significantly (though it cannot be measured by existing surveys and analyses). In order to increase cocaine retail prices and reduce purity, supply reduction efforts would have to cut supply beyond the surplus supply resulting from reduced demand by casual users. So the actual supply reduction was probably even greater in magnitude than the sizable change reflected in the price and purity data.<p>

The cost of the entire international drug control effort for programs and assistance to foreign countries rose from $209 million in fiscal year 1988 - to $660 million in 1992 (its peak); it moved from 4.4 percent to 5.6 percent of the federal drug control budget. Interdiction costs increased between 1988 and 1992, but almost that entire increase involved the estimated cost of Department of Defense (DOD) activities in support of the anti-drug effort.  And even with this increase, interdiction costs as a percentage of the federal drug control budget declined between FY 89 and FY92.<p>

If measured strictly by results, prevention efforts -- assisted by Presidents Reagan and Bush but primarily those carried out by parents, teachers, young people and communities throughout the nation -- made unprecedented progress in combating drug use (in particular, casual cocaine use declined dramatically). But contrary to what is viewed as settled fact by many in Washington, interdiction and cocaine source country programs seem to have been the crucial cause of the only reductions in heavy or addictive cocaine use in the past decade. The most intelligent approach to drug policy, then, is to work both the prevention and interdiction fronts; to integrate efforts instead of posing an either/or scenario.<p>

The obvious question to ask is: why didn't the reduction in cocaine supply continue throughout 1991 and beyond? The movement in the summer of 1991 of US. military resources to the Persian Gulf for Desert Shield and, later, Desert Storm, reduced interdiction coverage, particularly in regard to some of the most powerful airborne and surface naval systems.<p>

Those resources were never returned.  Today, all of the source-country governments are reducing efforts against the cocaine trade. And unfortunately there is no visible effort by the Clinton administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign supply control.  This is an unconscionable abdication.  We face the real prospect of foreign nations permitting the unchallenged production and shipment of illegal drugs to the U.S. and throughout the world: which is a prescription for uncontrollable supplies of illegal drugs.  Which in turn is a prescription for even greater social chaos.<p>

<P>Ross Perot may have walked into a trap of his own devising. By deciding
to set up an official political party instead of merely running for President
as an independent candidate, Perot will be subject to all the legal difficulties
that beset the two major parties. It will be harder now for him to play
the reformist outsider. And the state versions of his new party are almost
sure to cause problems. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What will he have gained? Practically nothing. Organizing a new political
party in these times is like starting a typewriter company; you're investing
in a declining market. Political parties historically had four main roles:
control of nominations, financing candidates, filling patronage jobs and
creating a cohesive caucus in the Congress and state legislatures. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All but the last role have been reduced in the past thirty years, thanks
to one &quot;reform&quot; after another. Primary voters, not party regulars,
pick most nominees; candidates' organizations, not parties, raise most campaign
funds; and patronage--after a century of civil service reform--is down to
token numbers, and those few are hired by office-holders without much consultation
with their party. And the last role--forming legislative caucuses--is not
one that will benefit Perot's Independence Party, since it is unlikely to
elect many local candidates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we assume that Perot will be able to get his party legally recognized
in all 50 states, and that is a big assumption, there still are enormous
obstacles to operating the party successfully. Laws governing parties differ
widely from state to state. For example, the latitude for a party to give
financial support to particular candidates is far greater in a state like
Ohio than it is in a state like California. Separate legal teams, and legal
procedures, will be needed for each state. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With 50 new state Independence parties will come a certain amount of &quot;independence&quot;
for those parties internally. The publisher of the daily political Hotline
in Washington, D.C., Douglas Bailey, predicts that &quot;Once Perot creates
all these state parties, there is nothing to stop them from running local
candidates with their own ideas and their own personal baggage. Then Perot
loses control.&quot; New York's Independence Party, which suggested to Perot
that he use its name, already plans to slate up to a thousand candidates.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot also may lose some of his self-styled reformer image. In the past,
he has wanted us to believe that the two major parties get into trouble
so often because their candidates are morally weak and lack his wonderous
&quot;common sense.&quot; Only Perot, standing above the fray, was pure.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In reality, most election scandals are the result of some petty infraction
or wrong assumption about the nation's increasingly dense weave of campaign
laws. Never before, including the Progressive Era, have so many ethics laws
been put on the books. Even with relatively experienced personnel, the Republicans
and Democrats cannot help making the kind of petty bookkeeping and judgment
errors that, taken out of context and exaggerated by a hostile opponent
or the media, can be made to look serious and intentional. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot's United We Stand, America is legally a mere non-profit organization
and, for example, does not have to follow financial disclosure laws. But
Perot's new and official party will be held to the same strict standards
as the Republicans and Democrats. His organization will find the reporting
of contributions alone to be a tricky challenge. Then will come the scrutiny
by the media and political foes. Did anyone contribute more than the permitted
$1000 per person? Was any of the money from a source that someone, somewhere
deems disreputable? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, when something goes wrong, the blame will tend to fall directly
on Perot himself, for his party will still be identified as more of a one-man
show than any since 1968, when the American Independence Party was organized
by and for Alabama Governor George Wallace. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if Perot is the Independence Party presidential candidate, one of
the &quot;reforms&quot; most likely to develop wide public interest in 1996
will be ending the advantage allowed for rich individuals like him to buy
advertising and organizing talent that other parties must obtain through
broad solicitations. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Perot may persuade Colin Powell to run at the head of the new
party, which surely would increase the flow of individual contributions
and expand the party's showing at the polls. What opinion surveys indicate
so far is that the Independence Party would do its best with Powell as its
nominee. But the ticket still would not win. In contrast, the surveys suggest
that Powell as a Republican would win. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This raises another question. Other than Perot's o'ervaulting ambition,
what substantive reason is there for the Independence Party? Is there some
novel insight it brings to a deficient political system--as the new Republican
Party did with its clear anti-slavery message in the 1850s, which helped
it replace the badly divided Whigs? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No. Except for his anti-free trade position, Perot's main themes, including
budget cutting, echo the Republicans. The difference is that they are in
office, and he is not. They take the heat; he carps. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the head of a national party, that stand-offish role will change. Ross
Perot running as an outsider, as in 1992, might make enough of an impression
on the electorate to defeat the Republicans' presidential nominee again,
and help re-elect President Clinton. But as the head of an official political
party? <BR>
<I><BR>
Wal, I don't have to tell you people, that great sucking sound is jest Ross
sinking down to the level of the rest of 'em! <BR>

Dear Senator 

After years of empty rhetoric, I am glad to see true reform 
brewing in Congress.  I look forward to the day when 
Congress reforms itself via the Citizen Congress Act.

If passed, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act 
will help restore my faith in elected officials.  For too 
long, we have been made promises while important measures 
such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment have 
not materialized.

By eliminating perks and wasteful practices from within, 
Congress can begin to reverse the hollow promises of the 
past several years. Abolishment of the federal pension 
system, elimination of franked mass mailings, non-automatic
pay increases, and reduced military aircraft travel are 
significant reforms which also reduce government spending. 
At a time when the country's budget is in poor fiscal 
condition, there is little reason not to tighten the belt 
of Congress.

I was disappointed to see term limits measures fail, yet 
I believe that the Citizen Congress Act is a step in the 
right direction in regards to congressional reform.  I 
understand that Members of Congress work hard and are 
very busy, but I also believe Congress needs to truly 
reidentify with the voters of this country.  I ask that 
you pledge support for this measure, and I look forward
to your reply.

Sincerely,
</textarea>

<PRE>
What will happen over the next several years is that the external 
bandwidth of most computers--that is, the bandwidth of the 
asynchronous transfer mode networks that are being developed by 
some 600 companies and that are being deployed at an increasing 
pace--will be bigger than the internal bandwidth. And that will mean 
that computers will be able to tap remote databases and educational 
possibilities as readily as they tap their internal disk drives and CD-
ROMs. This means that, in a sense, the computer will hollow out, and 
the network will become the computer in a way that has never been 
true before. 


And the effect of this is that the Law of the Microcosm will join the 
Law of the Telecosm. The Law of the Microcosm says that if you take 
any number n transistors and put them on a single sliver of silicon, 
you get n-squared performance and value (thats one of the key 
exponentials that drive this era). The Law of the Telecosm says that 
if you take any number n computers and put them on a network you 
get n-squared performance and value, because each computer uses 
the network as a resource and is also a potential resource for the 
network.
	

And so the value of the network exponentially increases as the 
number of computers connected to it increases. And I think its the 
convergence of these two laws, both of which are central to the 
evolution of the computer industry, that will really shape the future. 
Its not going to be Hollywood executives who are going to be the 
chief drivers of the new age; they in fact will be victims of the new 
age. The chief drivers and the real winners are the computer and 
computer networking industries, as they interconnect Americas 
schools and colleges and homes into a truly new World Wide Web of 
glass and light. That is the real promise of the next era, and its going 
to happen faster than people expect, not more slowly. 


Theres still an optical illusion at the communications cliff at LANs 
end, but that can be quickly overcome by the use of cable 
technology--the coaxial that is already in the ground and connecting 
American homes, and particularly connecting to all the homes with 
computers. Last year there were some 26 million PCs in American 
homes, and 24 million of those homes had cable connections, and 
these cable connections are fully adequate to open the way for this 
transformation of the computer--the hollowing out of the computer, 
the moving of the computer onto the network, and the 
transformation of computer network architecture over the next 
decade.
	

So I think its a sure thing that education will be a much bigger 
market than entertainment. This is almost a certainty. Because 
education fits with computer technology, which is the driving force of 
this industry. But its not just the computer technology thats 
important, its the culture of the computer industry. Its the power of 
the commitment of increasing millions of citizens to this technology 
as a key channel for their creation of wealth and their advancement 
of learning.
	

And so its not just a technological issue, its a cultural issue, and 
the computer as a learning tool is a generator of wealth that will 
absorb an increasing share of our energies and creativity in the 
information age and will continue to expand its domain; whereas 
television will always be a disappointment because its essentially a 
diversion. It doesnt edify, it doesnt add to the national endowment, it 
tends to subtract from it. Its not the idiot box that will lead the U.S. 
into a new information age.


I think that the past years well-publicized efforts at convergence 
were really misconceived. US West and Bell Atlantic and Nynex 
turning to Hollywood talent agent Mike Ovitz is really rather 
pathetic, because when you think about it, if youre Mike Ovitz and 
you make a movie you really want it to go on everybodys conduit, 
whereas if youre Bell Atlantic and you run a network you want 
everybodys movies on that network. In other words, theres no 
benefit anymore from combining content and conduit in an era of 
truly broadband network. The exponential thrust comes from 
combining conduit with conduit, and allowing the people on the 
network to supply their own content to a great extent, in an 
entrepreneurial process thats almost entirely unpredictable.
	

But I think you can tell the general shape of the multimedia 
market that will emerge. It wont resemble Hollywood and it wont 
resemble broadcast television: It will resemble the book industry. 
There are about 80,000 books published every year in the United 
States, and the stores that are gaining share are the stores that offer 
the most choice. The key to the book industry is when a customer 
goes into a book store the customer gets his or her first choice. You 
get the book you want rather than a book thats been scheduled for 
you.
  

I think that same idea also gives us the key to finding the real 
opportunity in education in the information age. Students will get 
their first choice rather than some choice thats defined for them by 
some remote hierarchy. The power is migrating to the customer and 
that will be the driving force of the economy in the next decade, and 
it will be an exciting time.</PRE>

<CENTER><B>Clinton Land Grab Called Shameful By Small Business
Group<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan made the following statement in
response to President Clinton's election-year land grab of southern
Utah:<BR>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton is getting a little too generous
during this election season.  On the campaign trail he has been
promising cradle-to-grave programs while doling out pork in key
electoral battleground states.<BR>
<P>
But his generosity has gone a little too far this
week.  Knowing that Utah will not fall into the Democratic column,
he has conveniently sacrificed the property rights of voters in
the state to placate environmental groups that need a return on
investment for their election-year financial support.<BR>
<P>
By executive fiat, the President has blatantly circumvented
the Congress to create a national monument without regard to the
job impact such a move would have on Utah's residents.  President
Clinton has consulted only with environmentalists on the land-grab,
and has even ignored and usurped his own Interior Department.
<BR>
<P>
It is clear that if President Clinton is bold enough
to make such moves leading up to the November elections, a second
term in office would mean a severe erosion of already-endangered
private property rights.<BR>
<P>
Utah residents, lawmakers and businesses are capable
of environmental stewardship.  They do not need President Clinton
-- or his cash supporters in the environmental movement -- to
tell them how to run their state.&quot;<BR>
<P>
President Clinton used his powers under the Antiquities
Act of 1906 to proclaim that 1.8 million acres of Utah will be
given protected status as a national monument.

The Reality of Drugs Belies a Cartoon-style Answer</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Garry B. Trudeau, creator of the comic-strip Doonesbury, is
one of your star Boomer celebrities, a self-appointed guru of perpetual
'60s cool. It was Trudeau who invented the jaunty Mr. Butts character that
mocks the tobacco companies and the politicians who take their contributions.
Today Mr. Butts figures haunt only Republican rallies, despite the annoying
fact from the National Library on Money and Politics that more than half
of the tobacco support of congressional candidates from 1980 to 1994 went
to Democrats.<BR>
<BR>
Real history, in contrast to cartoon history, has that way of interfering
with a good story. In Mr. Trudeau's case, this crusader against the legal
vice of tobacco recently felt obliged to write an essay in Time magazine
regarding his own past use of illegal narcotics. Were RJR Nabisco sleuths
about to expose him? Regardless, his confession is not the mea culpa of
a Newt Gingrich or even the denial of a Bill &quot;I didn't inhale&quot;
Clinton. Instead, Trudeau manages to say only briefly that he no longer
advocates drugs, while telling us at length how much he once enjoyed them
and even sold them. He implies that he only quit once he became a parent,
not so many years ago. &quot;To summarize,&quot; he writes, &quot;at one
time I possessed, consumed and probably distributed marijuana--activities
for which I may feel embarrassment but not guilt.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
These &quot;memories of TOKING UP are fondly held,&quot; he coos in capitals.
&quot;Finally, I admit that this has not caused me to lose a moment of sleep,
except as it has pertained to my career.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
How&Igrave;s that as a didactic tale for the kids? Tobacco's bad for you,
but dope's a bit of a kick. Cartoonist, draw thyself!<BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration also did not take drugs very seriously for over
three years; indeed, until a political attack appeared on the horizon. Then
the Administration, too, came up with the preposterous attempt to switch
the subject to cigarettes.<BR>
<BR>
In the first three years of the Clinton presidency, Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders proposed looking into legalizing drugs and the Justice Department
recommended reducing mandatory sentences for drug crimes. The President
slashed the staff of his drug office by 80 percent and reduced interdiction
of drugs at the border and eradication efforts overseas. Coast Guard seizures
of cocaine fell 45 percent and marijuana, 90 percent. Supply reduction was
deemed a waste of time and money. <BR>
<BR>
When a report was produced for the Pentagon by the Institute for Defense
Analysis (IDA) suggesting the contrary--that interdiction is a &quot;cost
effective operational strategy for increasing cocaine prices and thereby
reducing cocaine use in the United States&quot;--the Administration held
up dissemination. Only insistence by the Republican dominated House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee brought the report to public awareness last
week. The full contents still have not been released.<BR>
<BR>
It apparently was the Administration's expectation that increased funds
for drug treatment would bring about demand reduction. Indeed, <I>The Man
From Hope</I>  told a group of Miami middle-schoolers last spring that drug
use had gone down &quot;every year for the last three years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the hard facts showed the hope was false. The National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse for 1995 revealed that drug use among teens rocketed upward
105% since 1992. Cocaine use among teens soared 166%. Compared to the past,
the drugs themselves have become cheap, &quot;pure&quot; and dangerous.
This would tend to validate the IDA study. Greater drug supply produces
lower prices and wider availability. Lessened drug education, meanwhile,
lowers the threshold for initial usage. Drug treatment for addicts, a Clinton
priority, is a valuable and humane service, but not much of an answer to
expanded drug supply and usage.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration tried to wriggle off the bad publicity--and escape the
merciless Dole ad showing candidate Clinton in 1992 laughing on MTV that
he wished he had inhaled--by pinning the problem on the Bush years. The
numbers in that period, however, don&Igrave;t show anything more than anti-drug
efforts and drug usage reaching a plateau. So another spin was tried, that
Republicans in Congress are responsible because they have not supported
all the treatment funds the president sought. But again, even if true, that
argument begs the question.<BR>
<BR>
That question is, what works? The best answer, so far, is an all-fronts
struggle of the kind launched in the Reagan years, when drug use was cut
in half.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of who is elected president, let&Igrave;s increase drug interdiction
and drug eradication, overseas as well as at home. From my own service as
U.S. representative to the U.N. narcotics agencies in Vienna in the '80s,
I would argue that we should solicit more international cooperation and
financial support for these tasks. Let&Igrave;s also expand assistance for
crop substitution in countries like Colombia, and thereby promote the domestic
stability that gives politicians the courage to stand up to narco-traffickers.<BR>
<BR>
Let&Igrave;s revise the once useful, but now stale, &quot;Just Say No&quot;
educational campaign among youth. Yes, we also should continue to improve
drug treatment for addicts and we should decriminalize medicinal use. And
let&Igrave;s do more to rebut Hollywood and media figures who glamorize
drugs, or, like Trudeau, laugh them off.<BR>
<BR>
As for politicians (or cartoonists), nobody cares what they did as youths.
What matters is whether they set an example as adults who have taken the
drug issue seriously.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Can a Virtual School Help Improve Learning?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Tom A. Alberg<BR>
Chairman, Discovery Institute</CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="zigzag-3.gif" WIDTH="394" HEIGHT="6" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>
<P>BILL Gates said several years ago that &quot;on a scale of one to ten,
if a mediocre teacher is a three and Socrates was a nine, computers and
software are about a four, with prospects of someday being a six or seven.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It probably is true, indeed, that computers and educational software, by
themselves, will never equate to a great or even a good teacher. But if
today's networked computing is enlisted, the possibilities become more promising.
Networking connects the calculating, storage, retrieval and display power
of electronic machines with people who have ideas, creativity, questions
and emotions. It is a means of asking others for their opinions and of expressing
your own. Its instantaneous reach is around the school or around the world.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The components of high-tech leaming already in use are impressive; from
the increasingly popular and powerful Internet to the expanding corpus of
educational software and CD-ROMS. Distance leaming video broadcasts have
the power to bring the best lecturers to all students. Adding interactive
techniques including wireless and Internet facilities-can create a much
enriched personal experience for students, especially for those living a
long distance from large schools.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we hope to approach the &quot;nine&quot; of Socrates, however, we need
to combine and organize such resources into a coherent program of leaming.
We need to find out how emerging technological possibilities comport with
human nature in practice. We must find out how the new technology works
and how it can be made to work better if we are to know how to encourage
its appropriate development and dissemination. It took generations to create
the traditional classroom; the high technology leaming center of the future
can and should be created in one: ours.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One way to concentrate progress in high-technology leaming, while avoiding
disappointments and waste along the way, would be to organize a demonstration
project that tested out new hardware, Internet services and software for
varying kinds of learners. Call it a virtual school. In addition to combining
different high-tech leaming techniques (both Internet and software, for
example), it would pull together the lessons of existing experiments that
operate solely with one kind of technology or in one kind of leaming environment.
Today these experiences are scattered in n-tany homes, public and private
schools, universities and high tech firms.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The virtual school project is not a job for govemment acting alone, nor
for any one school, foundation or corporation. It should, however, collaborate
with all levels and kinds of existing educational systems and educators-from
state officials to home schoolers, from software manufacturers to telecommunications
companies, from computer scientists to educational television stations,
and with much attention to the actual students and their parents.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A virtual school is not one without human teachers. We may talk about the
virtues of self-leaming, but even the greatest scholars usually operate
within a community, and almost all fledgling students must have a structure
and human guidance. But the nature of the teacher/pupfl relationship may
well change as high technology is introduced.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the experiments in the virtual school, therefore, would seek to discover
what kind of teacher/student interaction works best in a high-tech leaming
environment. We mostly abandoned rote leaming years ago and yet we have
found that total reliance upon student spontaneity does not yield measurable
progress in knowledge and skflls-which is one of the major concerns of school
refon-ners. With new hardware and software technologies, it should be possible
to develop both new kinds of group interaction and self-directed learning.
Accordingly, the job of the teacher is sure to be different, and it will
take experience to discover how to teach in the high tech environment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, what it means to be a student will change. For certain, it will
not be appropriate to give each pupil a computer with CD-ROMs filled with
great literature and hope that he or she will stumble across Nfilton or
The Federalist Papers. Nor should we consider it sufficient to give students
a connection to the Internet, which is a wonderful tool, but often referred
to as &quot;chaotic.&quot; They will need some kind of guide-and some reliable
accountability for results. It may be that the teaching model will be closer
to the tutor of yore than to today's classroom instructor. The &quot;tutor&quot;
guides his or her pupil, suggests certain inquiries and requires a demonstration
of increased knowledge and skill. Sometimes the tutor meets with the pupils
as a group, sometimes singly-sometimes over the Internet and sometimes in
person.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The virtual school, then, would be an association of educational tutors
(teachers) and participants of all ages (students), organized and equipped
to make maximum use of existing and new educational software and the Internet.
The tutors would work together to devise curricula, combining desktop software,
specific knowledge based resources on the Internet (such as the Harvard
files on Greek architecture for a fine arts or history course .... ), Internet
communication opportunities (pen pals in Italy for a course on Italian;
topical bulletin boards on whales .... ), interactive video &quot;classes&quot;
and personal meetings and field trips with students.<BR>
Assignments-and tests-in the virtual school would take place largely on
the Internet. Scoring of exams would be faster and easier than now, and
the whole idea of &quot;exams&quot; might change as learning patterns change.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Anyone could &quot;audit&quot; the experimental virtual school, but the
tutorials would require preliminary application and approval. Whether he
or she was a home schooler or someone attending a standard public or private
school, a student would sign up with the virtual school for an actual course
and be assigned a tutor. C)n the other hand, a tutor with his or her own
group of students could also enter.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Imagine, for example, how a Garfield High School student who wanted to study
Italian@r some other language not now available in the Pubfic school system-might
sign up for a beginning course with the virtual school. The curriculum for
Italian would carry the student as far as he or she desired, with measurable
milepost results satisfactory not only to the student but to his or her
parents and Garfield advisor. The curriculum would be flexible enough, moreover,
that a hundred students taking Italian through the virtual school could
each learn in his own way and in varying real times, with wide choices of
content to permit instructional custon-dzing. The students also would be
part of an on-line, interactive, real time class. All would have some opportunity
for face-to-face interaction, as desirable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The tutors would be drawn from existing teachers at schools, supplemented
by other people in the community. For example, the Garfield High School
student who wanted to study Italian, n-dght have a knowledgeable language
teacher at Garfield as the tutor or someone else in the community who was
qualified to monitor his progress. Math and science teachers might be supplemented
by Boeing engineers serving as tutors on the Internet. Lawyers might tutor
constitutional law or environment and public policy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While the virtual school would not bear any resemblance to the large physical
structures Of today, it would probably actually exist in physical space
as well as cyberspace and etherspace. There would be meeting rooms at an
otherwise modest virtual school office where you occasionally could meet
your tutor and probably other participants, as well. Rooms would be flexible
in size and also would include the latest high quality video broadcasting
and teleconferencing screens, as well as virtual reality facilities.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most students would use the virtual school as an adjunct to their regular
institutional or home school program. The dynamic of the school would be
such, however, that it would be constantly iinproving itself and expanding,
as the participants learned what worked and what didn't.<BR>
Nationwide, schools are investing literally hundreds of millions of dollars
in high technology products, often for school office improvements, but increasingly
for student learning. The future is likely to see such investments expand
exponentially. But planning for this development currently is sparse (Washington
State is further along than most), and discouraging waste, therefore, is
inevitable unless better information is available on what works and what
does not. Teachers will need to be trained when they are still attending
schools of educationonly a small fraction are computer literate nowand existing
teachers need to be retrained. But trained to do what? A comprehensive virtual
school experiment that is not beholden to any interest can help shorten
the learning curve in the high-tech educational future.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we want to pioneer in creating a virtual school in the Puget Sound area,
we must build a constituency that believes, first, that the use and deployment
of computer software, hardware and networks can measurably improve the learning
process, and, second, that the new system should be able to justify itself
in terms of measurable results for students and for the educational system
as a whole. Technology should not become just another expensive addition
to the present system. It should help transform education, facilitating
the real reforms in productivity and cost-effectiveness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But it can't happen without some experimentation, some trial and error me
use of high technology, in other words, to learn more about high tech learning.<BR>

Summary</I> </H4>
America needs passenger rail service as an economical and ecological alternative
to endless road and airport construction. Unfortunately, Amtrak cannot (and
probably should not) survive as it is presently structured and funded. Perpetuating
the status quo will burden America with a lame, government-run passenger
operation, limping along on the nation's freight rail rights-of-way, operating
under outdated federal rules from its 1970 authorization, and surviving
on Congressional handouts. <BR>
<BR>
But, the solution is not to throw Amtrak on the market, accepting whatever
happens. What would happen is, Amtrak would die. The proper course is to
reorganize the system, privatizing whatever can be privatized, building
new public-private alliances and compacts around the set of rail corridors
that link cities 100-500 miles apart-which is the functional core of the
national system-and then reconnecting this reorganized nation system to
other forms of transportation to create a true intermodal passenger network.
<BR>
<BR>
But before dealing with Amtrak, we need to understand its true circumstances.
Since its birth in 1971, Amtrak has been a neglected stepchild. The government
had no interest in its success. Neither did the freight railroads, over
whose tracks it ran. Labor made certain Congress burdened it with uneconomical
work rules; politicians picked the routes; bureaucrats ran the place like,
well, a bureaucracy. In retrospect, the wonder is that Amtrak succeeded
as well as it did. <BR>
<BR>
Amtrak's 1994 fiscal crisis coincided with the rise of budget cutting as
a national political priority. Following the election of the new Republican
Congress in November 1994, Amtrak's new president, Tom Downs, tried to adjust
to this priority, cutting 22% of its train miles and 1500 employees and
developing new, flexible strategic business units. Unable by themselves
to save the system, these measures did help reduce the financial crisis,
while improved marketing and a few new routes actually led to a small increase
in ridership. The cuts also alerted ordinary people to the value of passenger
train service. As a consequence, a number of states have offered subsidies
or have committed revenues to help save local service. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Presently, the unwillingness of many Congressmen to buck the opposition
to reform from the rail labor unions, the trial lawyers and commuter rail
states led Rep. Bud Shuster, Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure to declare, &quot;Amtrak is dead.&quot; His pronouncement
may prove to be prophetic, but it is premature. Amtrak's continuing financial
crisis still can be turned into an opportunity if the public's interest
is sustained and if a government reform process can be formalized. Toward
that end, Discovery Institute proposes the following measures: &#183; 
<UL>
  <LI>Approve three years of interim Amtrak operating support, tied to a
firm schedule for transition to a new system. &#183; 
  <LI>Pass a comprehensive Amtrak Privatization and Revitalization Act that
gives management power to eliminate all costs that do not improve service.
This will lift prohibitions against contracting out services, repeal excessive
labor provisions and resolve the legal liability questions between freight
and passenger rail.. &#183; 
  <LI>Establish a public-private commission to develop a new national system.
This Rail Alliance for Passenger Services (RAPS) will analyze proposals
for privatizing various corridors. These proposals should come from compacts
among local and state governments, private entrepreneurs, and the freight
railroads over whose tracks the passenger trains run. 
</UL>
<BR>
It is vital that the freights become stakeholders in passenger service.
RAPS will seek ways to upgrade passenger service, infrastructure, technology
and safety. And, RAPS will study development of a truly intermodal passenger
system, closely linking rail to bus service, airports, ferries and other
modes of transportation, with coordinated ticketing. At the end of this
period RAPS will recommend which corridors become part of the new National
Passenger Rail System, and will preside over the transition. <BR>
<BR>
The new National Passenger Rail System will be composed of corridors in
every region of the country, with a national organization setting safety
and service standards. To help justify the cost of long distance trains
that make the national system truly national and which assure service to
rural areas where air service is often lacking, passenger trains should
be allowed to carry mail and packages once more. Further, as in the National
Highway System, there should be a Federal commitment to provide infrastructure
capital-possibly through states and interstate compacts. After all, the
government provides the roads and airports over which the trucking and air
transport industries operate. Indeed, given the congestion in many parts
of the country and the ecological harm inherent in road and airport expansion,
passenger rail may turn out to be one of the bigger transportation bargains
in the federal budget. Why are we in this situation? 
<H4><I>A Little History </I></H4>
<BR>
The United States has not always neglected its railroads. Far from it. In
the 19th century, railroads were closely allied with the government. Land
grants, state loan programs, and other subsidies facilitated rapid expansion.
By the 1890s, indeed, the so-called Rail Barons had achieved incredible
influence and wealth, and some railroads employed more people and took in
more money that the government itself. But power and arrogance triggered
trust-busting and aggressive regulation. The railroads found themselves
fighting against an intermittently irate government, while the press and
populist politicians inflamed voters. <BR>
<BR>
Once the railroads' servile ally, government eventually became their effective
enemy in an era of social experimentation, imposing stifling regulation
and unnecessarily costly labor rules. All rates, routes and service were
under the rigid control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Shippers
became a privileged class in commerce. Railroad workers received a special
Federal retirement program, a Federal unemployment program, and a Federal
tort-based workers compensation program. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, railroads often headquartered in far-away cities saw their rights-of-way
become targets for ever-increasing taxation revenues by state and local
governments. <BR>
<BR>
But even as government presided over the slow strangulation of the railroads,
it began starry-eyed love affairs with the automobile and the airplane.
Upon creation of the Highway Trust Fund and under the general guidance of
the Bureau of Roads in Washington, DC, a great bureaucratic auto constituency
was built in the states. The motor industry and its allies saw the government
as a potential partner, and one of the most powerful lobbies in history
was created. General Motors, the trucking industry, asphalt producers, road
contractors, dealerships, and the American Automobile Association (AAA)
became the &quot;Road Gang&quot; that worked effectively through the Association
of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and the Congress. A similar combination
of &quot;Airmen&quot; pressed for airports in every community and for a
fail-safe air traffic control system. <BR>
<BR>
A bi-partisan political team transformed America. Many of the results benefited
the average citizen and community, but rail transportation was left out
of the new dispensation. Private railroad operators found that cars, buses,
trucks and airplanes operating over government-funded superhighways and
aviation infrastructure became virtually unbeatable. The economic and social
effects were tremendous as cities emptied and people and industry moved
to the suburbs. Freight and passengers were increasingly diverted from the
rail beds to the interstate freeways and the airports. <BR>
<BR>
By 1980, the competition seemed to be over. Much of the railroad industry
was insolvent. Salvaging passenger rail was beyond the capabilities of private
companies. Led by the once mighty Penn Central, Northeast railroads tumbled
into receivership one after the other, followed in the Midwest by the Rock
Island and the Milwaukee Road. At the low point, 25% of America's railroads
were bankrupt, with the Chicago North Western, Illinois Central and Southern
Pacific nearly so. Rail market share continued to fall; debt was staggering,
the physical system was breaking down. A national system failure was probable.
Liquidation or nationalization were serious alternatives. <BR>
<BR>
From the beginning, saving the freight lines received top priority. Passenger
service was an afterthought. The first step toward recovery came in 1971
when Congress created Amtrak as a relief measure for freight railroads.
In 1973, Congress authorized a Northeast rail restructuring process and
a rebuilding of the freight infrastructure that produced Conrail. Congress
then authorized some repayable loans directed primarily at rebuilding midwest
freight lines. The Staggers Act of 1980 eliminated decades of over-regulation
and freed the freights to compete. Profitability soon followed. Unfortunately,
over in the new public sector, service did not fare as well. <BR>
<BR>
It need not have been this way. Although passenger service had been deteriorating
for a half century, experiments in the depths of the Great Depression had
demonstrated that revival was possible. In 1930, Ralph Budd, president of
the Burlington Railroad and his ally, railcar maker Edward Budd (no relation),
committed massive capital to high-speed, light-weight, state-of-the-art
rail technology. In a few years, modern diesel engines were pulling art-deco,
air-conditioned cars at over 100 miles per hour. Consumer response was enthusiastic
and profitable. American passenger trains, such as the California Zephyr
and the Santa Fe Chief, were the best in the world. During World War II,
passenger and freight railroading boomed. <BR>
<BR>
At war's end, the country had a great opportunity to create a balanced transportation
system that included rail. But the government chose to subsidize rail's
air and automobile competitors. Perhaps no one fully understood the long-term
implications for America. Western Europe and Japan, on the other hand, committed
to balanced systems and today enjoy high speed and, in some cases, profit-making
passenger rail operations. <BR>
<BR>
In 1971, the U.S. government finally committed to maintaining passenger
rail. In an exceedingly thoughtless law, no attention was given to restoring
American rail passenger service to a world standard. While Europe and Japan
invested billions in passenger rail to create true modal balance, Congress
directed Amtrak to become a self-sufficient, independent passenger operation.
Government funding was always minimal and no long-term capital commitment
was planned. The results of this policy are now apparent. <BR>
<BR>
The Amtrak Act created several counter-productive conditions. A government-owned
(and ill-financed) passenger system now operated over privately-owned tracks
and infrastructure-the exact opposite of the air and automobile and trucking
systems, where privately owned vehicles utilize government-provided facilities.
Further, the freights had no self-interest in seeing Amtrak succeed, since
the government paid them less-than-market rents for the use of their facilities.
Amtrak trains interfered with the freights' own operations and created unwelcome
insurance and liability problems. They agreed to the arrangement only as
a way of getting passenger service off their backs. Since the establishment
of Conrail, the freights have concentrated on their own core businesses.
<BR>
<BR>
Amtrak never really had a chance. The government didn't care and the private
entrepreneurs were out of the game. And, from the beginning, the Amtrak
Board was dominated by the Department of Transportation. Increasingly, Amtrak
behaved like a government bureaucracy. Middle management, with no incentives
and salaries capped by Congress, became rigid. There was continuous rancor
between management and the 16 rail labor unions, making highest quality
service impossible. The Washington, D.C.-based bureaucracy was nearly blind
to potential state and local community efforts for rail improvement. Further,
Amtrak inherited an ancient fleet and received little capital for modernization.
<BR>
<BR>
Both the Reagan and Bush administrations thought that Amtrak should be zero-funded.
In fact, Amtrak survived largely because senators and congressmen protected
trains running through their districts, enabling Amtrak President Graham
Claytor to maintain limited subsidies. Unfortunately, this meant that Congress
effectively controlled the national route system, which it froze in place
regardless of growing route losses. Congress became a de facto Board of
Directors, albeit a Board that paid attention to Amtrak's business only
sporadically. Statutory labor protection continued to guarantee Amtrak employees
up to six years' salary if they were moved more than thirty miles because
of a route change. Contracting car maintenance or any element of the passenger
operation to lower cost providers was forbidden by Federal law and union
contract. <BR>
<BR>
Under the circumstances, it is remarkable that, for many years under Claytor,
Amtrak arrived as well as it did. A good system was built in the Northeast
Corridor, and new rail cars were acquired. For a period, ridership improved,
creating an illusion that all was well. But decline could not be staved
off forever. By 1994, with a recession and fare wars in the airline industry,
ridership fell, while costs and capital needs increased. By fall, Amtrak
was confronting a cash crisis. In November, Americans went to the polls
and elected the first Republican Congress in 40 years. &quot;Deficit reduction&quot;
became the political battle cry. For Amtrak, the crisis had ripened at the
worst possible moment. <BR>
<BR>
American political debate in the aftermath of the 1994 elections set the
tone of a pseudo-debate. Aggressive freshman and senior budget-cutting Republicans
suggested that Amtrak has no modern function in an age of planes and automobiles.
They proposed &quot;Zeroing Amtrak&quot; in the Budget. Amtrak did make
cuts. But, then, from around the Nation, complaints of those affected quickly
found their way to mayors, governors and Capitol Hill. <BR>
<BR>
The crisis, however, created new interest in Amtrak. Several states, especially
Wisconsin and Vermont, offered subsidies to preserve threatened services.
Amtrak, Washington State, Oregon and British Columbia began incremental
development of high speed rail service along the Cascadia Corridor from
Eugene and Portland, through Seattle to Vancouver, BC. Initial ridership
has been higher than expected and a recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted
the new service and its special emphasis on regional cuisine. North Carolina
inaugurated its new Piedmont Service. Florida and California have committed
revenue streams to high-speed rail development. Amtrak, New York State and
the Federal Railroad Administration developed an experimental 125 mph turbine
train retrofit which is now in service between Albany and NYC; the state
is studying the re manufacture of additional trains to establish a fleet
capable of regular 125 mph service. At the suggestion of Senator Trent Lott,
Amtrak conducted a series of outreach meetings throughout the country. These
meetings produced broad recommendations and also demonstrated popular and
local government support for passenger rail. Passengers have increased four
percent so far in 1995. Maybe, then, passenger rail has a future. 
<H4><I>The Role of Congress </I></H4>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration has called for a continued Amtrak and has pushed
for labor provisions to be negotiated through collective bargaining. But
the Administrationcannot or will not advocate immediate cost savings that
cross the rail labor unions. Key Republican Representatives and Senators,
however, have made a clear that substantial savings must come from such
reforms. Further, they insist, Amtrak must have total flexibility to contract
operational functions to low cost, sometimes non-union, providers. To the
Republican leadership, these changes are a pre-condition for continuing
subsidies, even for an interim period. <BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of the 104th Congress, veteran Pennsylvania Congressman
Bud Shuster was named chairman of the newly organized Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure (T&amp;I), and that committee and its Rail Subcommittee,
chaired by Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island, New York, were
given authority of Amtrak. In the Senate, jurisdiction stayed with the Senate
Commerce Committee where Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota is Chairman.
The Subcommittee Chairman is Trent Lott of Mississippi. Lott also serves
as Majority Whip of the Senate, putting him in a powerful position within
the Leadership. All four key chairmen have expressed support for saving
Amtrak-if it can be reformed. <BR>
<BR>
Hearings began in Congress in the Spring. The popular outcry resulting from
service cutbacks brought new focus. The Committees took a hard look at the
real problems of Amtrak, and of passenger rail in general. First came the
battle of the budget. It was a solid win for proponents of a national rail
passenger service-at least in the short term. During a transition period
through fiscal year 1998, the combined capital, operating and other payments
can total $712 million a year under the Republican-passed budget. <BR>
<BR>
However, Representatives Shuster and Molinari also promised the budget hawks
on the House Budget and Appropriations Committees that they would wring
maximum savings out of the existing system in exchange for these relatively
generous appropriations. Whereas current law prohibits any contracting by
Amtrak, other than for food service, the Shuster/Molinari bill (the Amtrak
Reform and Privatization Act, H.R. 1788) would repeal all anti-contract
law and permit subcontracting of all rail operating functions. H.R. 1788
reduces labor protection payments from 6 years to 6 months for an employee
whose job is eliminated. In addition, the bill places stringent limits on
liability exposure for freight and passenger carriers in intercity (including
high speed) and raises the rent for commuter passenger rail in the Northeast
Corridor. <BR>
<BR>
In the face of these proposed House reforms, rail labor mounted an intensive
lobbying campaign to overturn the contracting and labor protection amendments
which are the heart of the bill. Trial lawyers mounted an effort to remove
the liability limitations, while commuter rail states fought the move to
increase rental rates. When, June 14, the full T&I Committee markup on the
Shuster/Molinari bill was held, opponents caught the bill's backers off-guard,
prevailing on two vital reform votes. Chairman Shuster adjourned the Committee
mark-up without &quot;reporting out&quot; the bill to the House of Representatives.
It was the next day that he announced in the press, &quot;Amtrak is dead.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Action moved to the Senate. On June 16, the Senate Commerce Committee held
a substantive hearing on Amtrak. Interest for the next few months has shifted
to this Committee, where it will remain unless the House deadlock can be
broken. <BR>
<BR>
Prospects are certainly unclear. Amtrak has a large enough base in Congress
that is likely to receive some level of financial support for the coming
year-if it is tied to significant reforms. But the base is now more fragile
than in some time. And it is not realistic, in any event, to expect federal
subsidies adequate to restore or improve service over the longer term. But,
the need for inter-city and regional rail is still conspicuous. This means
that now is the time to establish a long-term comprehensive strategy for
our national rail passenger system. 
<H3><CENTER>Making Rail Passenger Service a Success<BR>
The Discovery Proposal </CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio361661" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
1: </I>Cut All Administrative Costs Permitted by Law </H4>
Amtrak must take all necessary steps within existing law to cut costs. Under
Tom Downs' leadership, remarkable progress has been made in a short time.
Business-oriented operating units have been established. Service on major
routes has been reduced while reinvigorated marketing has prevented a matching
decline in ridership. In fact, passenger revenues are 4% ahead of last year.
If passenger rail service is to be saved, more can be done within the existing
Amtrak framework. 
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio361901" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
2:</I> Cut All Extra Costs Imposed by Law </H4>
The contracting and labor reforms, as well as liability provisions of Shuster/Molinari,
must be adopted to give the system any real chance of survival. Second,
Railroad Retirement, the worker liability statute known as FELA, and all
of the other costly and non-productive Federal mandates that are unique
to railroads (described earlier) should be ended, or at least sharply reduced.
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio363876" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
3:</I> Maximize Resources </H4>
There are several laws which allow funding for elements of intercity passenger
service. The Swift High Speed Rail Act authorizes grants for development
of high speed rail technologies and corridor planning. The massive Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) allows limited funds for technology
development (section 1036) and grade crossing protection in emerging rail
passenger corridors (section 1010). All of these provisions should be integrated
into a comprehensive intercity rail program. This is a good job for the
Federal Railroad Administration. 
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio364695" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
4:</I> Design a National System Plan</H4>
<BR>
A blue ribbon federal commission should be charged with development of an
overall passenger system analysis, leading to a new national system plan.
The commission, which, for convenience, we shall call the Rail Alliance
for Passenger Service (RAPS), also should be responsible for overseeing
implementation of the plan. While Amtrak should be represented on RAPS,
membership should be heavily represented by the rights-of-way owners, states
and communities, the general business and labor communities and consumers.
<BR>
<BR>
Some believe that Amtrak itself could take on the functions of RAPS, obviating
the need for a new entity. However, Amtrak never has had a planning capability
and, as a bureaucratic organization with rail operating responsibility,
has a corporate culture and an altogther understandable urge for self-preservation,
that might complicate its performance of the role envisioned for RAPS. <BR>
<BR>
RAPS should be charged with market-driven development of a National Rail
Passenger System that provides incentives for Amtrak and other operators
to make money. Once the new national system is in place, the Amtrak monopoly
for providing intercity passenger service will pass to RAPS. Operations
over the new national system then will be re-distributed to Amtrak or other
qualified passenger rail operators. <BR>
<BR>
<B>RAPS will: </B>&#183; 
<UL>
  <LI>Analyze corridors as candidates for inclusion in the National Rail
System. It will contract with a major accounting firm to review Amtrak's
financial and operating records and make findings as to the fully distributed
cost of each Amtrak route. That firm also will make findings about the most
likely shortfalls between revenue and cost on each route. &#183; 
  <LI>Make a special study of the unique Northeast Corridor (NEC) between
Washington and Boston to determine its role in the National System. The
NEC has taken a large share of Amtrak's federally provided capital and is
presently faces an estimated five billion dollars of needed repairs. Amtrak
owns the tracks (which are also used by many commuter trains) and must maintain
the NEC to an exact standard to achieve high speeds. Yet the NEC is a popular
service and the only rail corridor where Amtrak is competitive with airlines.
RAPS would investigate transferring ownership to an interstate compact.
Privatization options, as well as Congress might well designate the Corridor
as a highly controlled &quot;interstate highway,&quot; making it eligible
for trust fund spending, with private users paying a fee to operate high
speed rail service over its lines. &#183; 
  <LI>Analyze the cost and feasibility of upgrading designated routes throughout
the national corridor system to 125 mph. Swift Act planning funds and ISTEA
section 1010 funds will be used to hire engineering firm consultants for
this purpose. Freight/passenger interface problems will be addressed as
will estimates of infrastructure improvement costs. RAPS, further, will
analyze potential funding sources and cost-benefits. &#183; 
  <LI>Over an 18 month period, solicit proposals from multi-party compacts
for corridor route operations and intermodal connections. These pacts should
be composed of: an entrepreneur who proposes to operate the trains, the
host railroads (who may choose to operate the trains themselves), the states
and communities served, and possibly other private stakeholders. Transition
employee interests must be considered. Proposals should include both a realistic
operating budget and financial plan, identify specific funding sources and
ways of overcoming financial shortfalls. Although it is probable that some
long-term federal financial support for infrastructure will be necessary,
each plan should be based on realistic assumptions-not on the hope of a
bottomless well of federal money. 
  <LI>See to it that issues involving host freight railroads are resolved
in compact negotiations. These issues include: grade crossing protection;
liability; operational interface; rent for use of track; and financing capital
improvements (such as higher rail speeds) for passenger operations. Through
the RAPS corridor, the freight owners in each will have a long-term role
in the governance of the National Rail Passenger System. &#183; 
  <LI>Recommend the specific routes that will become elements of the National
Passenger Rail System and approve the operating plan. This concept assumes
that there will be competition for the right to operate these routes. Different
contractors, freight carriers, and/or state/local authorities may operate
trains on different routes, so long as they meet RAPS' standards,which must
be approved by the Federal Railroad Administration and the track owners
for safety and operating compatibility. &#183; 
  <LI>Permit Amtrak itself and its employees, if they so decide, to privatize
and compete as a member of compact coalitions. In the interim, a residual
&quot;public Amtrak&quot; will need to operate during five-year analysis-and-transition
period. This public Amtrak will continue to operate the existing basic system
but with complete flexibility to achieve cost savings provided in the Shuster/Molinari
legislation. &#183; 
  <LI>Address in this planning process the distribution and ownership of
Amtrak passenger equipment. &#183; 
  <LI>Establish a plan for a national intermodal surface passenger system.
This will include a national system of reservations and ticketing, with
links to bus and even air. Intermodal bus/rail stations will be encouraged.
RAPS will set standards and principles of service, including equipment design
and compatibility for the National Rail Passenger System. &#183; 
  <LI>Provide a permanent residual national authority for oversight and
coordination with the National Passenger System. The RAPS Board will provide
for arbitration of disputes and administration of whatever federal funding
is ultimately authorized. It also will serve as residual holder of the right
to provide passenger service as a part of the National Rail Passenger System.
The RAPS Board will ultimately be privatized. 
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
Funding for the plan Funding for the implementation of the National Rail
Passenger System envisioned in this proposal will be provided in three parts.
<BR>
<BR>
First, Amtrak will be given a general fund operating subsidy for the &quot;interim&quot;
planning period of three to five years. (The 1996 Congressional Budget allows
adequate funding for 3 years.) <BR>
<BR>
Second, the states will be given flexibility to commit discretionary ISTEA
trust funding to &quot;National Rail Plan&quot; rail projects. Currently,
states may not use highway trust fund money for rail. However, in considering
a highway bill recently, the Senate passed an amendment offered by Sen.
Anthony Roth (R.-Delaware) and Sen. Joseph Biden (D.-Delaware) to provide
some highway trust fund flexibility for Amtrak projects. The vote was a
persuasive 64 to 36. Coincidentally, a recent national poll indicated that
63% of the public support the concept of committing gas tax revenues to
Amtrak projects. Nevertheless, Roth-Biden has fierce opposition from the
highway lobby and will face great difficulties in the House of Representatives.
The opponents, unfortunately, include Transportation and Infrastructure
Chairman Bud Shuster. However, if Roth-Biden becomes law, chances for a
passenger rail revival will become greatly improved. At the very least,
it will quickly become clear how much priority the states are willing to
give passenger rail when confronted with a real choice. Besides, in many
corridors, federal capital improvements mean highway/rail grade separation
and improve port access, which benefit community safety, trucking and sea/air
traffic. <BR>
<BR>
The National Rail Plan adopted by RAPS for transmission to Congress will
include a statement as to whether any additional Federal funding is necessary
on a temporary or permanent basis. <BR>
<BR>
Needless to say, the more detailed the plans developed by RAPS, and the
more solid the state and local commitments, the easier it will be for Congress
to respond with long-term capital funding. Government has traditionally
provided infrastructure investment capital when public benefits are substantial.
For example, on congested or higher speed routes that are shared with freight
trains, double tracking, passing tracks, and state-of-the-art signal and
separation systems (as well as fencing), may prove necessary. Once a rational
planning process has been completed, the Congress will have a solid foundation
on which to allocate national transportation dollars to competing intermodal
priorities. 
<H4><I>Creating a National System </I></H4>
<BR>
A large issue will be how to deal with the long distance overnight trains
that make up much of the current national system. Nostalgia and romantic
names out of the past have political appeal. The question is whether they
make economic sense. Should the Sunset Limited ride into the sunset? Or
can such new (and old) ideas as combined passenger and mail service help
make the longer runs viable? Perhaps states and communities at location
stops along the route could maintain stations and underwrite part of the
cost of service. The answers must come out in the factual analysis and should
not prejudiced at the beginning of the process. <BR>
<BR>
Under this Discovery Institute proposal, the National Passenger Rail System
will be based on the building blocks of corridors in every region of the
country. Only after the corridor compacts have been submitted, analyzed,
and implemented-and costs are known-will it become clear whether national
connectivity should be a system goal. No doubt, the entrepreneurial imagination
of rail and bus operators will see opportunities where bureaucratic thinking
has seen only problems. 
<H4><I>Conclusion</I> </H4>
It is possible and desirable for this country to have a world-class passenger
rail system once again. But what priority will Congress and the people give
to saving and exploiting this asset? There must be a serious debate in Congress-a
debate informed, not just by political pressures from constituents and economic
interests, but by proof of cost-effective readiness to enter new partnerships
and try new arrangements. <BR>
<BR>
Today's new federalist philosophy seeks to return decision-making power
to the people. It seeks to give resourceful, customer-oriented capitalism
a chance. Saving passenger rail falls into this overall challenge. Privatization
is not a magic answer, but it can be a key part of a successful long-term
solution. <BR>

TOGETHER AGAIN</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>January 1996 </CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<H3>My friends, it would behoove you to study everything you can get your
hands on by <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, a true American genius.
Here is the second interview he was kind enough to grant me for my newsletter.
Learn it, love it, live it. -- Rush Limbaugh<BR>
<BR>
<HR></H3>
	RUSH: You are very gracious, sir, to consent to undergoing another grilling.
What I primarily want to talk to you about is your December 18th op-ed in
The Wall Street Journal. You made the case that American progress and innovation
have depended heavily on genius. But the thing that puts you at odds with
much of populist thought in America today is that you say this genius would
not flourish in this country without immigration. For people who didn't
read the piece, could you basically recap your theory?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: All of America's great achievements have come from immigration.
We initially were a nation of immigrants, of course. That was the initial
genius of America -- that we received people fleeing persecution and oppression
in Europe and elsewhere, who found a land of opportunities, new frontiers,
in the United States.<BR>
	This has been true throughout our history. New waves of immigrants have
resulted in new upsurges of income, productivity, innovation and achievement.
The spearheads of this achievement have always been this &quot;genius class,&quot;
as I roughly describe it. I do believe that genius is 90% perspiration.
But it does have a genetic content as well. This is a class of people who
are just enormously more productive than others, and they tend to go where
they're welcomed, and stay where they're well-treated.<BR>
	America has been their land of opportunity for most of the past century.
Receiving these immigrants during the Second World War made possible the
Manhattan Project, which produced the atomic bomb, which ended the war successfully
and then allowed us to continue in the lead in the arms race. This was critical,
because it was almost entirely immigrants who created the atomic bomb, the
hydrogen bomb, the intercontinental-missile program, the space program.
All were heavily fueled by immigration and the geniuses who emigrated to
our shores.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Is it safe to say that the development of all these projects would
not have occurred at all, were it not for immigration?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. I don't think we could have had the Manhattan Project. The
Manhattan Project was an achievement of European immigrants, a lot of them
Jewish, who brought their genius to the United States and put together the
bomb. There were some Americans, but mostly in relatively lesser roles.
<BR>
	Then, later, all our technologies fed on this input from outsiders -- particularly
the microchip, which is really the heart of the present, American global
leadership. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: George, longer than anyone I can recall (aside from those in the
business directly), you have been touting the relevance and importance of
the computer to America's future. In your piece in the Journal you cite
some of the key inventors of the microchip, developers of that technology,
as also being immigrants.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: The company that really founded the microchip industry in the United
States, as the microprocessor industry evolved into the personal-computer
industry, was Fairchild Semiconductor. When the parent company tried to
control it too closely, the key people spun off and became Intel Corporation.
The group at Fairchild and Intel were led by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce,
both of whom were American geniuses and inventors. But most of the other
people at Intel, or at least half of the other major contributors, were
immigrants. Andrew Grove fled through a field across the Hungarian border
in 1956, barely escaping the Russian tanks. <BR>
	RUSH: Grove runs Intel now.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. Earlier on in his career, he ran a couple of crucial projects
at Intel that made them dominant in MOS technology, Metal Oxide Semiconductor
technology, which is really the foundation of the whole industry. In every
major semiconductor company, and every major semiconductor project, between
a third and two-thirds of key contributors are immigrants. Americans have
just not focused on these hard-core engineering skills.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But is that a lack of genius indigenous to America?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think it's the result of a variety of things. In software, which
entails similar degrees of genius, the numbers are not so high: Probably
10 to 15% of the major contributors to America's software predominance an
immigrants. But they are critical contributors. It's not this overwhelming
phenomenon that one discovers in microchips. But both of them were absolutely
critical to the personal-computer industry, which, in turn, is the driving
force of American economic growth and the spearhead of world economic growth
today.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: A lot of readers -- many of them who might not even have computers
-- are going to argue: &quot;How can you say that? What about all these
jobs we're losing to Japan, jobs we're losing to Mexico, jobs we're losing
across the seas -- the manufacturing jobs that everybody thinks are the
heart and soul of this country?&quot; Here you've just said it is the microchip
and its derivatives which are leading the world today in growth and expansion.<BR>
<BR>
	 GILDER: Since the ascendancy of the microchip, beginning<BR>
around 1970, the U.S. has outperformed all the other economies in the world,
overwhelmingly, in job-creation. You just can't make the argument that we've
been losing jobs to other countries. We've created some 35 million net new
jobs in the last 30 years -- while the Europeans, for example, have created
almost no net new jobs outside of government consumption. The Japanese have
created new employment, but substantially less than we have. <BR>
	How can we be losing jobs to countries that are creating jobs radically
more slowly than we are?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But the manufacturing sector is what many people look to and say,
&quot;Hey! You can't be a unionized worker anymore and afford a house. You
used to be able to in America in the '50s. You can't do it anymore.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Anybody whose livelihood depends on examining union jobs and the
performance of unions, or collecting statistics for unions, or mobilizing
campaigns for unions, has a great incentive to disparage all this new employment
and opportunity in America, because it does largely arise outside the unionized
sectors. That is true. The unions have all flocked to the dinosaurs. They
all attempt to preserve jobs in old industries that are declining. <BR>
	And the new employment has been emerging in semiconductors, software, computer
manufacturing, as well as services in software. Manufacturing has continued
to grow. We're the dominant computer manufacturer in the world. We also
lead telecommunications and networks. And the Internet, which is entirely
an American creation, is now the dominant force in the world economy.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Yet you still have, in the American political scene, this anti-immigration
sentiment. And many of the people who are showing some moderate signs of
success [by] attacking this loss of manufacturing sector jobs are conservatives.
Perot's slightly conservative on balance, you'd have to say, although he's
made his money in computers. Buchanan is turning into a David Bonior in
this area, when it comes to industrialized job-loss. <BR>
	And people believe it. When they read you saying this, they're going to
scratch their heads, because there are a tremendous number of citizens who
believe we're losing jobs left and right; that the country is going south
fast; and that we've got to build a wall around America. Yet here you are
saying the worst thing we could possibly do is limit immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Illegal aliens who come in and are prohibited from having employment,
but mandated to receive welfare, are a problem -- it's the welfare state
that's the problem [in that case]. We have a welfare state mandated to reach
out to immigrants and induce them to take advantage of all the benefits.
You've been talking about this on your program. The welfare state is now
an enterprise, and it's &quot;reaching out&quot; to immigrants. The result
is that today's illegal aliens and immigrants are being captured by the
welfare state more rapidly than previous immigrant groups. And this is very
destructive, because welfare destroys everybody it touches.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There's a rising tide of people who believe that the only way to
fix this is to stop all immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Rush, it makes no sense. I don't think it's very valuable to stop
Mexicans from coming to the United States and doing the jobs they do mostly.
National Review magazine, on the basis of alarms about illegal immigration,
advocates a moratorium on all immigration, which would be incredibly destructive.
It would mean that lots of high-technology companies just couldn't operate
in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Let's construct a hypothesis here. There's a wall built around America
-- no immigration. We have embarked on a course of acculturating those who
are here, who have not yet learned Americanism. That's the strategy: Until
we can acculturate those who are here, we need to shut down. Are you suggesting
that, if this situation occurred, there is not somehow an ability here toproduce
the genius amongst those who live in the contiguous 48 plus Alaska and Hawaii
to continue this high-tech revolution?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: For certain key jobs and key inventive roles, there are just a
very few people in the world capable of performing them. The numbers are
small, and that small number tends to be distributed all around the world.
So any company that wants to be absolutely on the leading edge, to get the
best people in every field working together to produce some new product
-- whether it's a new kind of fiber-optic application for a broad-band Internet,
or whether it's a new kind of digital disk, or a new Internet computer,
or whatever it is -- those people have to command the best in all these
fields. If they can't get the best people to come to the United States,
they have to go to the best people. That's just a fact of life.<BR>
	And it's not new. It was true about Henry Ford, when he was starting Ford
Motor Company. Ford was the leading-edge company in the world economy, and
he &quot;imported&quot; a whole bunch of people from Scotland, England and
Germany to help him build his cars. Key advances in Ford Motor Company were
attributable to immigrants. When you are leading-edge, you are effectively
the spearhead for the entire planetary economy -- [so] you've got to get
the best, wherever they are. That's true about a lot of companies in the
United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Isn't it also true that America is one of the few places where genius
can flourish?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is right. So it would be horrendous, not just for the U.S.
but for the world, if you stopped the geniuses from coming. But there's
another point: For the last decade or so American culture -- the public
culture, the TV culture, the mass culture -- has been kind of hostile to
genius.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They're hostile to all achievement.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Correct. You, of course, have been the leader in making the case
against this hostility in our culture. But the schools are amazingly hostile
to genius. The result has been that American culture does not produce as
many of these people as it did in the past. Asians who come over and can
hardly read the language are thus immune to most of the seductions of the
welfare state and to the seductions of the imperial National Education Association
establishment. These newcomers dominate the schools [and ignore] all these
distractions -- while Americans are so attuned to the anti-achievement culture
that they regard these activities as beneath them.<BR>
	So the immigrants, ultimately, will help. You get these people in high
schools winning the valedictorian awards and going to the best colleges.
It creates a competitive counterforce that I think will regenerate American
culture.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Back to this resentment of achievement. We have these high-achieving
immigrants now being aced out of entry into various colleges, because we're
trying to not &quot;humiliate&quot; people. We are limiting the number of
high-achievers so as to spread the opportunity around to others. The goal
now is that everybody will pretty much be the same, in terms of equality
of outcome.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is, of course, a menace. If you really want to have equality,
you can have everybody equally poor.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There are those striving for it, even as we speak.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Exactly. And if you have a moratorium on immigrants, you'll be
making a major contribution to it. Because a lot of these immigrants are
very aggressive and creative and innovative and some of them are geniuses
who can revitalize an entire economy. <BR>
	Pat Buchanan -- who is correct about many things -- has, I think, been
somewhat twisted by this aspiration to cut into the unionized lower-middle-class
Democrats Perot is alleged to have attracted. It is chiefly a political
appeal he's making; he's trying to expand the Republican parry. I think
he's very smart. But they've stumbled on a bad one when they seriously talk
about a moratorium on immigration. Not just a slight little error, but a
truly deadly mistake.<BR>
	RUSH: It resonates, though, because there's a new nationalist fervor among
people who believe their jobs and livelihoods are being taken away from
them. I think they are largely union people who've grown up in unionized
homes; that's been the culture that they've been familiar with, and that's
what America always was to them, and now it's vanishing. Union membership
is down below 15%. And those who still survive are having to &quot;give
back&quot; wage gains and benefit gains. <BR>
	They think that anybody who wants to save their livelihood and their tradition
is a great American, because that's what America was. &quot;America was
not the computer. It wasn't the microprocessor, the microchip, or Microsoft.
It wasn't the Internet. America was steel. It was coal. It was the Teamsters
and truck-drivers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: We had the Korean War. There were bodies coming back in bags, and
three recessions, and people lived eight or nine years less.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: And you had to have a bomb-shelter in the back yard. You had to get
civil-defense instructions, and to see that the drinking water changed every
three weeks in case they nuked us.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: And, in many of these same union families, their parents came here
on a boat and struggled in some appalling jobs, by anybody's standards today.
I mean, to celebrate coal miners' jobs! One of the great triumphs is to
get beyond this kind of work, where people died years younger. It just is
a false nostalgia. Here we had, during this early period toward which people
are nostalgic, two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Korean War.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: It's an economic nostalgia. They remember the days where you, on
a salary of $12,000 a year, could buy a house, and could afford to send
your kid to college, and there were no credit cards, so you didn't go into
debt. And now the average cost for a house is 10 times what anybody makes
a year.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: But the average house is 20% bigger than it was, and 79% of new
houses have air-conditioning.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: So you would agree with the premise that every day in America is
a better day.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes, absolutely! And my grandchildren are going to live phenomenally,
incomparably better than we do.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Despite what happened to Don Shula, let me go to one more thing in
your column, because this really intrigued me. You know, if I didn't have
my mind, I would like to have yours. In fact, I'd probably rather have yours
anyway. But you say the current Republican fervor to balance the budget
is &quot;Hooverian.&quot; And that they've wasted a year on this premise.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: When you [make] a balanced budget your goal, you play into the
hands of the Democrats. You immediately put the focus on cutting government
spending. So your whole campaign is perceived by the people -- who get their
information largely from the media megaphones -- as negative. The Republicans
are somehow going to cut spending drastically, and this terrifies the 33%
of Americans who are dependent one way or another on government jobs and
subsidies.<BR>
	So you end up terrorizing millions of people, but you don't achieve anything
of value. Because Democrats succeed: As a result of this threat, they succeed
in mobilizing sufficient political force to stop major cuts. Meanwhile,
the things worth doing, the things people will really enjoy -- tax-rate
reductions, privatization, deregulation, all these positive programs Republicans
should push and  you've been pushing for years -- get lost. <BR>
	So we end up just talking about balanced budgets seven years from now.
Who the hell cares?<BR>
	The last time we had a balanced budget was 1979. It was an all-governmental
balanced budget, and we [also] had a trade surplus. Yet the whole private
economy was in the red. With the Reagan years, America's assets have risen,
since then, from about $17 trillion to $40 trillion. Yet we're speaking
as if the Reagan Administration was some kind of orgy of debt.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Bit is it an error of substance they've made? Or an error of strategy?
Because obviously what they're trying to do is nor just balance the budget.
They're trying to end the welfare stare. They're trying to reduce the size
of government so as to make more prosperous the individual. You would agree
with that, wouldn't you?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I agree with their visions. I don't agree with their tactics --
and their tactics have now, in my judgment, largely subsumed their vision.
So they end up essentially attempting to achieve something called &quot;balanced
budget&quot; by cutting various government programs. That is a completely
negative formula, and it's political poison. Moreover, it doesn't achieve
any good results<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But I am in favor of ending a lot of government programs. I'm also
in favor of the American people understanding why. I don't want to have
come up with a strategy to fool the American people -- perhaps, to win,
you must. But I would love to be able to educate the American people, to
say: &quot;This program is worthless. It's wasteful. It doesn't need to
exist. We don't need to be paying you to conduct sleigh-rides around herds
of elk in Jellystone National Park. And I'm not going to sit here and take
your job away from you without telling you why. I'm going to make sure you
understand this is not a function of government.&quot;<BR>
	Is that strategy a guaranteed loser, because so many people have now been
indoctrinated to the degree that they depend on government, and panic if
they think it's not going to be there?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think you have to start by cutting tax rates. Big tax- rate reductions
would be entirely positive. They would pay for themselves. They would enrich
the country. They would make Republicans popular -- despite what the polls
happen to say.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: The Democrats would do the same thing, though. They would call them
tax cuts for the rich, and you'd still have the same arguments that are
taking place now. Because Democrats are not going to lay down and let happen
what the true objective is, which is to reduce government, regardless of
how the Republicans characterize it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: To the extent the goal is defined as cutting back government programs,
the Democrats win. To the extent the goal is defined as unleashing the American
economy, creating huge numbers of new jobs and opportunities, reducing tax
rates, deregulating bureaucracy, we win. The focus on the balanced budget
is a mistake, and this mistake was imposed on the party by a pollster. Politicians
who follow public-opinion polls earn the contempt of the public. And that
is the big danger today, because Republicans on television most of the time
are saying something about a balanced budget that isn't true.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Such as?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Such as, that it will greatly lower interest rates and produce
all these marvelous benefits. This could be achieved by tax cuts, but [not]
by the balanced-budget process -- because you have to begin by saying tax
cuts cost revenue, which is nonsense. Republicans from the beginning agreed
to accept the static budgeting method, that tax cuts don't affect economic
behavior. Tax cuts increase revenue, as you've explained endlessly, but
this still hasn't penetrated beyond your audience.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, they're even afraid to defend the Reagan years on that. But,
if you get rid of the deficit, haven't you freed up a pool of anywhere from
$150 billion to $300 billion that doesn't have to be borrowed by government
and, as such, won't money be in greater supply? Therefore, supply-and-demand
would dictate interest rates would come down?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's an accounting view of the economy. There's another view,
which focuses on asset values. As John Rutledge at the Claremont Institute
in California explains, we have something like $40 trillion of assets in
the American economy. Those numbers  you're using, relating to the flow
of funds into the federal government, are picayune compared to the immense
changes in asset-values that go on in response to different government policies.
If you cut tax rates, asset-values in general increase. And they increase
not by a few hundred billion dollars, but by trillions of dollars. <BR>
	Money is relevant only as a symbol of productive services that somebody
has offered. This idea that somehow you can I unleash new money which will
automatically expand the economy is the fallacy of demand-side economics
-- and I know you oppose that. Bur the balanced-budget illusion is largely
based on demand-side calculations.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: What about the theories, as advanced by Pete Peterson and others,
that if we don't get a handle on it now, the national tax rate is going
to be 84% for a child born in 1990? That Social Security and all of these
things that actually should be calculated as part of the deficit but aren't
[will] bleed the economy dry, with taxation on fewer numbers of productive
people? They say balancing the budget and paying for what you spend is crucial
to keeping solvent all these various contracts we've made with generations.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Several analysts have questioned the basic accounting functions
Peterson and Rudman and that group have been adducing. But, to Peterson,
the whole Reagan Administration was an absolutely catastrophic failure.
He's one of these one-hand economists. On the one hand, he can see liabilities.
But he can't count assets -- the other hand. So he sees the liabilities
of the federal government growing. But he can't see the tens of trillions
of dollars of new assets emerging from these new industries that have been
generated and are now the spearheads of global economic growth.<BR>
	American companies now earn some 47% of all the profits in world economy.
American dominance today, industrially, is probably as great as ever before,
except immediately surrounding a war triumph. This is much more important
than these numbers Peterson talks about.<BR>
	The Gingrich error was to start by cutting -- by threatening -- existing
programs, rather than by starting with the flat tax. That should have been
what they came into office with. Let Clinton make all the arguments about
why we shouldn't have a tax return on a post card. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Can the Republicans win in November?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Sure, they can. I think Steve Forbes is really defining the issues
on which we can win. To the extent the winning candidate really follows
that theme, he can win. What's your impression of Steve?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I love what Steve's doing. I absolutely do.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Do you think he's beginning to show some real political aptitude?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I think he's learning. I don't know if it's soon enough to overcome
Dole's insurmountable lead. It's not over till it's over but, boy, it looks
awfully doubtful for anybody buy Dole.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: A lot of people must tell you this, but you essentially did it
in '94. And you really could greatly change things in '96. I think you could
shape the situation and force Dole to respond to your position, because
you really are the foundation of the Republican Party now. It's a hell of
a responsibility, Rush!<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, somebody has to do it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Why don't you run? <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I don't want the pay cut.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's right! But you could make these guys face this issue. They
believe that Reagan's tax cuts were a mistake.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They do, because to them it's a zero-sum game. They have no understanding
of the expansion capabilities of people keeping what they earn. George,
let's talk again.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Obviously, any time.<BR>

<h2>Colombia, America 's Favorite 'Narco-Democracy'</h2>
<h3>By WILLIAM J. BENNET AND JESSE HELMS</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
The deluge of illegal drugs flooding into the U.S. has become one of the principal threats to our national security. More Americans die each year from the use of cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs than from international terrorism. Yet, while the Clinton administration has rightly maintained a tough line with Libya, Iran and other governments known to be sponsoring terrorism, it has let Columbia -- which ships more cocaine into the U.S. than any other country -- completely off the hook. It is time for the administration to stiffen its spine and show some resolve in its anti-drug efforts.<p>

The administration's recent annual review of international cooperation on counter-drug efforts by major drug-producing and trafficking countries is instructive. Under this review, countries that fail to meet certain minimum standards of performance in combating drug trafficking are supposed to be denied U.S. aid. The Clinton administration acknowledged in its report that Colombia has indeed failed to meet minimum standards, yet, amazingly, granted Colombia a "national interest waiver" allowing U.S. aid to flow into Colombia despite its miserable record.<p>

This is a grave moral and geopolitical mistake. All available evidence clearly indicates Colombia has totally capitulated to the drug lords. By extending certification to Colombia, despite overwhelming evidence that its government is rife with narco-corruption, the Clinton administration has sent a troubling signal to all drug producing nations: The U.S. will impose no penalty for collusion in trafficking with the drug lords.<p>

Colombia is no borderline case. It has indisputably, become a "narco-democracy" -- a country with a facade of democratic government that is effectively controlled by drug kingpins who manipulate the political establishment with cocaine money. According to the administration's own background papers on Colombia:<p>

<ul>
<li>The Cali cartel has been left free by the Colombian government to exploit the banking system and launder vast sums of drug money with impunity.

<li>There is practically no effective investigation or prosecution of the more than 15,000 current cases of corruption involving government officials (more than half of them senior level authorities).

<li>A "guilt-laundering" system exists, in which Cali drug lords surrender, and submit to a jerry-rigged plea-bargaining system that leaves their assets intact and allbws them to plead to minor charges.

<li>The government's eradication programs have been half-hearted at best, despite massive increases in the growing of opium and new cocaine cultivation.

<li>High-level government collusion enables the shipment of enormous quantities of cocaine into the U.S., with 727 jets transiting in Mexico with tons of the drug.

<li>There is evidence of the corruption of many members of the Colombian Congress, and increasing evidence of presidential ties to the drug cartels.
</ul>

The Clinton administration cannot plead ignorance as the excuse for its abdication of responsibility. But conditions in Colombia are in fact worse than even the administration's report acknowledges. The influence of the cartels and their blood money pervades almost all aspects of Colombia's political, social and economic life. Cartel money finances political campaigns. It silences journalists. It buys judges. It infiltrates virtually every major business activity in Colombia-from cut flowers, to oil, to paper, to banking.<p>

Colombia is now the primary base for the cartels to extend their drug operations throughout the hemisphere. Despite the fact that the Cali cartel now supplies more than 80% of all the cocaine entering the U.S., the Colombian government has failed to arrest or prosecute even one significant cartel member. To the contrary, Colombia has given the cartel cover and protection from international extradition, allowing these drugs to end up on American streets and in American schools, where they destroy the lives of American children.<p>

We believe the Colombian government's collusion with the drug lords poses a direct threat to the national security of 'the U.S.  It is time to meet this threat head-on.  And since the Clinton administration has failed to provide leadership on this issue, it is all the more important that Congress assume responsibility.  That is why a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee will hold a hearing today on the issue.  And why legislation will be introduced this week to cut off all economic support, trade benefits, and military assistance to Colombia by Feb. 6,1996, unless the president of the United States can certify that Colombian President Ernesto Samper has implemented the reform agenda he promised the U.S. Congress he would enact.<p>

Elements of this agenda include investigating the financing by drug traffickers of political parties and candidates in Columbia; putting law enforcement resources behind investigating, capturing, convicting and imprisoning major drug lords in Colombia; ending the "guilt-laundering" system; confiscating assets of cartel leaders; and destroying 44,000 hectares (108,680 acres) of coca and poppy plants in Colombia by Jan. 1,1996 (and all remaining acreage by Jan. 1, 1997).<p>

The Colombian leaders must be sent a clear and unmistakable message: In the war on drugs, they can either continue to ally themselves with the cartels, and thereby become a pariah state like Libya and Iran; or they can return to the community of civilized nations, fulfill the promises President Samper made, and join with the U.S. in an effort to put the cartels out of business. The choice is theirs.<p>

<I>[Mr. Bennett, co-director of Empower America and a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, served as drug czar in the Bush administration. Sen. Helms (R., N.C.) is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.]</I>

Congress Should Seek Out Sources of Worsening Military Morale</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>
<P>	Turf  battles and budget cuts always stir anxieties in the military,
 but recent signs of damaged morale in the officer corps  suggest worrisome
trouble from more unusual sources. At some point the fighting ability of
the military--its reason for existence--may be impaired. Before that happens,
Congress should investigate the causes of the recent spate of  firings,
resignations, lawsuits, charges of &quot;McCarthyism&quot; and top officer
suicides that are afflicting the armed services.<BR>
<BR>
	A Congressional investigation almost surely would cast a light on the results
of President Clinton's political correctness policies and micro management,
 but it also would call into question the attitudes of some members of Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	For several years now the military has been treated as some kind of social
laboratory. A Tailhook Convention of Navy aviators five years ago included
a notorious party that provided the pretext for the puritanical reaction
that followed. Somehow, few of the guilty parties at  that event were found
and punished, but people who merely attended the same convention and were
involved in no misconduct have been permanently tarnished. So were superiors
and people tagged by remarks or actions in other situations that would have
had little or no consequences in a less hysterical atmosphere.  In all,
14 admirals have been relieved or retired. Literally dozens of other officers'
promotions have been held up by the Senate. This week, Secretary of Defense
William Perry himself finally called for an end to the Tailhook witch hunt.
<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, however, the Navy, and the services generally, are pinned down
by an arch-feminist fusillade of charges and policy demands. For example,
we now have reached a point, literally, where even unattributed and unsubstantiated
accusations of political incorrectness can wreck officers' careers, and
where failure of superiors to punish those so accused can bring them down,
too. This truly is McCarthyism.<BR>
<BR>
	According to the Center for Military Readiness, a Defense Department Instruction
(DoDI 1320.4) was issued last year that allows &quot;alleged adverse information&quot;
and &quot;unsubstantiated allegations&quot; to be placed in the files of
officers after they have been selected for promotion and before their confirmation.
Without the officers being informed, the possibly false charges can be circulated
to Pentagon brass, the White House and Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	If something similar happens to short-term political appointees, they,
at least, can use publicity and political connections to fight back. Military
officers, sworn to serve civilian leadership, are nearly immobilized. They
may  be subjected to unwarranted and devastating shame.<BR>
<BR>
	The recent suicide of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jeremy Boorda,
is almost by itself worthy of a Congressional investigation. Far more apparently
was involved than an approaching Newsweek article examining his right to
wear two &quot;V&quot; (for valor) devices on his  Vietnam campaign ribbons.
Boorda had been under pressure on one hand to push the Clinton political
correctness policies, while on the other he was incurring increasing  criticism
for failing to defend the honor of his officers and the effectiveness of
the service.<BR>
<BR>
	Among the critics was combat hero, author and former Navy Secretary Jim
Webb, who, in a speech at Annapolis revealed the &quot;disturbing statistic&quot;
that in the past year &quot;53 percent of the post-command Commanders in
naval aviation left the Navy rather than continue their careers...These
were the cream, the very future of the Navy, officers who had performed
for two decades in a manner that marked them as potential Admirals.&quot;
Rather than continue on a nominally  successful track, they are quitting,
Webb noted. <BR>
<BR>
	It's not just the Navy. A Coast Guard Captain, Ernie Blanchard, made a
speech at the Coast Guard Academy that included some weak humor that offended
some female cadets. Example: he said that his friend, the Commandant, was
so unsexy that on his wedding night, when he told his wife they could do
anything she wanted, she said she'd like to go to sleep. Was it funny? No.
Was it offensive? Well, it seemingly was so offensive that Capt. Blanchard
was forced to make a public apology. But that didn't end it. Feminists demanded
a court-martial, and the top brass went along. Blanchard, a life-time veteran
with a wife and two teen-aged daughters, was led to believe that he might
well be found guilty, and lose not only his job, but also his pension. Ruined--by
a joke--he, too, committed suicide. <BR>
<BR>
	In the Army, a recent  critical internal report on morale has not been
released to the media, but it has been described in the journal Military
Review as an assessment of &quot;anecdotal accounts&quot; indicating a growing
culture of mistrust and stifled initiative.<BR>
<BR>
	The Army report echoes a former Air Force pilot who  quit because of the
backbiting and division. &quot;It's a one-mistake military now,&quot; he
says, &quot;and the mistake doesn't even have to amount to anything much
or even be true.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	It cannot help morale, in this context, that the very President who has
visited many of the new rules upon the military is the same one who has
used his  status as Commander-in-Chief as a claim against prosecution in
a lawsuit for, of all things,  sexual harassment in the Paula Jones case.<BR>
<BR>
	Some service tension, as noted, would be expected anyway in an era of military
downsizing. The armed forces are now 1.4 million, compared to 13 million
at the height of World War II; yet we have just as many generals and admirals
as then. We are top-heavy. But demoralizing your officer class so that many
of your best people quit and many of the others live in quiet fear is  a
strange way to address the leadership issue. <BR>
<BR>
	Are these problems as serious as the news stories and &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot;
suggest? Why doesn't the Congress find out?<BR>

Dear Senator 

After years of empty rhetoric, I am glad to see true reform 
brewing in Congress.  I look forward to the day when 
Congress reforms itself via the Citizen Congress Act.

If passed, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act 
will help restore my faith in elected officials.  For too 
long, we have been made promises while important measures 
such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment have 
not materialized.

By eliminating perks and wasteful practices from within, 
Congress can begin to reverse the hollow promises of the 
past several years. Abolishment of the federal pension 
system, elimination of franked mass mailings, non-automatic
pay increases, and reduced military aircraft travel are 
significant reforms which also reduce government spending. 
At a time when the country's budget is in poor fiscal 
condition, there is little reason not to tighten the belt 
of Congress.

I was disappointed to see term limits measures fail, yet 
I believe that the Citizen Congress Act is a step in the 
right direction in regards to congressional reform.  I 
understand that Members of Congress work hard and are 
very busy, but I also believe Congress needs to truly 
reidentify with the voters of this country.  I ask that 
you pledge support for this measure, and I look forward
to your reply.

Sincerely,
</textarea>

Before ANDERSON and TACHA, Circuit Judges, and COOK, District
Judge. (FN*)
<P>
TACHA, Circuit Judge.
<P>
Appellants appeal an order of the district court granting defendants'
motion for summary judgment. Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc. v.
Romer, 750 F.Supp. 1041 (D.Colo.1990). On appeal, appellants contend
that the Governor of Colorado violated their First Amendment rights
by using state resources to defeat an amendment on the ballot
at a Colorado general election. Appellee Romer cross appeals asserting
that appellants lack standing to pursue this action. We exercise
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 and dismiss the appeal
for lack of standing.
<P>
BACKGROUND
<P>
In October of 1988, the citizens of Colorado placed an initiative,
commonly referred to as Amendment six, on the ballot at the Colorado
general election. Amendment six focused on statewide tax reform
and would have allowed the citizens of Colorado to vote directly
on any significant change in state tax laws.
<P>
Appellee Romer, the Governor of the State of Colorado, and defendant
Citizens for Representative Government, of which defendants Phil
Fox and Clark Shaw were members, publicly opposed the amendment.
Appellants assert that Governor Romer used numerous public resources
to publicly oppose the amendment. These resources allegedly included
staff time, equipment and supplies, travel resources, and facilities
at the state mansion and state capital office. Amendment six eventually
was defeated in the Colorado general election.
<P>
After the defeat of the amendment, appellants filed a suit in
the United States District Court for the District of Colorado
seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. Appellants claimed that
Governor Romer violated their First Amendment rights by using
state resources and the power and prestige of his office to oppose
the amendment. Appellants also asserted that the Governor and
the other defendants combined in a conspiracy to violate the appellants'
constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985(3) and
common law.
<P>
Asserting that appellants lacked standing and that they failed
to state a claim for relief for a violation of the United States
Constitution, defendants moved for summary judgment. Appellants
cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court *1396 denied
appellants' motion and then addressed defendants' motion, denying
it in part and granting it in part. The district court found that
appellants had standing to sue, but that Governor Romer's expenditures
were &quot;de minimis&quot; so that the appellants failed to state
a claim.
<P>
DISCUSSION
<P>
On appeal, Romer contends that appellants lack standing to pursue
this action. Because we agree with this contention, we address
only the standing argument and do not address the merits of appellants'
contentions on appeal. In this case, appellants are two associations,
the Colorado Taxpayers Union and the Colorado Libertarian Party,
and a number of individuals.
<P>
Before a party may invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts,
Article III requires that the party demonstrate that (1) &quot;
'he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as
a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant' &quot;;
(2) &quot;the injury 'fairly can be traced to the challenged action'
&quot;; and (3) the injury &quot; 'is likely to be redressed by
a favorable decision.' &quot; Valley Forge Christian College v.
Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., 454
U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (quoting
Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99, 99
S.Ct. 1601, 1607, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979) and Simon v. Eastern Ky.
<P>
Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 41, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924,
1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976)). If a party satisfies these minimum
constitutional requirements, then a court may still deny standing
for prudential reasons if the injury alleged constitutes a &quot;generalized
grievance&quot; that more appropriately should be addressed by
the representative branches. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,
751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).
<P>
The district court concluded that plaintiffs &quot;alleged sufficient
injury for standing.&quot; Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc. v. Romer,
750 F.Supp. 1041, 1043 (D.Colo.1990). In support of this conclusion,
the district court stated that &quot;[t]he harm consists of the
additional burden imposed on the plaintiffs by the defendants'
allegedly unconstitutional acts. Like the plaintiffs in Common
Cause v. Bolger, [512 F.Supp. 26, 30 (D.D.C.1980) ], the plaintiffs
here have alleged that their campaign for Amendment 6 would not
have been so difficult (and, in fact, might have been successful)
but for the defendants' acts.&quot; Id. We must now determine
whether the individuals or either of the associations, the Colorado
Libertarian Party or the Colorado Taxpayers Union, have standing
to bring this suit.
<P>
A. The Colorado Libertarian Party
<P>
Appellants contend that the Libertarian Party has standing to
sue because it seeks judicial relief for injuries to the organization.
An organization has standing on its own behalf if it meets the
standing requirements that apply to individuals. Havens Realty
Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 378-79, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 1124-25,
71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982). To have standing, plaintiffs must allege
&quot; 'such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy'
as to warrant ... invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.&quot;
Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp.,
429 U.S. 252, 261, 97 S.Ct. 555, 561, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (quoting
Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d
663 (1962)). Appellants must demonstrate that their alleged injury
is an &quot;injury in fact, economic or otherwise.&quot; Association
of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 152,
90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). The injury must be &quot;
'distinct and palpable,' &quot; Gladstone, Realtors v. Village
of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 100, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1608, 60 L.Ed.2d
66 (1979) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct.
2197, 2206, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975)), and &quot;real and immediate,&quot;
not abstract, conjectural, speculative, or hypothetical, City
of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660,
1664-65, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).
<P>
Appellants claim that Governor Romer used his staff and the resources
of his office to defeat the tax initiative supported by the Libertarian
Party and thus forced *1397 the Party to bear a greater burden
in its attempt to pass the amendment. Appellants claim that under
Havens, 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124, this drain on resources
is a concrete and demonstrable injury.
<P>
In Havens, the Supreme Court found that an organization was entitled
to standing on its own behalf because the organization alleged
that an apartment owner's racial steering practices had perceptively
impaired the organization's ability to provide counseling and
referral services for low and moderate income home seekers. The
Court stated that &quot;[s]uch [a] concrete and demonstrable injury
to the organization's activities--with the consequent drain on
the organization's resources--constitutes far more than simply
a setback to the organization's abstract social interests.&quot;
Id. at 379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124.
<P>
Appellants' argument that they were forced to counteract the Governor's
activities through the expenditure of additional funds is purely
conjectural.
<P>
Such an argument simply does not demonstrate that the Libertarian
Party or its members have suffered a distinct and concrete injury.
At most, the Libertarian Party's allegations suggest only that
the organization has received a minor setback to its organizational
purpose. The Libertarian Party's argument would require this court
to engage in a futile act of speculation in order to determine
the extent of some remote, uncertain injury. This type of conjectural
injury cannot establish standing under Havens. In Havens, the
defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct could be tied directly
to a concrete harm inflicted upon the primary activity of the
plaintiff organization--the organization's counseling and referral
efforts were rendered futile when the defendant turned away referred
applicants. Here, appellants' actions in spending additional funds
simply cannot be traced to the Governor's allegedly illegal expenditures.
It is pure conjecture to assume that Governor Romer's activities
caused appellants to drain their resources. Thus, we conclude
that appellants have not &quot;allege[d] [a] personal injury fairly
traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely
to be redressed by the requested relief.&quot; Allen v. Wright,
468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).
<P>
The Libertarian Party also argues that it suffered an injury when
its First Amendment rights were chilled. Appellants contend that
the allegedly illegal expenditures by the Governor effectively
imposed a tax upon the Libertarian Party in its effort to exercise
its First Amendment right to petition. Essentially, appellants
claim that the dilution of Party resources chilled the exercise
of First Amendment rights.
<P>
We cannot agree with the characterization of the Governor's activities
as a &quot;tax&quot; on the Libertarian Party or its members'
First Amendment right to petition. The Governor's activities in
no way prevented the Libertarian Party or its members from petitioning
the government. The Governor's activities only commenced once
the amendment was placed on the ballot. The Governor's allegedly
unlawful activities never prevented members of the Libertarian
Party from associating, speaking on behalf of the amendment, or
voting on the amendment. Further, the Libertarian Party and its
members failed to demonstrate that Romer's activities impacted
their ability to petition the government of Colorado in the future.
Thus, neither the Libertarian Party nor its members has demonstrated
that First Amendment rights were chilled.
<P>
The Libertarian Party contends that even if it has not been injured,
it is entitled to standing on behalf of its members. In Hunt v.
Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 343,
97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977), the Supreme Court
announced a three-part test for associational standing:
<P>
[A]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members
when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in
their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane
to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted
nor the relief *1398 requested requires the participation of the
individual members in the lawsuit.
<P>
Because we conclude that the Libertarian Party's members do not
have standing to sue in their own right, the Party is not entitled
to associational standing.
<P>
B. The Colorado Taxpayers Union and the Individual Appellants
<P>
The individual appellants claim that they are entitled to standing
as taxpayers. The Colorado Taxpayers Union asserts standing as
an organization suing on behalf of its tax-paying members. Appellants
argue that the Governor illegally used state tax funds in order
to defeat Amendment six and that this misappropriation entitles
them to standing under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942,
20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). The district court stated that &quot;[t]he
essence of the plaintiffs' position is that when the Governor
becomes an advocate against a citizen initiative, he has exceeded
the limits of his official power and interfered in the process
by which the people exercise their sovereign right to change the
authority of the officials who govern them.&quot; Colorado Taxpayers
Union, Inc., 750 F.Supp. at 1044. Appellee Romer argues that this
claim is insufficient to give appellants taxpayer standing under
Flast.
<P>
Most of the taxpayer standing cases addressed by the Supreme Court
deal with federal taxpayer standing. The general prohibition against
federal taxpayer standing originated in Frothingham v. Mellon,
262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). In Frothingham,
the Supreme Court held that a federal taxpayer lacks standing
to sue to enjoin federal officials from enforcing a  federal statute
authorizing appropriations of public money. The federal taxpayer
attacked the Maternity Act of 1921, which established a federal
program of grants to states to reduce maternal and infant mortality.
The taxpayer alleged that Congress, in enacting the Act, exceeded
its powers under Article I of the Constitution. She argued that
&quot;the effect of the appropriations complained of will be to
increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take her property
without due process of law.&quot; Id. at 486, 43 S.Ct. at 600.
<P>
The Court began its analysis by noting that &quot;[t]he interest
of a taxpayer of a municipality in the application of its moneys
is direct and immediate and the remedy by injunction to prevent
their misuse in not inappropriate. It is upheld by a large number
of state cases and is the rule of this court.&quot; Id. The Court
then distinguished federal taxpayers from municipal taxpayers
and stated that a federal taxpayer's &quot;interest in the moneys
of the treasury ... is comparatively minute and indeterminable&quot;
and that &quot;the effect upon future taxation, of any payment
out of the [Treasury's] funds, [is] remote, fluctuating and uncertain.&quot;
Id. at 487, 43 S.Ct. at 601. Thus, the Court found that the federal
taxpayer lacked standing.
<P>
In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947
(1968), the Court created an exception to the bar on federal taxpayer
standing in the context of Establishment Clause challenges. The
Court asked &quot;whether the Frothingham barrier should be lowered
when a taxpayer attacks a federal statute on the ground that it
violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First
Amendment.&quot; Id. at 85, 88 S.Ct. at 1944. To resolve this
issue, the Court noted that a court must &quot;determine whether
there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim
sought to be adjudicated.&quot; Id. at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1953.
The Court then concluded that the nexus requirement for a federal
taxpayer contains two aspects. &quot;First, the taxpayer must
establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative
enactment attacked.&quot; Id. Under this first aspect, a taxpayer
can only challenge the unconstitutionality of exercises of congressional
power under the Taxing and Spending Clause of Article I, Section
8 of the Constitution. The second aspect requires that a taxpayer
establish &quot;a nexus between that status and the precise nature
of the constitutional infringement alleged.&quot; Id. To satisfy
this requirement, a taxpayer must show that the challenged action
&quot;exceeds specific  constitutional limitations imposed upon
the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power.&quot;
Id. at 102- *1399 03, 88 S.Ct. at 1953-54. In Flast, the taxpayers
satisfied both aspects of the required nexus because they challenged
a congressional exercise of power under Article I, Section 8 and
because they asserted that the congressional expenditures violated
the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which specifically
limits the taxing and spending power of Article I, Section 8.
<P>
After Flast, the Court consistently has adhered to the &quot;narrow
exception [Flast ] created to the general rule against taxpayer
standing.&quot; Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 618, 108 S.Ct.
2562, 2579, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). In Valley Forge Christian
College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State,
Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982), the
Court held that federal taxpayers lacked standing to challenge
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare's (HEW) decision
to give property to a religious institution. The Court rejected
the taxpayers' standing argument because the &quot;source of their
complaint is not a congressional action, but a decision by HEW
to transfer a parcel of federal property.&quot; Id. at 479, 102
S.Ct. at 762. The Court also reasoned that &quot;the property
transfer about which [the taxpayers] complain was not an exercise
of authority conferred by the Taxing and Spending Clause.&quot;
Id. at 480, 102 S.Ct. at 762. (FN1) Thus, the Court has indicated
that Flast applies only to cases in which a federal taxpayer challenges
a congressional appropriation made pursuant to Article I, Section
8 that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment. See United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 94 S.Ct.
2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974);
<P>
Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208,
228, 94 S.Ct.
<P>
2925, 2935, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974); Flast, 392 U.S. at 114, 115,
88 S.Ct. at 1959, 1960 (Stewart, J., concurring and Fortas, J.,
concurring); see also Taub v. Kentucky, 842 F.2d 912, 916 (6th
Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 179, 102 L.Ed.2d
148 (1988).
<P>
Both parties mistakenly rely on Flast to resolve whether appellants
qualify for taxpayer standing in this case. Flast does not directly
govern this appeal because it applies to federal taxpayer standing
issues, not questions relating to standing for state taxpayers.
Although neither Frothingham nor Flast analyzes questions of state
taxpayer standing invoked to challenge state taxes or expenditures,
the Supreme Court briefly addressed the issue in Doremus v. Board
of Education, 342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952).
<P>
In Doremus, New Jersey state taxpayers sued the State of New Jersey
seeking a declaratory judgment that a state law authorizing public
school teachers to read from the Bible violated the First Amendment.
The Court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing because
they did not allege any direct injury to themselves. The Court
stated that [t]here is no allegation that this activity is supported
by any separate tax or paid for from any particular appropriation
or that it adds any sum whatever to the cost of conducting the
school. No information is given as to what kind of taxes are paid
by appellants and there is no averment that the Bible reading
increases any tax they do pay or that as taxpayers they are, will,
or possibly can be out of pocket because of it.
<P>
Id. at 433, 72 S.Ct. at 397. The Court reiterated that a taxpayer
&quot; 'must be able to show, not only that the statute is invalid,
but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining
some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely
that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.'
&quot; Id. at 434, 72 S.Ct. at 397 (quoting Commonwealth of Mass.
v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, 601, 67 L.Ed. 1078
(1923)). The Court held that &quot;[t]he taxpayer's action can
meet this test, but only *1400 when it is a good-faith pocketbook
action.&quot; Id. Thus, we must determine whether appellants'
action satisfies the &quot;good-faith pocketbook&quot; requirement.
<P>
After Doremus, the federal courts have addressed the issue of
state taxpayer standing and the type of claim that satisfies the
good-faith pocketbook requirement infrequently. In Hoohuli v.
Ariyoshi, 741 F.2d 1169 (9th Cir.1984), the Ninth Circuit examined
the issue of state taxpayer standing and concluded that the plaintiffs
met the Doremus requirements. In Hoohuli, state taxpayers brought
an action challenging a system established by the State of Hawaii
that disbursed benefits to residents who had descended from aboriginal
inhabitants of the islands. The taxpayers claimed that &quot;their
tax dollars were being spent on a program which disbursed benefits
based on impermissible racial classifications.&quot; Id. at 1172.
<P>
After reviewing Frothingham and Doremus, the Ninth Circuit concluded
that &quot;[s]tate taxpayers could still maintain taxpayer suits
if their pleadings were sufficient. They were sufficient if they
set forth the relationship between taxpayer, tax dollars, and
the allegedly illegal government activity.&quot; Id. at 1178 (citation
omitted). To reach this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit reviewed
Flast and its progeny and found that because the Supreme Court
did not discuss Doremus in the second part of the Flast nexus
test, it implicitly distinguished between standing requirements
for federal and state taxpayers. Id. at 1179. Thus, the Ninth
Circuit decided that state taxpayer standing remained unchanged
after Flast and must be guided by Doremus in its original form.
Id. at 1179-80.
<P>
Based on this analysis, the Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs
had satisfied the &quot;good-faith pocketbook action&quot; of
Doremus. Each of the plaintiffs set forth his or her status as
a taxpayer. The taxpayers challenged the appropriation, transfer
and spending of taxpayers' money from the general fund of the
state treasury. Further, the taxpayers alleged that they &quot;ha[d]
been burdened with the necessity to provide more taxes to support&quot;
the program.
<P>
Id. at 1180. The Ninth Circuit concluded that &quot;[t]he pleadings
set forth with specificity amounts of money appropriated and spent
for allegedly unlawful purposes.&quot; Id. Thus, under the test
announced by the Ninth Circuit, a taxpayer must satisfy three
requirements: (1) taxpayer status; (2) the appropriation of monies
from the state's general funds; and (3) the spending of those
funds for allegedly unlawful purposes. (FN2) Under this standard,
a taxpayer need not demonstrate that &quot;her tax burden will
be lightened by elimination of the questioned expenditure.&quot;
Cammack v. Waihee, 932 F.2d 765 (9th Cir.1991), petition for cert.
filed, 60 USLW 3406 (Nov. 12, 1991). (FN3)
<P>
The Eighth Circuit, in Minnesota Federation of Teachers v. Randall,
891 F.2d 1354 (8th Cir.1989), agreed with the Ninth Circuit's
approach to state taxpayer standing. In Randall, the plaintiffs,
a teachers' union and its president, brought an action challenging
the constitutionality of the Minnesota Post-Secondary Enrollment
Options Act. Pursuant to the Act, public high school students
in their junior and senior years could take advanced courses at
two- and four-year colleges, some of which were religiously affiliated.
The plaintiffs alleged that the Act violated the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment. Protesting the disbursement of
tax money to sectarian schools and arguing that reallocation of
funds reduced money available for his salary, the president of
the teachers' union asserted standing as a taxpayer. *1401 The
district court dismissed the suit for lack of standing because
it believed that to achieve state taxpayer standing, the plaintiff
would have to show an increase in his tax bill under Doremus.
Id. at 1357. The Eighth Circuit disagreed, concluding that Doremus
did not require a showing of an increased tax burden. The court
reasoned that &quot;only a taxpayer really suffers a distinct
injury from the improper use of public money in violation of the
establishment clause&quot; and &quot;that taxpayer standing was
created to specifically permit the airing of establishment claims.&quot;
Id. at 1358. The Eighth Circuit concluded, &quot;we do not believe
that state taxpayers are required to show an increase in their
tax burdens to allege sufficient injury.&quot; Id.
<P>
The Sixth Circuit addressed the issue of state taxpayer standing
in Taub v. Kentucky, 842 F.2d 912 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488
U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 179, 102 L.Ed.2d 148 (1988). In Taub, a state
taxpayer brought an action against Kentucky, its governor, and
other executive officers to prevent them from spending state tax
revenues in connection with the construction of an automotive
assembly plant. The plaintiff, who paid approximately $1,200 dollars
in state property taxes, claimed that &quot;the action of the
Commonwealth and various officials of the executive branch amount[ed]
to the taking of  private property through taxation for other
than a public purpose.&quot; Id. at 914. After reviewing the federal
taxpayer standing cases, the court noted that few cases have addressed
the standing of state taxpayers where the Establishment Clause
is not an issue, whereas municipal taxpayer standing has been
recognized in a variety of contexts. Id. at 917. The Sixth Circuit
then noted that challenges to the Establishment Clause create
a unique situation in state taxpayer standing cases. Relying on
the Supreme Court's notation in School District of Grand Rapids
v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 380 n. 5, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3220 n. 5, 87
L.Ed.2d 267 (1985), that the Court has &quot;adjudicated [numerous]
Establishment Clause challenges by state taxpayers to programs
for aiding nonpublic schools,&quot; the Sixth Circuit stated that
&quot;[t]his observation [by the Supreme Court] points up the
distinctive treatment of standing when the Establishment Clause
is involved, but does not indicate any rule with respect to other
state taxpayer suits.&quot; Taub, 842 F.2d at 917.
<P>
After undertaking the preceding analysis and reviewing Doremus,
the court conclude[d] that the requirements for federal taxpayer
standing announced in Frothingham control the issue of state taxpayer
standing, at least in those cases where violation of the Establishment
Clause is not alleged.... In order to have standing, a state taxpayer
must allege direct and palpable injury with sufficient specificity
to meet the &quot;good-faith pocketbook&quot; requirement of Doremus.
<P>
Id. at 918. The Sixth Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's
conclusion in Hoohuli that a state taxpayer must only allege that
appropriated funds were spent for unlawful purposes. Id. at 918-19.
In addition to this requirement, the court required that &quot;[a]
state taxpayer ... tie such allegations of illegal appropriations
and expenditures to a specific claim of some direct and palpable
injury threatened or suffered.&quot; Id. at 919.
<P>
After considering the cases relating to both federal and state
taxpayer standing, we conclude that, where an Establishment Clause
violation is not asserted, a state taxpayer must allege that appropriated
funds were spent for an allegedly unlawful purpose and that the
illegal appropriations and expenditures are tied to a direct and
palpable injury threatened or suffered. Only by meeting these
requirements will a state taxpayer satisfy the &quot;good-faith
pocketbook&quot; requirement of Doremus. A state taxpayer must
demonstrate that she will be &quot;out of pocket&quot; because
of the allegedly illegal appropriation. Doremus, 342 U.S. at 433,
72 S.Ct. at 396.
<P>
In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by the Supreme Court's
decision in ASARCO, Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 109 S.Ct. 2037,
104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989). In ASARCO, numerous individual state taxpayers
and the Arizona Education Association, representing approximately
20,000 public *1402 school teachers in the State of Arizona, brought
a suit in Arizona state court seeking a declaration that a state
statute governing mineral leases on state land was void. The plaintiffs
challenged the state statute on grounds that it did not comply
with the methods Congress required the State to follow before
leasing or selling the lands granted by the United States in the
New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 557. Because
the state court interpreted federal law, the Court addressed whether
the plaintiffs would have had standing had the action originally
been brought in federal court.
<P>
The Court noted that the general bar on federal taxpayer suits
announced in Frothingham does not necessarily apply to municipal
taxpayers &quot;if it has been shown that the 'peculiar relation
of the corporate taxpayer to the [municipal] corporation' makes
the taxpayer's interest in the application of municipal revenues
'direct and immediate.' &quot; ASARCO, 109 S.Ct. at 2043 (quoting
Frothingham, 262 U.S. at 486-87, 43 S.Ct. at 600-01) (alteration
in original).
<P>
The Court then noted that &quot;we have likened state taxpayers
to federal taxpayers, and thus we have refused to confer standing
upon a state taxpayer absent a showing of 'direct injury,' pecuniary
or otherwise.&quot; Id. (quoting Doremus, 342 U.S. at 434, 72
S.Ct. at 397). The Court concluded that the state taxpayers were
not entitled to standing because &quot;[t]he possibility that
taxpayers will receive any direct pecuniary relief from this lawsuit
is 'remote, fluctuating and uncertain,' as stated in Frothingham,
supra, and consequently the claimed injury is not 'likely to be
redressed by a favorable decision.' &quot; Id. (quoting Valley
Forge, 454 U.S. at 472, 102 S.Ct. at 758). (FN4)
<P>
After reviewing the reasoning in ASARCO, we conclude that we must
reject the Ninth Circuit's formulation of state taxpayer standing
because it equates state taxpayers with municipal taxpayers for
standing purposes. See Cammack, 932 F.2d at 770 (&quot;we conclude
that municipal taxpayer standing ... mirrors our threshold for
state taxpayer standing&quot;). Supreme Court jurisprudence indicates
that state taxpayers must be likened to federal taxpayers. Thus,
in addition to demonstrating that money was appropriated and spent
for an allegedly unlawful purpose, a state taxpayer must show
that a distinct and palpable injury resulted from the allegedly
illegal appropriation or expenditure. To show such an injury,
a state taxpayer must allege that he has suffered a monetary loss
due to the allegedly unlawful activity's effect on his tax liability.
(FN5)
<P>
Requiring a distinct and palpable injury for state taxpayers comports
with notions of federalism that are central to our system of government.
In the federal taxpayer standing cases, the Supreme Court has
restricted standing to prevent the judicial branch from intruding
into the provinces of the executive and the legislative branches.
We agree with the Sixth Circuit that [t]his separation of powers
concern has a counterpoint which should be considered when a state
taxpayer seeks to have a federal court enjoin the appropriation
and spending activities of a state government.
<P>
Considerations of federalism should signal the same caution in
these circumstances as concern for preservation of the proper
separation of powers in an &quot;all federal&quot; action.
<P>
Taub, 842 F.2d at 919. As the dissent in Hoohuli stated, *1403.
Doremus requires a state taxpayer plaintiff to demonstrate &quot;a
good-faith pocketbook action,&quot; which appears to parallel
the core article III injury-in-fact requirement. But when state
taxpayers attack state spending in federal court, another major
consideration operates: the integrity of our government's federalist
structure. Unnecessary or abstract decisions by federal courts
in cases where there is no case or controversy could unduly constrict
experimental state welfare legislation and undermine local self-determination.
<P>
Hoohuli, 741 F.2d at 1183 (Wallace, J., dissenting) (citations
omitted). In this case we have an especially compelling federalism
concern that dictates careful attention to the threshold case
or controversy requirement of standing. This case involves a citizen
initiative effort. The right to initiate legislation is a unique
state-created right. The allegations in this case suggest that
the elected chief executive officer of the state cannot take an
active official role in the state-created initiative process.
We can discern few areas so sacrosanct as protection of state
self-determination. The mere allegation of federal constitutional
violations cannot be allowed to clothe a state governmental decisionmaking
process with the ill-fitting garments of federal court scrutiny.
The &quot;direct injury&quot; requirement for standing that has
flourished since Frothingham and Doremus and that defines the
appropriate litigants in a state taxpayer case proves yet again
the wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution when they tied federal
court jurisdiction to the &quot;case or controversy&quot; requirement
and its attendant standing, ripeness, and mootness doctrines.
This case proves the continuing importance of judicial vigilance
over these time-tested doctrines. Absent such vigilance, we would
seriously undermine the constitutional commitment to federalism.
<P>
In this case, appellants allege that funds were appropriated and
spent for an unlawful purpose; however, they do not allege a distinct
and palpable injury that results from an increased tax liability.
Instead, appellants merely allege that the Governor's allegedly
illegal activities forced them to spend additional funds to offset
his efforts. &quot;[A] taxpayer alleges injury only by virtue
of his liability for taxes.&quot; Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 478,
102 S.Ct. at 762. Appellants have not alleged that they have suffered
any injury whatsoever as a result of paying increased taxes to
fund the Governor's activities. Because appellants have not alleged
an injury related to tax liability, they have not shown that they
have suffered a distinct and palpable injury as a result of the
allegedly illegal appropriations or expenditures. Thus, the individual
appellants do not satisfy the good-faith pocketbook requirement
of Doremus and are not entitled to standing as state taxpayers.
Likewise, the Colorado Taxpayers Union lacks associational standing
because its members do not have standing as taxpayers to sue in
their own right. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441.
<P>
Accordingly, both the individuals and the two associations lack
standing to challenge the alleged illegality of the Governor's
activities. The appeal is DISMISSED.
<P>
FN* The Honorable H. Dale Cook, Chief Judge, United States District
Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, sitting by designation.
<P>
FN1. The Supreme Court has permitted federal taxpayer standing
when plaintiffs challenge that the administration of congressional
grants violates the Establishment Clause. See Roemer v. Board
of Pub. Works, 426 U.S. 736, 744, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2343, 49 L.Ed.2d
179 (1976); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 735-36, 93 S.Ct. 2868,
2870-71, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973); Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S.
672, 676, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 2094, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971).
<P>
FN2. The dissent in Hoohuli argued that the taxpayers lacked standing
because they did not demonstrate how the Hawaiian plan increases
the taxes they pay. Id. at 1183 (Wallace, J., dissenting). The
dissent noted that if the taxpayers had shown a sufficient good-faith
pocketbook injury, an &quot;especially acute&quot; dual federalism
issue would arise. Id.
<P>
FN3. In Cammack v. Waihee, the Ninth Circuit found that the same
standing requirements that apply to state taxpayers also apply
to municipal taxpayers.
<P>
&quot;[W]e conclude that municipal taxpayer standing simply requires
the 'injury' of an allegedly improper expenditure of municipal
funds, and in this way mirrors our threshold for state taxpayer
standing.&quot; Id. at 770.
<P>
*1403_ FN4. Justice Kennedy garnered only four votes for the portion
of the opinion that deals with state taxpayer standing. See ASARCO,
109 S.Ct. at 2053 (Brennan, J., concurring). Because Justice Brennan
believed that it was unnecessary to address the state taxpayer
standing issue, he did not concur in this part of Justice Kennedy's
decision. Justice O'Connor did not take part in the decision.
<P>
FN5. In ASARCO, the Court explained why the plaintiff-taxpayers
lacked standing:
<P>
[The taxpayers] have simply asserted that the Arizona statute
governing mineral leases has &quot;deprived the school trust funds
of millions of dollars thereby resulting in unnecessarily higher
taxes.&quot; Complaint, p III. Even if the first part of that
assertion were correct, however, it is pure speculation whether
the lawsuit would result in any actual tax relief for [the taxpayers].

<P><BR>
	This summer the Congress is expected, finally, to take up the subject of
campaign finance reform. If you believe the interpretation put upon this
issue by most of the media and the permanent, self-designated &quot;reform&quot;
lobby, the only reason to oppose the proposals being made is the self-interest
of politicians and their major backers. But this simplistic view increasingly
is contradicted by the actual results of the reform measures we already
have adopted in the past 25 years.  In few other areas does the &quot;law
of unintended consequences&quot; operate so fiercely. <BR>
<BR>
	Most, though not all, campaign reform proposals in Washington, D.C., would
result in just the opposite of what reformers claim. They would reduce accountability
of politicians, increase the power of rich candidates and special interests,
decrease electoral competition and stifle the very free political speech
that the American Founders cared about most when they enshrined it  in the
First Amendment.<BR>
<BR>
	Arguably, we need more money in politics, not less, and more people giving,
not fewer, and that to protect free political speech, we need less government
regulation, not more.<BR>
<BR>
	Look at the Alice in Wonderland situation that has developed recently in
this year's presidential race. For the past couple of months, Bob Dole,
his poll numbers sagging, must have wondered why he ever agreed to accept
public matching money for his  presidential campaign. Under the law, a &quot;reform&quot;
measure of its time, Dole received federal matching grants from revenue
raised by the check-off account to which about 20 percent of the taxpayers
contribute on their income tax forms; but in return, he had to agree to
limit his campaign spending during the primary season. Now,  effectively
having secured the Republican nomination, he is only about $150,000 away
from his legal limit and the GOP convention is still months away. He cannot
legally raise and spend campaign dollars until after the Republican convention.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Bill Clinton, who had no primary opposition, was able to husband
most of his millions in federal matching money and can campaign to his heart's
delight. In fact, as an incumbent president he already enjoys enormous advantages,
garnering campaign-like publicity while simply performing as president.
At the same time, his allies in the AFL-CIO, who are able to operate outside
the campaign laws, are spending $35 million to defeat Dole and the Republicans.
The Democratic Party has been similarly focused all spring, placing TV ads
in crucial election states. The cumulative effect on Dole's numbers could
not have been good.<BR>
<BR>
	Dole is left now with the option of using the resources of the Republican
party, but even there he has to be careful. The Republican National Committee
plans to spend $20 million to boost its cause before the party convention,
but the White House and the Democratic party's lawyers are watching to see
if, for example, Dole or other Republicans at party-sponsored events target
Bill Clinton by name in a way that will allow a campaign ethics charge to
be lodged with the Federal Elections Commission. Both parties at this point
can talk about &quot;issues,&quot; the law appears to say, but cannot explicitly
support their candidate's election. On either this ground or the likelihood
of &quot;overspending,&quot; Dole could find himself in another of our country's
synthetic &quot;scandals,&quot; and a defendant before the Federal Elections
Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	Thus we see in this one situation, the potential for absurdity in modern
campaign &quot;reform&quot; legislation. One of the major party candidates
is nearly incapacitated and tempted to technical error by the rigidity of
federal law--in a dilemma not anticipated years ago by reformers. The parties
themselves can campaign, but only if they pretend otherwise. The special
interests, however, including besides the AFL-CIO,  a host of powers, such
as the National Rifle Association, the National Chamber of Commerce, the
trial lawyers and the pro-and anti-abortion groups, can spend unlimited
funds free of public scrutiny--so long as they don't use explicit words
urging a vote for their preferred candidates. And billionaire Ross Perot
(who claims to be a reformer, of all things) can spend as much as he likes,
and say whatever he likes, so long as he spends his own money.  Ralph Nader,
another potential third party presidential candidate who  claims &quot;reform&quot;
credentials, indicates that he may not release his income tax return, since
where he gets his money  is nobody's business.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Reform,&quot; you see, is for other people. For oneself it increasingly
is mostly a dandy way to get the tactical upper hand over one's ideological
foes. Specifically, it is a means to handicap accountable political parties
to the benefit of unaccountable special interests, to handicap challengers
to the benefit of incumbents, and to enable personally rich candidates to
place their competition at a disadvantage. At least, that is the way it
is working out.<BR>
<BR>
	Twenty five years ago, when the post-Watergate Federal Elections Campaign
Act was adopted, the Supreme Court  (in Buckley v. Valeo) allowed the law's
limits on contributions (a $1000 amount in federal elections that has never
been adjusted for inflation), but cited First Amendment free speech objections
to permit limits on spending for wealthy candidates, special interest groups
or candidates who decline to accept federal matching money in presidential
races. <BR>
<BR>
	On their own terms, therefore, the reformers wound up with  a lopsided
system that is shot through with unfair exceptions and contradictions. And
the results show it. Though reformers sought lower cost campaigns, campaign
spending levels, in constant dollars, have gone up threefold. The incumbency
advantage actually increased after the post-Watergate reforms were enacted;
even in 1994, 91.4 percent of incumbents who sought re-election were successful.
Where reformers wanted to reduce the influence of special interests, they
failed spectacularly. The best example is the creation of political action
committees (PACs) that collect voluntary contributions in a given industry
or civic organization. This was originally a  reform meant to replace straightforward
corporate support of candidates. Now the PACs themselves are under attack.
<BR>
<BR>
	Even if the Supreme Court had accepted the full dose of reform medicine
first advanced in law--controlling expenditures as well as contributions--we
probably would have been disappointed by the consequences. As Larry J. Sabato,
a campaign finance expert at the University of Virginia, has written, &quot;One
cannot dam the flow of political money in a society as free as ours. If
it's blocked in one area, it will simply find other channels...These alternative
means of influence are often obscured and unaccountable, eliminating visible
disclosure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, Sabato's reality check runs directly contrary to what reformers
and much of the public believe to be the case. They always imagine that
good clean election campaigns are right around the corner, if only we pass
a few more regulations. What we forget is the &quot;law of unintended consequences.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Take the &quot;Bi-partisan Clean Congress Act&quot; introduced in the U.S.
House by Republican Rep. Linda Smith of southwest Washington,  and several
other legislators--Rep. Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) and Rep. Chris Shays, (R-Conn.)--with
strong support from the permanent reform lobby, including Common Cause,
the League of Women Voters, Ross Perot and most of the liberal media (the
latter have lionized Rep. Smith, though they oppose nearly every other political
view she holds). This bill would ban PACs, curb out-of-state contributions
to Congressional candidates, and further limit spending by the political
parties. A companion measure in the Senate, sponsored by Senators Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.), John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-Minn.), would seek to
convince candidates to limit spending voluntarily by offering them free
or reduced TV advertising time and government-financed mailings, and penalizing
those who do not go along by giving their opponents even more government
campaign support. The Senate bill also would expand further the regulatory
powers of the Federal Elections Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	You can't blame them for trying. But how would it work out? Linda Smith
ran last time against an incumbent, Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, who received a
lot of out-of-state money and outspent Mrs. Smith, then the challenger,
two to one. But Linda Smith, a leading power among segments of the religious
right, had a well-organized power base that raised enough money to enable
her to get her message out. It would make political sense for her now, as
an incumbent, to entrench this advantage by limiting out-of-state contributions
and providing overall spending caps.<BR>
<BR>
	But consider the case of Rep. George Nethercutt of Spokane. As a challenger
in 1994 and facing mighty Speaker of the House Tom Foley, he found initial
fundraising very difficult. Even local Republicans were afraid of offending
a powerful incumbent Democrat. Nethercutt was a challenger who required
out-of-state support to get enough traction to make his race credible. <BR>
<BR>
	Thus, whether out-of-state contributions hurt or help incumbents depends
a great deal on the circumstances of a particular race. And the same goes
for efforts to keep a lid on personal spending. A challenger's only hope
against a well-known incumbent, especially if that officeholder enjoys media
 support, is to raise a large enough war chest to get his message out on
his own.  Says Bradley A. Smith, who teaches election law at Capital University
in Ohio, &quot;What is important is not who outspends whom, but that the
challenger spends enough to stimulate voter interest in the race...Efforts
to cap spending help entrench incumbents and so foster public frustration
with the system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
	The same also is true of contribution limits.  Little-known challengers
need to  raise large sums early if they  hope to win, and they usually cannot
raise such sums without getting large contributions from a few family members
and close friends. Contribution limits like those in the Smith and McCain
bills mainly help incumbents, people (like Smith) with an already organized
donor base, and the personally wealthy, who can contribute all they want.
One person's &quot;reform&quot; is thus another's restraint on fair competition
and voter choice.<BR>
<BR>
	A major flaw with the thinking of most reformers is the idea that there
is too much money in political campaigns now.  As Bradley Smith points out,
the total spent on all Congressional races in 1994, including primaries,
was $600 million, less than half the annual advertising budget of General
Motors, or about $3 per eligible voter--the amount of a video rental. It
is also false to think that the amount of money spent on campaigns is responsible
for  &quot;negative&quot; campaigning and attack ads on TV. There is no
evidence for this, nor for the conventional impression that expensive campaigns
always prevail. If the complaint is based on false assumptions, therefore,
it is not surprising that that it has bad consequences.<BR>
<BR>
	If we can all agree that we want ample political competition to assure
the voters choices, adequate airing of issues to provide voter's information
for making those choices and prevention of hidden influences, then a better
kind of reform might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
	First, raise the limit on personal contributions. In truth, there probably
should be no limit, so long as the money is disclosed. Personal donations
are far more disinterested than those of PACs, let alone the soft money
spending of special interests, that goes unreported.  Contribution limits
for individual donors have tilted the playing field to millionaires and
billionaires, who by court ruling, are burdened with no such restrictions.
As a compromise, at least raise the present contribution limit enough to
take account of 25 years of inflation; i.e., to $5,000.<BR>
<BR>
	Second, don't weaken the political parties, strengthen them. It is ridiculous
to try to limit or curtail their spending . They are the proper and historical
home of politics and the institutions of democracy that are most regulated
by political disclosure laws--in contrast to the court-protected  unions,
industry associations and special interest advocacy groups. Fortunately,
a Colorado case is about to be decided which could determine that money
parties spend on their candidates constitute an &quot;expenditure&quot;
under the law, not a &quot;contribution,&quot; and therefore, they, too,
are covered by the First Amendment's free speech clause. <BR>
<BR>
	Indeed, in Washington State, as a result of Initiative 134, we already
have reached a similar conclusion.<BR>
<BR>
	Third, if we are going to have strict disclosure laws, they should be applied
to special interest groups--including the reformer's own organizations--that
lobby the public on political issues.<BR>
<BR>
	Fourth, instead of trying to shrink spending on politics, which is wrongheaded,
and futile in any case, stimulate the ordinary citizen to participate more.
Nothing would go farther to liberate citizen politicians than expanded support
in the form of citizen campaign contributions. We can do this by offering
a tax deduction for all contributions up to the legal limit and a tax credit
for all those below a set figure; say, $50. Parties should be included,
as well as candidates.<BR>
<BR>
	Fifth, if the above is accomplished, it then would not hurt to limit PACs
further, and it will not be necessary to turn eventually to direct public
finance of political reform.<BR>
<BR>
	This kind of program suggestion is not unique. Variations of it recently
have been embraced by groups and individuals as diverse as the libertarian
CATO Institute and the liberal Center for the Study of the American Electorate,
Speaker Newt Gingrich and liberal columnist David Broder, the conservative
Wall Street Journal and the liberal Roll Call. They all have seen that what
we need now is not another round of reform, but, if you will, a reform of
the reforms already in place.<BR>
<BR>
	 Political freedom, after all,  is really an analog to economic freedom,
as well as its natural companion. Just as over-regulation can stifle the
economy and lead to government control, so too can over-regulation of politics.
Our object, therefore, should be to increase competition and free speech
in the political process.<BR>

R.A.V., Petitioner, v.
<P>
CITY OF ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA.
<P>
No. 90-7675.
<P>
Argued Dec. 4, 1991.
<P>
Decided June 22, 1992.
<P>
</center>
<P>
*2540
<P>
Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
After allegedly burning a cross on a black family's lawn, petitioner
R.A.V. was charged under, inter alia, the St. Paul, Minnesota,
Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, which prohibits the display of
a symbol which one knows or has reason to know &quot;arouses anger,
alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed,
religion or gender.&quot; The trial court dismissed this charge
on the ground that the ordinance was substantially overbroad and
impermissibly content-based, but the State Supreme Court reversed.
It rejected the overbreadth claim because the phrase &quot;arouses
anger, alarm or resentment in others&quot; had been construed
in earlier state cases to limit the ordinance's reach to &quot;fighting
words&quot; within the meaning of this Court's decision in Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed.
1031 a category of expression unprotected by the First Amendment.
The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly
content-based because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
governmental interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated
threats to public safety and order.
<P>
Held: The ordinance is facially invalid under the First Amendment.
Pp.
<P>
2542-2550.
<P>
(a) This Court is bound by the state court's construction of the
ordinance as reaching only expressions constituting &quot;fighting
words.&quot; However, R.A.V.'s request that the scope of the Chaplinsky
formulation be modified, thereby invalidating the ordinance as
substantially overbroad, need not be reached, since the ordinance
unconstitutionally prohibits speech on the basis of the subjects
the speech addresses. P. 2542.
<P>
(b) A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation,
and fighting words, may be regulated because of their constitutionally
proscribable content. However, these categories are not entirely
invisible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate
them based on hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonproscribable
message they contain. Thus the regulation of &quot;fighting words&quot;
may not be based on nonproscribable content. It may, however,
be underinclusive, addressing some offensive instances and leaving
other, equally offensive, ones alone, so long as the selective
prescription is not based on content, or there is no realistic
possibility that regulation of ideas is afoot. Pp. 2542-2547.
<P>
(c) The ordinance, even as narrowly construed by the State Supreme
Court, is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special
prohibitions on those speakers who express views on the disfavored
subjects of &quot;race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot;
At the same time, it permits displays containing abusive invective
if they are not addressed to those topics. Moreover, in its practical
operation the ordinance goes beyond mere content, to actual viewpoint,
discrimination. Displays containing &quot;fighting words&quot;
that do not invoke the disfavored subjects would seemingly be
useable ad libitum by those arguing in favor of racial, color,
etc. tolerance and equality, but not by their opponents. St. Paul's
desire to communicate to minority groups that it does not condone
the &quot;group hatred&quot; of bias-motivated speech does not
justify selectively silencing speech on the basis of its content.
Pp. 2547-2549.
<P>
(d) The content-based discrimination reflected in the ordinance
does not rest upon the very reasons why the particular class of
speech at issue is proscribable, it is not aimed only at the &quot;secondary
effects&quot; *2541 of speech within the meaning of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d
29, and it is not for any other reason the sort that does not
threaten censorship of ideas. In addition, the ordinance's content
discrimination is not justified on the ground that the ordinance
is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in ensuring
the basic human rights of groups historically discriminated against,
since an ordinance not limited to the favored topics would have
precisely the same beneficial effect. Pp. 2549-2550.

<P>
Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
In the predawn hours of June 21, 1990, petitioner and several
other teenagers allegedly assembled a crudely-made cross by taping
together broken chair legs. They then allegedly burned the cross
inside the fenced yard of a black family that lived across the
street from the house where petitioner was staying. Although this
conduct could have been punished under any of a number of laws,
(FN1) one of the two provisions under which respondent city of
St. Paul chose to charge petitioner (then a juvenile) was the
St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, St. Paul, Minn.Legis.Code
Sec. 292.02 (1990), which provides:
<P>
&quot;Whoever places on public or private property a symbol, object,
appellation, characterization or graffiti, including, but not
limited to, a burning cross or Nazi swastika, which one knows
or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment
in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender
commits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.&quot;
<P>
Petitioner moved to dismiss this count on the ground that the
St. Paul ordinance was substantially overbroad and impermissibly
content-based and therefore facially invalid under the First Amendment.
(FN2) The trial court granted this motion, but the Minnesota Supreme
Court reversed. That court rejected petitioner's overbreadth claim
because, as construed in prior Minnesota cases, see, e.g., In
re Welfare of S.L.J., 263 N.W.2d 412 (Minn.1978), the modifying
phrase &quot;arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others&quot;
limited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounts to
&quot;fighting words,&quot; i.e., &quot;conduct that itself inflicts
injury or tends to incite immediate violence ...,&quot; In re
Welfare of R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d 507, 510 (Minn.1991) (citing Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed.
1031 (1942)), and therefore the ordinance reached only expression
&quot;that the first amendment does not protect.&quot; 464 N.W.2d,
at 511. The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly
content-based because, in its view, &quot;the ordinance is a narrowly
tailored means toward accomplishing the compelling governmental
interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated *2542
threats to public safety and order.&quot; Ibid. We granted certiorari,
501 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2795, 115 L.Ed.2d 969 (1991).

In construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by the construction
given to it by the Minnesota court. Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 339, 106 S.Ct. 2968,
2975-2976, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.
747, 769, n. 24, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3361, n. 24, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113
(1982); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 895-896,
93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949). Accordingly, we accept the Minnesota Supreme
Court's authoritative statement that the ordinance reaches only
those expressions that constitute &quot;fighting words&quot; within
the meaning of Chaplinsky. 464 N.W.2d, at 510-511. Petitioner
and his amici urge us to modify the scope of the Chaplinsky formulation,
thereby invalidating the ordinance as &quot;substantially overbroad,&quot;
Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2914-2915,
37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). We find it unnecessary to consider this
issue. Assuming, arguendo, that all of the expression reached
by the ordinance is proscribable under the &quot;fighting words&quot;
doctrine, we nonetheless conclude that the ordinance is facially
unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise permitted speech
solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses. (FN3)
<P>
The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing
speech, see, e.g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 309-311,
60 S.Ct. 900, 905-906, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940), or even expressive
conduct, see, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 406, 109 S.Ct.
2533, 2540, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989), because of disapproval of
the ideas expressed. Content-based regulations are presumptively
invalid. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime
Victims Bd., 502 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, ---- -
----, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991) id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at
---- - ---- (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); Consolidated
Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 530,
536, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2332-2333, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980); Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289-2290,
33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). From 1791 to the present, however, our
society, like other free but civilized *2543 societies, has permitted
restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,
which are &quot;of such slight social value as a step to truth
that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct. at 762. We have recognized that
&quot;the freedom of speech&quot; referred to by the First Amendment
does not include a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.
See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304,
1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) (obscenity); Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343
U.S. 250, 72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952) (defamation); Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, supra, (&quot;fighting words&quot;); see generally
Simon &amp; Schuster, supra, 502 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at
---- (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Our decisions since
the 1960's have narrowed the scope of the traditional categorical
exceptions for defamation, see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974);
see generally Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 13-17,
110 S.Ct. 2695, ----, 111 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990), and for obscenity,
see Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d
419 (1973), but a limited categorical approach has remained an
important part of our First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
We have sometimes said that these categories of expression are
&quot;not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,&quot;
Roth, supra, 354 U.S., at 483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308; Beauharnais,
supra, 343 U.S., at 266, 72 S.Ct., at 735; Chaplinsky, supra,
315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769; or that the &quot;protection
of the First Amendment does not extend&quot; to them, Bose Corp.
v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 504,
104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984); Sable Communications
of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 124, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 2835,
106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989). Such statements must be taken in context,
however, and are no more literally true than is the occasionally
repeated shorthand characterizing obscenity &quot;as not being
speech at all,&quot; Sunstein, Pornography and the First Amendment,
1986 Duke L.J. 589, 615, n. 146. What they mean is that these
areas of speech can, consistently with the First Amendment, be
regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content
(obscenity, defamation, etc.)--not that they are categories of
speech entirely invisible to the Constitution, so that they may
be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to their
distinctively proscribable content. Thus, the government may proscribe
libel; but it may not make the further content discrimination
of proscribing only libel critical of the government. We recently
acknowledged this distinction in Ferber, 458 U.S., at 763, 102
S.Ct., at 3357-3358, where, in upholding New York's child pornography
law, we expressly recognized that there was no &quot;question
here of censoring a particular literary theme....&quot; See also
id., at 775, 102 S.Ct., at 3364 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (&quot;As
drafted, New York's statute does not attempt to suppress the communication
of particular ideas&quot;).
<P>
Our cases surely do not establish the proposition that the First
Amendment imposes no obstacle whatsoever to regulation of particular
instances of such proscribable expression, so that the government
&quot;may regulate [them] freely,&quot; post, at 2552 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment). That would mean that a city council
could enact an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene
works that contain criticism of the city government or, indeed,
that do not include endorsement of the city government. Such a
simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all approach to First Amendment
protection is at odds with common sense and with our jurisprudence
as well. (FN4) It is not true *2544 that &quot;fighting words&quot;
have at most a &quot;de minimis &quot; expressive content, ibid.,
or that their content is in all respects &quot;worthless and undeserving
of constitutional protection,&quot; post, at 2553; sometimes they
are quite expressive indeed. We have not said that they constitute
&quot;no part of the expression of ideas,&quot; but only that
they constitute &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas.&quot;
Chaplinsky, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769 (emphasis added).
<P>
The proposition that a particular instance of speech can be proscribable
on the basis of one feature (e.g., obscenity) but not on the basis
of another (e.g., opposition to the city government) is commonplace,
and has found application in many contexts. We have long held,
for example, that nonverbal expressive activity can be banned
because of the action it entails, but not because of the ideas
it expresses--so that burning a flag in violation of an ordinance
against outdoor fires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag
in violation of an ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not.
See Johnson, 491 U.S., at 406-407, 109 S.Ct., at 2540-2541. See
also Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. ----, ---- - ----,
111 S.Ct. 2456, 2460-2461, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (plurality);
id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2465-2466 (SCALIA, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (SOUTER,
J., concurring in judgment); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S.
367, 376-377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678-1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
Similarly, we have upheld reasonable &quot;time, place, or manner&quot;
restrictions, but only if they are &quot;justified without reference
to the content of the regulated speech.&quot; Ward v. Rock Against
Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2753-2754, 105 L.Ed.2d
661 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Clark
v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 298, 104
S.Ct. 3065, 3071, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984) (noting that the O'Brien
test differs little from the standard applied to time, place,
or manner restrictions). And just as the power to proscribe particular
speech on the basis of a noncontent element (e.g., noise) does
not entail the power to proscribe the same speech on the basis
of a content element; so also, the power to proscribe it on the
basis of one content element (e.g., obscenity) does not entail
the power to proscribe it on the basis of other content elements.
<P>
*2545 In other words, the exclusion of &quot;fighting words&quot;
from the scope of the First Amendment simply means that, for purposes
of that Amendment, the unprotected features of the words are,
despite their verbal character, essentially a &quot;nonspeech&quot;
element of communication. Fighting words are thus analogous to
a noisy sound truck: Each is, as Justice Frankfurter recognized,
a &quot;mode of speech,&quot; Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268,
282, 71 S.Ct. 325, 333, 95 L.Ed. 267 (1951) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring in result); both can be used to convey an idea; but
neither has, in and of itself, a claim upon the First Amendment.
As with the sound truck, however, so also with fighting words:
The government may not regulate use based on hostility--or favoritism--towards
the underlying message expressed. Compare Frisby v. Schultz, 487
U.S. 474, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988) (upholding, against
facial challenge, a content-neutral ban on targeted residential
picketing) with Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 100 S.Ct. 2286,
65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980) (invalidating a ban on residential picketing
that exempted labor picketing). (FN5)
<P>
The concurrences describe us as setting forth a new First Amendment
principle that prohibition of constitutionally proscribable speech
cannot be &quot;underinclusiv[e],&quot; post, at 2553 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment)--a First Amendment &quot;absolutism&quot;
whereby &quot;within a particular 'proscribable' category of expression,
... a government must either proscribe all speech or no speech
at all,&quot; post, at 2562 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).
That easy target is of the concurrences' own invention. In our
view, the First Amendment imposes not an &quot;underinclusiveness&quot;
limitation but a &quot;content discrimination&quot; limitation
upon a State's prohibition of proscribable speech. There is no
problem whatever, for example, with a State's prohibiting obscenity
(and other forms of proscribable expression) only in certain media
or markets, for although that prohibition would be &quot;underinclusive,&quot;
it would not discriminate on the basis of content. See, e.g.,
Sable Communications, 492 U.S., at 124-126, 109 S.Ct., at 2835-2836
(upholding 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223(b)(1) (1988), which prohibits obscene
telephone communications).
<P>
Even the prohibition against content discrimination that we assert
the First Amendment requires is not absolute. It applies differently
in the context of proscribable speech than in the area of fully
protected speech. The rationale of the general prohibition, after
all, is that content discrimination &quot;rais[es] the specter
that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints
from the marketplace,&quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S., at
----, 112 S.Ct., at 508; Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S. ----, ----,
111 S.Ct. 1438, 1444, 113 L.Ed.2d 494 (1991); FCC v. League of
Women Voters of California, 468 U.S. 364, 383-384, 104 S.Ct. 3106,
3119-3120, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984); Consolidated Edison Co., 447
U.S., at 536, 100 S.Ct., at 2333; Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,
408 U.S., at 95-98, 92 S.Ct., at 2289-2292. But content discrimination
among various instances of a class of proscribable speech often
does not pose this threat.
<P>
When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely
of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable,
no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists.
Such a reason, having been adjudged neutral enough to support
exclusion of the entire class of speech from First Amendment protection,
is also neutral enough to form the *2546 basis of distinction
within the class. To illustrate: A State might choose to prohibit
only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its
prurience--i.e., that which involves the most lascivious displays
of sexual activity. But it may not prohibit, for example, only
that obscenity which includes offensive political messages. See
Kucharek v. Hanaway, 902 F.2d 513, 517 (CA7 1990), cert. denied,
498 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 713, 112 L.Ed.2d 702 (1991). And the
Federal Government can criminalize only those threats of violence
that are directed against the President, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871--since
the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment
(protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption
that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened
violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person
of the President. See Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707,
89 S.Ct. 1399, 1401, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (upholding the facial
validity of Sec. 871 because of the &quot;overwhelmin[g] interest
in protecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowing
him to perform his duties without interference from threats of
physical violence&quot;). But the Federal Government may not criminalize
only those threats against the President that mention his policy
on aid to inner cities. And to take a final example (one mentioned
by Justice STEVENS, post, at 2563-2564), a State may choose to
regulate price advertising in one industry but not in others,
because the risk of fraud (one of the characteristics of commercial
speech that justifies depriving it of full First Amendment protection,
see Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,
Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 771-772, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1830-1831, 48 L.Ed.2d
346 (1976)) is in its view greater there. Cf. Morales v. Trans
World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d
157 (1992) (state regulation of airline advertising); Ohralik
v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d
444 (1978) (state regulation of lawyer advertising). But a State
may not prohibit only that commercial advertising that depicts
men in a demeaning fashion, see, e.g., L.A. Times, Aug. 8, 1989,
section 4, p. 6, col. 1.
<P>
Another valid basis for according differential treatment to even
a content-defined subclass of proscribable speech is that the
subclass happens to be associated with particular &quot;secondary
effects&quot; of the speech, so that the regulation is &quot;justified
without reference to the content of the ... speech,&quot; Renton
v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 48, 106 S.Ct. 925, 929,
89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986) (quoting, with emphasis, Virginia Pharmacy
Bd., supra, 425 U.S., at 771, 96 S.Ct., at 1830); see also Young
v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 71, n. 34, 96 S.Ct.
2440, 2453, n. 34, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality); id., at
80-82, 96 S.Ct., at 2457-2458 (Powell, J., concurring);
<P>
Barnes, 501 U.S., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2469-2471 (SOUTER,
J., concurring in judgment). A State could, for example, permit
all obscene live performances except those involving minors. Moreover,
since words can in some circumstances violate laws directed not
against speech but against conduct (a law against treason, for
example, is violated by telling the enemy the nation's defense
secrets), a particular content-based subcategory of a proscribable
class of speech can be swept up incidentally within the reach
of a statute directed at conduct rather than speech. See id.,
at ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2460 (plurality); id., at ---- - ----,
111 S.Ct., at 2465-2466 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (SOUTER, J., concurring
in judgment); FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U.S.
411, 425-432, 110 S.Ct. 768, 776-780, 107 L.Ed.2d 851 (1990);
O'Brien, 391 U.S., at 376-377, 88 S.Ct., at 1678-1679. Thus, for
example, sexually derogatory &quot;fighting words,&quot; among
other words, may produce a violation of Title VII's general prohibition
against sexual discrimination in employment practices, 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 2000e-2; 29 CFR Sec. 1604.11 (1991). See also 18 U.S.C. Sec.
242; 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981, 1982. Where the government does not
target conduct on the *2547 basis of its expressive content, acts
are not shielded from regulation merely because they express a
discriminatory idea or philosophy.
<P>
These bases for distinction refute the proposition that the selectivity
of the restriction is &quot;even arguably 'conditioned upon the
sovereign's agreement with what a speaker may intend to say.'
&quot; Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 555, 101 S.Ct.
2882, 2917, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in
part) (citation omitted). There may be other such bases as well.
Indeed, to validate such selectivity (where totally proscribable
speech is at issue) it may not even be necessary to identify any
particular &quot;neutral&quot; basis, so long as the nature of
the content discrimination is such that there is no realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot. (We cannot
think of any First Amendment interest that would stand in the
way of a State's prohibiting only those obscene motion pictures
with blue-eyed actresses.) Save for that limitation, the regulation
of &quot;fighting words,&quot; like the regulation of noisy speech,
may address some offensive instances and leave other, equally
offensive, instances alone. See Posadas de Puerto Rico, 478 U.S.,
at 342-343, 106 S.Ct., at 2977-2978. (FN6)
<P>
II
<P>
Applying these principles to the St. Paul ordinance, we conclude
that, even as narrowly construed by the Minnesota Supreme Court,
the ordinance is facially unconstitutional. Although the phrase
in the ordinance, &quot;arouses anger, alarm or resentment in
others,&quot; has been limited by the Minnesota Supreme Court's
construction to reach only those symbols or displays that amount
to &quot;fighting words,&quot; the remaining, unmodified terms
make clear that the ordinance applies only to &quot;fighting words&quot;
that insult, or provoke violence, &quot;on the basis of race,
color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; Displays containing abusive
invective, no matter how vicious or severe, are permissible unless
they are addressed to one of the specified disfavored topics.
Those who wish to use &quot;fighting words&quot; in connection
with other ideas--to express hostility, for example, on the basis
of political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality--are
not covered. The First Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose
special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored
subjects. See Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S., at ---- - ----,
112 S.Ct., at ---- - ----; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v.
Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 229-230, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1727-1728, 95
L.Ed.2d 209 (1987).
<P>
In its practical operation, moreover, the ordinance goes even
beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.
Displays containing some words--odious racial epithets, for example--would
be prohibited to proponents of all views. But &quot;fighting words&quot;
that do not themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or
*2548 gender--aspersions upon a person's mother, for example--would
seemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of those arguing
in favor of racial, color, etc. tolerance and equality, but could
not be used by that speaker's opponents. One could hold up a sign
saying, for example, that all &quot;anti-Catholic bigots&quot;
are misbegotten; but not that all &quot;papists&quot; are, for
that would insult and provoke violence &quot;on the basis of religion.&quot;
St. Paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate
to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis
of Queensbury Rules.
<P>
What we have here, it must be emphasized, is not a prohibition
of fighting words that are directed at certain persons or groups
(which would be facially valid if it met the requirements of the
Equal Protection Clause); but rather, a prohibition of fighting
words that contain (as the Minnesota Supreme Court repeatedly
emphasized) messages of &quot;bias-motivated&quot; hatred and
in particular, as applied to this case, messages &quot;based on
virulent notions of racial supremacy.&quot; 464 N.W.2d, at 508,
511. One must wholeheartedly agree with the Minnesota Supreme
Court that &quot;[i]t is the responsibility, even the obligation,
of diverse communities to confront such notions in whatever form
they appear,&quot; ibid., but the manner of that confrontation
cannot consist of selective limitations upon speech. St. Paul's
brief asserts that a general &quot;fighting words&quot; law would
not meet the city's needs because only a content-specific measure
can communicate to minority groups that the &quot;group hatred&quot;
aspect of such speech &quot;is not condoned by the majority.&quot;
Brief for Respondent 25. The point of the First Amendment is that
majority preferences must be expressed in some fashion other than
silencing speech on the basis of its content.
<P>
Despite the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court and St. Paul
acknowledge that the ordinance is directed at expression of group
hatred, Justice STEVENS suggests that this &quot;fundamentally
misreads&quot; the ordinance. Post, at 2570. It is directed, he
claims, not to speech of a particular content, but to particular
&quot;injur[ies]&quot; that are &quot;qualitatively different&quot;
from other injuries. Post, at 2565. This is word-play. What makes
the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc. produced by violation
of this ordinance distinct from the anger, fear, sense of dishonor,
etc. produced by other fighting words is nothing other than the
fact that it is caused by a distinctive idea, conveyed by a distinctive
message. The First Amendment cannot be evaded that easily. It
is obvious that the symbols which will arouse &quot;anger, alarm
or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion
or gender&quot; are those symbols that communicate a message of
hostility based on one of these characteristics. St. Paul concedes
in its brief that the ordinance applies only to &quot;racial,
religious, or gender-specific symbols&quot; such as &quot;a burning
cross, Nazi swastika or other instrumentality of like import.&quot;
Brief for Respondent 8. Indeed, St. Paul argued in the Juvenile
Court that &quot;[t]he burning of a cross does express a message
and it is, in fact, the content of that message which the St.
Paul Ordinance attempts to legislate.&quot; Memorandum from the
Ramsey County Attorney to the Honorable Charles A. Flinn, Jr.,
dated July 13, 1990, in In re Welfare of R.A.V., No. 89-D-1231
(Ramsey Cty. Juvenile Ct.), p. 1, reprinted in App. to Brief for
Petitioner C-1.
<P>
The content-based discrimination reflected in the St. Paul ordinance
comes within neither any of the specific exceptions to the First
Amendment prohibition we discussed earlier, nor within a more
general exception for content discrimination that does not threaten
censorship of ideas. It assuredly does not fall within the exception
for content discrimination based on the very reasons why the particular
class of speech at issue (here, fighting words) is proscribable.
As explained earlier, see supra, at 2545, the reason why fighting
words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First
Amendment is not that their content communicates *2549 any particular
idea, but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable
(and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the
speaker wishes to convey. St. Paul has not singled out an especially
offensive mode of expression--it has not, for example, selected
for prohibition only those fighting words that communicate ideas
in a threatening (as opposed to a merely obnoxious) manner. Rather,
it has proscribed fighting words of whatever manner that communicate
messages of racial, gender, or religious intolerance. Selectivity
of this sort creates the possibility that the city is seeking
to handicap the expression of particular ideas. That possibility
would alone be enough to render the ordinance presumptively invalid,
but St. Paul's comments and concessions in this case elevate the
possibility to a certainty.
<P>
St. Paul argues that the ordinance comes within another of the
specific exceptions we mentioned, the one that allows content
discrimination aimed only at the &quot;secondary effects&quot;
of the speech, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S.
41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986). According to St. Paul,
the ordinance is intended, &quot;not to impact on [sic ] the right
of free expression of the accused,&quot; but rather to &quot;protect
against the victimization of a person or persons who are particularly
vulnerable because of their membership in a group that historically
has been discriminated against.&quot; Brief for Respondent 28.
Even assuming that an ordinance that completely proscribes, rather
than merely regulates, a specified category of speech can ever
be considered to be directed only to the secondary effects of
such speech, it is clear that the St. Paul ordinance is not directed
to secondary effects within the meaning of Renton. As we said
in Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct.
<P>
1157, 99 L.Ed.2d 333 (1988), &quot;[l]isteners' reactions to speech
are not the type of 'secondary effects' we referred to in Renton.&quot;
Id., at 321, 108 S.Ct., at 1163-1164. &quot;The emotive impact
of speech on its audience is not a 'secondary effect.' &quot;
Ibid. See also id., at 334, 108 S.Ct., at 1170-1171. (opinion
of Brennan, J.). (FN7)
<P>
It hardly needs discussion that the ordinance does not fall within
some more general exception permitting all selectivity that for
any reason is beyond the suspicion of official suppression of
ideas. The statements of St. Paul in this very case afford ample
basis for, if not full confirmation of, that suspicion.
<P>
Finally, St. Paul and its amici defend the conclusion of the Minnesota
Supreme Court that, even if the ordinance regulates expression
based on hostility towards its protected ideological content,
this discrimination is nonetheless justified because it is narrowly
tailored to serve compelling state interests. Specifically, they
assert that the ordinance helps to ensure the basic human rights
of members of groups that have historically been subjected to
discrimination, including the right of such group members to live
in peace where they wish. We do not doubt that these interests
are compelling, and that the ordinance can be said to promote
them. But the &quot;danger of censorship&quot; presented by a
facially content-based statute, Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S.
----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1438, 1444, 113 L.Ed.2d 494 (1991), requires
that that weapon be employed only where it is &quot;necessary
to serve the asserted [compelling] interest,&quot; Burson v. Freeman,
504 *2550 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d 5
(1992) (plurality) (emphasis added); Perry Education Assn. v.
Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948,
954-955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). The existence of adequate content-neutral
alternatives thus &quot;undercut[s] significantly&quot; any defense
of such a statute, Boos v. Barry, supra, 485 U.S., at 329, 108
S.Ct., at 1168, casting considerable doubt on the government's
protestations that &quot;the asserted justification is in fact
an accurate description of the purpose and effect of the law,&quot;
Burson, supra, 504 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1859 (KENNEDY,
J., concurring). See Boos, supra, 485 U.S., at 324-329, 108 S.Ct.,
at 1165-1168; cf. Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota
Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 586-587, 103 S.Ct. 1365, 1372-1373,
75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983). The dispositive question in this case,
therefore, is whether content discrimination is reasonably necessary
to achieve St. Paul's compelling interests; it plainly is not.
An ordinance not limited to the favored topics, for example, would
have precisely the same beneficial effect. In fact the only interest
distinctively served by the content limitation is that of displaying
the city council's special hostility towards the particular biases
thus singled out. (FN8) That is precisely what the First Amendment
forbids. The politicians of St. Paul are entitled to express that
hostility--but not through the means of imposing unique limitations
upon speakers who (however benightedly) disagree.
<P>
* * *
<P>
Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross
in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient
means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding
the First Amendment to the fire.
<P>
The judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court is reversed, and the
case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice O'CONNOR
join, and with whom Justice STEVENS joins except as to Part I(A),
concurring in the judgment.
<P>
I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme
Court should be reversed. However, our agreement ends there.
<P>
This case could easily be decided within the contours of established
First Amendment law by holding, as petitioner argues, that the
St. Paul ordinance is fatally overbroad because it criminalizes
not only unprotected expression but expression protected by the
First Amendment. See Part II, infra. Instead, &quot;find[ing]
it unnecessary&quot; to consider the questions upon which we granted
review, (FN1) ante, at 2542, the *2551 Court holds the ordinance
facially unconstitutional on a ground that was never presented
to the Minnesota Supreme Court, a ground that has not been briefed
by the parties before this Court, a ground that requires serious
departures from the teaching of prior cases and is inconsistent
with the plurality opinion in Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992), which was joined by two
of the five Justices in the majority in the present case.
<P>
This Court ordinarily is not so eager to abandon its precedents.
Twice within the past month, the Court has declined to overturn
longstanding but controversial decisions on questions of constitutional
law. See Allied Signal, Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation,
504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2251, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1992); Quill
Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1904, 119 L.Ed.2d
91 (1992). In each case, we had the benefit of full briefing on
the critical issue, so that the parties and amici had the opportunity
to apprise us of the impact of a change in the law. And in each
case, the Court declined to abandon its precedents, invoking the
principle of stare decisis. Allied Signal, Inc., supra, --- U.S.,
at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2261;
<P>
Quill Corp., supra, --- U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1915-1916.
<P>
But in the present case, the majority casts aside long-established
First Amendment doctrine without the benefit of briefing and adopts
an untried theory. This is hardly a judicious way of proceeding,
and the Court's reasoning in reaching its result is transparently
wrong.
<P>
I
<P>
A
<P>
This Court's decisions have plainly stated that expression falling
within certain limited categories so lacks the values the First
Amendment was designed to protect that the Constitution affords
no protection to that expression. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942), made the point
in the clearest possible terms:
<P>
&quot;There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise
<P>
any Constitutional problem.... It has been well observed that
such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any
benefit that may be *2552 derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Id., at 571-572,
62 S.Ct., at 769.
<P>
See also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,
466 U.S. 485, 504, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984)
(citing Chaplinsky ).
<P>
Thus, as the majority concedes, see ante, at 2543, this Court
has long held certain discrete categories of expression to be
proscribable on the basis of their content. For instance, the
Court has held that the individual who falsely shouts &quot;fire&quot;
in a crowded theatre may not claim the protection of the First
Amendment. Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct.
247, 249, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919). The Court has concluded that neither
child pornography, nor obscenity, is protected by the First Amendment.
New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 764, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3358, 73
L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 20, 93
S.Ct. 2607, 2612, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973); Roth v. United States,
354 U.S. 476, 484-485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308-1309, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498
(1957). And the Court has observed that, &quot;[l]eaving aside
the special considerations when public officials [and public figures]
are the target, a libelous publication is not protected by the
Constitution.&quot; Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763, 102 S.Ct.,
at 3358 (citations omitted).
<P>
All of these categories are content based. But the Court has held
that First mendment does not apply to them because their expressive
content is worthless or of de minimis value to society. Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769. We have not
departed from this principle, emphasizing repeatedly that, &quot;within
the confines of [these] given classification[s], the evil to be
restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests,
if any, at stake, that no process of case-by-case adjudication
is required.&quot;
<P>
Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359;
Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 819, 95 S.Ct. 2222, 2231, 44
L.Ed.2d 600 (1975). This categorical approach has provided a principled
and narrowly focused means for distinguishing between expression
that the government may regulate freely and that which it may
regulate on the basis of content only upon a showing of compelling
need. (FN2)
<P>
Today, however, the Court announces that earlier Courts did not
mean their repeated statements that certain categories of expression
are &quot;not within the area of constitutionally protected speech.&quot;
Roth, supra, 354 U.S., at 483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308. See ante, at
2543, citing Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 266, 72 S.Ct.
725, 735, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952); Chaplinsky, supra, 315 U.S., at
571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769; Bose Corp., supra, 466 U.S., at
504, 104 S.Ct., at 1961; Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.
FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 124, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 2835, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989).
The present Court submits that such clear statements &quot;must
be taken in context&quot; and are not &quot;literally true.&quot;
Ante, at 2543.
<P>
To the contrary, those statements meant precisely what they said:
The categorical approach is a firmly entrenched part of our First
Amendment jurisprudence. Indeed, the Court in Roth reviewed the
guarantees of freedom of expression in effect at the time of the
ratification of the Constitution and concluded, &quot;[i]n light
of this history, it is apparent that the unconditional phrasing
of the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance.&quot;
354 U.S., at 482-483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308.
<P>
In its decision today, the Court points to &quot;[n]othing ...
in this Court's precedents warrant[ing] disregard of this longstanding
tradition.&quot; Burson, 504 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1860
(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Allied Signal, Inc., supra,
*2553 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2261. Nevertheless, the majority
holds that the First Amendment protects those narrow categories
of expression long held to be undeserving of First Amendment protection--at
least to the extent that lawmakers may not regulate some fighting
words more strictly than others because of their content. The
Court announces that such content-based distinctions violate the
First Amendment because &quot;the government may not regulate
use based on hostility--or favoritism--towards the underlying
message expressed.&quot; Ante, at 2545. Should the government
want to criminalize certain fighting words, the Court now requires
it to criminalize all fighting words.
<P>
To borrow a phrase, &quot;Such a simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all
approach to First Amendment protection is at odds with common
sense and with our jurisprudence as well.&quot; Ante, at 2543.
It is inconsistent to hold that the government may proscribe an
entire category of speech because the content of that speech is
evil, Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359;
but that the government may not treat a subset of that category
differently without violating the First Amendment; the content
of the subset is by definition worthless and undeserving of constitutional
protection.
<P>
The majority's observation that fighting words are &quot;quite
expressive indeed,&quot; ante, at 2544, is no answer. Fighting
words are not a means of exchanging views, rallying supporters,
or registering a protest; they are directed against individuals
to provoke violence or to inflict injury. Chaplinsky, 315 U.S.,
at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769. Therefore, a ban on all fighting words
or on a subset of the fighting words category would restrict only
the social evil of hate speech, without creating the danger of
driving viewpoints from the marketplace. See ante, at 2545.
<P>
Therefore, the Court's insistence on inventing its brand of First
Amendment underinclusiveness puzzles me. (FN3) The overbreadth
doctrine has the redeeming virtue of attempting to avoid the chilling
of protected expression, Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601,
612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973); Osborne v. Ohio,
495 U.S. 103, 112, n. 8, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 1697, n. 8, 109 L.Ed.2d
98 (1990); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 503,
105 S.Ct. 2794, 2801, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985); Ferber, supra, 458
U.S., at 772, 102 S.Ct., at 3362, but the Court's new &quot;underbreadth&quot;
creation serves no desirable function. Instead, it permits, indeed
invites, the continuation of expressive conduct that in this case
is evil and worthless in First Amendment terms, see Ferber, supra,
at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359; Chaplinsky, supra, 315 U.S.,
at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769, until the city of St. Paul cures
the underbreadth by adding to its ordinance a catch-all phrase
such as &quot;and all other fighting words that may constitutionally
be subject to this ordinance.&quot;
<P>
Any contribution of this holding to First Amendment jurisprudence
is surely a negative one, since it necessarily signals that expressions
of violence, such as the message of intimidation and racial hatred
conveyed by burning a cross on someone's lawn, are of sufficient
value to outweigh the social interest in order and morality that
has traditionally placed such fighting words outside the First
Amendment. (FN4) Indeed, by characterizing fighting words as a
form of &quot;debate,&quot; ante, at 2548, the majority *2554
legitimates hate speech as a form of public discussion.
<P>
Furthermore, the Court obscures the line between speech that could
be regulated freely on the basis of content (i.e., the narrow
categories of expression falling outside the First Amendment)
and that which could be regulated on the basis of content only
upon a showing of a compelling state interest (i.e., all remaining
expression). By placing fighting words, which the Court has long
held to be valueless, on at least equal constitutional footing
with political discourse and other forms of speech that we have
deemed to have the greatest social value, the majority devalues
the latter category. See Burson v. Freeman, supra, --- at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1849-1850; Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic
Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 222-223, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 1019-1020,
103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).
<P>
B
<P>
In a second break with precedent, the Court refuses to sustain
the ordinance even though it would survive under the strict scrutiny
applicable to other protected expression. Assuming, arguendo,
that the St. Paul ordinance is a content-based regulation of protected
expression, it nevertheless would pass First Amendment review
under settled law upon a showing that the regulation &quot; 'is
necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly
drawn to achieve that end.' &quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.
v. New York Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct.
501, 509, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991) (quoting Arkansas Writers' Project,
Inc., v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 231, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1728, 95
L.Ed.2d 209 (1987)). St. Paul has urged that its ordinance, in
the words of the majority, &quot;helps to ensure the basic human
rights of members of groups that have historically been subjected
to discrimination....&quot; Ante, at ----. The Court expressly
concedes that this interest is compelling and is promoted by the
ordinance. Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court treats strict scrutiny
analysis as irrelevant to the constitutionality of the legislation:
<P>
&quot;The dispositive question ... is whether content discrimination
is reasonably necessary in order to achieve St. Paul's compelling
interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not limited to the
favored topics would have precisely the same beneficial effect.&quot;
Ibid.
<P>
Under the majority's view, a narrowly drawn, content-based ordinance
could never pass constitutional muster if the object of that legislation
could be accomplished by banning a wider category of speech. This
appears to be a general renunciation of strict scrutiny review,
a fundamental tool of First Amendment analysis. (FN5)
<P>
This abandonment of the doctrine is inexplicable in light of our
decision in Burson v. Freeman, supra, which was handed down just
a month ago. (FN6) In Burson, seven *2555 of the eight participating
members of the Court agreed that the strict scrutiny standard
applied in a case involving a First Amendment challenge to a content-based
statute. See id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1851; id., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 1848 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). (FN7) The statute at
issue prohibited the solicitation of votes and the display or
distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance
to a polling place. The plurality concluded that the legislation
survived strict scrutiny because the State had asserted a compelling
interest in regulating electioneering near polling places and
because the statute at issue was narrowly tailored to accomplish
that goal. Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856-1857.
<P>
Significantly, the statute in Burson did not proscribe all speech
near polling places; it restricted only political speech. Id.,
at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1850. The Burson plurality, which included
THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY, concluded that the distinction
between types of speech required application of strict scrutiny,
but it squarely rejected the proposition that the legislation
failed First Amendment review because it could have been drafted
in broader, content-neutral terms:
<P>
&quot;States adopt laws to address the problems that confront
them.
<P>
The First Amendment does not require States to regulate for problems
that do not exist.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856 (emphasis
added).
<P>
This reasoning is in direct conflict with the majority's analysis
in the present case, which leaves two options to lawmakers attempting
to regulate expressions of violence: (1) enact a sweeping prohibition
on an entire class of speech (thereby requiring &quot;regulat[ion]
for problems that do not exist); or (2) not legislate at all.
<P>
Had the analysis adopted by the majority in the present case been
applied in Burson, the challenged election law would have failed
constitutional review, for its content-based distinction between
political and nonpolitical speech could not have been characterized
as &quot;reasonably necessary,&quot; ante, at 2550, to achieve
the State's interest in regulating polling place premises. (FN8)
<P>
As with its rejection of the Court's categorical analysis, the
majority offers no reasoned basis for discarding our firmly established
strict scrutiny analysis at this time. The majority appears to
believe that its doctrinal revisionism is necessary to prevent
our elected lawmakers from prohibiting libel against members of
one political party but not another and from enacting similarly
preposterous laws. Ante, at 2543. The majority is misguided.
<P>
Although the First Amendment does not apply to categories of unprotected
speech, such as fighting words, the Equal Protection Clause requires
that the regulation of unprotected speech be rationally related
to a legitimate government interest. A defamation statute that
drew distinctions on the basis of political affiliation or &quot;an
ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene works that contain
criticism of the *2556 city government,&quot; ante, at 2543, would
unquestionably fail rational basis review. (FN9)
<P>
Turning to the St. Paul ordinance and assuming arguendo, as the
majority does, that the ordinance is not constitutionally overbroad
(but see Part II, infra ), there is no question that it would
pass equal protection review. The ordinance proscribes a subset
of &quot;fighting words,&quot; those that injure &quot;on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; This selective
regulation reflects the City's judgment that harms based on race,
color, creed, religion, or gender are more pressing public concerns
than the harms caused by other fighting words. In light of our
Nation's long and painful experience with discrimination, this
determination is plainly reasonable. Indeed, as the majority concedes,
the interest is compelling. Ante, at 2549.
<P>
C
<P>
The Court has patched up its argument with an apparently nonexhaustive
list of ad hoc exceptions, in what can be viewed either as an
attempt to confine the effects of its decision to the facts of
this case, see post, at 2560-2561 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in
judgment), or as an effort to anticipate some of the questions
that will arise from its radical revision of First Amendment law.
<P>
For instance, if the majority were to give general application
to the rule on which it decides this case, today's decision would
call into question the
<P>
constitutionality of the statute making it illegal to threaten
the life of the President. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871. See Watts v. United
States, 394 U.S. 705, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (per
curiam ). Surely, this statute, by singling out certain threats,
incorporates a content-based distinction; it indicates that the
Government especially disfavors threats against the President
as opposed to threats against all others. (FN10) See ante, at
2547. But because the Government could prohibit all threats and
not just those directed against the President, under the Court's
theory, the compelling reasons justifying the enactment of special
legislation to safeguard the President would be irrelevant, and
the statute would fail First Amendment review.
<P>
To save the statute, the majority has engrafted the following
exception onto its newly announced First Amendment rule: Content-based
distinctions may be drawn within an unprotected category of speech
if the basis for the distinctions is &quot;the very reason the
entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.&quot; Ante, at
2545. Thus, the argument goes, the statute making it illegal to
threaten the life of the President is constitutional, &quot;since
the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment
(protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption
that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened
violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person
of the President.&quot; Ante, at 2546.
<P>
The exception swallows the majority's rule. Certainly, it should
apply to the St. Paul ordinance, since &quot;the reasons why [fighting
words] are outside the First Amendment ... have special force
when applied to [groups that have historically been subjected
to discrimination].&quot;
<P>
To avoid the result of its own analysis, the Court suggests that
fighting words are *2557 simply a mode of communication, rather
than a content-based category, and that the St. Paul ordinance
has not singled out a particularly objectionable mode of communication.
Ante, at 2545, 2548. Again, the majority confuses the issue. A
prohibition on fighting words is not a time, place, or manner
restriction; it is a ban on a class of speech that conveys an
overriding message of personal injury and imminent violence, Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769, a message that is at
its ugliest when directed against groups that have long been the
targets of discrimination. Accordingly, the ordinance falls within
the first exception to the majority's theory.
<P>
As its second exception, the Court posits that certain content-based
regulations will survive under the new regime if the regulated
subclass &quot;happens to be associated with particular 'secondary
effects' of the speech ...,&quot; ante, at 2546, which the majority
treats as encompassing instances in which &quot;words can ...
violate laws directed not against speech but against conduct ...&quot;
Ante, at 2546. (FN11) Again, there is a simple explanation for
the Court's eagerness to craft an exception to its new First Amendment
rule:
<P>
Under the general rule the Court applies in this case, Title VII
hostile work environment claims would suddenly be unconstitutional.
<P>
Title VII makes it unlawful to discriminate &quot;because of [an]
individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,&quot;
42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(a)(1), and the regulations covering hostile
workplace claims forbid &quot;sexual harassment,&quot; which includes
&quot;[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors,
and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature&quot;
which creates &quot;an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working
environment.&quot; 29 CFR Sec.
<P>
1604.11(a) (1991). The regulation does not prohibit workplace
harassment generally; it focuses on what the majority would characterize
as the &quot;disfavored topi[c]&quot; of sexual harassment. Ante,
at 2547. In this way, Title VII is similar to the St. Paul ordinance
that the majority condemns because it &quot;impose[s] special
prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored
subjects.&quot; Ibid. Under the broad principle the Court uses
to decide the present case, hostile work environment claims based
on sexual harassment should fail First Amendment review; because
a general ban on harassment in the workplace would cover the problem
of sexual harassment, any attempt to proscribe the subcategory
of sexually harassing expression would violate the First Amendment.
<P>
Hence, the majority's second exception, which the Court indicates
would insulate a Title VII hostile work environment claim from
an underinclusiveness challenge because &quot;sexually derogatory
'fighting words' ... may produce a violation of Title VII's general
prohibition against sexual discrimination in employment practices.&quot;
Ante, at 2546. But application of this exception to a hostile
work environment claim does not hold up under close examination.
<P>
First, the hostile work environment regulation is not keyed to
the presence or absence of an economic quid pro quo, Meritor Savings
Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d
49 (1986), but to the impact of the speech on the victimized worker.
Consequently, the regulation would no more fall within a secondary
effects exception than does the St. Paul ordinance. Ante, at 2549.
Second, the majority's focus on the statute's general prohibition
on discrimination glosses over the language of the specific regulation
governing hostile working environment, which reaches beyond any
&quot;incidental&quot; effect on speech. United States v. O'Brien,
391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
If the relationship between *2558 the broader statute and specific
regulation is sufficient to bring the Title VII regulation within
O'Brien, then all St. Paul need do to bring its ordinance within
this exception is to add some prefatory language concerning discrimination
generally.
<P>
As the third exception to the Court's theory for deciding this
case, the majority concocts a catchall exclusion to protect against
unforeseen problems, a concern that is heightened here given the
lack of briefing on the majority's decisional theory. This final
exception would apply in cases in which &quot;there is no realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.&quot;
Ante, at 2547. As I have demonstrated, this case does not concern
the official suppression of ideas. See supra, at 2553. The majority
discards this notion out-of-hand. Ante, at 2549.
<P>
As I see it, the Court's theory does not work and will do nothing
more than confuse the law. Its selection of this case to rewrite
First Amendment law is particularly inexplicable, because the
whole problem could have been avoided by deciding this case under
settled First Amendment principles.
<P>
II
<P>
Although I disagree with the Court's analysis, I do agree with
its conclusion: The St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional. However,
I would decide the case on overbreadth grounds.
<P>
We have emphasized time and again that overbreadth doctrine is
an exception to the established principle that &quot;a person
to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied will not be
heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably
be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other situations not
before the Court.&quot; Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S., at 610,
93 S.Ct., at 2915; Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S.,
at 503-504, 105 S.Ct., at 2801-2802. A defendant being prosecuted
for speech or expressive conduct may challenge the law on its
face if it reaches protected expression, even when that person's
activities are not protected by the First Amendment. This is because
&quot;the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected
speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that
protected speech of others may be muted.&quot; Broadrick, supra,
413 U.S., at 612, 93 S.Ct., at 2916; Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S.,
at 112, n. 8, 110 S.Ct., at 169, n. 8; New York v. Ferber, supra,
458 U.S., at 768-769, 102 S.Ct. at 3360-3361;
<P>
Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620,
634, 100 S.Ct. 826, 834, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980); Gooding v. Wilson,
405 U.S. 518, 521, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1105, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972).
<P>
However, we have consistently held that, because overbreadth analysis
is &quot;strong medicine,&quot; it may be invoked to strike an
entire statute only when the overbreadth of the statute is not
only &quot;real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to
the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,&quot; Broadrick, 413 U.S.,
at 615, 93 S.Ct., at 2917, and when the statute is not susceptible
to limitation or partial invalidation. Id., at 613, 93 S.Ct.,
at 2916; Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus,
Inc., 482 U.S. 569, 574, 107 S.Ct. 2568, 2571, 96 L.Ed.2d 500
(1987). &quot;When a federal court is dealing with a federal statute
challenged as overbroad, it should ... construe the statute to
avoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to a
limiting construction.&quot; Ferber, 458 U.S., at 769, n. 24,
102 S.Ct., at 3361, n. 24. Of course, &quot;[a] state court is
also free to deal with a state statute in the same way.&quot;
Ibid. See, e.g., Osborne, 495 U.S. at 113-114, 110 S.Ct., at 1698-1699.
<P>
Petitioner contends that the St. Paul ordinance is not susceptible
to a narrowing construction and that the ordinance therefore should
be considered as written, and not as construed by the Minnesota
Supreme Court. Petitioner is wrong. Where a state court has interpreted
a provision of state law, we cannot ignore that interpretation,
*2559 even if it is not one that we would have reached if we were
construing the statute in the first instance. Ibid.;
<P>
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 355, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1856, 75
L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates,
Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, n. 5, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, n. 5, 71
L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). (FN12)
<P>
Of course, the mere presence of a state court interpretation does
not insulate a statute from overbreadth review. We have stricken
legislation when the construction supplied by the state court
failed to cure the overbreadth problem. See, e.g., Lewis v. City
of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 132-133, 94 S.Ct. 970, 972, 39 L.Ed.2d
214 (1974); Gooding, supra, 405 U.S., at 524-525, 92 S.Ct., at
1107-1108. But in such cases, we have looked to the statute as
construed in determining whether it contravened the First Amendment.
Here, the Minnesota Supreme Court has provided an authoritative
construction of the St. Paul antibias ordinance. Consideration
of petitioner's overbreadth claim must be based on that interpretation.
<P>
I agree with petitioner that the ordinance is invalid on its face.
Although the ordinance as construed reaches categories of speech
that are constitutionally unprotected, it also criminalizes a
substantial amount of expression that--however repugnant--is shielded
by the First Amendment.
<P>
In attempting to narrow the scope of the St. Paul antibias ordinance,
the Minnesota Supreme Court relied upon two of the categories
of speech and expressive conduct that fall outside the First Amendment's
protective sphere: words that incite &quot;imminent lawless action,&quot;
Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 449, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1830, 23
L.Ed.2d 430 (1969), and &quot;fighting&quot; words, Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769.
The Minnesota Supreme Court erred in its application of the Chaplinsky
fighting words test and consequently interpreted the St. Paul
ordinance in a fashion that rendered the ordinance facially overbroad.
<P>
In construing the St. Paul ordinance, the Minnesota Supreme Court
drew upon the definition of fighting words that appears in Chaplinsky--words
&quot;which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to
incite an immediate breach of the peace.&quot; Id., at 572, 62
S.Ct., at 769. However, the Minnesota court was far from clear
in identifying the &quot;injur[ies]&quot; inflicted by the expression
that St. Paul sought to regulate. Indeed, the Minnesota court
emphasized (tracking the language of the ordinance) that &quot;the
ordinance censors only those displays that one knows or should
know will create anger, alarm or resentment based on racial, ethnic,
gender or religious bias.&quot; In re Welfare of R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d
507, 510 (1991). I therefore understand the court to have ruled
that St. Paul may constitutionally prohibit expression that &quot;by
its very utterance&quot; causes &quot;anger, alarm or resentment.&quot;
<P>
Our fighting words cases have made clear, however, that such generalized
reactions are not sufficient to strip expression of its constitutional
protection. The mere fact that expressive activity causes hurt
feelings, offense, or resentment does not render the expression
unprotected. See United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310, 319,
110 S.Ct. 2404, 2410, 110 L.Ed.2d 287 (1990); Texas v. Johnson,

41 (1988); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 745, 98 S.Ct.

<P>
In the First Amendment context, &quot;[c]riminal statutes must
be scrutinized with particular care; those that make unlawful
a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct may
be held facially invalid even if they also have legitimate application.&quot;
Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2508, 96 L.Ed.2d
398 (1987) (citation omitted). The St. Paul antibias ordinance
is such a law. Although the ordinance reaches conduct that is
unprotected, it also makes criminal expressive conduct that causes
only hurt feelings, offense, or resentment, and is protected by
the First Amendment. Cf. Lewis, supra, 415 U.S., at 132, 94 S.Ct.,
at 972. (FN13) The ordinance is therefore fatally overbroad and
invalid on its face.

<P>
Today, the Court has disregarded two established principles of
First Amendment law without providing a coherent replacement theory.
Its decision is an arid, doctrinaire interpretation, driven by
the frequently irresistible impulse of judges to tinker with the
First Amendment. The decision is mischievous at best and will
surely confuse the lower courts. I join the judgment, but not
the folly of the opinion.
<P>
Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment.
<P>
I regret what the Court has done in this case. The majority opinion
signals one of two possibilities: it will serve as precedent for
future cases, or it will not. Either result is disheartening.
<P>
In the first instance, by deciding that a State cannot regulate
speech that causes great harm unless it also regulates speech
that does not (setting law and logic on their heads), the Court
seems to abandon the categorical approach, and inevitably to relax
the level of scrutiny applicable to content-based laws. As Justice
WHITE points out, this weakens the traditional protections of
speech. If all expressive activity must be accorded the same protection,
that protection will be scant. The simple reality is that the
Court will never provide child pornography or cigarette advertising
the level of protection customarily granted political speech.
If we are forbidden from categorizing, as the Court has done here,
we shall reduce protection across the board. It is sad that in
its effort to reach a satisfying result in this case, the Court
is willing to weaken First Amendment protections.
<P>
In the second instance is the possibility that this case will
not significantly alter First Amendment jurisprudence, but, instead,
will be regarded as an aberration--a case where the Court manipulated
doctrine to strike down an ordinance whose premise it opposed,
namely, that racial threats and *2561 verbal assaults are of greater
harm than other fighting words. I fear that the Court has been
distracted from its proper mission by the temptation to decide
the issue over &quot;politically correct speech&quot; and &quot;cultural
diversity,&quot; neither of which is presented here. If this is
the meaning of today's opinion, it is perhaps even more regrettable.
<P>
I see no First Amendment values that are compromised by a law
that prohibits hoodlums from driving minorities out of their homes
by burning crosses on their lawns, but I see great harm in preventing
the people of Saint Paul from specifically punishing the race-based
fighting words that so prejudice their community.
<P>
I concur in the judgment, however, because I agree with Justice
WHITE that this particular ordinance reaches beyond fighting words
to speech protected by the First Amendment.
<P>
Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice WHITE and Justice BLACKMUN
join as to Part I, concurring in the judgment.
<P>
Conduct that creates special risks or causes special harms may
be prohibited by special rules. Lighting a fire near an ammunition
dump or a gasoline storage tank is especially dangerous; such
behavior may be punished more severely than burning trash in a
vacant lot. Threatening someone because of her race or religious
beliefs may cause particularly severe trauma or touch off a riot,
and threatening a high public official may cause substantial social
disruption; such threats may be punished more severely than threats
against someone based on, say, his support of a particular athletic
team. There are legitimate, reasonable, and neutral justifications
for such special rules.
<P>
This case involves the constitutionality of one such ordinance.
Because the regulated conduct has some communicative content--a
message of racial, religious or gender hostility--the ordinance
raises two quite different First Amendment questions. Is the ordinance
&quot;overbroad&quot; because it prohibits too much speech? If
not, is it &quot;underbroad&quot; because it does not prohibit
enough speech?
<P>
In answering these questions, my colleagues today wrestle with
two broad principles: first, that certain &quot;categories of
expression [including 'fighting words'] are 'not within the area
of constitutionally protected speech,' &quot; ante, at 2553 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment); and second, that &quot;[c]ontent-based
regulations [of expression] are presumptively invalid.&quot; Ante,
at 2542 (Opinion of the Court). Although in past opinions the
Court has repeated both of these maxims, it has--quite rightly--adhered
to neither with the absolutism suggested by my colleagues. Thus,
while I agree that the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutionally
overbroad for the reasons stated in Part II of Justice WHITE's
opinion, I write separately to suggest how the allure of absolute
principles has skewed the analysis of both the majority and concurring
opinions.
<P>
I
<P>
Fifty years ago, the Court articulated a categorical approach
to First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
&quot;There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise any Constitutional problem.... It has been well
observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition
of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth
that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86
L.Ed. 1031 (1942).
<P>
We have, as Justice WHITE observes, often described such categories
of expression as &quot;not within the area of constitutionally
protected speech.&quot; Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 483,
77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957).
<P>
*2562 The Court today revises this categorical approach. It is
not, the Court rules, that certain &quot;categories&quot; of expression
are &quot;unprotected,&quot; but rather that certain &quot;elements&quot;
of expression are wholly &quot;proscribable.&quot; To the Court,
an expressive act, like a chemical compound, consists of more
than one element. Although the act may be regulated because it
contains a proscribable element, it may not be regulated on the
basis of another (nonproscribable) element it also contains. Thus,
obscene antigovernment speech may be regulated because it is obscene,
but not because it is antigovernment. Ante, at 2543. It is this
revision of the categorical approach that allows the Court to
assume that the St. Paul ordinance proscribes only fighting words,
while at the same time concluding that the ordinance is invalid
because it imposes a content-based regulation on expressive activity.
<P>
As an initial matter, the Court's revision of the categorical
approach seems to me something of an adventure in a doctrinal
wonderland, for the concept of &quot;obscene anti-government&quot;
speech is fantastical. The category of the obscene is very narrow;
to be obscene, expression must be found by the trier of fact to
&quot;appea[l] to the prurient interest, ... depic[t] or describ[e],
in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct, [and] taken as a
whole, lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.&quot; Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607,
2614-2615, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (emphasis added). &quot;Obscene
antigovernment&quot; speech, then, is a contradiction in terms:
If expression is antigovernment, it does not &quot;lac[k] serious
... political ... value&quot; and cannot be obscene.
<P>
The Court attempts to bolster its argument by likening its novel
analysis to that applied to restrictions on the time, place, or
manner of expression or on expressive conduct. It is true that
loud speech in favor of the Republican Party can be regulated
because it is loud, but not because it is pro-Republican; and
it is true that the public burning of the American flag can be
regulated because it involves public burning and not because it
involves the flag. But these analogies are inapposite. In each
of these examples, the two elements (e.g., loudness and pro-Republican
orientation) can coexist; in the case of &quot;obscene antigovernment&quot;
speech, however, the presence of one element (&quot;obscenity&quot;)
by definition means the absence of the other. To my mind, it is
unwise and unsound to craft a new doctrine based on such highly
speculative hypotheticals.
<P>
I am, however, even more troubled by the second step of the Court's
analysis--namely, its conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is
an unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech. Drawing
on broadly worded dicta, the Court establishes a near-absolute
ban on content-based regulations of expression and holds that
the First Amendment prohibits the regulation of fighting words
by subject matter. Thus, while the Court rejects the &quot;all-or-nothing-at-all&quot;
nature of the categorical approach, ante, at 2543, it promptly
embraces an absolutism of its own: within a particular &quot;proscribable&quot;
category of expression, the Court holds, a government must either
proscribe all speech or no speech at all. (FN1) This aspect of
the Court's ruling fundamentally misunderstands the role and constitutional
status of content-based regulations *2563 on speech, conflicts
with the very nature of First Amendment jurisprudence, and disrupts
well-settled principles of First Amendment law.
<P>
Although the Court has, on occasion, declared that content-based
regulations of speech are &quot;never permitted,&quot; Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 99, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2292,
33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), such claims are overstated. Indeed, in
Mosley itself, the Court indicated that Chicago's selective proscription
of nonlabor picketing was not per se unconstitutional, but rather
could be upheld if the City demonstrated that nonlabor picketing
was &quot;clearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing.&quot;
Id., at 100, 92 S.Ct., at 2292. Contrary to the broad dicta in
Mosley and elsewhere, our decisions demonstrate that content-based
distinctions, far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitable
and indispensable aspect of a coherent understanding of the First
Amendment.
<P>
This is true at every level of First Amendment law. In broadest
terms, our entire First Amendment jurisprudence creates a regime
based on the content of speech. The scope of the First Amendment
is determined by the content of expressive activity: Although
the First Amendment broadly protects &quot;speech,&quot; it does
not protect the right to &quot;fix prices, breach contracts, make
false warranties, place bets with bookies, threaten, [or] extort.&quot;
Schauer, Categories and the First Amendment: A Play in Three Acts,
34 Vand.L.Rev. 265, 270 (1981). Whether an agreement among competitors
is a violation of the Sherman Act or protected activity under
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine (FN2) hinges upon the content of
the agreement. Similarly, &quot;the line between permissible advocacy
and impermissible incitation to crime or violence depends, not
merely on the setting in which the speech occurs, but also on
exactly what the speaker had to say.&quot; Young v. American Mini
Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 66, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2450, 49 L.Ed.2d
310 (1976) (plurality opinion); see also Musser v. Utah, 333 U.S.
95, 100-103, 68 S.Ct. 397, 399-401, 92 L.Ed. 562 (1948) (Rutledge,
J., dissenting).
<P>
Likewise, whether speech falls within one of the categories of
&quot;unprotected&quot; or &quot;proscribable&quot; expression
is determined, in part, by its content. Whether a magazine is
obscene, a gesture a fighting word, or a photograph child pornography
is determined, in part, by its content. Even within categories
of protected expression, the First Amendment status of speech
is fixed by its content. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S.
254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), and Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 105 S.Ct. 2939,
86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985), establish that the level of protection
given to speech depends upon its subject matter: speech about
public officials or matters of public concern receives greater
protection than speech about other topics. It can, therefore,
scarcely be said that the regulation of expressive activity cannot
be predicated on its content: much of our First Amendment jurisprudence
is premised on the assumption that content makes a difference.
<P>
Consistent with this general premise, we have frequently upheld
content-based regulations of speech. For example, in Young v.
American Mini Theatres, the Court upheld zoning ordinances that
regulated movie theaters based on the content of the films shown.
In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57
L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (plurality opinion), we upheld a restriction
on the broadcast of specific indecent words. In Lehman v. City
of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770
(1974) (plurality opinion), we upheld a city law that permitted
commercial advertising, but prohibited political advertising,
on city buses. In Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 *2564
S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973), we upheld a state law that
restricted the speech of state employees, but only as concerned
partisan political matters. We have long recognized the power
of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate misleading advertising
and labeling, see, e.g., Jacob Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608,
66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946), and the National Labor Relations
Board's power to regulate an employer's election-related speech
on the basis of its content. See, e.g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing
Co., 395 U.S. 575, 616-618, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1942-1943, 23 L.Ed.2d
547 (1969). It is also beyond question that the Government may
choose to limit advertisements for cigarettes, see 15 U.S.C. Secs.
1331-1340, (FN3) but not for cigars; choose to regulate airline
advertising, see Morales v. Trans World Airlines, 504 U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992), but not bus advertising;
or choose to monitor solicitation by lawyers, see Ohralik v. Ohio
State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978),
but not by doctors.
<P>
All of these cases involved the selective regulation of speech
based on content--precisely the sort of regulation the Court invalidates
today. Such selective regulations are unavoidably content based,
but they are not, in my opinion, &quot;presumptively invalid.&quot;
As these many decisions and examples demonstrate, the prohibition
on content-based regulations is not nearly as total as the Mosley
dictum suggests.
<P>
Disregarding this vast body of case law, the Court today goes
beyond even the overstatement in Mosley and applies the prohibition
on content-based regulation to speech that the Court had until
today considered wholly &quot;unprotected&quot; by the First Amendment--namely,
fighting words. This new absolutism in the prohibition of content-based
regulations severely contorts the fabric of settled First Amendment
law.
<P>
Our First Amendment decisions have created a rough hierarchy in
the constitutional protection of speech. Core political speech
occupies the highest, most protected position; commercial speech
and nonobscene, sexually explicit speech are regarded as a sort
of second-class expression; obscenity and fighting words receive
the least protection of all. Assuming that the Court is correct
that this last class of speech is not wholly &quot;unprotected,&quot;
it certainly does not follow that fighting words and obscenity
receive the same sort of protection afforded core political speech.
Yet in ruling that proscribable speech cannot be regulated based
on subject matter, the Court does just that. (FN4) Perversely,
this gives fighting words greater protection than is afforded
commercial speech. If Congress can prohibit false advertising
directed at airline passengers without also prohibiting false
advertising directed at bus passengers and if a city can prohibit
political advertisements in its buses while allowing other advertisements,
it is ironic to hold that a city cannot regulate fighting words
based on &quot;race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot; while
leaving unregulated fighting words based on &quot;union membership
or homosexuality.&quot; Ante, at 2547. The Court today turns First
Amendment law on its head: Communication that was once entirely
unprotected (and that still can be wholly proscribed) is now entitled
to greater protection than commercial speech--and possibly greater
protection than core political *2565 speech. See Burson v. Freeman,
504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, ----, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
<P>
Perhaps because the Court recognizes these perversities, it quickly
offers some ad hoc limitations on its newly extended prohibition
on content-based regulations. First, the Court states that a content-based
regulation is valid &quot;[w]hen the content discrimination is
based upon the very reason the entire class of speech ... is proscribable.&quot;
In a pivotal passage, the Court writes &quot;the Federal Government
can criminalize only those physical threats that are directed
against the President, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871--since the reasons
why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment (protecting
individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that
fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence
will occur) have special force when applied to the ... President.&quot;
Ante, at 2546.
<P>
As I understand this opaque passage, Congress may choose from
the set of unprotected speech (all threats) to proscribe only
a subset (threats against the President) because those threats
are particularly likely to cause &quot;fear of violence,&quot;
&quot;disruption,&quot; and actual &quot;violence.&quot;
<P>
Precisely this same reasoning, however, compels the conclusion
that St. Paul's ordinance is constitutional. Just as Congress
may determine that threats against the President entail more severe
consequences than other threats, so St. Paul's City Council may
determine that threats based on the target's race, religion, or
gender cause more severe harm to both the target and to society
than other threats. This latter judgment--that harms caused by
racial, religious, and gender-based invective are qualitatively
different from that caused by other fighting words--seems to me
eminently reasonable and realistic.
<P>
Next, the Court recognizes that a State may regulate advertising
in one industry but not another because &quot;the risk of fraud
(one of the characteristics that justifies depriving [commercial
speech] of full First Amendment protection ...)&quot; in the regulated
industry is &quot;greater&quot; than in other industries. Ante,
at 2546. Again, the same reasoning demonstrates the constitutionality
of St. Paul's ordinance. &quot;[O]ne of the characteristics that
justifies&quot; the constitutional status of fighting words is
that such words &quot;by their very utterance inflict injury or
tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.&quot; Chaplinsky,
315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 762. Certainly a legislature that
may determine that the risk of fraud is greater in the legal trade
than in the medical trade may determine that the risk of injury
or breach of peace created by race-based threats is greater than
that created by other threats.
<P>
Similarly, it is impossible to reconcile the Court's analysis
of the St. Paul ordinance with its recognition that &quot;a prohibition
of fighting words that are directed at certain persons or groups
... would be facially valid.&quot; Ante, at 2548 (emphasis deleted).
A selective proscription of unprotected expression designed to
protect &quot;certain persons or groups&quot; (for example, a
law proscribing threats directed at the elderly) would be constitutional
if it were based on a legitimate determination that the harm created
by the regulated expression differs from that created by the unregulated
expression (that is, if the elderly are more severely injured
by threats than are the nonelderly). Such selective protection
is no different from a law prohibiting minors (and only minors)
from obtaining obscene publications. See Ginsberg v. New York,
390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968). St. Paul has
determined--reasonably in my judgment--that fighting-word injuries
&quot;based on race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot; are
qualitatively different and more severe than fighting-word injuries
based on other characteristics. Whether the selective proscription
of proscribable speech is defined by the protected target (&quot;certain
persons or groups&quot;) or the basis of the harm (injuries &quot;based
on race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot;) makes no constitutional
difference: what matters is whether *2566 the legislature's selection
is based on a legitimate, neutral, and reasonable distinction.
<P>
In sum, the central premise of the Court's ruling--that &quot;[c]ontent-based
regulations are presumptively invalid&quot;--has simplistic appeal,
but lacks support in our First Amendment jurisprudence. To make
matters worse, the Court today extends this overstated claim to
reach categories of hitherto unprotected speech and, in doing
so, wreaks havoc in an area of settled law. Finally, although
the Court recognizes exceptions to its new principle, those exceptions
undermine its very conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional.
Stated directly, the majority's position cannot withstand scrutiny.
<P>
II
<P>
Although I agree with much of Justice WHITE's analysis, I do not
join Part I-A of his opinion because I have reservations about
the &quot;categorical approach&quot; to the First Amendment. These
concerns, which I have noted on other occasions, see, e.g., New
York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 778, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3365-3366,
73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment),
lead me to find Justice WHITE's response to the Court's analysis
unsatisfying.
<P>
Admittedly, the categorical approach to the First Amendment has
some appeal:
<P>
either expression is protected or it is not--the categories create
safe harbors for governments and speakers alike. But this approach
sacrifices subtlety for clarity and is, I am convinced, ultimately
unsound. As an initial matter, the concept of &quot;categories&quot;
fits poorly with the complex reality of expression. Few dividing
lines in First Amendment law are straight and unwavering, and
efforts at categorization inevitably give rise only to fuzzy boundaries.
Our definitions of &quot;obscenity,&quot; see, e.g., Marks v.
United States, 430 U.S. 188, 198, 97 S.Ct. 990, 996, 51 L.Ed.2d
260 (1977) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part), and &quot;public forum,&quot; see, e.g., United States
Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453 U.S.
114, 126-131, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 2683-2686, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981);
id., at 136-140, 101 S.Ct., at 2688-2691 (Brennan, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at 147-151, 101 S.Ct., at 2694-2696 (Marshall,
J., dissenting); 152-154, 101 S.Ct. at 2696-2698 (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting) (all debating the definition of &quot;public forum&quot;),
illustrate this all too well. The quest for doctrinal certainty
through the definition of categories and subcategories is, in
my opinion, destined to fail.
<P>
Moreover, the categorical approach does not take seriously the
importance of context. The meaning of any expression and the legitimacy
of its regulation can only be determined in context. (FN5) Whether,
for example, a picture or a sentence is obscene cannot be judged
in the abstract, but rather only in the context of its setting,
its use, and its audience. Similarly, although legislatures may
freely regulate most nonobscene child pornography, such pornography
that is part of &quot;a serious work of art, a documentary on
behavioral problems, or a medical or psychiatric teaching device,&quot;
may be entitled to constitutional protection; the &quot;question
whether a specific act of communication is protected by the First
Amendment always requires some consideration of both its content
and its context.&quot; Ferber, 458 U.S. at 778, 102 S.Ct., at
3366 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment); see also Smith v.
<P>
United States, 431 U.S. 291, 311-321, 97 S.Ct. 1756, 1769-1774,
52 L.Ed.2d 324
<P>
(1977) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The categorical approach sweeps
too broadly when it declares that all such expression *2567 is
beyond the protection of the First Amendment.
<P>
Perhaps sensing the limits of such an all-or-nothing approach,
the Court has applied its analysis less categorically than its
doctrinal statements suggest.
<P>
The Court has recognized intermediate categories of speech (for
example, for indecent nonobscene speech and commercial speech)
and geographic categories of speech (public fora, limited public
fora, nonpublic fora) entitled to varying levels of protection.
The Court has also stringently delimited the categories of unprotected
speech. While we once declared that &quot;[l]ibelous utterances
[are] not ... within the area of constitutionally protected speech,&quot;
Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 266, 72 S.Ct. 725, 735,
96 L.Ed. 919 (1952), our rulings in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974),
and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472
U.S. 749, 105 S.Ct. 2939, 86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985), have substantially
qualified this broad claim. Similarly, we have consistently construed
the &quot;fighting words&quot; exception set forth in Chaplinsky
narrowly. See, e.g., Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 107 S.Ct.
2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987); Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415
U.S. 130, 94 S.Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974); Cohen v. California,
403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). In the case
of commercial speech, our ruling that &quot;the Constitution imposes
no ... restraint on government [regulation] as respects purely
commercial advertising,&quot; Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S.
52, 54, 62 S.Ct. 920, 921, 86 L.Ed. 1262 (1942), was expressly
repudiated in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976).
In short, the history of the categorical approach is largely the
history of narrowing the categories of unprotected speech.
<P>
This evolution, I believe, indicates that the categorical approach
is unworkable and the quest for absolute categories of &quot;protected&quot;
and &quot;unprotected&quot; speech ultimately futile. My analysis
of the faults and limits of this approach persuades me that the
categorical approach presented in Part I-A of Justice WHITE's
opinion is not an adequate response to the novel &quot;underbreadth&quot;
analysis the Court sets forth today.
<P>
III
<P>
As the foregoing suggests, I disagree with both the Court's and
part of Justice WHITE's analysis of the constitutionality St.
Paul ordinance. Unlike the Court, I do not believe that all content-based
regulations are equally infirm and presumptively invalid; unlike
Justice WHITE, I do not believe that fighting words are wholly
unprotected by the First Amendment. To the contrary, I believe
our decisions establish a more complex and subtle analysis, one
that considers the content and context of the regulated speech,
and the nature and scope of the restriction on speech. Applying
this analysis and assuming arguendo (as the Court does) that the
St. Paul ordinance is not overbroad, I conclude that such a selective,
subject-matter regulation on proscribable speech is constitutional.
<P>
Not all content-based regulations are alike; our decisions clearly
recognize that some content-based restrictions raise more constitutional
questions than others. Although the Court's analysis of content-based
regulations cannot be reduced to a simple formula, we have considered
a number of factors in determining the validity of such regulations.
<P>
First, as suggested above, the scope of protection provided expressive
activity depends in part upon its content and character. We have
long recognized that when government regulates political speech
or &quot;the expression of editorial opinion on matters of public
importance,&quot; FCC v. League of Women Voters of California,
468 U.S. 364, 375-376, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3114-3115, 82 L.Ed.2d 278
(1984), &quot;First Amendment protectio[n] is 'at its zenith.'
&quot; Meyer v. *2568 Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 425, 108 S.Ct. 1886,
1894, 100 L.Ed.2d 425 (1988). In comparison, we have recognized
that &quot;commercial speech receives a limited form of First
Amendment protection,&quot; Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 340, 106 S.Ct. 2968,
2976, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986), and that &quot;society's interest
in protecting [sexually explicit films] is of a wholly different,
and lesser magnitude than [its] interest in untrammeled political
debate.&quot; Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at 70,
96 S.Ct., at 2452; see also FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S.
726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). The character of expressive
 activity also weighs in our consideration of its constitutional
status. As we have frequently noted, &quot;[t]he government generally
has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has
in restricting the written or spoken word.&quot; Texas v. Johnson,
491 U.S. 397, 406, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2540, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989);
see also United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673,
20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
<P>
The protection afforded expression turns as well on the context
of the regulated speech. We have noted, for example, that &quot;[a]ny
assessment of the precise scope of employer expression, of course,
must be made in the context of its labor relations setting ...
[and] must take into account the economic dependence of the employees
on their employers.&quot; NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S.,
at 617, 89 S.Ct., at 1942. Similarly, the distinctive character
of a university environment, see Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
277-280, 102 S.Ct. 269, 278-280, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) (STEVENS,
J., concurring in judgment), or a secondary school environment,
see Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 108 S.Ct.
592, 98 L.Ed.2d 562 (1988), influences our First Amendment analysis.
The same is true of the presence of a &quot; 'captive audience[,
one] there as a matter of necessity, not of choice.' &quot; Lehman
v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S., at 302, 94 S.Ct., at 2717
(citation omitted). (FN6) Perhaps the most familiar embodiment
of the relevance of context is our &quot;fora&quot; jurisprudence,
differentiating the levels of protection afforded speech in different
locations.
<P>
The nature of a contested restriction of speech also informs our
evaluation of its constitutionality. Thus, for example, &quot;[a]ny
system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing
a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.&quot;
Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70, 83 S.Ct. 631,
639, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). More particularly to the matter of
content-based regulations, we have implicitly distinguished between
restrictions on expression based on subject matter and restrictions
based on viewpoint, indicating that the latter are particularly
pernicious. &quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying the
First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S., at
414, 109 S.Ct., at 2544. &quot;Viewpoint discrimination is censorship
in its purest form,&quot; Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local
Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 62, 103 S.Ct. 948, 964, 74 L.Ed.2d
794 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting), and requires particular
scrutiny, in part because such regulation often indicates a legislative
effort to skew public debate on an issue. See, e.g., Schacht v.
United States, 398 U.S. 58, 63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1559, 26 L.Ed.2d
44 (1970). &quot;Especially where ... the legislature's suppression
of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable
public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people,
the First Amendment is plainly offended.&quot; First National
Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407,
1420-1421, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). *2569 Thus, although a regulation
that on its face regulates speech by subject matter may in some
instances effectively suppress particular viewpoints, see, e.g.,
Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Service Comm'n of N.Y.,
447 U.S. 530, 546-547, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2338, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980)
(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment), in general, viewpoint-based
restrictions on expression require greater scrutiny than subject-matter
based restrictions. (FN7)
<P>
Finally, in considering the validity of content-based regulations
we have also looked more broadly at the scope of the restrictions.
For example, in Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at
71, 96 S.Ct., at 2452-2453, we found significant the fact that
&quot;what [was] ultimately at stake [was] nothing more than a
limitation on the place where adult films may be exhibited.&quot;
Similarly, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, the Court emphasized
two dimensions of the limited scope of the FCC ruling. First,
the ruling concerned only broadcast material which presents particular
problems because it &quot;confronts the citizen ... in the privacy
of the home&quot;; second, the ruling was not a complete ban on
the use of selected offensive words, but rather merely a limitation
on the times such speech could be broadcast. 438 U.S., at 748-750,
98 S.Ct., at 3039-3041.
<P>
All of these factors play some role in our evaluation of content-based
<P>
regulations on expression. Such a multi-faceted analysis cannot
be conflated into two dimensions. Whatever the allure of absolute
doctrines, it is just too simple to declare expression &quot;protected&quot;
or &quot;unprotected&quot; or to proclaim a regulation &quot;content-based&quot;
or &quot;content-neutral.&quot;
<P>
In applying this analysis to the St. Paul ordinance, I assume
arguendo --as the Court does--that the ordinance regulates only
fighting words and therefore is not overbroad. Looking to the
content and character of the regulated activity, two things are
clear. First, by hypothesis the ordinance bars only low-value
speech, namely, fighting words. By definition such expression
constitutes &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and [is] of such slight social value as a step to truth that any
benefit that may be derived from [it] is clearly outweighed by
the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky, 315
U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769. Second, the ordinance regulates
&quot;expressive conduct [rather] than ... the written or spoken
word.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S., at 406, 109 S.Ct., at
2540.
<P>
Looking to the context of the regulated activity, it is again
significant that the statute (by hypothesis) regulates only fighting
words. Whether words are fighting words is determined in part
by their context. Fighting words are not words that merely cause
offense; fighting words must be directed at individuals so as
to &quot;by their very utterance inflict injury.&quot; By hypothesis,
then, the St. Paul ordinance restricts speech in confrontational
and potentially violent situations. The case at hand is illustrative.
The cross-burning in this case--directed as it was to a single
African-American family trapped in their home--was nothing more
than a crude form of physical intimidation. That this cross-burning
sends a message of racial hostility does not automatically endow
it with complete constitutional protection. (FN8) *2570 Significantly,
the St. Paul ordinance regulates speech not on the basis of its
subject matter or the viewpoint expressed, but rather on the basis
of the harm the speech causes. In this regard, the Court fundamentally
misreads the St. Paul ordinance. The Court describes the St. Paul
ordinance as regulating expression &quot;addressed to one of [several]
specified disfavored topics,&quot; ante, at 2547 (emphasis supplied),
as policing &quot;disfavored subjects,&quot; ibid. (emphasis supplied),
and as &quot;prohibit[ing] ... speech solely on the basis of the
subjects the speech addresses.&quot; Ante, at 2542 (emphasis supplied).
Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the ordinance regulates only
a subcategory of expression that causes injuries based on &quot;race,
color, creed, religion or gender,&quot; not a subcategory that
involves discussions that concern those characteristics. (FN9)
The ordinance, as construed by the Court, criminalizes expression
that &quot;one knows ... [by its very utterance inflicts injury
on] others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot;
In this regard, the ordinance resembles the child pornography
law at issue in Ferber, which in effect singled out child pornography
because those publications caused far greater harms than pornography
involving adults.
<P>
Moreover, even if the St. Paul ordinance did regulate fighting
words based on its subject matter, such a regulation would, in
my opinion, be constitutional. As noted above, subject-matter
based regulations on commercial speech are widespread and largely
unproblematic. As we have long recognized, subject-matter regulations
generally do not raise the same concerns of government censorship
and the distortion of public discourse presented by viewpoint
regulations. Thus, in upholding subject-matter regulations we
have carefully noted that viewpoint-based discrimination was not
implicated. See Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at
67, 96 S.Ct., at 2450-2451 (emphasizing &quot;the need for absolute
neutrality by the government,&quot; and observing that the contested
statute was not animated by &quot;hostility for the point of view&quot;
of the theatres); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S., at 745-746,
98 S.Ct., at 3038-3039 (stressing that &quot;government must remain
neutral in the marketplace of ideas&quot;); see also FCC v. League
of Women's Voters of California, 468 U.S., at 412-417, 104 S.Ct.,
at 3134-3137 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Metromedia, Inc. v. City
of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 554-555, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 2916-2917,
69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part).
<P>
Indeed, some subject-matter restrictions are a functional necessity
in contemporary governance: &quot;The First Amendment does not
require States to regulate for problems that do not exist.&quot;
Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1856,
119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
<P>
Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, the St. Paul ordinance
does not regulate expression based on viewpoint. The Court contends
that the ordinance requires proponents of racial intolerance to
&quot;follow the *2571. Marquis of Queensbury Rules&quot; while
allowing advocates of racial tolerance to &quot;fight freestyle.&quot;
The law does no such thing.
<P>
The Court writes:
<P>
&quot;One could hold up a sign saying, for example, that all 'anti-Catholic
bigots' are misbegotten; but not that all 'papists' are, for that
would insult and provoke violence 'on the basis of religion.'
&quot; Ante, at 2548.
<P>
This may be true, but it hardly proves the Court's point. The
Court's reasoning is asymmetrical. The response to a sign saying
that &quot;all [religious] bigots are misbegotten&quot; is a sign
saying that &quot;all advocates of religious tolerance are misbegotten.&quot;
Assuming such signs could be fighting words (which seems to me
extremely unlikely), neither sign would be banned by the ordinance
for the attacks were not &quot;based on ... religion&quot; but
rather on one's beliefs about tolerance. Conversely (and again
assuming such signs are fighting words), just as the ordinance
would prohibit a Muslim from hoisting a sign claiming that all
Catholics were misbegotten, so the ordinance would bar a Catholic
from hoisting a similar sign attacking Muslims.
<P>
The St. Paul ordinance is evenhanded. In a battle between advocates
of tolerance and advocates of intolerance, the ordinance does
not prevent either side from hurling fighting words at the other
on the basis of their conflicting ideas, but it does bar both
sides from hurling such words on the basis of the target's &quot;race,
color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; To extend the Court's
pugilistic metaphor, the St. Paul ordinance simply bans punches
&quot;below the belt&quot;--by either party. It does not, therefore,
favor one side of any debate. (FN10)
<P>
Finally, it is noteworthy that the St. Paul ordinance is, as construed
by the Court today, quite narrow. The St. Paul ordinance does
not ban all &quot;hate speech,&quot; nor does it ban, say, all
cross-burnings or all swastika displays. Rather it only bans a
subcategory of the already narrow category of fighting words.
Such a limited ordinance leaves open and protected a vast range
of expression on the subjects of racial, religious, and gender
equality. As construed by the Court today, the ordinance certainly
does not &quot; 'raise the specter that the Government may effectively
drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.' &quot;
Ante, at 2545. Petitioner is free to burn a cross to announce
a rally or to express his views about racial supremacy, he may
do so on private property or public land, at day or at night,
so long as the burning is not so threatening and so directed at
an individual as to &quot;by its very [execution] inflict injury.&quot;
Such a limited proscription scarcely offends the First Amendment.
<P>
In sum, the St. Paul ordinance (as construed by the Court) regulates
expressive activity that is wholly proscribable and does so not
on the basis of viewpoint, but rather in recognition of the different
harms caused by such activity. Taken together, these several considerations
persuade me that the St. Paul ordinance is not an unconstitutional
content-based regulation of speech. Thus, were the ordinance not
overbroad, I would vote to uphold it.

FN3. Contrary to Justice WHITE's suggestion, post, at 2550-2551,
petitioner's claim is &quot;fairly included&quot; within the questions
presented in the petition for certiorari, see this Court's Rule
14.1(a). It was clear from the petition and from petitioner's
other filings in this Court (and in the courts below) that his
assertion that the St. Paul ordinance &quot;violat[es] overbreadth
... principles of the First Amendment,&quot; Pet. for Cert. i,
was not just a technical &quot;overbreadth&quot; claim--i.e.,
a claim that the ordinance violated the rights of too many third
parties--but included the contention that the ordinance was &quot;overbroad&quot;
in the sense of restricting more speech than the Constitution
permits, even in its application to him, because it is content-based.
An important component of petitioner's argument is, and has been
all along, that narrowly construing the ordinance to cover only
&quot;fighting words&quot; cannot cure this fundamental defect.
Id., at 12, 14, 15-16. In his briefs in this Court, petitioner
argued that a narrowing construction was ineffective because (1)
its boundaries were vague, Brief for Petitioner 26, and because
(2) denominating particular expression a &quot;fighting word&quot;
because of the impact of its ideological content upon the audience
is inconsistent with the First Amendment, Reply Brief for Petitioner
5; id., at 13 (&quot;[The ordinance] is overbroad, viewpoint discriminatory
and vague as 'narrowly construed' &quot;) (emphasis added). At
oral argument, counsel for Petitioner reiterated this second point:
&quot;It is ... one of my positions, that in [punishing only some
fighting words and not others], even though it is a subcategory,
technically, of unprotected conduct, [the ordinance] still is
picking out an opinion, a disfavored message, and making that
clear through the State.&quot; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. In resting
our judgment upon this contention, we have not departed from our
criteria of what is &quot;fairly included&quot; within the petition.

*2571_ FN4. Justice WHITE concedes that a city council cannot
prohibit only those legally obscene works that contain criticism
of the city government, post, at 2555, but asserts that to be
the consequence, not of the First Amendment, but of the Equal
Protection Clause. Such content-based discrimination would not,
he asserts, &quot;be rationally related to a legitimate government
interest,&quot; ibid. But of course the only reason that government
interest is not a &quot;legitimate&quot; one is that it violates
the First Amendment. This Court itself has occasionally fused
the First Amendment into the Equal Protection Clause in this fashion,
but at least with the acknowledgment (which Justice WHITE cannot
afford to make) that the First Amendment underlies its analysis.
See Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct.
2286, 2289-2290, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (ordinance prohibiting
only nonlabor picketing violated the Equal Protection Clause because
there was no &quot;appropriate governmental interest&quot; supporting
the distinction inasmuch as &quot;the First Amendment means that
government has no power to restrict expression because of its
message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content&quot;);

<P>
Justice STEVENS seeks to avoid the point by dismissing the notion
of obscene anti-government speech as &quot;fantastical,&quot;
post, at 2562, apparently believing that any reference to politics
prevents a finding of obscenity. Unfortunately for the purveyors
of obscenity, that is obviously false. A shockingly hard core
pornographic movie that contains a model sporting a political
tattoo can be found, &quot;taken as a whole [to] lac[k] serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,&quot; Miller
v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2614-2615, 37 L.Ed.2d
419 (1973) (emphasis added). Anyway, it is easy enough to come
up with other illustrations of a content-based restriction upon
&quot;unprotected speech&quot; that is obviously invalid: the
anti-government libel illustration mentioned earlier, for one.
See supra, at 2543. And of course the concept of racist fighting
words is, unfortunately, anything but a &quot;highly speculative
hypothetica[l],&quot; post, at 2562.
<P>
FN5. Although Justice WHITE asserts that our analysis disregards
&quot;established principles of First Amendment law,&quot; post,
at 2560, he cites not a single case (and we are aware of none)
that even involved, much less considered and resolved, the issue
of content discrimination through regulation of &quot;unprotected&quot;
speech--though we plainly recognized that as an issue in Ferber.
It is of course contrary to all traditions of our jurisprudence
to consider the law on this point conclusively resolved by broad
language in cases where the issue was not presented or even envisioned.
<P>
FN6. Justice STEVENS cites a string of opinions as supporting
his assertion that &quot;selective regulation of speech based
on content&quot; is not presumptively invalid. Post, at 2563-2564.
Analysis reveals, however, that they do not support it. To begin
with, three of them did not command a majority of the Court, Young
v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 63-73, 96 S.Ct.
<P>
2440, 2448-2454, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality); FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 744-748, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3037-3040, 57

418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct.

2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974) (plurality), and two others did not
even discuss the First Amendment, Morales v. Trans World Airlines,

Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608, 66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946).
In any event, all that their contents establish is what we readily
concede: that presumptive invalidity does not mean invariable
invalidity, leaving room for such exceptions as reasonable and
viewpoint-neutral content-based discrimination in nonpublic forums,
see Lehman, supra, 418 U.S., at 301-304, 94 S.Ct., at 2716-2718;

<P>
*2571_ FN7. St. Paul has not argued in this case that the ordinance
merely regulates that subclass of fighting words which is most
likely to provoke a violent response. But even if one assumes
(as appears unlikely) that the categories selected may be so described,
that would not justify selective regulation under a &quot;secondary
effects&quot; theory. The only reason why such expressive conduct
would be especially correlated with violence is that it conveys
a particularly odious message; because the &quot;chain of causation&quot;
thus necessarily &quot;run[s] through the persuasive effect of
the expressive component&quot; of the conduct, Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, 501 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 2470-2471, 115 L.Ed.2d
504 (1991) (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment), it is clear that
the St. Paul ordinance regulates on the basis of the &quot;primary&quot;
effect of the speech--i.e., its persuasive (or repellant) force.
<P>
FN8. A plurality of the Court reached a different conclusion with
regard to the Tennessee anti-electioneering statute considered
earlier this Term in Burson v.
<P>
Freeman, 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
In light of the &quot;logical connection&quot; between electioneering
and the State's compelling interest in preventing voter intimidation
and election fraud--an inherent connection borne out by a &quot;long
history&quot; and a &quot;wide-spread and time-tested consensus,&quot;
id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1855-1858--the plurality concluded
that it was facd with one of those &quot;rare case[s]&quot; in
which the use of a facially content-based restriction was justified
by interests unrelated to the suppression of ideas, id., at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1857-1858; see also id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at
1859 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Justice WHITE and Justice STEVENS
are therefore quite mistaken when they seek to convert the Burson
plurality's passing comment that &quot;[t]he First Amendment does
not require States to regulate for problems that do not exist,&quot;
id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856, into endorsement of the revolutionary
proposition that the suppression of particular ideas can be justified
when only those ideas have been a source of trouble in the past.
Post, at 2555 (WHITE, J.); post, at 2570 (STEVENS, J.).
<P>
FN1. The Court granted certiorari to review the following questions:
<P>
&quot;1. May a local government enact a content-based, 'hate-crime'
ordinance prohibiting the display of symbols, including a Nazi
swastika or a burning cross, on public or private property, which
one knows or has reason to know arouses anger, alarm, or resentment
in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or gender
without violating overbreadth and vagueness principles of the
First Amendment to the United States Constitution?
<P>
&quot;2. Can the constitutionality of such a vague and substantially
overbroad content-based restraint of expression be saved by a
limiting construction, like that used to save the vague and overbroad
content-neutral laws, restricting its application to 'fighting
words' or 'imminent lawless action?' &quot; Pet. for Cert. i.
<P>
It has long been the rule of this Court that &quot;[o]nly the
questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein,
will be considered by the Court.&quot; This Court's Rule 14.1(a).
This Rule has served to focus the issues presented for review.
But the majority reads the Rule so expansively that any First
Amendment theory would appear to be &quot;fairly included&quot;
within the questions quoted above.
<P>
Contrary to the impression the majority attempts to create through
its selective quotation of petitioner's briefs, see ante, at 2542,
n. 3, petitioner did not present to this Court or the Minnesota
Supreme Court anything approximating the novel theory the majority
adopts today. Most certainly petitioner did not &quot;reiterat[e]&quot;
such a claim at argument; he responded to a question from the
bench. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. Previously, this Court has shown the
restraint to refrain from deciding cases on the basis of its own
theories when they have not been pressed or passed upon by a state
court of last resort. See, e.g., Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213,
217-224, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2321-2325, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).
<P>
Given this threshold issue, it is my view that the Court lacks
jurisdiction to decide the case on the majority rationale. Cf.
Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Public Serv. Comm'n,
461 U.S. 375, 382, n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, n. 6, 76 L.Ed.2d
1 (1983). Certainly the preliminary jurisdictional and prudential
concerns are sufficiently weighty that we would never have granted
certiorari, had petitioner sought review of a question based on
the majority's decisional theory.
<P>
*2571_ FN2. &quot;In each of these areas, the limits of the unprotected
category, as well as the unprotected character of particular communications,
have been determined by the judicial evaluation of special facts
that have been deemed to have constitutional significance.&quot;
Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S.
485, 504-505, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961-1962, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1948).
<P>
FN3. The assortment of exceptions the Court attaches to its rule
belies the majority's claim, see ante, at 2545, that its new theory
is truly concerned with content discrimination. See Part I(C),
infra (discussing the exceptions).
<P>
FN4. This does not suggest, of course, that cross burning is always
unprotected. Burning a cross at a political rally would almost
certainly be protected expression. Cf. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395
U.S. 444, 445, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1828, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969). But
in such a context, the cross burning could not be characterized
as a &quot;direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange
fisticuffs,&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 409, 109 S.Ct.
2533, 2542, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989), to which the fighting words
doctrine, see Part II, infra, applies.
<P>
FN5. The majority relies on Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct.
1157, 99
<P>
L.Ed.2d 333 (1988), in arguing that the availability of content-neutral
alternatives &quot; 'undercut[s] significantly' &quot; a claim
that content-based
<P>
legislation is &quot; 'necessary to serve the asserted [compelling]
interest.' &quot; Ante, at 2549-2550 (quoting Boos, supra, at
329, 108 S.Ct., at 1168, and Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----,
----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (plurality)). Boos does
not support the majority's analysis. In Boos, Congress already
had decided that the challenged legislation was not necessary,
and the Court pointedly deferred to this choice. 485 U.S., at
329, 108 S.Ct., at 1168. St. Paul lawmakers have made no such
legislative choice.
<P>
Moreover, in Boos, the Court held that the challenged statute
was not narrowly tailored because a less restrictive alternative
was available. Ibid. But the Court's analysis today turns Boos
inside-out by substituting the majority's policy judgment that
a more restrictive alternative could adequately serve the compelling
need identified by St. Paul lawmakers. The result would be: (a)
a statute that was not tailored to fit the need identified by
the government; and (b) a greater restriction on fighting words,
even though the Court clearly believes that fighting words have
protected expressive content. Ante, at 2544.
<P>
FN6. Earlier this Term, seven of the eight participating members
of the Court agreed that strict scrutiny analysis applied in Simon
&amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476
(1991), in which we struck down New York's &quot;Son of Sam&quot;
law, which required &quot;that an accused or convicted criminal's
income from works describing his crime be deposited in an escrow
account.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 504.
<P>
FN7. The Burson dissenters did not complain that the plurality
erred in applying strict scrutiny; they objected that the plurality
was not sufficiently rigorous in its review. 504 U.S., at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1865 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).
<P>
FN8. Justice SCALIA concurred in the judgment in Burson, reasoning
that the statute, &quot;though content-based, is constitutional
[as] a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic
forum.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1848. However, nothing
in his reasoning in the present case suggests that a content-based
ban on fighting words would be constitutional were that ban limited
to nonpublic fora. Taken together, the two opinions suggest that,
in some settings, political speech, to which &quot;the First Amendment
'has its fullest and most urgent application,' &quot; is entitled
to less constitutional protection than fighting words. Eu v. San
Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223,
109 S.Ct. 1013, 1020, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989) (quoting Monitor
Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 272, 91 S.Ct. 621, 625, 28 L.Ed.2d
35 (1971)).
<P>
*2571_ FN9. The majority is mistaken in stating that a ban on
obscene works critical of government would fail equal protection
review only because the ban would violate the First Amendment.
Ante, at 2541, n. 2. While decisions such as Police Dept. of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972),
recognize that First Amendment principles may be relevant to an
equal protection claim challenging distinctions that impact on
protected expression, id., at 95-99, 92 S.Ct., at 2289-2292, there
is no basis for linking First and Fourteenth Amendment analysis
in a case involving unprotected expression. Certainly, one need
not resort to First Amendment principles to conclude that the
sort of improbable legislation the majority hypothesizes is based
on senseless distinctions.
<P>
FN10. Indeed, such a law is content based in and of itself because
it distinguishes between threatening and nonthreatening speech.
<P>
FN11. The consequences of the majority's conflation of the rarely-used
secondary effects standard and the O'Brien test for conduct incorporating
&quot;speech&quot; and &quot;nonspeech&quot; elements, see generally
United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376-377, 88 S.Ct. 1673,
1678-1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), present another question that
I fear will haunt us and the lower courts in the aftermath of
the majority's opinion.
<P>
FN12. Petitioner can derive no support from our statement in Virginia
v. American Bookseller's Assn., 484 U.S. 383, 397, 108 S.Ct. 636,
645, 98 L.Ed.2d
<P>
782 (1988), that &quot;the statute must be 'readily susceptible'
to the limitation; we will not rewrite a state law to conform
it to constitutional requirements.&quot; In American Bookseller's,
no state court had construed the language in dispute. In that
instance, we certified a question to the state court so that it
would have an opportunity to provide a narrowing interpretation.
Ibid. In Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216,
95 S.Ct. 2268, 2276, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975), the other case upon
which petitioner principally relies, we observed not only that
the ordinance at issue was not &quot;by its plain terms ... easily
susceptible of a narrowing construction,&quot; but that the state
courts had made no effort to restrict the scope of the statute
when it was challenged on overbreadth grounds.
<P>
FN13. Although the First Amendment protects offensive speech,
Johnson v. Texas, 491 U.S., at 414, 109 S.Ct., at 2544, it does
not require us to be subjected to such expression at all times,
in all settings. We have held that such expression may be proscribed
when it intrudes upon a &quot;captive audience.&quot; Frisby v.
Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 484-485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2502-2503, 101
L.Ed.2d 420 (1988); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726,
748-749, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3040-3041, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). And
expression may be limited when it merges into conduct. United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672
(1968); cf. Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106
S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986). However, because of the
manner in which the Minnesota Supreme Court construed the St.
Paul ordinance, those issues are not before us in this case.
<P>
FN1. The Court disputes this characterization because it has crafted
two exceptions, one for &quot;certain media or markets&quot; and
the other for content discrimination based upon &quot;the very
reason that the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.&quot;
Ante, at 2545. These exceptions are, at best, ill-defined. The
Court does not tell us whether, with respect to the former, fighting
words such as cross-burning could be proscribed only in certain
neighborhoods where the threat of violence is particularly severe,
or whether, with respect to the second category, fighting words
that create a particular risk of harm (such as a race riot) would
be proscribable. The hypothetical and illusory category of these
two exceptions persuades me that either my description of the
Court's analysis is accurate or that the Court does not in fact
mean much of what it says in its opinion.
<P>
*2571_ FN2. See Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct.
1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference
v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d
464 (1961).
<P>
FN3. See also Packer Corp v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105, 52 S.Ct. 273,
76 L.Ed. 643 (1932) (Brandeis, J.) (upholding a statute that prohibited
the advertisement of cigarettes on billboards and street-car placards).
<P>
FN4. The Court states that the prohibition on content-based regulations
&quot;applies differently in the context of proscribable speech&quot;
than in the context of other speech, ante, at 2545, but its analysis
belies that claim. The Court strikes down the St. Paul ordinance
because it regulates fighting words based on subject matter, despite
the fact that, as demonstrated above, we have long upheld regulations
of commercial speech based on subject matter. The Court's self-description
is inapt: By prohibiting the regulation of fighting words based
on its subject matter, the Court provides the same protection
to fighting words as is currently provided to core political speech.
<P>
FN5. &quot;A word,&quot; as Justice Holmes has noted, &quot;is
not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a
living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according
to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.&quot; Towne
v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425, 38 S.Ct. 158, 159, 62 L.Ed. 372
(1918); see also Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 201, 84 S.Ct.
1676, 1685, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (Warren, C.J., dissenting).
<P>
FN6. Cf. In re Chase, 468 F.2d 128, 139-140 (CA7 1972) (Stevens,
J., dissenting) (arguing that defendant who, for reasons of religious
belief, refused to rise and stand as the trial judge entered the
courtroom was not subject to contempt proceedings because he was
not present in the courtroom &quot;as a matter of choice&quot;).
<P>
FN7. Although the Court has sometimes suggested that subject-matter
based and viewpoint-based regulations are equally problematic,
see, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Service Comm'n
of N.Y., 447 U.S., at 537, 100 S.Ct., at 2338, our decisions belie
such claims.
<P>
FN8. The Court makes much of St. Paul's description of the ordinance
as regulating &quot;a message.&quot; Ante, at 2548. As always,
however, St. Paul's argument must be read in context:
<P>
&quot;Finally, we ask the Court to reflect on the 'content' of
the 'expressive conduct' represented by a 'burning cross.' It
is no less than the first step in an act of racial violence. It
was and unfortunately still is the equivalent of [the] waving
of a knife before the thrust, the pointing of a gun before it
is fired, the lighting of the match before the arson, the hanging
of the noose before the lynching. It is not a political statement,
or even a cowardly statement of hatred. It is the first step in
an act of assault. It can be no more protected than holding a
gun to a victim['s] head. It is perhaps the ultimate expression
of 'fighting words.' &quot; App. to Brief for Petitioner C-6.
<P>
FN9. The Court contends that this distinction is &quot;wordplay,&quot;
reasoning that &quot;[w]hat makes [the harms caused by race-based
threats] distinct from [the harms] produced by other fighting
words is ... the fact that [the former are] caused by a distinctive
idea.&quot; Ante, at 2548 (emphasis added). In this way, the Court
concludes that regulating speech based on the injury it causes
is no different from regulating speech based on its subject matter.
This analysis fundamentally miscomprehends the role of &quot;race,
color, creed, religion [and] gender&quot; in contemporary American
society. One need look no further than the recent social unrest
in the Nation's cities to see that race-based threats may cause
more harm to society and to individuals than other threats. Just
as the statute prohibiting threats against the President is justifiable
because of the place of the President in our social and political
order, so a statute prohibiting race-based threats is justifiable
because of the place of race in our social and political order.
Although it is regrettable that race occupies such a place and
is so incendiary an issue, until the Nation matures beyond that
condition, laws such as St. Paul's ordinance will remain reasonable
and justifiable.
<P>
*2571_ FN10. Cf. FCC v. League of Women Voters of California,
468 U.S. 364, 418, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3137, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984)
(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (&quot;In this case ... the regulation
applies ... to a defined class of ... licensees [who] represent
heterogenous points of view. There is simply no sensible basis
for considering this regulation a viewpoint restriction--or ...
to condemn it as 'content-based'--because it applies equally to
station owners of all shades of opinion&quot;

<H1><CENTER>Bob Dole's &quot;Vision&quot; May Soon Clear Up</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>The campaign of 1996 will get out of the summer Doledrums when the prospective
GOP standard-bearer announces his economic program. If that program is ambitious
in scope, joining a growth package of and tax reductions and spending controls
with a long term rescue of Social Security through private sector investments,
Bob Dole's supposed lack of a &quot;vision&quot; suddenly will disappear
as a political concern. A program simple in concept and profound in social
and economic implications, it would unite in common interest otherwise contending
generations and economic groups.<BR>
<BR>
The young, the working poor and much of the middle class, for whom high
payroll taxes and today's low-growth prosperity make saving exceedingly
difficult, would see the bulk of their Social Security tax finally put to
work as a genuine instrument for investment. Simultaneously, the effect
upon the nation's overall savings rate would give the United States the
higher growth rates that encourage real national and personal financial
progress.<BR>
<BR>
The risk in the package, of course, is raising the Social Security issue
in a politically charged atmosphere. The Clinton White House will be tempted
irresistibly to rouse the elderly against any change. Never mind that in
almost any reform plan Dole might endorse, protection of the elderly will
be guaranteed. The politics of misinformation that worked so well with Medicare
reform--where millions of dollars of Democratic and labor union TV ads persuaded
voters that a proposed reduction in the rate of growth of this entitlement
constituted a &quot;cut&quot;--will be used again to stigmatize reform of
Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
But several developments are pushing a cautious Dole to take up the challenge,
anyhow.<BR>
First, he desperately needs some new ideas. As is, his campaign is running
like a Kansas creek in a July drought. But something more than old-time
Republican deficit reductions is indicated. An economic plan that offers
ordinary workers a way to gain a share in national wealth-creation will
have broad and deep appeal. Without a forward-looking national agenda, on
the other hand, Dole's only hope is that the Clinton presidency self-destructs
in scandal. But even if it did, a victorious Dole would go into office without
a mandate for any particular program. <BR>
<BR>
Second, former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm's entry into the suddenly real
&quot;race&quot; for the Reform Party nomination puts the Social Security
issue on the table, in any case. He has met with key backers of the idea,
including Jose Pinera, the Chilean who successfully introduced it in his
country, and the proposal is now part of Lamm's avowed program. So the issue
will be debated nationally, regardless of what Dole or Clinton want or fear,
or, of course, how the more likely Reform Party nominee, Ross Perot, chooses
to characterize it. <BR>
<BR>
Lamm knows he is on to something. Young voters are especially excited about
the idea. When Steve Forbes proposed it in a debate at the University of
Arizona last spring he got a standing ovation from the largely youthful
audience and won that state's primary.<BR>
<BR>
The third development promoting a Dole decision to adopt broad reform as
an issue is the imminence of a report by the Clinton Administration's own
bi-partisan Social Security advisory commission. Having labored in obscurity
for two years, the panel is about to conclude that the best solution to
the Social Security system's problems is reform that takes advantage of
the power of the free market. (The worst solution, of course, is to raise
the already high payroll taxes and to cut benefits.)<BR>
<BR>
The 13 member commission is divided as to which of several specific approaches
is desirable. The main issues are whether all or only part of a worker's
12.4 percent Social Security tax should be invested in a savings and investment
account for him personally and how best to handle the transition from the
present system to an entirely new one.<BR>
<BR>
These are not minor questions. Without some of a taxpayers' payment going
to fund the transition costs of a new system, that transition becomes problematical.
On the other hand, unless a worker gets something close to full personal
advantage from the investment of his savings, the bright potential for him
and for the economy is reduced.<BR>
<BR>
These differences can be composed, but they need not be resolved in this
fall's campaign. Even if Dole (or Clinton, for that matter) were to embrace
a specific detailed plan, Congress would want to hold hearings and make
changes next spring. In fact, there are so many variations of the private
sector plan around now that endorsing one completely would assure criticism
from backers of other approaches. The same goes for a flat tax proposal
and a spending control plan.<BR>
<BR>
What matters is a general outline that combines the benefits of a flat or
flatter income tax with the conversion of Social Security from a fund whose
current (and temporary) surplus is used to subsidize the general budget
to one that helps individual workers invest. A flat tax without Social Security
reform could be seen as tilting toward the upper middle class and wealthy,
while Social Security reform by itself will not maximize economic growth.
The two together, along with spending controls, would help every worker
and family in the country. If Dole advocates such a package he will have
a central and unifying theme for his campaign. No more Bob Dull.<BR>
<BR>
As it happens, the last Kansan to be nominated for President, Dwight Eisenhower
in 1952, also was criticized in late summer for a campaign that was &quot;running
like a dry creek.&quot; But he managed to turn that campaign around with
a breakthrough international policy idea---&quot;I will go to Korea.&quot;
Economic reform to help average Americans could do the same for Bob Dole.

Each month, <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/bauer.html">Gary L. 
Bauer</a>, President of the Family Research Council, writes a letter 
to the friends of FRC that highlights a current topic, analyzes a key 
family issue, or describes an ongoing or new activity of the Council. 
These personal letters both describe the FRC President's perspective 
on the most pressing family issues and chronicle the development of 
FRC projects and programs to address those issues. These letters give 
friends of FRC an inside, in-depth look at the Council's work.

<title>Gary Bauer's January, 1997 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

January 3, 1997

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

On January 22, our nation will mark the 24th anniversary of the
Supreme Court decisions that elevated a choice for death to the
level of national policy.  In <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and its companion
case, <I>Doe v. Bolton</I>, seven men dressed in black robes delivered
a cruel blow that continues to reverberate throughout our land.
Those seven Justices, arrogant and unelected, elevated abortion
on demand to a status of grand Constitutional privilege.  The
chilling effects of their ruling have not stopped even to this
day, as a culture of death continues to descend across this good
and decent land.

<p>

Just how deeply a nation can sink into a depraved indifference
to human life was vividly illustrated recently in Delaware.  There,
prosecutors charge, two unwed college students -- Brian Peterson,
Jr. and Amy Grossberg -- entered a hotel for the express purpose
of giving birth to their firstborn son.  What happened next, prosecutors
say, is horrible to contemplate.  On a cold November night, the
child was placed in a plastic bag and dropped outside in the hotel
dumpster, where maintenance workers later found his body.  The
dead baby had a fractured skull and other injuries that the coroner
attributes to blunt-force head trauma and shaking.

<p>

Reaction to this case has been extraordinary.  Many columnists
have noted the fact that Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are
among those society would call its &quot;fortunate souls.&quot;
They come from well-to-do families; they have had the best of
everything.  As the <I>New York Times</I> reported it, they &quot;grew
up where many teenagers have their own cars and secure futures,
where gardeners tend landscaped lawns and shrubs[.]&quot;[1] They
do not live in some remote, forsaken corner of the world, or in
a culture where out-of-wedlock childbearing is rare or scorned.
They come from prosperous families in a populous state (New Jersey),
at a time when unwed pregnancy is so common that, apparently,
no one at Amy Grossberg's college even discussed with her the
fact that she was clearly on the verge of childbirth.

<p>

These young people are entitled to the legal presumption of innocence,
of course, so we will withhold our judgment about what happened
in that hotel room.  But we don't have to wait to react to what
is being said about their case by the swarms of psychologists
and lawyers now descending on Delaware.  Getting at the truth
seems far down on the list of priorities for these apologists.
One commentator regretted that Peterson and Grossberg had not
gone to New Jersey's local Planned Parenthood, where their problem
could have been averted by the nation's largest abortion provider.
New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has led the fight
to remove the pro-life plank from the Republican platform, talked
vaguely about the couple's failure to consider adoption and &quot;other
options.&quot;  Charles Oberly, Amy Grossberg's attorney, with
no hint that he was merely trying to shift the blame to Peterson,
told <I>The New York Times</I> that &quot;[t]here is a serious
question whether this woman did anything criminal.&quot;[2]

<p>

Now, it may be true that both of these privileged young adults
are &quot;all-American kids.&quot;  It may be, as their lawyer
claims, that they were panic-stricken and irrational to the point
of insanity in that hotel room.  But it might also be the case
that they engaged in an act of calculated rationality.  Columnist
George Will put his finger on this exactly when he pointed out
how, under only slightly different circumstances, Peterson and
Grossberg could have found themselves visiting the White House
for a veto ceremony instead of standing before a grand jury in
Delaware. &quot;Don't young people read newspapers?&quot; he
wrote. &quot;Don't they know that, thanks to President Clinton,
they could have <I>chosen</I> to have a doctor suck their baby's
brains out, and Delaware would not have <I>chosen</I> to charge
them with murder?&quot;[3]

<p>

In the world in which we now live, it is surely possible that
two 18-year-olds could not see the logical and rational difference
between dropping their baby boy into a dumpster and dropping by
the New Jersey clinic that has performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions
in a single year.  And if there is no rational difference between
these two actions, why then would society insist on punishment
for the one deed and presidential praise for the right to do the
other?

<p>

This is where the abortion culture has led us in January 1997.
On the 8th of this month, the Supreme Court of the United States
will hear a case that will determine whether or not there is an
individual constitutional right to commit suicide with the aid
of another.  Lawyers for our side, including FRC's own Cathy Cleaver,
have argued strenuously in legal briefs to the court not only
that no such right exists, but that to invent it would be to open
the floodgates to the wholesale &quot;termination&quot; of the
elderly and severely handicapped.  We have many allies on this
issue -- and compelling arguments -- but at this writing we are
keenly aware that the odds are against us: the Supreme Court is
radically liberal on social issues, and both federal appeals courts
in this case have held that the states may not restrict assisted
suicide.

<p>

In Michigan, Jack Kevorkian has claimed at least 45 victims. 
This pathological ex-pathologist, whose obsession with death includes
painting pictures that feature Nazi images and human cannibalism,
has so far evaded the condemnation of jurors.  The media depicts
him as a hero and trail-blazer.  He depicts himself as a latter-day
Thomas Jefferson, while conveniently forgetting all the while
the words of Jefferson, who said that &quot;[t]he care of human
life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the sole legitimate
object of good government.&quot;

<p>

How then can we restore respect for the sanctity of human life?
The Family Research Council is determined to do its part.  We
will continue to battle in the courts, as we have done in opposing
assisted suicide and defending the right of pro-life sidewalk
counselors to offer aid to those entering abortion clinics.[4] We
will continue to address our case to the Congress, urging the
adoption of legislation to ban partial-birth abortions and to
provide legal protection for human life from conception until
natural death.  And we will keep the pressure on Bill Clinton
and Al Gore to reverse their pro-abortion policies.  As long as
we have breath in us to speak, we will remind those in office
of their sacred duty to defend the weak and the helpless.

<p>

We will also continue to conduct research and to publish analysis,
both legal and social, of the key issues under debate.  This month,
we are releasing two more contributions to this effort.  Gracie
Hsu and Robert G. Morrison of my staff have joined with me in
preparing a comprehensive statement on the sanctity of human life.
We approached this task humbly, knowing that many great writers
and thinkers have addressed this subject more powerfully than
we ever could.  Still, we believe that Americans need a constant
recalling to the faith and vision of our founders and to the lessons
of our Judeo-Christian heritage.

<p>

It has been said over and over again that the abortion industry
is the most unregulated commercial enterprise in American history.
When a New Jersey newspaper revealed, as noted above, that a
clinic there had performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions in a
single year, it reported a startling fact that no power in state
government knew or wanted to know.  The information currently
being gathered about the number of abortions performed in America
and the harm these abortions do to women is woefully inadequate.
You can use the enclosed reply card to obtain a copy of FRC's
Special Report, <I>A Woman's Right (Not) to Know</I>, by Virginia
Delegate Robert G. Marshall.

<p>

January, of course, also marks the birthday of the Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr.  His speech at the Lincoln Memorial still resonates
throughout every corner of this land, too, because he invoked
the &quot;unalienable rights&quot; to life, liberty and happiness
that belong to all people not by virtue of their skin color or
utility, but by virtue of their humanity.  That humanity is holy
because it reflects the image and likeness of our Creator, a Creator
who loves us &quot;irrationally&quot; -- not according to our
merits or usefulness to Him -- but because he has <I>chosen</I>
to love us.

<p>

How like that love the noblest human love is.  I think of the
woman in our area of Virginia a few years back, who came home
to find her family's trailer ablaze.  Knowing that her two children
were inside, she rushed into the inferno to save them.  A firefighter
who tried to restrain her said that she was on fire the moment
she passed through the trailer door.  Her body was found outside
the room where the bodies of her two sons lay. <I>Irrational love.</I>

<p>

Or the heartrending footnote to that searing story of the young
boy in the Chicago housing project who was thrown to his death
from an upper floor by two 12-year-olds because he refused to
steal candy for them.  That act of gross disrespect for human
life was matched by the impossible act of love displayed by the
dead boy's 5-year-old brother, who raced down the stairs of the
high rise immediately after the incident.  Asked by a counselor
what was going through his mind, the little boy said he had hoped
to catch his brother before he hit the ground.  <I>Irrational
love.</I>

<p>

Or, finally, the young police officer in Tennessee, struck by
a bullet in the line of duty, who lay in a &quot;persistent vegetative
state.&quot;  (That's an awful term for a physical condition that
none of us can fully comprehend.)  One day, after several years
of this coma-like condition, the officer awoke for a brief time,
recognized his children, and spoke to them.  His brother rushed
to the hospital to be with him.  When the press asked the brother
what his reaction was to so many years of waiting and worrying,
he said that it was worth it all just to be able to tell his brother
that he loved him, and to be understood.

<p>

My friends, these are acts of irrational love -- performed out
of profound, reflexive respect for the sanctity of human life.
All around us in 1997, there are signs that affirm this kind
of love, but unfortunately there are also many other signs that
tell us we have lost our way -- a way of service and sacrifice
on behalf of those who desperately need us.

<p>

In the days to come, let us all pray that our Supreme Court, our
Congress and our President will recover their sense of direction
and help this nation, once again, become a beacon to the oppressed,
a Shining City on a Hill.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  As always, your partnership with us is essential to our
success.  We thank God for all you do to make our work possible.
Your generosity and your prayers, your friendship and notes of
encouragement -- these things mean more to me that you will ever
know. I pray that you and your family will enjoy all of God's blessings
in 1997.

Richard Weaver's seminal book "Ideas Have Consequences" could be our theme today, despite the fact that it was published almost 50 years ago. The remarkable growth of the Internet proves again the power of ideas to reshape how Americans communicate with each other, and the world. <p>
The Heritage Foundation's World Wide Web site was created to spread the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense, the same ideas which caused a political revolution in the 1994 elections. As Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich declared just after the election: "Heritage is, without question, the most far-reaching conservative
organization in the country in the war of ideas, and one which has had a tremendous impact not just in Washington, but literally across the planet." 
<p>
As a leader in both the political and communications revolutions taking place today, The Heritage Foundation will continue to demonstrate the power of our ideas well into the 21st century.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Coming Jewish Conservatism</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><I>From The Washington Times Tuesday, September 26, 1995:</I><H1><CENTER><BR>The Coming Jewish Conservatism </CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I>Adam Pruzan </I></CENTER></H3><IMG SRC="rainbow.gif" WIDTH="793" HEIGHT="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom><BR><BR>For most of this century, American Jews, liberalism and the Democratic Partyhave gone together like bagels, lox and cream cheese. At the present, wecan expect this cozy relationship to continue. However, to borrow PresidentClinton's favorite word, Jewish liberals will increasingly have to contendwith change - and it will not be an easy task. <BR><BR>Liberalism has already changed. From a broad national consensus, in favorof equal opportunity, individual rights, popular sovereignty and economicgrowth, modern liberalism has become a minority ideology, supporting equalityof income, groups rights, the rule of the elite, and redistributionist economics.<BR><BR>Judaism continues to change. The Orthodox community, the largest potentialsource of Jewish conservatives, remains relatively small, but it is growingand vibrant. At the same time, the liberal denominations (including Reformand Conservative Judaism - the latter not to be confused with Jewish conservatism)have sadly become little more than comfortable exit doors through whichgrandchildren, if not the kids themselves, leave the faith. With intermarriagerates over 50 percent we can readily understand Rabbi Alexander Schindler,leader of the Reform movement, when he calls for proselytizing - the firstsuch appeal in Jewish history. <BR><BR>And, of course, the Democratic Party has changed. Others have chronciledand catalogued those changes far better than I could do; for our presentpurpose, it will suffice simply to restate the post-November bottom line:minority party. While our liberal coreligionists deal with these changes,Jewish conservatives should be prepared for an eventual shift within ourfaith that will mirror what has already occurred in the country as a whole.Such a transformation may not happen for decades, but we should understandits underlying dynamics, and do whatever we can to advance the process.To that end I offer the following guideposts. <BR><BR>First, let us steel ourselves for a long and difficult struggle. Jewishdemographics illustrate the problem. Reckoning conservatively (as conservativesshould), we estimate that America has 4 million voting Jews, that only 20percent vote Republican and that only 20 percent of those are real conservatives(the other 80 percent might be Jacob Javits types). This leaves us withonly 160,000 Jewish conservatives. <BR><BR>That number should both sober and encourage us. Although a minority withina minority, we can still comfortably fund an influential national organization,plus a periodical or two. We can partner effectively with far larger Christianconservative groups, benefiting from their size and influence while helpingto guard their flanks. We can offer the major media interesting &quot;manbites dog&quot; stories, potentially gaining exposure disproportionate toour numbers. (The radical feminists have done this for years). <BR><BR>Second, realize that an imbryonic Jewish conservative movement has muchmore intellectual firepower at its disposal than did the original conservativeleadership at a comparable state of development (say, 1955). This newspaper,the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, National Reviews, Commentary andthe American Spectator have all published Jewish conservatives by the score.<BR><BR>Third, get comfortable with putting religion into politics. We must do asour liberal brethren do, not as they say. The Reform movement calls itsWashington office, headed by a rabbi, the Religious Action Center. <BR><BR>Liberal Jews, unabashadly proclaim the religious authority of our sacredtexts, liberal Jews invoke the Talmudic principle of tikkum olam, the repairof the world. For them, &quot;repair&quot; includes active support for thehomosexual, feminist and abortion-rights agendas, the welfare state, andthe NEA. At the same time, liberal Jews vilify conservative Christians forsimilarly acting on their religious beliefs. <BR><BR>By definition, any religious-based attempt to repair the world must involveimposing on others. Modern Jewish liberals do this, so did President LIncoln.In his second inaugral address, a speech of fewer than 700 words, Mr. Lincolninvoked God six times and quoted the Bible three times. Lincoln put religionin politics to justify the Union imposing its values on the Confederacy.<BR><BR>Lincoln acted &quot;with malice toward none, with charity for all and withfirmness in the right as God gives us to se the right.&quot; That is thekind of whole-hearted, noble conviction our conservative Christian friendsshould bring into politics and we should follow their example. <BR><BR>God made our ancestors wander in the desert for 40 years before they couldcross into the Promised Land. Generations inured to slavery and sin hadto pass on before we could fulfill our destiny. Likewise, the Jews who newRoosevelt, Kennedy and Johnson may never turn to conservatism; it couldtake a generation or more for our community to catch up with the Americanelectorate. So we should be patient, but we should also move as far in theright direction as we can. As Rabbi Tarfon said two thousand years ago,&quot;it is not upon you to complete the task, but neither are you freeto withdraw from it.&quot; <BR><P><CENTER><B><I>Adam Pruzan is Vice President of Toward Tradition, a Seattle-based coalition of Jewish conservatives, and an adjunct fellow of DiscoveryInstitute. <BR></I><IMG SRC="rwbline2.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR></B></CENTER><H2><CENTER><A HREF="front.html">Discovery Publications</A></CENTER></H2><P><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="50" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Home</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<h2>Suddenly losing the war against drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[President Bush] hasn t fought a real war on crime and drugs, I will."</I><br>
	-Bill Clinton, Democratic National Convention, July 16, 1992.<p>

During the first half of the Clinton presidency, the morally serious and tough-minded anti-drug policies of the Reagan and Bush years have been replaced with such Clinton-era messages as the president's infamous "I didn't inhale" comment and the former Surgeon General's repeated calls to study the legalization of drugs.<p>

Enforcement has been de-emphasized and Attorney General Janet Reno has decried the harshness of federal mandatory minimum prison terms for drug crimes, complaining that too many dealers are in prison.  Over the past two years, the administration and its Democratic congressional allies have slashed drug interdiction and domestic drug eradication activities.  Offering enforcement assistance to -- and if that did not work, sanctioning -- foreign countries where cocaine and other drugs are produced and shipped to the US. has ceased to be a foreign policy priority.  And the Clinton administration's announced priority?  Drug treatment.  Yet neither the president nor the Democratic leaders in the 103rd Congress provided the treatment resources they said were needed most.  In this area, as in so many others, the President al said one thing and did another.<p>

The results of the administration's indifference are now in.  And they are not good.<p>

Last July, the White House released a "Pulse Check" on "national trends in drug abuse" reporting that supplies of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other illegal drugs were plentiful.  And in mid-December, the Clinton administration announced that, in 1994, illegal drug use by teenagers -- specifically 8th, 10th, and 12th graders -- rose sharply in 1994.  (See chart.)<p>

In response, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University warned, "If historical trends continue, the jump in marijuana use among America's children (age 12-18) from 1992 to 1994 signals that 820,000 more of 3 these children will try cocaine in their lifetime.  Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts."<p>

The administration also revealed that drug-related emergency-room cases-- dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts -- have reached the highest levels ever, in reporting going back to 1978.  Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to record levels.<p>

Put another way: if these trends continue, by 1996, the Clinton administration will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern American history. And this will have occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992, and a reduction of almost 30 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992.<p>

President Clinton has shown little concern about the carnage drugs cause.  Where violent street crime once seemed to be fed largely by battles between cocaine and crack dealers, drug testing of urban arrestees reveals most of them are drug users and under the influence of drugs when they commit a wide array of violent crimes.<p>

Drug use is also a major contributing factor to child abuse. Last April, Newsweek magazine published a long article on child abuse. It reported what those working in the field have known for years: "Drugs now suffuse 80 percent of the caseload; sexual and physical assaults that once taxed the imagination are now common." In the same month, The New York Times Magazine ran a cover story which profiled of a group of homeless, street people in New York City.  All the individuals featured in the article were drug addicts.  Whether it is violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, or inner-city poverty, drugs, -- and in particular crack cocaine -- have made those social pathologies far more acute and in some places, unmanageable.  While there are other factors contributing to these pathologies, it is crack that sustains the violence that is ripping apart large segments of American society.<p>

We believe two myths present serious obstacles to reducing such drug use.  First is the mantra that the root causes of drug use are poverty, racism and slow self-esteem."  And second is the more general view that therapy by a team of counselors, physicians and specialists is the only effective way to reduce drug use.  At their core these myths deny individual responsibility and, assume that drug use is not the product of an individual's decision, and that decisions are somehow made in a vacuum where things like f ear of getting caught, public disgrace and punishment are never considerations.  This attitude is precisely what got us in trouble in the first place.  Reversing the new drug epidemic and finishing the job of the Reagan and Bush years, requires restoring common sense about the drug problem and a recognition of the primary importance of the things contemporary liberalism has sought to discredit: enforcement, individual responsibility, and reducing the supply of drugs on our streets.<p>

Drug enforcement and individual responsibility are important because drug use can be intensely pleasurable.  The desire for drugs must be countered by certain moral precepts: drug use is wrong and those who use and traffic in illegal drugs deserve to be punished.  A responsible community teaches these things by what those in positions of authority -- parents religious leaders, teachers, friends, employers and political officials -- say about drugs and how they act toward drug use and sale.  If those in authority do not address the issue seriously, they teach that drug use is not a serious matter. And if they say
 drug use is intolerable but fail to act effectively to stop and punish those who sell and use drugs, their actions convey a much more powerful lesson than their words.<p>

Reducing the supply of drugs is important because drug use -- whether by non-addicts or
 addict -- is fueled by the desire to use and by the ease with which those who want drugs can obtain them. A nation that permits wide availability of dangerous drugs is sending its citizens particularly its youngest citizens an unwitting message: We are indifferent to drug use. The harsh reality is that drug use begins with experimentation, with a substantial portion escalating to addiction, which often ends in death. A free democratic society ought to display a special intolerance for those things that destroy people's
 virtue and eventually, destroy people's lives.<p>

There are some who believe the drug war is unwinnable.  They argue that the federal government has spent enormous sums of money to no effect and they assert that the drug trade is too rich and too powerful to be defeated. This is the "big lie" about the drug problem, and it is demonstrably false  The success of the 1980's gives witness to the lie.<p>

First the energy and resources devoted to the anti-drug effort during the last two administrations, combined with hardening public attitudes, produced dramatic declines in the drug problem. No other contemporary social pathology has declined by 50-80 percent.  The drug war was a huge domestic policy success that some have simply denied and are now dismantling.<p>

Second, while federal spending on the drug war was substantial, it only approached $12 billion at the end of the Bush years. At no time did such spending exceed federal spending for, say, NASA. The point here is that neither the space program nor the federal and-drug effort ever represented a serious burden in terms of the federal budget And busting the budget today is not required either. In fact, for the president to devote only a modicum of his valuable time seriously, to the drug issue can make a significant difference.<p>

Finally, there is no question that the drug trade has created some very wealthy and powerful criminals here and abroad. But they are not invincible. They corrupt and terrorize third-world countries and inner-city communities, largely because they are not seriously challenged. In 1989, Pablo Escobar was the well-known king of the Medellin Cartel, the seemingly unconquerable "King of Cocaine." A year later he was on the run. Eventually, even the corruption-plagued Colombian government was able to hunt him down and destroy the Medellin Cartel in the process.<p>

Our drug problem will continue to get worse until we once again pursue responsible, intelligent, and tough-minded policies. We have the means, it is simply a matter of whether we have the will. Consider this question: what would be the national response if a foreign-produced poison was contributing to the large-scale killing of white children in Chevy Chase, or Scarsdale, or Scottsdale? Would we have long debates about "root causes" -- or would we do whatever it took to close open-air drug markets, put an end to the killing, and stop the poison from reaching our children? We all know the answer to this question. It's time federal policy showed the same kind of concern for poor black inner city residents as it does for residents of upper middle class white neighborhoods.<p>

    <TITLE>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<I>From Friday November 3, 1995 Seattle Post Intelligencer:<BR>
</I>
<H1><CENTER>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism is Not Unique to Quebec </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by <BR>
Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>What do you follow in politics, economics or your heart? The moral discipline
of the market or the lure of memory? Your future as an individual or the
passions of your group? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Quebec was asked such questions this week, it split almost neatly in
two. And so might many of us. Indeed, what Canada faced, and will face,
is not dissimilar to what America faces and much of the world faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By a victory margin of only one percent, the decent, muddle-through confederation
of Canada--engaging affection not because of its pride, but because of its
humility--managed to hold on to just enough of the French-speaking community
to give it a reprieve from permanent division. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We now see, moreover, that what was averted may have been worse than even
the loss of a major province; namely, a complete breakup. When it seemed
that the &quot;sovereignist&quot; side might prevail in Quebec, large crowds
nationwide rallied 'round the Maple Leaf; and in that sense, Canada at last
found its patriotic voice. But at the same time, some commentators began
to re-investigate old arguments for an independent British Columbia, Alberta
or Ontario. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Gibson of the Fraser Institute in Vancouver, whose <I>Thirty Million
Musketeers: One Canada for All Canadians</I> , has just been published,
warned that a &quot;majority-plus-one 'yes' vote&quot; in Quebec very quickly
might result in several nation-states emerging across the broad pink map
that now represents Canada. But Quebec, voting a majority-plus-one percent
&quot;no,&quot; did not secede, for the moment, though another attempt will
be made in a few years. In the long run, however, economics, the moral discipline
of the market and individualism--rather than ethnic nationalism--will prevail.
And, they should prevail. Je me souviens (&quot;I remember&quot;) is a bitter-sweet
ethnic sentiment, not a principle for just governance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the battered federalist victors in Monday's vote have another
chance to revise political Canada. One way to try to prevent dissolution
is devolution. Not just heavily subsidized Quebec, but also the relatively
well-off provinces of Ontario, B.C. and Alberta, want more power to make
policies on pensions, labor training and economic development. Driven by
the brutal demands of Canada's federal debt--roughly $400 billion U.S. dollars--and
huge provincial debts, too, the governing Liberal Party in Ottawa may well
agree. Otherwise, as Gordon Gibson notes, the twin to the danger of losing
Quebec will be losing Canada's sovereignty to foreign credit markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Along the way, as federal power is devolved to the provinces, the level
of federal funding will be cut. Taxes probably will not go up, however,
and eventually must come down, for political as well as economic reasons;
Canadians are punished by high taxation and are showing interest in the
supply-side economics of the relatively new Reform Party. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If cutting spending and devolution sound like an echo of the policies of
the Republican Congress elected last year in the United States, that is
because these trends are, in fact, widespread. Pruning back years of government
growth, privatizing and decentralizing are logical responses to increasing
global economic competition. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The frugality medicine is hard enough to swallow in the United States, but
Canada is likely to gag on it. But, one of the reasons for the strong separatist
vote in Quebec is the poor state of the Canadian economy, and the main reason
for the poor economy--high unemployment, high interest rates, sagging dollar--is
government's refusal until now to take the medicine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The moral discipline of the market does lead to economic--and social--health,
that is the good news. You can see the results in the recent improvements
in such far-flung countries as Chile, New Zealand, the Czech Republic and
Estonia. The government of President Meri of Estonia, who visited Seattle
this week, cut taxes and eliminated tariffs and reports a sustained six
percent growth rate, in contrast to dawdling, centralist Russia, next door.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Estonians also have the second highest per capita Internet use in Eastern
Europe (after Finland). High technology, indeed, is another force for decentralization
and greater economic freedom world wide. The Internet is almost an emblem
of what is happening to communication and commerce today. It ignores national
borders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But does this free and open world, with its economy driven by high technology,
sound a bit frightening? If you feel that way, you have company in more
places than Quebec. In Eastern Europe, for example, the collapse of communism
caused even more fear than pain and often stimulated an escape to the seemingly
warm hearth of ethnic nationalism. Chechnya, Bosnia and the peaceful but
foolish secession of Slovakia from its Czech partner show the devastating
consequences of that illusion. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In our own country, we only have to get over two generations' growth of
the welfare state, not totalitarian socialism. But the appeal of ethnic
nationalism is strong here, too, as witness the black separatist ambitions
(though now ambiguous) of Louis Farrakhan. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you are, if you are hurting and fearful, it is tempting to nourish
your resentments and to imagine that you are stronger in a group-- racial,
ethnic, religious, geographic, gender, or whatever. The group, you find,
derives its justification in grievances against some other group. If only
you can remember past wrongs to the group and elevate the group identity
to your all-purpose answer, you can forget the moral discipline of the market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The American Founders and the classical liberal economists had a different
vision: of personal liberty and personal responsibility. The Canadians have
their own version of the same understanding. Because it respects all individuals
as equal before God and the law, this vision benefits society as a whole.
It tries, at least, to see you for yourself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For people have souls as well as hearts, and souls do not go to heaven in
groups, but one by one.<BR>

<h3>William J. Bennett Discusses Abortion Controversy</h3> 
 
 
<b>Address to the Catholic Campaign for America 
<br>Washington, D.C.</b> 
<P><i>November 17, 1995</i></center><P>
<hr> 
<P> 
	As Catholics of the Catholic Campaign for America, we must address without hesitation, and 
with proper moral seriousness, the issue of abortion in America.  One and a half million 
abortions performed every year -- of which the overwhelming majority are performed on 
perfectly healthy women in order to prevent the births of perfectly healthy children -- is a 
national shame and a national catastrophe.   
<P> 
	But not only is this catastrophic in itself -- indeed, it is virtually a definition of catastrophe -- 
it is also horrible in its consequences on the sensibilities of the American people.  There is 
little doubt that the 30 million abortions since 1973 have had a coarsening effect on a people's 
attitudes toward its children; it has diminished our sense of natality.  And it has accelerated 
the growth of what Pope John Paul  II has correctly called the "culture of death." 
<P> 
	In addressing the abortion issue, we should never abandon principle.  We should invite as 
many people as possible to the affirmation of our clear end: significant reduction of the 
number of abortions.   
<P> 
	But reasonable people of good will can and do disagree on the <i>means</i> to reducing 
abortions.  Some would push for various forms of criminalization, some would not. Some 
believe a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion is the surest and best way to go; 
others, in good faith, doubt this.  Differences aside, it seems to me we ought to bring to the 
cause all those who look at the figure of one and a half million abortions a year with horror 
and misgiving.  We can admit that yes, there are some hard, wrenching cases, cases on which 
people of good will disagree.  But let us set aside the small number of hard cases and focus 
our efforts on the vast majority of cases on which most Americans do not feel moral 
ambiguity. 
<P> 
	My own view is this:  I believe <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was wrongly decided and based on  
flawed legal reasoning;  I support legislative efforts to expand the boundaries of legal 
protection for the unborn (such as waiting periods, parental notification, restriction of 
abortions after viability, and other such measures); I oppose the use of public funds to pay for 
abortion;  and I strongly support pro-life alternatives such as adoption and abstinence. 
<P>
	As for the specific issue of a constitutional amendment, I know many people feel strongly 
about it.  But for myself, I do not think it has done much good, and I also believe there may 
well be drawbacks to it.  Above all, I believe it has done nothing to help reduce the number of 
abortions.  And that is, after all, the crucial issue in this debate: <i>how to reduce the number 
of abortions in America</i>.	 
<P> 
	Abortion is a moral issue and the law should reflect that fact.  Current law refuses to 
demonstrate to people that abortion is even a serious issue, much less a moral one.  Our efforts 
should be to infuse into the law a heightened sense of the spiritual and human dimensions of 
the issue.  Provisions which highlight and stress the morality of the issue -- waiting periods, 
information about fetal life and possible consequences for the mother, and parental 
notification among others -- should be pursued vigorously, on the state level.  And the recent 
effort to ban partial-birth abortions seems to me both tactically smart and morally sound. 
<P> 
	I believe that there is a pro-life agenda that is both incremental <i>and</i> principled, 
politically realistic <i>and</i> ambitious.  Our nation, as it is today, will sustain certain legal 
reforms: ending late-term abortions and sex selection abortions; promoting informed consent; 
and requiring parental notification to end the desperate isolation of pregnant teens and to 
promote responsibility, communication, and mature decision making.  That is where we ought 
to concentrate our legal efforts. 
<P> 
	I recognize that some pro-life groups will consider this kind of incremental approach as too 
little.  To which I respond: the approach I am advocating recognizes that social reform must 
respect political realities if we hope to restrict abortion-on-demand.  "Public sentiment is 
everything," Lincoln said of American democracy.  "With public sentiment, nothing can fail; 
without it, nothing can succeed.  Consequently, he who molds public sentiment, goes deeper 
than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces decisions.  He makes statutes and decisions 
possible or impossible to be executed."  
<P> 
	I believe this type of pro-life movement would find the support of the majority of Americans -
- including many Democrats who are deeply troubled by the massive number of abortions 
which take place every year.    
<P> 
	There is an instructive historical analogy to which we can turn.  Research by Professor Marvin 
Olasky (author of <i>Abortion Rites: A Social History of Abortion in America</i>) has 
revealed something that most Americans on both sides of the abortion debate do not 
understand.  At the outset of the Civil War the abortion rate, in a smaller U.S. population, was 
almost exactly what it is today.  A pro-life movement, based in a network of shelters, began to 
actively oppose abortion by providing refuge to women in trouble.  Institutions like YWCA, 
the Salvation Army, and Florence Crittenton homes concentrated their efforts among 
prostitutes and young, urban women, impregnated and abandoned.  These activists worked for 
small victories, provided women with positive, pro-life alternatives to abortion, and fought for 
laws while not making them their primary focus.  The result?  Between 1860 and 1910, this 
steady, compassionate social pressure reduced the rate of abortions by over half.  And the rate 
stayed low until about 1960.  This model -- what Olasky refers to as "containment" as a way 
to achieve "roll back" -- is precisely the model anti-abortion advocates should look to and 
learn from.  It is politically viable and ultimately more effective and life-affirming. 
<P> 
	In another historical analogy, some have compared abortion in this century with slavery a 
century-and-a-half ago.  Many defenders of the rights of blacks had differing views on which 
specific efforts to abolish slavery in a democratic republic would prove most expedient, 
prudent,  and fruitful.  These were passionate debates about an important issue.  I believe the 
course of action chosen by abolitionists like Harriet Tubman offers greater promise than the 
course chosen by John Brown.  Again, I think we could learn much from Lincoln -- who 
proposed containing slavery so as to put it on the path to extinction.  The spirit of both Harriet 
Tubman and Abraham Lincoln would well serve the pro-life movement today. 
<P> 
	Finally, I want to express my deep respect for the pro-life people who have labored long and 
hard and selflessly on behalf of the unborn.  I am speaking here of the people in the crisis 
pregnancy centers, adoption agencies, and foster homes around this country.  Their work is 
among the most admirable in the nation.  These are the people who are doing the most to 
contain and reduce the numbers of abortion in America.  They are unsung heroes of our 
Republic.  It is time we give them the praise they deserve.

<dd>A State University denied a religious student newspaper the right to apply for activity funds on the same terms as other student groups on the grounds that doing so would violate the Establishment Clause.  CIR, representing the students, argued that a government entity must be evenhanded in granting benefits, and that discrimination based solely on the newspaper's viewpoint was a violation of the Free Speech Clause.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two lower Courts found for the University, but the Supreme Court reversed 5-4 and found for the Students.  Current status: Remanded back to District Court where matter is pending.

Ronald W. ROSENBERGER, et al., Petitioners v.
<P>
RECTOR AND VISITORS OF the UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA et al.
<P>
No. 94-329.
<P>
Supreme Court of the United States
<P>
Argued March 1, 1995.
<P>
Decided June 29, 1995.
<P>
</center>
<P>
*2511
<P>
Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Respondent University of Virginia, a state instrumentality, authorizes
payments from its Student Activities Fund (SAF) to outside contractors
for the printing costs of a variety of publications issued by
student groups called &quot;Contracted Independent Organizations&quot;
(CIOs). The SAF receives its money from mandatory student fees
and is designed to support a broad range of extracurricular student
activities related to the University's educational purpose. CIOs
must include in their dealings with third parties and in all written
materials a disclaimer stating that they are independent of the
University and that the University is not responsible for them.
The University withheld authorization for payments to a printer
on behalf of petitioners' CIO, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), solely
because its student newspaper, Wide Awake:
<P>
A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia, *2512 &quot;primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality,&quot; as prohibited by the University's
SAF Guidelines. Petitioners filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. Sec.
1983, alleging, inter alia, that the refusal to authorize payment
violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.
<P>
After the District Court granted summary judgment for the University,
the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the University's invocation
of viewpoint discrimination to deny third-party payment violated
the Speech Clause, but concluding that the discrimination was
justified by the necessity of complying with the Establishment
Clause.
<P>
Held:
<P>
1. The Guideline invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms
and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their
right of free speech. Pp. 2516-2520.
<P>
(a) The Guideline violates the principles governing speech in
limited public forums, which apply to the SAF under, e.g., Perry
Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 46-47,
103 S.Ct. 948, 955-956, 74 L.Ed.2d 794. In determining whether
a State is acting within its power to preserve the limits it has
set for such a forum so that the exclusion of a class of speech
there is legitimate, see, e.g., id., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957,
this Court has observed a distinction between, on the one hand,
content discrimination-- i.e., discrimination against speech because
of its subject matter--which may be permissible if it preserves
the limited forum's purposes, and, on the other hand, viewpoint
discrimination--i.e., discrimination because of the speaker's
specific motivating ideology, opinion, or perspective--which is
presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise
within the forum's limitations, see id., at 46, 103 S.Ct., at
955. The most recent and most apposite case in this area is Lamb's
Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----,
----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 124 L.Ed.2d 352, in which the Court
held that permitting school property to be used for the presentation
of all views on an issue except those dealing with it from a religious
standpoint constitutes prohibited viewpoint discrimination. Here,
as in that case, the State's actions are properly interpreted
as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination rather than permissible
line-drawing based on content:
<P>
By the very terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does
not exclude religion as a subject matter, but selects for disfavored
treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial
viewpoints. Pp. 2516-2518.
<P>
(b) The University's attempt to escape the consequences of Lamb's
Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of funds
rather than access to facilities is unavailing. Although it may
regulate the content of expression when it is the speaker or when
it enlists private entities to convey its own message, Rust v.
Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233;
<P>
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 276, 102 S.Ct. 269, 277-278,
70 L.Ed.2d 440, the University may not discriminate based on the
viewpoint of private persons whose speech it subsidizes, Regan
v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 548, 103
S.Ct. 1997, 2002, 76 L.Ed.2d 129. Its argument that the scarcity
of public money may justify otherwise impermissible viewpoint
discrimination among private speakers is simply wrong. Pp. 2518-2520.
<P>
(c) Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here.
The Guideline at issue has a vast potential reach: The term &quot;promotes&quot;
as used there would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic
position that rests upon a belief (or nonbelief) in a deity or
ultimate reality, while the term &quot;manifests&quot; would bring
within the prohibition any writing resting upon a premise presupposing
the existence (or nonexistence) of a deity or ultimate reality.
It is difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would
be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection
to their ultimate philosophy. Pp. 2519-2520.
<P>
2. The violation following from the University's denial of SAF
support to petitioners is not excused by the necessity of complying
with the Establishment Clause. Pp. 2520-2525.
<P>
(a) The governmental program at issue is neutral toward religion.
Such neutrality is a significant factor in upholding programs
in *2513 the face of Establishment Clause attack, and the guarantee
of neutrality is not offended where, as here, the government follows
neutral criteria and even-handed policies to extend benefits to
recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints,
<P>
including religious ones, are broad and diverse, Board of Ed.
of Kiryas Joel v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481,
2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546. There is no suggestion that the University
created its program to advance religion or aid a religious cause.
The SAF's purpose is to open a forum for speech and to support
various student enterprises, including the publication of newspapers,
in recognition of the diversity and creativity of student life.
The SAF Guidelines have a separate classification for, and do
not make third-party payments on behalf of, &quot;religious organizations,&quot;
and WAP did not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial
viewpoint; it sought funding under the Guidelines as a &quot;student
... communications ... grou[p].&quot; Neutrality is also apparent
in the fact that the University has taken pains to disassociate
itself from the private speech involved in this case. The program's
neutrality distinguishes the student fees here from a tax levied
for the direct support of a church or group of churches, which
would violate the Establishment Clause. Pp. 2520-2523.
<P>
(b) This case is not controlled by the principle that special
Establishment Clause dangers exist where the government makes
direct money payments to sectarian institutions, see, e.g., Roemer
v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345,
49 L.Ed.2d 179, since it is undisputed that no public funds flow
directly into WAP's coffers under the program at issue. A public
university does not violate the Establishment Clause when it grants
access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide
spectrum of student groups, even if some of those groups would
use the facilities for devotional exercises. See e.g., Widmar,
454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274. This is so even where the
upkeep, maintenance, and repair of those facilities is paid out
of a student activities fund to which students are required to
contribute. Id., at 265, 102 S.Ct., at 272. There is no difference
in logic or principle, and certainly no difference of constitutional
significance, between using such funds to operate a facility to
which students have access, and paying a third-party contractor
to operate the facility on its behalf. That is all that is involved
here: The University provides printing services to a broad spectrum
of student newspapers. Were the contrary view to become law, the
University could only avoid a constitutional violation by scrutinizing
the content of student speech, lest it contain too great a religious
message. Such censorship would be far more inconsistent with the
Establishment Clause's dictates than would governmental provision
of secular printing services on a religion-blind basis. Pp. 2523-2525.

Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
The University of Virginia, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth
for which it is named and thus bound by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, authorizes the payment of outside contractors for
the printing costs of a variety of student publications. It withheld
any authorization for payments on behalf of petitioners for the
sole reason that their student paper &quot;primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality.&quot; That the paper did promote or manifest views within
the defined exclusion seems plain enough. The challenge is to
the University's regulation and its denial of authorization, the
case raising issues under the Speech and Establishment Clauses
of the First Amendment.
<P>

<P>
The public corporation we refer to as the &quot;University&quot;
is denominated by state law as &quot;the Rector and Visitors of
the University of Virginia,&quot; Va.Code Ann. Sec. 23-69 (1993),
and it is responsible for governing the school, see Secs. 23-69
to 23-80. Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, and ranked by him,
together with the authorship of the Declaration of Independence
and of the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Sec.
57-1, as one of his proudest achievements, the University is among
the Nation's oldest and most respected seats of higher learning.
It has more than 11,000 undergraduate students, and 6,000 graduate
and professional students. An understanding of the case requires
a somewhat detailed description of the program the University
created to support extracurricular student activities on its campus.
<P>
Before a student group is eligible to submit bills from its outside
contractors for payment by the fund described below, it must become
a &quot;Contracted Independent Organization&quot; (CIO). CIO status
is available to any group the majority of whose members are students,
whose managing officers are fulltime students, and that complies
with certain procedural requirements. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.
A CIO must file its constitution with the University; must pledge
not to discriminate in its membership; and must include in dealings
with third parties and in all written materials a disclaimer,
stating that the CIO is independent of the University and that
the University is not responsible for the CIO. App. 27-28. CIOs
enjoy access to University facilities, including meeting rooms
and computer terminals. Id., at 30. A standard agreement signed
between each CIO and the University provides that the benefits
and opportunities afforded to CIOs &quot;should not be misinterpreted
as meaning that those organizations are part of or controlled
by the University, that the University is responsible for the
organizations' contracts or other acts or omissions, or that the
University approves of the organizations' goals or activities.&quot;
Id., at 26.
<P>
All CIOs may exist and operate at the University, but some are
also entitled to apply for funds from the Student Activities Fund
(SAF). Established and governed by University Guidelines, the
purpose of the SAF is to support a broad range of extracurricular
student activities that &quot;are related to the educational purpose
of the University.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF is
based on the University's &quot;recogni[tion] that the availability
of a wide range of opportunities&quot; for its students &quot;tends
to enhance the University environment.&quot; App. 26. The Guidelines
require that it be administered &quot;in a manner consistent with
the educational purpose of the University as well as with state
and federal law.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF receives
its money from a mandatory fee of $14 per semester assessed to
each full-time student. The Student Council, elected by the students,
has the initial authority to disburse the funds, but its actions
are subject to review by a faculty body chaired by a designee
of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Cf. id., at 63a-64a.
<P>
Some, but not all, CIOs may submit disbursement requests to the
SAF. The Guidelines recognize 11 categories of student groups
that may seek payment to third-party contractors because they
&quot;are related to the educational purpose of the University
of Virginia.&quot; Id., at 61a-62a. One of these is &quot;student
news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communications
media groups.&quot;
<P>
Id., at 61a. The Guidelines also specify, however, that the costs
of certain activities of CIOs that are otherwise eligible for
funding will not be reimbursed by the SAF. The student activities
which are excluded from SAF support are religious activities,
philanthropic contributions and activities, political activities,
activities that would jeopardize the University's tax exempt status,
those which involve payment of honoraria or similar fees, or social
entertainment or related expenses. Id., at 62a-63a. The prohibition
on &quot;political activities&quot; is defined so that it is limited
to electioneering and lobbying. The Guidelines provide that &quot;[t]hese
restrictions on funding political activities are not intended
to preclude funding of any otherwise eligible student organization
which ... espouses particular positions or ideological viewpoints,
including those that may be *2515 unpopular or are not generally
accepted.&quot; Id., at 65a-66a. A &quot;religious activity,&quot;
by contrast, is defined as any activity that &quot;primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality.&quot; Id., at 66a.
<P>
The Guidelines prescribe these criteria for determining the amounts
of third-party disbursements that will be allowed on behalf of
each eligible student organization: the size of the group, its
financial self-sufficiency, and the University-wide benefit of
its activities. If an organization seeks SAF support, it must
submit its bills to the Student Council, which pays the organization's
creditors upon determining that the expenses are appropriate.
No direct payments are made to the student groups. During the
1990-1991 academic year, 343 student groups qualified as CIOs.
One hundred thirty-five of them applied for support from the SAF,
and 118 received funding. Fifteen of the groups were funded as
&quot;student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic
communications media groups.&quot;
<P>
Petitioners' organization, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), qualified
as a CIO. Formed by petitioner Ronald Rosenberger and other undergraduates
in 1990, WAP was established &quot;[t]o publish a magazine of
philosophical and religious expression,&quot; &quot;[t]o facilitate
discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance
of Christian viewpoints,&quot; and &quot;[t]o provide a unifying
focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds.&quot; App.
67. WAP publishes Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University
of Virginia. The paper's Christian viewpoint was evident from
the first issue, in which its editors wrote that the journal &quot;offers
a Christian perspective on both personal and community issues,
especially those relevant to college students at the University
of Virginia.&quot; App. 45. The editors committed the paper to
a two-fold mission: &quot;to challenge Christians to live, in
word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage
students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ
means.&quot; Ibid. The first issue had articles about racism,
crisis pregnancy, stress, prayer, C.S. Lewis' ideas about evil
and free will, and reviews of religious music. In the next two
issues, Wide Awake featured stories about homosexuality, Christian
missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music reviews
and interviews with University professors. Each page of Wide Awake,
and the end of each article or review, is marked by a cross. The
advertisements carried in Wide Awake also reveal the Christian
perspective of the journal. For the most part, the advertisers
are churches, centers for Christian study, or Christian bookstores.
By June 1992, WAP had distributed about 5,000 copies of Wide Awake
to University students, free of charge.
<P>
WAP had acquired CIO status soon after it was organized. This
is an important consideration in this case, for had it been a
&quot;religious organization,&quot; WAP would not have been accorded
CIO status. As defined by the Guidelines, a &quot;religious organization&quot;
is &quot;an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.&quot; App. to Pet.
for Cert. 66a. At no stage in this controversy has the University
contended that WAP is such an organization.
<P>
A few months after being given CIO status, WAP requested the SAF
to pay its printer $5,862 for the costs of printing its newspaper.
The Appropriations Committee of the Student Council denied WAP's
request on the ground that Wide Awake was a &quot;religious activity&quot;
within the meaning of the Guidelines, i.e., that the newspaper
&quot;promote[d] or manifest[ed] a particular belie[f] in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot; Ibid. It made its determination
after examining the first issue. App. 54. WAP appealed the denial
to the full Stud ent Council, contending that WAP met all the
applicable Guidelines and that denial of SAF support on the basis
of the magazine's religious perspective violated the Constitution.
The appeal was denied without further comment, and WAP appealed
to the next level, the Student Activities Committee. In a letter
signed by the Dean of Students, the committee sustained the denial
of funding. App. 55.
<P>
Having no further recourse within the University structure, WAP,
Wide Awake, and three of its editors and members filed suit in
*2516 the United States District Court for the Western District
of Virginia, challenging the SAF's action as violative of Rev.Stat.
Sec. 1979, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. They alleged that refusal to authorize
payment of the printing costs of the publication, solely on the
basis of its religious editorial viewpoint, violated their rights
to freedom of speech and press, to the free exercise of religion,
and to equal protection of the law. They relied also upon Article
I of the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs. 57-1, 57-2 (1986 and Supp.1994), but
did not pursue those theories on appeal. The suit sought damages
for the costs of printing the paper, injunctive and declaratory
relief, and attorney's fees.
<P>
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled
for the University, holding that denial of SAF support was not
an impermissible content or viewpoint discrimination against petitioners'
speech, and that the University's Establishment Clause concern
over its &quot;religious activities&quot; was a sufficient justification
for denying payment to third-party contractors. The court did
not issue a definitive ruling on whether reimbursement, had it
been made here, would or would not have violated the Establishment
Clause. 795 F.Supp. 175, 181-182 (WD Va.1992).
<P>
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in
disagreement with the District Court, held that the Guidelines
did discriminate on the basis of content. It ruled that, while
the State need not underwrite speech, there was a presumptive
violation of the Speech Clause when viewpoint discrimination was
invoked to deny third-party payment otherwise available to CIOs.
18 F.3d 269, 279-281 (1994). The Court of Appeals affirmed the
judgment of the District Court nonetheless, concluding that the
discrimination by the University was justified by the &quot;compelling
interest in maintaining strict separation of church and state.&quot;
Id., at 281.
<P>
II
<P>
It is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based
on its substantive content or the message it conveys. Police Dept.
of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 33
L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Other principles follow from this precept.
In the realm of private speech or expression, government regulation
may not favor one speaker over another. City Council of Los Angeles
v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 804, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2128,
80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984). Discrimination against speech because of
its message is presumed to be unconstitutional. See Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458-2459,
129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994). These rules informed our determination
that the government offends the First Amendment when it imposes
financial burdens on certain speakers based on the content of
their expression. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y.
State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115, 112 S.Ct. 501, 507-508,
116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991). When the government targets not subject
matter but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the
violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant. See
R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391, 112 S.Ct. 2538, ----, 120
L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Viewpoint discrimination is thus an egregious
form of content discrimination. The government must abstain from
regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the
opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the
restriction. See Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).
<P>
These principles provide the framework forbidding the State from
exercising viewpoint discrimination, even when the limited public
forum is one of its own creation. In a case involving a school
district's provision of school facilities for private uses, we
declared that &quot;[t]here is no question that the District,
like the private owner of property, may legally preserve the property
under its control for the use to which it is dedicated.&quot;
Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508
U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993).
The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate
purposes for which it was created may justify the State in reserving
it for certain groups or for the discussion *2517 of certain topics.
See, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,
473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985);
Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957. Once it has
opened a limited forum, however, the State must respect the lawful
boundaries it has itself set. The State may not exclude speech
where its distinction is not &quot;reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum,&quot; Cornelius, supra, at 804-806,
105 S.Ct. at 3450-51; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46,
49, 103 S.Ct., at 955, 957, nor may it discriminate against speech
on the basis of its viewpoint, Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2147; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 103
S.Ct., at 955; R.A.V., supra, at 386-388, 391-393, 112 S.Ct.,
at ---- - ----, ---- - ----; cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397,
414-415, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2545, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989). Thus, in
determining whether the State is acting to preserve the limits
of the forum it has created so that the exclusion of a class of
speech is legitimate, we have observed a distinction between,
on the one hand, content discrimination, which may be permissible
if it preserves the purposes of that limited forum, and, on the
other hand, viewpoint discrimination, which is presumed impermissible
when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations.
See Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 955.
<P>
The SAF is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or
geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable. See,
e.g., Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46-47, 103 S.Ct., at 955-956
(forum analysis of a school mail system); Cornelius, supra, at
801, 105 S.Ct., at 3448 (forum analysis of charitable contribution
program). The most recent and most apposite case is our decision
in Lamb's Chapel, supra. There, a school district had opened school
facilities for use after school hours by community groups for
a wide variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes. The
district, however, had enacted a formal policy against opening
facilities to groups for religious purposes. Invoking its policy,
the district rejected a request from a group desiring to show
a film series addressing various child-rearing questions from
a &quot;Christian perspective.&quot; There was no indication in
the record in Lamb's Chapel that the request to use the school
facilities was &quot;denied for any reason other than the fact
that the presentation would have been from a religious perspective.&quot;
508 U.S., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2145. Our conclusion was
unanimous: &quot;[I]t discriminates on the basis of viewpoint
to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all
views about family issues and child-rearing except those dealing
with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.&quot; Ibid.
<P>
The University does acknowledge (as it must in light of our precedents)
that &quot;ideologically driven attempts to suppress a particular
point of view are presumptively unconstitutional in funding, as
in other contexts,&quot; but insists that this case does not present
that issue because the Guidelines draw lines based on content,
not viewpoint. Brief for Respondents 17, n. 10. As we have noted,
discrimination against one set of views or ideas is but a subset
or particular instance of the more general phenomenon of content
discrimination.
<P>
See, e.g., R.A.V., supra, at 391, 112 S.Ct., at ----. And, it
must be acknowledged, the distinction is not a precise one. It
is, in a sense, something of an understatement to speak of religious
thought and discussion as just a viewpoint, as distinct from a
comprehensive body of thought. The nature of our origins and destiny
and their dependence upon the existence of a divine being have
been subjects of philosophic inquiry throughout human history.
We conclude, nonetheless, that here, as in Lamb's Chapel, viewpoint
discrimination is the proper way to interpret the University's
objections to Wide Awake. By the very terms of the SAF prohibition,
the University does not exclude religion as a subject matter but
selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts
with religious editorial viewpoints. Religion may be a vast area
of inquiry, but it also provides, as it did here, a specific premise,
a perspective, a standpoint from which a variety of subjects may
be discussed and considered. The prohibited perspective, not the
general subject matter, resulted in the refusal to make third-party
payments, for the subjects discussed were *2518 otherwise within
the approved category of publications.
<P>
The dissent's assertion that no viewpoint discrimination occurs
because the Guidelines discriminate against an entire class of
viewpoints reflects an insupportable assumption that all debate
is bipolar and that anti-religious speech is the only response
to religious speech. Our understanding of the complex and multifaceted
nature of public discourse has not embraced such a contrived description
of the marketplace of ideas. If the topic of debate is, for example,
racism, then exclusion of several views on that problem is just
as offensive to the First Amendment as exclusion of only one.
It is as objectionable to exclude both a theistic and an atheistic
perspective on the debate as it is to exclude one, the other,
or yet another political, economic, or social viewpoint. The dissent's
declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple voices
are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple
ways.
<P>
The University's denial of WAP's request for third-party payments
in the present case is based upon viewpoint discrimination not
unlike the discrimination the school district relied upon in Lamb's
Chapel and that we found invalid. The church group in Lamb's Chapel
would have been qualified as a social or civic organization, save
for its religious purposes. Furthermore, just as the school district
in Lamb's Chapel pointed to nothing but the religious views of
the group as the rationale for excluding its message, so in this
case the University justifies its denial of SAF participation
to WAP on the ground that the contents of Wide Awake reveal an
avowed religious perspective. See supra, at 2515. It bears only
passing mention that the dissent's attempt to distinguish Lamb's
Chapel is entirely without support in the law. Relying on the
transcript of oral argument, the dissent seems to argue that we
found viewpoint discrimination in that case because the government
excluded Christian, but not atheistic, viewpoints from being expressed
in the forum there. Post, at 2550-2551, and n. 13. The Court relied
on no such distinction in holding that discriminating against
religious speech was discriminating on the basis of viewpoint.
There is no indication in the opinion of the Court (which, unlike
an advocate's statements at oral argument, is the law) that exclusion
or inclusion of other religious or antireligious voices from that
forum had any bearing on its decision.
<P>
The University tries to escape the consequences of our holding
in Lamb's Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision
of funds rather than access to facilities. The University begins
with the unremarkable proposition that the State must have substantial
discretion in determining how to allocate scarce resources to
accomplish its educational mission. Citing our decisions in Rust
v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991),
Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540,
103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983), and Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), the University
argues that content-based funding decisions are both inevitable
and lawful. Were the reasoning of Lamb's Chapel to apply to funding
decisions as well as to those involving access to facilities,
it is urged, its holding &quot;would become a judicial juggernaut,
constitutionalizing the ubiquitous content-based decisions that
schools, colleges, and other government entities routinely make
in the allocation of public funds.&quot; Brief for Respondents
16.
<P>
To this end the University relies on our assurance in Widmar v.
Vincent, supra. There, in the course of striking down a public
university's exclusion of religious groups from use of school
facilities made available to all other student groups, we stated:
&quot;Nor do we question the right of the University to make academic
judgments as to how best to allocate scarce resources.&quot; 454
U.S., at 276, 102 S.Ct., at 277. The quoted language in Widmar
was but a proper recognition of the principle that when the State
is the speaker, it may make content-based choices. When the University
determines the content of the education it provides, it is the
University speaking, and we have permitted the government to regulate
the content of what is or is not expressed when it is the speaker
or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message.
In the same vein, in Rust v. Sullivan, *2519 supra, we upheld
the government's prohibition on abortion-related advice applicable
to recipients of federal funds for family planning counseling.
There, the government did not create a program to encourage private
speech but instead used private speakers to transmit specific
information pertaining to its own program. We recognized that
when the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular
policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes. 500 U.S.,
at 194, 111 S.Ct., at 1773. When the government disburses public
funds to private entities to convey a governmental message, it
may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message
is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee. See id., at 196-200,
111 S.Ct., at 1774-1776.
<P>
It does not follow, however, and we did not suggest in Widmar,
that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the University
does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it
favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views
from private speakers. A holding that the University may not discriminate
based on the viewpoint of private persons whose speech it facilitates
does not restrict the University's own speech, which is controlled
by different principles. See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356,
2372, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990); Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier,
484 U.S. 260, 270-272, 108 S.Ct. 562, 569-570, 98 L.Ed.2d 592
(1988). For that reason, the University's reliance on Regan v.
Taxation with Representation of Wash., supra, is inapposite as
well. Regan involved a challenge to Congress' choice to grant
tax deductions for contributions made to veterans' groups engaged
in lobbying, while denying that favorable status to other charities
which pursued lobbying efforts. Although acknowledging that the
Government is not required to subsidize the exercise of fundamental
rights, see 461 U.S., at 545-546, 103 S.Ct., at 2001, we reaffirmed
the requirement of viewpoint neutrality in the Government's provision
of financial benefits by observing that &quot;[t]he case would
be different if Congress were to discriminate invidiously in its
subsidies in such a way as to 'ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous
ideas,' &quot; see id., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002 (quoting Cammarano
v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513, 79 S.Ct. 524, 533, 3 L.Ed.2d
462 (1959), in turn quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513,
519, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). Regan relied
on a distinction based on preferential treatment of certain speakers--veterans
organizations--and not a distinction based on the content or messages
of those groups' speech. 461 U.S., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002;
cf. Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U.S., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957. The University's
regulation now before us, however, has a speech-based restriction
as its sole rationale and operative principle.
<P>
The distinction between the University's own favored message and
the private speech of students is evident in the case before us.
The University itself has taken steps to ensure the distinction
in the agreement each CIO must sign. See supra, at 2. The University
declares that the student groups eligible for SAF support are
not the University's agents, are not subject to its control, and
are not its responsibility. Having offered to pay the third-party
contractors on behalf of private speakers who convey their own
messages, the University may not silence the expression of selected
viewpoints.
<P>
The University urges that, from a constitutional standpoint, funding
of speech differs from provision of access to facilities because
money is scarce and physical facilities are not. Beyond the fact
that in any given case this proposition might not be true as an
empirical matter, the underlying premise that the University could
discriminate based on viewpoint if demand for space exceeded its
availability is wrong as well. The government cannot justify viewpoint
discrimination among private speakers on the economic fact of
scarcity. Had the meeting rooms in Lamb's Chapel been scarce,
had the demand been greater than the supply, our decision would
have been no different. It would have been incumbent on the State,
of course, to ration or allocate the scarce resources on some
acceptable neutral principle; but nothing in our decision indicated
that scarcity would give the State the right to *2520 exercise
viewpoint discrimination that is otherwise impermissible.
<P>
Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here. The
first danger to liberty lies in granting the State the power to
examine publications to determine whether or not they are based
on some ultimate idea and if so for the State to classify them.
The second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling
of individual thought and expression. That danger is especially
real in the University setting, where the State acts against a
background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at
the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. See
Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-181, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346, 33
L.Ed.2d 266 (1972); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, State Univ.
of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 683-684, 17 L.Ed.2d
629 (1967);
<P>
Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1211-1212,
1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957). In ancient Athens, and, as Europe entered
into a new period of intellectual awakening, in places like Bologna,
Oxford, and Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous
assemblages or concourses for students to speak and to write and
to learn. See generally R. Palmer &amp; J. Colton, A History of
the Modern World 39 (7th ed. 1992). The quality and creative power
of student intellectual life to this day remains a vital measure
of a school's influence and attainment. For the University, by
regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its
students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry
in one of the vital centers for the nation's intellectual life,
its college and university campuses.
<P>
The Guideline invoked by the University to deny third-party contractor
payments on behalf of WAP effects a sweeping restriction on student
thought and student inquiry in the context of University sponsored
publications. The prohibition on funding on behalf of publications
that &quot;primarily promot[e] or manifes[t] a particular belie[f]
in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,&quot; in its ordinary
and commonsense meaning, has a vast potential reach. The term
&quot;promotes&quot; as used here would comprehend any writing
advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief in
a deity or ultimate reality. See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 1815 (1961) (defining &quot;promote&quot; as &quot;to
contribute to the growth, enlargement, or prosperity of: further,
encourage&quot;). And the term &quot;manifests&quot; would bring
within the scope of the prohibition any writing that is explicable
as resting upon a premise which presupposes the existence of a
deity or ultimate reality. See id., at 1375 (defining &quot;manifest&quot;
as &quot;to show plainly: make palpably evident or certain by
showing or displaying&quot;). Were the prohibition applied with
much vigor at all, it would bar funding of essays by hypothetical
student contributors named Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes. And
if the regulation covers, as the University says it does, see
Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, those student journalistic efforts which
primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity
and no ultimate reality, then under-graduates named Karl Marx,
Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre would likewise have some
of their major essays excluded from student publications. If any
manifestation of beliefs in first principles disqualifies the
writing, as seems to be the case, it is indeed difficult to name
renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps
for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy.
Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable essay on
making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did not point
out their (necessary) imperfections.
<P>
Based on the principles we have discussed, we hold that the regulation
invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms and in its application
to these petitioners, is a denial of their right of free speech
guaranteed by the First Amendment. It remains to be considered
whether the violation following from the University's action is
excused by the necessity of complying with the Constitution's
prohibition against state establishment of religion. We turn to
that question.
<P>
III
<P>
Before its brief on the merits in this Court, the University had
argued at all stages of the litigation that inclusion of WAP's
contractors in SAF funding authorization would violate the Establishment
Clause. Indeed, that is *2521 the ground on which the University
prevailed in the Court of Appeals. We granted certiorari on this
question: &quot;Whether the Establishment Clause compels a state
university to exclude an otherwise eligible student publication
from participation in the student activities fund, solely on the
basis of its religious viewpoint, where such exclusion would violate
the Speech and Press Clauses if the viewpoint of the publication
were nonreligious.&quot; Pet. for Cert. i. The University now
seems to have abandoned this position, contending that &quot;[t]he
fundamental objection to petitioners' argument is not that it
implicates the Establishment Clause but that it would defeat the
ability of public education at all levels to control the use of
public funds.&quot; Brief for Respondents 29; see id., at 27-29,
and n. 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. That the University itself no
longer presses the Establishment Clause claim is some indication
that it lacks force; but as the Court of Appeals rested its judgment
on the point and our dissenting colleagues would find it determinative,
it must be addressed.
<P>
The Court of Appeals ruled that withholding SAF support from Wide
Awake contravened the Speech Clause of the First Amendment, but
proceeded to hold that the University's action was justified by
the necessity of avoiding a violation of the Establishment Clause,
an interest it found compelling. 18 F.3d, at 281. Recognizing
that this Court has regularly &quot;sanctioned awards of direct
nonmonetary benefits to religious groups where the government
has created open fora to which all similarly situated organizations
are invited,&quot; 18 F.3d, at 286 (citing Widmar, 454 U.S., at
277, 102 S.Ct., at 278), the Fourth Circuit asserted that direct
monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects
is &quot;a beast of an entirely different color,&quot; 18 F.3d,
at 286. The court declared that the Establishment Clause would
not permit the use of public funds to support &quot; 'a specifically
religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.'
&quot; Id., at 285 (quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743,
93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973) (emphasis deleted)).
It reasoned that because Wide Awake is &quot;a journal pervasively
devoted to the discussion and advancement of an avowedly Christian
theological and personal philosophy,&quot; the University's provision
of SAF funds for its publication would &quot;send an unmistakably
clear signal that the University of Virginia supports Christian
values and wishes to promote the wide promulgation of such values.&quot;
18 F.3d, at 286.
<P>
If there is to be assurance that the Establishment Clause retains
its force in guarding against those governmental actions it was
intended to prohibit, we must in each case inquire first into
the purpose and object of the governmental action in question
and then into the practical details of the program's operation.
Before turning to these matters, however, we can set forth certain
general principles that must bear upon our determination.
<P>
A central lesson of our decisions is that a significant factor
in upholding governmental programs in the face of Establishment
Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion. We have decided
a series of cases addressing the receipt of government benefits
where religion or religious views are implicated in some degree.
The first case in our modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence
was Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504,
91 L.Ed. 711 (1947). There we cautioned that in enforcing the
prohibition against laws respecting establishment of religion,
we must &quot;be sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit [the
government] from extending its general state law benefits to all
its citizens without regard to their religious belief.&quot; Id.,
at 16, 67 S.Ct., at 512. We have held that the guarantee of neutrality
is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral
criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients
whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are
broad and diverse. See Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School
Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491, 129
L.Ed.2d 546 (1994) (SOUTER, J.) (&quot;[T]he principle is well
grounded in our case law [and] we have frequently relied explicitly
on the general availability of any benefit provided religious
groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges&quot;);
Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 *2522 U.S.
481, 487-488, 106 S.Ct. 748, 751, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986); Mueller
v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 398-399, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 3069, 77 L.Ed.2d
721 (1983); Widmar, 454 U.S., at 274-275, 102 S.Ct., at 277.
<P>
More than once have we rejected the position that the Establishment
Clause even justifies, much less requires, a refusal to extend
free speech rights to religious speakers who participate in broad-reaching
government programs neutral in design. See Lamb's Chapel, 508
U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147-2148; Mergens, 496 U.S., at
248, 252, 110 S.Ct., at 2370-2371, 2373; Widmar, supra, at 274-275,
102 S.Ct., at 277.
<P>
The governmental program here is neutral toward religion. There
is no suggestion that the University created it to advance religion
or adopted some ingenious device with the purpose of aiding a
religious cause. The object of the SAF is to open a forum for
speech and to support various student enterprises, including the
publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and
creativity of student life. The University's SAF Guidelines have
a separate classification for, and do not make third-party payments
on behalf of, &quot;religious organizations,&quot; which are those
&quot;whose purpose is to practice a devotion to an acknowledged
ultimate reality or deity.&quot; Pet. for Cert. 66a. The category
of support here is for &quot;student news, information, opinion,
entertainment, or academic communications media groups,&quot;
of which Wide Awake was 1 of 15 in the 1990 school year. WAP did
not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial viewpoint;
it sought funding as a student journal, which it was.
<P>
The neutrality of the program distinguishes the student fees from
a tax levied for the direct support of a church or group of churches.
A tax of that sort, of course, would run contrary to Establishment
Clause concerns dating from the earliest days of the Republic.
The apprehensions of our predecessors involved the levying of
taxes upon the public for the sole and exclusive purpose of establishing
and supporting specific sects. The exaction here, by contrast,
is a student activity fee designed to reflect the reality that
student life in its many dimensions includes the necessity of
wide-ranging speech and inquiry and that student expression is
an integral part of the University's educational mission. The
fee is mandatory, and we do not have before us the question whether
an objecting student has the First Amendment right to demand a
pro rata return to the extent the fee is expended for speech to
which he or she does not subscribe. See Keller v. State Bar of
California, 496 U.S. 1, 15-16, 110 S.Ct. 2228, 2237, 110 L.Ed.2d
1 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Board of Ed., 431 U.S. 209, 235-236,
97 S.Ct. 1782, 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977). We must treat it,
then, as an exaction upon the students. But the $14 paid each
semester by the students is not a general tax designed to raise
revenue for the University. See United States v. Butler, 297 U.S.
1, 61, 56 S.Ct. 312, 317, 80 L.Ed. 477 (1936) (&quot;A tax, in
the general understanding of the term, and as used in the Constitution,
signifies an exaction for the support of the Government&quot;);
see also Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 595-596, 5 S.Ct. 247,
252, 28 L.Ed. 798 (1884). The SAF cannot be used for unlimited
purposes, much less the illegitimate purpose of supporting one
religion. Much like the arrangement in Widmar, the money goes
to a special fund from which any group of students with CIO status
can draw for purposes consistent with the University's educational
mission; and to the extent the student is interested in speech,
withdrawal is permitted to cover the whole spectrum of speech,
whether it manifests a religious view, an antireligious view,
or neither. Our decision, then, cannot be read as addressing an
expenditure from a general tax fund. Here, the disbursements from
the fund go to private contractors for the cost of printing that
which is protected under the Speech Clause of the First Amendment.
This is a far cry from a general public assessment designed and
effected to provide financial support for a church.
<P>
Government neutrality is apparent in the State's overall scheme
in a further meaningful respect. The program respects the critical
difference &quot;between government speech endorsing religion,
which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing
religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.&quot;
Mergens, supra, *2523 at 250, 110 S.Ct., at 2372 (opinion of O'CONNOR,
J.). In this case, &quot;the government has not willfully fostered
or encouraged&quot; any mistaken impression that the student newspapers
speak for the University. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.
v. Pinette, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 2448, --- L.Ed.2d
---- (slip op., at 10). The University has taken pains to disassociate
itself from the private speech involved in this case. The Court
of Appeals' apparent concern that Wide Awake's religious orientation
would be attributed to the University is not a plausible fear,
and there is no real likelihood that the speech in question is
being either endorsed or coerced by the State, see Lee v. Weisman,
505 U.S. 577, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2649, ----, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992);
Witters, supra, at 489, 106 S.Ct., at 752-753 (citing Lynch v.
Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1367, 79 L.Ed.2d
604 (1984) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring)); see also Witters, supra,
at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 754-755 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) (citing Lynch, supra, at 690, 104
S.Ct., at 1368 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring)).
<P>
The Court of Appeals (and the dissent) are correct to extract
from our decisions the principle that we have recognized special
Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct
money payments to sectarian institutions, citing Roemer v. Board
of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345,
49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976); Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 614-615,
108 S.Ct. 2562, 2577, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988); Hunt v. McNair,
413 U.S., at 742, 93 S.Ct. at 2874; Tilton, 403 U.S., at 679-680,
91 S.Ct., at 2096; Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1
v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968).
The error is not in identifying the principle but in believing
that it controls this case. Even assuming that WAP is no different
from a church and that its speech is the same as the religious
exercises conducted in Widmar (two points much in doubt), the
Court of Appeals decided a case that was, in essence, not before
it, and the dissent would have us do the same. We do not confront
a case where, even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian
recipients, the government is making direct money payments to
an institution or group that is engaged in religious activity.
Neither the Court of Appeals nor the dissent, we believe, takes
sufficient cognizance of the undisputed fact that no public funds
flow directly to WAP's coffers.
<P>
It does not violate the Establishment Clause for a public university
to grant access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis
to a wide spectrum of student groups, including groups which use
meeting rooms for sectarian activities, accompanied by some devotional
exercises. See Widmar, 454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274; Mergens,
496 U.S., at 252, 110 S.Ct., at 2373. This is so even where the
upkeep, maintenance, and repair of the facilities attributed to
those uses is paid from a student activities fund to which students
are required to contribute. Widmar, supra, at 265, 102 S.Ct.,
at 272. The government usually acts by spending money. Even the
provision of a meeting room, as in Mergens and Widmar, involved
governmental expenditure, if only in the form of electricity and
heating or cooling costs. The error made by the Court of Appeals,
as well as by the dissent, lies in focusing on the money that
is undoubtedly expended by the government, rather than on the
nature of the benefit received by the recipient. If the expenditure
of governmental funds is prohibited whenever those funds pay for
a service that is, pursuant to a religion-neutral program, used
by a group for sectarian purposes, then Widmar, Mergens, and Lamb's
Chapel would have to be overruled. Given our holdings in these
cases, it follows that a public university may maintain its own
computer facility and give student groups access to that facility,
including the use of the printers, on a religion neutral, say
first-come-first-served, basis. If a religious student organization
obtained access on that religion-neutral basis and used a computer
to compose or a printer or copy machine to print speech with a
religious content or viewpoint, the State's action in providing
the group with access would no more violate the Establishment
Clause than would giving those groups access to an assembly hall.
See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches School Dist., 508 U.S. ----,
113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 *2524 (1993); Widmar, supra; Mergens,
supra. There is no difference in logic or principle, and no difference
of constitutional significance, between a school using its funds
to operate a facility to which students have access, and a school
paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its
behalf. The latter occurs here. The University provides printing
services to a broad spectrum of student newspapers qualified as
CIOs by reason of their officers and membership. Any benefit to
religion is incidental to the government's provision of secular
services for secular purposes on a religion-neutral basis. Printing
is a routine, secular, and recurring attribute of student life.
<P>
By paying outside printers, the University in fact attains a further
degree of separation from the student publication, for it avoids
the duties of supervision, escapes the costs of upkeep, repair,
and replacement attributable to student use, and has a clear record
of costs. As a result, and as in Widmar, the University can charge
the SAF, and not the taxpayers as a whole, for the discrete activity
in question. It would be formalistic for us to say that the University
must forfeit these advantages and provide the services itself
in order to comply with the Establishment Clause. It is, of course,
true that if the State pays a church's bills it is subsidizing
it, and we must guard against this abuse. That is not a danger
here, based on the considerations we have advanced and for the
additional reason that the student publication is not a religious
institution, at least in the usual sense of that term as used
in our case law, and it is not a religious organization as used
in the University's own regulations. It is instead a publication
involved in a pure forum for the expression of ideas, ideas that
would be both incomplete and chilled were the Constitution to
be interpreted to require that state officials and courts scan
the publication to ferret out views that principally manifest
a belief in a divine being.
<P>
Were the dissent's view to become law, it would require the University,
in order to avoid a constitutional violation, to scrutinize the
content of student speech, lest the expression in question--speech
otherwise protected by the Constitution--contain too great a religious
content. The dissent, in fact, anticipates such censorship as
&quot;crucial&quot; in distinguishing between &quot;works characterized
by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens
to express views that a given religion might approve.&quot; Post,
at 2550. That eventuality raises the specter of governmental censorship,
to ensure that all student writings and publications meet some
baseline standard of secular orthodoxy. To impose that standard
on student speech at a university is to imperil the very sources
of free speech and expression. As we recognized in Widmar, official
censorship would be far more inconsistent with the Establishment
Clause's dictates than would governmental provision of secular
printing services on a religion-blind basis.
<P>
&quot;[T]he dissent fails to establish that the distinction [between
'religious' speech and speech 'about' religion] has intelligible
content. There is no indication when 'singing hymns, reading scripture,
and teaching biblical principles' cease to be 'singing, teaching,
and reading'--all apparently forms of 'speech,' despite their
religious subject matter--and become unprotected 'worship.' ...
<P>
&quot;[E]ven if the distinction drew an arguably principled line,
it is highly doubtful that it would lie within the judicial competence
to administer. Merely to draw the distinction would require the
university--and ultimately the courts--to inquire into the significance
of words and practices to different religious faiths, and in varying
circumstances by the same faith. Such inquiries would tend inevitably
to entangle the State with religion in a manner forbidden by our
cases. E.g., Walz [v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664,
90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) ].&quot; 454 U.S., at 269-270,
n. 6, 102 S.Ct., at 274, n. 6 (citations omitted).
<P>
* * *
<P>
To obey the Establishment Clause, it was not necessary for the
University to deny eligibility to student publications because
of their viewpoint. The neutrality commanded of the State by the
separate Clauses of the First Amendment was compromised by the
*2525 University's course of action. The viewpoint discrimination
inherent in the University's regulation required public officials
to scan and interpret student publications to discern their underlying
philosophic assumptions respecting religious theory and belief.
That course of action was a denial of the right of free speech
and would risk fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion,
which could undermine the very neutrality the Establishment Clause
requires. There is no Establishment Clause violation in the University's
honoring its duties under the Free Speech Clause.
<P>
The judgment of the Court of Appeals must be, and is, reversed.

It is so ordered.

129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). This insistence on government neutrality toward
religion explains why we have held that schools may not discriminate
against religious groups by denying them equal access to facilities
that the schools make available to all. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct.
269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). Withholding access would leave an
impermissible perception that religious activities are disfavored:
&quot;the message is one of neutrality rather than endorsement;
if a State refused to let religious groups use facilities open
to others, then it would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility
toward religion.&quot; Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools
(Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 2371,
110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990) (plurality opinion). &quot;The Religion
Clauses prohibit the government from favoring religion, but they
provide no warrant for discriminating against religion.&quot;
Kiryas Joel, supra, at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2498 (O'CONNOR, J.).
Neutrality, in both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment
Clause.
<P>
As Justice SOUTER demonstrates, however, post, at 2535-2537, there
exists another axiom in the history and precedent of the Establishment
Clause. &quot;Public funds may not be used to endorse the religious
message.&quot; Bowen v.

<P>
(Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also id., at 622, 108 S.Ct., at

<P>
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring). Our cases have permitted some government
funding of secular functions performed by sectarian organizations.
See, e.g., id., at 617, 108 S.Ct. at 2578 (funding for sex education);
Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 741, 96 S.Ct.
2337, 2342, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976)

Bradfield v.
<P>
Roberts, 175 U.S. 291, 299-300, 20 S.Ct. 121, 124, 44 L.Ed. 168
(1899) (funding of health care for indigent patients). These decisions,
however, provide no precedent for the use of public funds to finance
religious activities.
<P>
This case lies at the intersection of the principle of government
neutrality and the prohibition on state funding of religious activities.
It is clear that the University has established a generally applicable
program to encourage the free exchange of ideas by its students,
an expressive marketplace that includes some 15 student publications
with predictably divergent viewpoints. It is equally clear that
petitioners' viewpoint is religious and that publication of Wide
Awake is a religious activity, under both the University's regulation
and a fair reading of our precedents. Not to finance Wide Awake,
according to petitioners, violates the principle of neutrality
by sending a message of hostility toward religion. To finance
Wide Awake, argues the University, violates the prohibition on
direct state funding of religious activities.
<P>
When two bedrock principles so conflict, understandably neither
can provide the definitive answer. Reliance on categorical platitudes
is unavailing. Resolution instead depends on the hard task of
judging--sifting through the details and determining whether *2526
the challenged program offends the Establishment Clause. Such
judgment requires courts to draw lines, sometimes quite fine,
based on the particular facts of each case. See Lee v. Weisman,
505 U.S. 577, 598, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2661, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992)
(&quot;Our jurisprudence in this area is of necessity one of line-drawing&quot;).
As Justice Holmes observed in a different context: &quot;Neither
are we troubled by the question where to draw the line. That is
the question in pretty much everything worth arguing in the law.
Day and night, youth and age are only types.&quot; Irwin v. Gavit,
268 U.S. 161, 168, 45 S.Ct. 475, 476, 69 L.Ed. 897 (1925) (citation
omitted).
<P>
In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S.
481, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), for example, we unanimously
held that the State may, through a generally applicable financial
aid program, pay a blind student's tuition at a sectarian theological
institution. The Court so held, however, only after emphasizing
that &quot;vocational assistance provided under the Washington
program is paid directly to the student, who transmits it to the
educational institution of his or her choice.&quot; Id., at 487,
106 S.Ct., at 751. The benefit to religion under the program,
therefore, is akin to a public servant contributing her government
paycheck to the church. Ibid. We thus resolved the conflict between
the neutrality principle and the funding prohibition, not by permitting
one to trump the other, but by relying on the elements of choice
peculiar to the facts of that case: &quot;The aid to religion
at issue here is the result of petitioner's private choice. No
reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts before us
an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice
or belief.&quot; Id., at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 755 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See also Zobrest
v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, ----, 113 S.Ct.
2462, 2467-2468, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993).
<P>
The need for careful judgment and fine distinctions presents itself
even in extreme cases. Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S.
1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), provided perhaps the strongest
exposition of the no-funding principle: &quot;No tax in any amount,
large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities
or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form
they may adopt to teach or practice religion.&quot; Id., at 16,
67 S.Ct., at 512. Yet the Court approved the use of public funds,
in a general program, to reimburse parents for their children's
bus fares to attend Catholic schools. Id., at 17-18, 67 S.Ct.,
at 512-513. Although some would cynically dismiss the Court's
disposition as inconsistent with its protestations, see id., at
19, 67 S.Ct., at 513 (Jackson, J., dissenting) (&quot;the most
fitting precedent is that of Julia who, according to Byron's reports,
'whispering &quot;I will ne'er consent,&quot;--consented' &quot;),
the decision reflected the need to rely on careful judgment--not
simple categories--when two principles, of equal historical and
jurisprudential pedigree, come into unavoidable conflict.
<P>
So it is in this case. The nature of the dispute does not admit
of categorical answers, nor should any be inferred from the Court's
decision today, see ante, at 2521. Instead, certain considerations
specific to the program at issue lead me to conclude that by providing
the same assistance to Wide Awake that it does to other publications,
the University would not be endorsing the magazine's religious
perspective.
<P>
First, the student organizations, at the University's insistence,
remain strictly independent of the University. The University's
agreement with the Contracted Independent Organizations (CIO)--i.e.,
student groups--provides:
<P>
&quot;The University is a Virginia public corporation and the
CIO is not part of that corporation, but rather exists and operates
independently of the University.... The parties understand and
agree that this Agreement is the only source of any control the
University may have over the CIO or its activities....&quot; App.
27.
<P>
And the agreement requires that student organizations include
in every letter, contract, publication, or other written materials
the following disclaimer:
<P>
*2527 &quot;Although this organization has members who are University
of Virginia students (faculty) (employees), the organization is
independent of the corporation which is the University and which
is not responsible for the organization's contracts, acts or omissions.&quot;
Id., at 28.
<P>
Any reader of Wide Awake would be on notice of the publication's
independence from the University. Cf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S.,
at 274, n. 14, 102 S.Ct., at 276, n. 14.
<P>
Second, financial assistance is distributed in a manner that ensures
its use only for permissible purposes. A student organization
seeking assistance must submit disbursement requests; if approved,
the funds are paid directly to the third-party vendor and do not
pass through the organization's coffers. This safeguard accompanying
the University's financial assistance, when provided to a publication
with a religious viewpoint such as Wide Awake, ensures that the
funds are used only to further the University's purpose in maintaining
a free and robust marketplace of ideas, from whatever perspective.
This feature also makes this case analogous to a school providing
equal access to a generally available printing press (or other
physical facilities), ante, at 2524, and unlike a block grant
to religious organizations.
<P>
Third, assistance is provided to the religious publication in
a context that makes improbable any perception of government endorsement
of the religious message. Wide Awake does not exist in a vacuum.
It competes with 15 other magazines and newspapers for advertising
and readership. The widely divergent viewpoints of these many
purveyors of opinion, all supported on an equal basis by the University,
significantly diminishes the danger that the message of any one
publication is perceived as endorsed by the University. Besides
the general news publications, for example, the University has
provided support to The Yellow Journal, a humor magazine that
has targeted Christianity as a subject of satire, and Al-Salam,
a publication to &quot;promote a better understanding of Islam
to the University Community,&quot; App. 92. Given this wide array
of non-religious, anti-religious and competing religious viewpoints
in the forum supported by the University, any perception that
the University endorses one particular viewpoint would be illogical.
This is not the harder case where religious speech threatens to
dominate the forum. Cf. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.
v. Pinette, ante, --- U.S., at ----, 115 S.Ct., at 2451 (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
<P>
Mergens, 496 U.S., at 275, 110 S.Ct., at 2385.
<P>
Finally, although the question is not presented here, I note the
possibility that the student fee is susceptible to a Free Speech
Clause challenge by an objecting student that she should not be
compelled to pay for speech with which she disagrees. See, e.g.,
Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1, 15, 110 S.Ct. 2228,
2236-2237, 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,
431 U.S. 209, 236, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977).
There currently exists a split in the lower courts as to whether
such a challenge would be successful. Compare Hays County Guardian
v. Supple, 969 F.2d 111, 123 (CA5 1992), cert. denied 506 U.S.
----, 113 S.Ct. 1067, 122 L.Ed.2d 371 (1993); Kania v. Fordham,
702 F.2d 475, 480 (CA4 1983); Good v. Associated Students of Univ.
of Wash., 86 Wash.2d 94, 105-106, 542 P.2d 762, 769 (1975) (en
banc), with Smith v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 4 Cal.4th 843,
863-864, 16 Cal.Rptr.2d 181, 194-195, 844 P.2d 500, 513-514, cert.
denied, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 181, 126 L.Ed.2d 140 (1993).
While the Court does not resolve the question here, see ante,
at 2522, the existence of such an opt-out possibility not available
to citizens generally, see Abood, supra, at 259, n. 13, 97 S.Ct.,
at 1811, n. 13 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment), provides
a potential basis for distinguishing proceeds of the student fees
in this case from proceeds of the general assessments in support
of religion that lie at the core of the prohibition against religious
funding, see ante, at 2521-2522; post, at 2528-2529 (THOMAS, J.,
concurring); post, at 2535-2537 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), and
from government funds generally. Unlike monies dispensed from
state or federal treasuries, the Student Activities Fund is collected
from students who themselves administer the fund and select qualifying
recipients only *2528 from among those who originally paid the
fee. The government neither pays into nor draws from this common
pool, and a fee of this sort appears conducive to granting individual
students proportional refunds. The Student Activities Fund, then,
represents not government resources, whether derived from tax
revenue, sales of assets, or otherwise, but a fund that simply
belongs to the students.
<P>
The Court's decision today therefore neither trumpets the supremacy
of the neutrality principle nor signals the demise of the funding
prohibition in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I observed
last Term, &quot;[e]xperience proves that the Establishment Clause,
like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single
test.&quot; Kiryas Joel, 512 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2499
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
<P>
When bedrock principles collide, they test the limits of categorical
obstinacy and expose the flaws and dangers of a Grand Unified
Theory that may turn out to be neither grand nor unified. The
Court today does only what courts must do in many Establishment
Clause cases--focus on specific features of a particular government
action to ensure that it does not violate the Constitution. By
withholding from Wide Awake assistance that the University provides
generally to all other student publications, the University has
discriminated on the basis of the magazine's religious viewpoint
in violation of the Free Speech Clause. And particular features
of the University's program--such as the explicit disclaimer,
the disbursement of funds directly to third-party vendors, the
vigorous nature of the forum at issue, and the possibility for
objecting students to opt out--convince me that providing such
assistance in this case would not carry the danger of impermissible
use of public funds to endorse Wide Awake's religious message.
<P>
Subject to these comments, I join the opinion of the Court.
<P>
Justice THOMAS, concurring.
<P>
I agree with the Court's opinion and join it in full, but I write
separately to express my disagreement with the historical analysis
put forward by the dissent. Although the dissent starts down the
right path in consulting the original meaning of the Establishment
Clause, its misleading application of history yields a principle
that is inconsistent with our Nation's long tradition of allowing
religious adherents to participate on equal terms in neutral government
programs.
<P>
Even assuming that the Virginia debate on the so-called &quot;Assessment
Controversy&quot; was indicative of the principles embodied in
the Establishment Clause, this incident hardly compels the dissent's
conclusion that government must actively discriminate against
religion. The dissent's historical discussion glosses over the
fundamental characteristic of the Virginia assessment bill that
sparked the controversy: The assessment was to be imposed for
the support of clergy in the performance of their function of
teaching religion. Thus, the &quot;Bill Establishing a Provision
for Teachers of the Christian Religion&quot; provided for the
collection of a specific tax, the proceeds of which were to be
appropriated &quot;by the Vestries, Elders, or Directors of each
religious society ... to a provision for a Minister or Teacher
of the Gospel of their denomination, or the providing places of
divine worship, and to none other use whatsoever.&quot; See Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 74, 67 S.Ct. 504, 539, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947) (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.). (FN1)
<P>
*2529 James Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious
Assessments (hereinafter Madison's Remonstrance) must be understood
in this context. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, Madison's
objection to the assessment bill did not rest on the premise that
religious entities may never participate on equal terms in neutral
government programs. Nor did Madison embrace the argument that
forms the linchpin of the dissent: that monetary subsidies are
constitutionally different from other neutral benefits programs.
Instead, Madison's comments are more consistent with the neutrality
principle that the dissent inexplicably discards. According to
Madison, the Virginia assessment was flawed because it &quot;violate[d]
that equality which ought to be the basis of every law.&quot;
Madison's Remonstrance p 4, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 66,
67 S.Ct., at 536 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.). The assessment
violated the &quot;equality&quot; principle not because it allowed
religious groups to participate in a generally available government
program, but because the bill singled out religious entities for
special benefits. See ibid. (arguing that the assessment violated
the equality principle &quot;by subjecting some to peculiar burdens&quot;
and &quot;by granting to others peculiar exemptions&quot;).
<P>
Legal commentators have disagreed about the historical lesson
to take from the Assessment Controversy. For some, the experience
in Virginia is consistent with the view that the Framers saw the
Establishment Clause simply as a prohibition on governmental preferences
for some religious faiths over others. See R. Cord, Separation
of Church and State: Historical Fact and Current Fiction 20-23
(1982); Smith, Getting Off on the Wrong Foot and Back on Again:
<P>
A Reexamination of the History of the Framing of the Religion
Clauses of the First Amendment and a Critique of the Reynolds
and Everson Decisions, 20 Wake Forest L.Rev. 569, 590-591 (1984).
Other commentators have rejected this view, concluding that the
Establishment Clause forbids not only government preferences for
some religious sects over others, but also government preferences
for religion over irreligion. See, e.g., Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot;
Aid to Religion: A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp;
Mary L.Rev. 875, 875 (1986).
<P>
I find much to commend the former view. Madison's focus on the
preferential nature of the assessment was not restricted to the
fourth paragraph of the Remonstrance discussed above. The funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects, and the Remonstrance seized on this defect:
<P>
&quot;Who does not see that the same authority which can establish
Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish
with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion
of all other Sects.&quot; Madison's Remonstrance p 3, reprinted
in Everson, supra, at 65, 67 S.Ct., at 535-536.
<P>
In addition to the third and fourth paragraphs of the Remonstrance,
&quot;Madison's seventh, *2530 ninth, eleventh, and twelfth arguments
all speak, in some way, to the same intolerance, bigotry, unenlightenment,
and persecution that had generally resulted from previous exclusive
religious establishments.&quot; Cord, supra, at 21. The conclusion
that Madison saw the principle of nonestablishment as barring
governmental preferences for particular religious faiths seems
especially clear in light of statements he made in the more-relevant
context of the House debates on the First Amendment. See Wallace
v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 98, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 2511, 86 L.Ed.2d
29 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) (Madison's views &quot;as
reflected by actions on the floor of the House in 1789, [indicate]
that he saw the [First] Amendment as designed to prohibit the
establishment of a national religion, and perhaps to prevent discrimination
among sects,&quot; but not &quot;as requiring neutrality on the
part of government between religion and irreligion&quot;). Moreover,
even if more extreme notions of the separation of church and state
can be attributed to Madison, many of them clearly stem from &quot;arguments
reflecting the concepts of natural law, natural rights, and the
social contract between government and a civil society,&quot;
Cord, supra, at 22, rather than the principle of nonestablishment
in the Constitution. In any event, the views of one man do not
establish the original understanding of the First Amendment.
<P>
But resolution of this debate is not necessary to decide this
case. Under any understanding of the Assessment Controversy, the
history cited by the dissent cannot support the conclusion that
the Establishment Clause &quot;categorically condemn[s] state
programs directly aiding religious activity&quot; when that aid
is part of a neutral program available to a wide array of beneficiaries.
Post, at 2539. Even if Madison believed that the principle of
nonestablishment of religion precluded government financial support
for religion per se (in the sense of government benefits specifically
targeting religion), there is no indication that at the time of
the framing he took the dissent's extreme view that the government
must discriminate against religious adherents by excluding them
from more generally available financial subsidies. (FN2)
<P>
In fact, Madison's own early legislative proposals cut against
the dissent's suggestion. In 1776, when Virginia's Revolutionary
Convention was drafting its Declaration of Rights, Madison prepared
an amendment that would have disestablished the Anglican Church.
This amendment (which went too far for the Convention and was
not adopted) is not nearly as sweeping as the dissent's version
of disestablishment; Madison merely wanted the Convention to declare
that &quot;no man or class of men ought, on account of religion[,]
to be invested with peculiar emoluments or privileges....&quot;
Madison's Amendments to the Declaration of Rights (May 29-June
12, 1776), in 1 Papers of James Madison 174 (W. Hutchinson &amp;
W. Rachal eds. 1962) (emphasis added). Likewise, Madison's Remonstrance
stressed that &quot;just government&quot; is &quot;best supported
by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his Religion with
the same equal hand which protects his person and his property;
by neither invading the equal rights of any Sect, nor suffering
any Sect to invade those of another.&quot; Madison's Remonstrance
p 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 68, 67 S.Ct., at 537; cf.
Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch 43, 49, 3 L.Ed. 650 (1815) (holding
that the Virginia constitution did not prevent the government
from &quot;aiding the votaries of every sect to ... perform their
own religious duties,&quot; or from &quot;establishing funds for
the support of ministers, for public charities, for the endowment
of churches, or for the sepulture of the dead&quot; *2531 Stripped
of its flawed historical premise, the dissent's argument is reduced
to the claim that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence permits
neutrality in the context of access to government facilities but
requires discrimination in access to government funds. The dissent
purports to locate the prohibition against &quot;direct public
funding&quot; at the &quot;heart&quot; of the Establishment Clause,
see post, at 2541, but this conclusion fails to confront historical
examples of funding that date back to the time of the founding.
To take but one famous example, both Houses of the First Congress
elected chaplains, see S. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1820
ed.); H.R. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1826 ed.), and that
Congress enacted legislation providing for an annual salary of
$500 to be paid out of the Treasury, see Act of Sept. 22, 1789,
ch. 17, Sec. 4, 1 Stat. 70, 71. Madison himself was a member of
the committee that recommended the chaplain system in the House.
See H.R. Jour., at 11-12; 1 Annals of Cong. 891 (1789);
<P>
Cord, supra, at 25. This same system of &quot;direct public funding&quot;
of congressional chaplains has &quot;continued without interruption
ever since that early session of Congress.&quot; Marsh v. Chambers,
463 U.S. 783, 788, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 3334, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983).
(FN3)
<P>
The historical evidence of government support for religious entities
through property tax exemptions is also overwhelming. As the dissent
concedes, property tax exemptions for religious bodies &quot;have
been in place for over 200 years without disruption to the interests
represented by the Establishment Clause.&quot; Post, at 2542,
n. 7 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664,
676-680, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1415-1417, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)). (FN4)
In my view, the dissent's acceptance of this tradition puts to
rest the notion that the Establishment Clause bars monetary aid
to religious groups even when the aid is equally available to
other groups. A tax exemption in many cases is economically and
functionally indistinguishable from a direct monetary subsidy.
(FN5) In *2532 one instance, the government relieves religious
entities (along with others) of a generally applicable tax; in
the other, it relieves religious entities (along with others)
of some or all of the burden of that tax by returning it in the
form of a cash subsidy. Whether the benefit is provided at the
front or back end of the taxation process, the financial aid to
religious groups is undeniable. The analysis under the Establishment
Clause must also be the same: &quot;Few concepts are more deeply
embedded in the fabric of our national life, beginning with pre-Revolutionary
colonial times, than for the government to exercise at the very
least this kind of benevolent neutrality toward churches and religious
exercise....&quot; Walz, supra, at 676-677, 90 S.Ct., at 1415.
<P>
Consistent application of the dissent's &quot;no-aid&quot; principle
would require that &quot; 'a church could not be protected by
the police and fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept
in repair.' &quot; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.,
509 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993)
(quoting Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274-275, 102 S.Ct. 269,
277, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981)). The dissent admits that &quot;evenhandedness
may become important to ensuring that religious interests are
not inhibited.&quot; Post, at 2541, n. 5. Surely the dissent must
concede, however, that the same result should obtain whether the
government provides the populace with fire protection by reimbursing
the costs of smoke detectors and overhead sprinkler systems or
by establishing a public fire department. If churches may benefit
on equal terms with other groups in the latter program--that is,
if a public fire department may extinguish fires at churches--then
they may also benefit on equal terms in the former program.
<P>
Though our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in hopeless disarray,
this case provides an opportunity to reaffirm one basic principle
that has enjoyed an uncharacteristic degree of consensus: The
Clause does not compel the exclusion of religious groups from
government benefits programs that are generally available to a
broad class of participants. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d

Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986); Mueller
v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983);
Widmar, supra. Under the dissent's view, however, the University
of Virginia may provide neutral access to the University's own
printing press, but it may not provide the same service when the
press is owned by a third party. Not surprisingly, the dissent
offers no logical justification for this conclusion, and none
is evident in the text or original meaning of the First Amendment.
<P>
If the Establishment Clause is offended when religious adherents
benefit from neutral programs such as the University of Virginia's
Student Activities Fund, it must also *2533 be offended when they
receive the same benefits in the form of in-kind subsidies. The
constitutional demands of the Establishment Clause may be judged
against either a baseline of &quot;neutrality&quot; or a baseline
of &quot;no aid to religion,&quot; but the appropriate baseline
surely cannot depend on the fortuitous circumstances surrounding
the form of aid. The contrary rule would lead to absurd results
that would jettison centuries of practice respecting the right
of religious adherents to participate on neutral terms in a wide
variety of government-funded programs.
<P>
Our Nation's tradition of allowing religious adherents to participate
in evenhanded government programs is hardly limited to the class
of &quot;essential public benefits&quot; identified by the dissent.
See post, at 2541, n. 5. A broader tradition can be traced at
least as far back as the First Congress, which ratified the Northwest
Ordinance of 1787. See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 50.
Article III of that famous enactment of the Confederation Congress
had provided: &quot;Religion, morality, and knowledge ... being
necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools
and the means of learning shall forever be encouraged.&quot; Id.,
at 52, n. (a). Congress subsequently set aside federal lands in
the Northwest Territory and other territories for the use of schools.
See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1803, ch. 21, Sec. 1, 2 Stat. 225-226;
Act of Mar. 26, 1804, ch. 35, Sec. 5, 2 Stat. 279;
<P>
Act of Feb. 15, 1811, ch. 14, Sec. 10, 2 Stat. 621; Act of Apr.
18, 1818, ch. 67, Sec. 6, 3 Stat. 430; Act of Apr. 20, 1818, ch.
126, Sec. 2, 3 Stat. 467.
<P>
Many of the schools that enjoyed the benefits of these land grants
undoubtedly were church-affiliated sectarian institutions as there
was no requirement that the schools be &quot;public.&quot; See
C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal
Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment
Religion Clauses 163 (1964). Nevertheless, early Congresses found
no problem with the provision of such neutral benefits. See also
id., at 174 (noting that &quot;almost universally[,] Americans
from 1789 to 1825 accepted and practiced governmental aid to religion
and religiously oriented educational institutions&quot;).
<P>
Numerous other government benefits traditionally have been available
to religious adherents on neutral terms. Several examples may
be found in the work of early Congresses, including copyright
protection for &quot;the author and authors of any map, chart,
book or books,&quot; Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, Sec. 1, 1 Stat.
124, 124, and a privilege allowing &quot;every printer of newspapers
[to] send one paper to each and every other printer of newspapers
within the United States, free of postage,&quot; Act of Feb. 20,
1792, ch. 7, Sec. 21, 1 Stat. 232, 238. Neither of these laws
made any exclusion for the numerous authors or printers who manifested
a belief in or about a deity.
<P>
Thus, history provides an answer for the constitutional question
posed by this case, but it is not the one given by the dissent.
The dissent identifies no evidence that the Framers intended to
disable religious entities from participating on neutral terms
in evenhanded government programs. The evidence that does exist
points in the opposite direction and provides ample support for
today's decision.
<P>
Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG and
Justice BREYER join, dissenting.
<P>
The Court today, for the first time, approves direct funding of
core religious activities by an arm of the State. It does so,
however, only after erroneous treatment of some familiar principles
of law implementing the First Amendment's Establishment and Speech
Clauses, and by viewing the very funds in question as beyond the
reach of the Establishment Clause's funding restrictions as such.
Because there is no warrant for distinguishing among public funding
sources for purposes of applying the First Amendment's prohibition
of religious establishment, I would hold that the University's
refusal to support petitioners' religious activities is compelled
by the Establishment Clause. I would therefore affirm.
<P>
I
<P>
The central question in this case is whether a grant from the
Student Activities Fund to pay Wide Awake's printing expenses
*2534 would violate the Establishment Clause. Although the Court
does not dwell on the details of Wide Awake's message, it recognizes
something sufficiently religious in the publication to demand
Establishment Clause scrutiny. Although the Court places great
stress on the eligibility of secular as well as religious activities
for grants from the Student Activities Fund, it recognizes that
such evenhanded availability is not by itself enough to satisfy
constitutional requirements for any aid scheme that results in
a benefit to religion. Ante, at 2521; see also ante, at 2525-2526
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring). Something more is necessary to justify
any religious aid. Some members of the Court, at least, may think
the funding permissible on a view that it is indirect, since the
money goes to Wide Awake's printer, not through Wide Awake's own
checking account. The Court's principal reliance, however, is
on an argument that providing religion with economically valuable
services is permissible on the theory that services are economically
indistinguishable from religious access to governmental speech
forums, which sometimes is permissible. But this reasoning would
commit the Court to approving direct religious aid beyond anything
justifiable for the sake of access to speaking forums. The Court
implicitly recognizes this in its further attempt to circumvent
the clear bar to direct governmental aid to religion. Different
members of the Court seek to avoid this bar in different ways.
The opinion of the Court makes the novel assumption that only
direct aid financed with tax revenue is barred, and draws the
erroneous conclusion that the involuntary Student Activities Fee
is not a tax. I do not read Justice O'CONNOR'S opinion as sharing
that assumption; she places this Student Activities Fund in a
category of student funding enterprises from which religious activities
in public universities may benefit, so long as there is no consequent
endorsement of religion. The resulting decision is in unmistakable
tension with the accepted law that the Court continues to avow.
<P>

<P>
The Court's difficulties will be all the more clear after a closer
look at Wide Awake than the majority opinion affords. The character
of the magazine is candidly disclosed on the opening page of the
first issue, where the editor-in-chief announces Wide Awake's
mission in a letter to the readership signed, &quot;Love in Christ&quot;:
it is &quot;to challenge Christians to live, in word and deed,
according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage students
to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.&quot;
App. 45. The masthead of every issue bears St. Paul's exhortation,
that &quot;[t]he hour has come for you to awake from your slumber,
because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
Romans 13:11.&quot;
<P>
Each issue of Wide Awake contained in the record makes good on
the editor's promise and echoes the Apostle's call to accept salvation:
<P>
&quot;The only way to salvation through Him is by confessing and
repenting of sin. It is the Christian's duty to make sinners aware
of their need for salvation. Thus, Christians must confront and
condemn sin, or else they fail in their duty of love.&quot; Mourad
&amp; Prince, A Love/Hate Relationship, November/December 1990,
p. 3.

&quot;When you get to the final gate, the Lord will be handing

lifetime, you did not request a seat on His Friendly Skies Flyer
by trusting Him and asking Him to be your pilot, then you will
not be on His list of reserved seats (and the Lord will know you
not). You will not be able to buy a ticket then; no amount of
money or desire will do the trick. You will be met by your chosen
pilot and flown straight to Hell on an express jet (without air
conditioning or toilets, of course).&quot; Ace, The Plane Truth,

<P>
There is no need to quote further from articles of like tenor,
but one could examine such other examples as religious poetry,
see Macpherson, I Have Started Searching for Angels, November/December
1990, p. 18; religious textual analysis and commentary, see Buterbaugh,
Colossians 1:1-14: Abundant Life, id., at 20; Buterbaugh, John

on religious practice, see Early, Thanksgiving and Prayer, November/December
1990, p. 21 (providing readers with suggested prayers and posing
contemplative questions about biblical texts); Early, Hope and
Spirit, March/April 1991, p. 21 (similar).
<P>
Even featured essays on facially secular topics become platforms
from which to call readers to fulfill the tenets of Christianity
in their lives. Although a piece on racism has some general discussion
on the subject, it proceeds beyond even the analysis and interpretation
of biblical texts to conclude with the counsel to take action
because that is the Christian thing to do:
<P>
&quot;God calls us to take the risks of voluntarily stepping out
of our comfort zones and to take joy in the whole richness of
our inheritance in the body of Christ. We must take the love we
receive from God and share it with all peoples of the world.
<P>
&quot;Racism is a disease of the heart, soul, and mind, and only
when it is extirpated from the individual consciousness and replaced
with the love and peace of God will true personal and communal
healing begin.&quot; Liu, et al., &quot;Eracing&quot; Mistakes,
November/December 1990, p. 14.
<P>
The same progression occurs in an article on eating disorders,
which begins with descriptions of anorexia and bulimia and ends
with this religious message:
<P>
&quot;As thinking people who profess a belief in God, we must
grasp firmly the truth, the reality of who we are because of Christ.
Christ is the Bread of Life (John 6:35). Through Him, we are full.
He alone can provide the ultimate source of spiritual fulfillment
which permeates the emotional, psychological, and physical dimensions
of our lives.&quot; Ferguson &amp; Lassiter, From Calorie to Calvary,

<P>
This writing is no merely descriptive examination of religious
doctrine or even of ideal Christian practice in confronting life's
social and personal problems. Nor is it merely the expression
of editorial opinion that incidentally coincides with Christian
ethics and reflects a Christian view of human obligation. It is
straightforward exhortation to enter into a relationship with
God as revealed in Jesus Christ, and to satisfy a series of moral
obligations derived from the teachings of Jesus Christ. These
are not the words of &quot;student news, information, opinion,
entertainment, or academic communicatio[n] ...&quot; (in the language
of the University's funding criterion, App. to Pet. for Cert.
61a), but the words of &quot;challenge [to] Christians to live,
in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and ...
to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means&quot;
(in the language of Wide Awake's founder, App. 45). The subject
is not the discourse of the scholar's study or the seminar room,
but of the evangelist's mission station and the pulpit. It is
nothing other than the preaching of the word, which (along with
the sacraments) is what most branches of Christianity offer those
called to the religious life.
<P>
Using public funds for the direct subsidization of preaching the
word is categorically forbidden under the Establishment Clause,
and if the Clause was meant to accomplish nothing else, it was
meant to bar this use of public money. Evidence on the subject
antedates even the Bill of Rights itself, as may be seen in the
writings of Madison, whose authority on questions about the meaning
of the Establishment Clause is well settled, e.g., Committee for
Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 770,
n. 28, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 2964, n. 28, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973); Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 13, 67 S.Ct. 504, 510, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947). Four years before the First Congress proposed
the First Amendment, Madison gave his opinion on the legitimacy
of using public funds for religious purposes, in the Memorial
*2536 and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, which played
the central role in ensuring the defeat of the Virginia tax assessment
bill in 1786 and framed the debate upon which the Religion Clauses
stand:
<P>
&quot;Who does not see that ... the same authority which can force
a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the
support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to
any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?&quot; James Madison,
Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments p 3 (hereinafter
Madison's Remonstrance), reprinted in Everson, supra, at 65-66
[67 S.Ct., at 524] (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).
<P>
Madison wrote against a background in which nearly every Colony
had exacted a tax for church support, Everson, supra, at 10, n.
8, 67 S.Ct., at 509, n. 8, the practice having become &quot;so
commonplace as to shock the freedom-loving colonials into a feeling
of abhorrence,&quot; 330 U.S., at 11, 67 S.Ct., at 509 (footnote
omitted). Madison's Remonstrance captured the colonists' &quot;conviction
that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under
a government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support,
or otherwise to assist any or all religions, or to interfere with
the beliefs of any religious individual or group.&quot; Ibid.
(FN1) Their sentiment as expressed by Madison in Virginia, led
not only *2537 to the defeat of Virginia's tax assessment bill,
but also directly to passage of the Virginia Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, written by Thomas Jefferson. That bill's preamble
declared that &quot;to compel a man to furnish contributions of
money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is
sinful and tyrannical,&quot; Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution 84-85
(P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987), and its text provided
&quot;[t]hat no man shall be compelled to frequent or support
any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever....,&quot;
ibid. See generally Everson, supra, at 13, 67 S.Ct., at 510. We
have &quot;previously recognized that the provisions of the First
Amendment, in the drafting and adoption of which Madison and Jefferson
played such leading roles, had the same objective and were intended
to provide the same protection against governmental intrusion
on religious liberty as the Virginia statute.&quot;
<P>
Ibid.; see also Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot; Aid to Religion:
A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev.
875, 921, 923 (1986) (&quot;[I]f the debates of the 1780's support
any proposition, it is that the Framers opposed government financial
support for religion.... They did not substitute small taxes for
large taxes; three pence was as bad as any larger sum. The principle
was what mattered. With respect to money, religion was to be wholly
voluntary. Churches either would support themselves or they would
not, but the government would neither help nor interfere&quot;)
(footnote omitted); T. Curry, The First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At
the time of the framing of the Bill of Rights, &quot;[t]he belief
that government assistance to religion, especially in the form
of taxes, violated religious liberty had a long history&quot;);
J. Choper, Securing Religious Liberty 16 (1995) (&quot;There is
broad consensus that a central threat to the religious freedom
of individuals and groups--indeed, in the judgment of many the
most serious infringement upon religious liberty--is posed by
forcing them to pay taxes in support of a religious establishment
or religious activities&quot;) (footnotes omitted; internal quotation
marks omitted). (FN2)
<P>
*2538 The principle against direct funding with public money is
patently violated by the contested use of today's student activity
fee. (FN3) Like today's taxes generally, the fee is Madison's
threepence. The University exercises the power of the State to
compel a student to pay it, see Jefferson's Preamble, supra, and
the use of any part of it for the direct support of religious
activity thus strikes at what we have repeatedly held to be the
heart of the prohibition on establishment. Everson, 330 U.S.,
at 15-16, 67 S.Ct., at 511 (&quot;The 'establishment of religion
clause' ... means at least this.... No tax in any amount, large
or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or
institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they
may adopt to teach or practice religion&quot;); see School Dist.
of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 385, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3223,
87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985) (&quot;Although Establishment Clause jurisprudence
is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause does absolutely
prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored indoctrination

2968 (&quot;In the absence of an effective means of guaranteeing

against which the Establishment Clause guards &quot;have been

640, 112 S.Ct. 2649, ----, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting) (&quot;The coercion that was a hallmark of historical
establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy
and of financial support by force of law and threat of penalty&quot;)
(emphasis omitted); cf. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 103-104,
88 S.Ct. 1942, 1954-1955, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968) (holding that
taxpayers have an adequate stake in the outcome of Establishment
Clause litigation to satisfy Article III standing requirements,
after *2539 stating that &quot;[o]ur history vividly illustrates
that one of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the
Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that the
taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion
over another or to support religion in general&quot;).
<P>
The Court, accordingly, has never before upheld direct state funding
of the sort of proselytizing published in Wide Awake and, in fact,
has categorically condemned state programs directly aiding religious
activity, School Dist. v. Ball, supra, at 395, 105 S.Ct., at 3228-3229
(striking programs providing secular instruction to nonpublic
school students on nonpublic school premises because they are
&quot;indistinguishable from the provision of a direct cash subsidy
to the religious school that is most clearly prohibited under
the Establishment Clause&quot;); Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229,
254, 97 S.Ct. 2593, 2608-2609, 53 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (striking
field trip aid program because it constituted &quot;an impermissible

Black, and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in

<P>
Even when the Court has upheld aid to an institution performing
both secular and sectarian functions, it has always made a searching
enquiry to ensure that the institution kept the secular activities
separate from its sectarian ones, with any direct aid flowing
only to the former and never the latter. Bowen v. Kendrick, 487

1926-1929, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968) (upholding textbook loan program
limited to secular books requested by individual students for
secular educational purposes).
<P>
Reasonable minds may differ over whether the Court reached the
correct result in each of these cases, but their common principle
has never been questioned or repudiated. &quot;Although Establishment
Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause
does absolutely prohibit government-financed ... indoctrination
into the beliefs of a particular religious faith.&quot; School
Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385, 105 S.Ct., at 3223.
<P>
B
<P>
Why does the Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts
and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme here is a clear
constitutional *2540 violation? The answer must be in part that
the Court fails to confront the evidence set out in the preceding
section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uninformatively
to Wide Awake's &quot;Christian viewpoint,&quot; ante, at 2515,
or its &quot;religious perspective,&quot; ante, at 2518, and in
distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church,
the Court maintains that &quot;[Wide Awake] is not a religious
institution, at least in the usual sense,&quot; ante, at 2524;
(FN4) see also ante, at 2515. The Court does not quote the magazine's
adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness
of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept
Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual
analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so it is easy for the
Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court
of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly
evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions
to religious points of view.
<P>
Nevertheless, even without the encumbrance of detail from Wide
Awake's actual pages, the Court finds something sufficiently religious
about the magazine to require examination under the Establishment
Clause, and one may therefore ask why the unequivocal prohibition
on direct funding does not lead the Court to conclude that funding
would be unconstitutional. The answer is that the Court focuses
on a subsidiary body of law, which it correctly states but ultimately
misapplies. That subsidiary body of law accounts for the Court's
substantial attention to the fact that the University's funding
scheme is &quot;neutral,&quot; in the formal sense that it makes
funds available on an evenhanded basis to secular and sectarian
applicants alike. Ante, at 2521-2522. While this is indeed true
and relevant under our cases, it does not alone satisfy the requirements
of the Establishment Clause, as the Court recognizes when it says
that evenhandedness is only a &quot;significant factor&quot; in
certain Establishment Clause analysis, not a dispositive one.
Ante, at 2521; see ante, at 2521-2522; see also ante, at 2525-2526
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring); id., at 2525 (&quot;Neutrality, in
both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment Clause&quot;);
Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, --- U.S.
----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2440, ----, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (&quot;the
Establishment Clause forbids a State from hiding behind the application
of formally neutral criteria and remaining studiously oblivious
to the effects of its actions.... [N]ot all State policies are
permissible under the Religion Clauses simply because they are
neutral in form&quot;). This recognition reflects the Court's
appreciation of two general rules: that whenever affirmative government
aid ultimately benefits religion, the Establishment Clause requires
some justification beyond evenhandedness on the government's part;
and that direct public funding of core sectarian activities, even
if accomplished pursuant to an evenhanded program, would be entirely
inconsistent with the Establishment Clause and would strike at
the very heart of the Clause's protection. See ante, at 2523 (&quot;We
do not confront a case where, even under a neutral program that
includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct
money payments to an institution or group that is engaged in religious

<P>
In order to understand how the Court thus begins with sound rules
but ends with an unsound result, it is necessary to explore those
rules in greater detail than the Court does. As the foregoing
quotations from the Court's opinion indicate, the relationship
between the prohibition on direct aid and the requirement of evenhandedness
when affirmative government aid does result in some benefit to
religion reflects the relationship between basic rule and marginal
criterion. *2541 At the heart of the Establishment Clause stands
the prohibition against direct public funding, but that prohibition
does not answer the questions that occur at the margins of the
Clause's application. Is any government activity that provides
any incidental benefit to religion likewise unconstitutional?
Would it be wrong to put out fires in burning churches, wrong
to pay the bus fares of students on the way to parochial schools,
wrong to allow a grantee of special education funds to spend them
at a religious college? These are the questions that call for
drawing lines, and it is in drawing them that evenhandedness becomes
important. However the Court may in the past have phrased its
line-drawing test, the question whether such benefits are provided
on an evenhanded basis has been relevant, for the question addresses
one aspect of the issue whether a law is truly neutral with respect
to religion (that is, whether the law either &quot;advance[s]
[or] inhibit[s] religion,&quot; Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh
Chapter, American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573, 592, 109
S.Ct. 3086, 3100, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989)). In Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 274, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981),
for example, we noted that &quot;[t]he provision of benefits to
[a] broad ... spectrum of [religious and nonreligious] groups
is an important index of secular effect.&quot; See also Board
of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S.
----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994).
In the doubtful cases (those not involving direct public funding),
where there is initially room for argument about a law's effect,
evenhandedness serves to weed out those laws that impermissibly
advance religion by channelling aid to it exclusively. Evenhandedness
is therefore a prerequisite to further enquiry into the constitutionality
of a doubtful law, (FN5) but evenhandedness goes no further. It
does not guarantee success under Establishment Clause scrutiny.
<P>
Three cases permitting indirect aid to religion, Mueller v. Allen,
463 U.S. 388, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983), Witters v.
Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 106 S.Ct.
748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills
School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993),
are among the latest of those to illustrate this relevance of
evenhandedness when advancement is not so obvious as to be patently
unconstitutional. Each case involved a program in which benefits
given to individuals on a religion-neutral basis ultimately were
used by the individuals, in one way or another, to support religious
institutions. (FN6)
<P>
In each, the fact that aid was distributed generally and on a
neutral basis was a necessary condition for upholding the program
at issue. Witters, supra, at 487-488, 106 S.Ct., at 751; Mueller,
supra, at 397-399, 103 S.Ct. at 3068-3069; Zobrest, supra, at
---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2467-2468. But the significance of
evenhandedness stopped there. We did not, in any of these cases,
hold that satisfying the condition was sufficient, or dispositive.
Even more importantly, we never held that evenhandedness might
be sufficient to render direct aid to religion constitutional.
Quite the contrary. Critical to our decisions in these cases was
the fact that the aid was indirect; it reached religious institutions
&quot;only as a result of the genuinely independent and private
choices of aid recipients,&quot; Witters, supra, at 487, 106 S.Ct.,
at 752; see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070;
Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469. In noting
and relying on this particular feature of each of the programs
at issue, we in fact reaffirmed the core prohibition on direct
funding of religious activities. *2542 See Zobrest, supra, at
---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469; Witters, supra, at 487,
106 S.Ct., at 752; see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct.,
at 3069-3070. Thus, our holdings in these cases were little more
than extensions of the unremarkable proposition that &quot;a State
may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate
all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without
constitutional barrier....&quot; Witters, supra, at 486-487, 106
S.Ct., at 751. Such &quot;attenuated financial benefit[s], ultimately
controlled by the private choices of individual[s],&quot; we have
found, are simply not within the contemplation of the Establishment
Clause's broad prohibition. Mueller, supra, at 400, 103 S.Ct.,
at 3069-3070; see also Witters, supra, at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 754-755
(opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). (FN7)
<P>
Evenhandedness as one element of a permissibly attenuated benefit
is, of course, a far cry from evenhandedness as a sufficient condition
of constitutionality for direct financial support of religious
proselytization, and our cases have unsurprisingly repudiated
any such attempt to cut the Establishment Clause down to a mere
prohibition against unequal direct aid. See, e.g., Tilton v. Richardson,
403 U.S., at 682-684, 91 S.Ct., at 2097-2099 (striking portion
of general aid program providing grants for construction of college
and university facilities to the extent program made possible
the use of funds for sectarian activities); (FN8) Wolman v. Walter,
433 U.S., at 252-255, 97 S.Ct., at 2608-09 (striking funding of
field trips for nonpublic school students, such as are &quot;provided
to public *2543 school students in the district,&quot; because
of unacceptable danger that state funds would be used to foster
religion). And nowhere has the Court's adherence to the preeminence
of the no-direct-funding principle over the principle of evenhandedness
been as clear as in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 108 S.Ct.
2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520.
<P>
Bowen involved consideration of the Adolescent Family Life Act
(AFLA), a federal grant program providing funds to institutions
for counseling and educational services related to adolescent
sexuality and pregnancy. At the time of the litigation, 141 grants
had been awarded under the AFLA to a broad array of both secular
and religiously affiliated institutions. Id., at 597, 108 S.Ct.,
at 2567-2568. In an Establishment Clause challenge to the Act
brought by taxpayers and other interested parties, the District
Court resolved the case on a pre-trial motion for summary judgment,
holding the AFLA program unconstitutional both on its face and
also insofar as religious institutions were involved in receiving
grants under the Act. When this Court reversed on the issue of
facial constitutionality under the Establishment Clause, id.,
at 602-618, 108 S.Ct., at 2570-2579, we said that there was &quot;no
intimation in the statute that at some point, or for some grantees,
religious uses are permitted.&quot; Id., at 614, 108 S.Ct., at
2577. On the contrary, after looking at the legislative history
and applicable regulations, we found safeguards adequate to ensure
that grants would not be &quot;used by ... grantees in such a
way as to advance religion.&quot; Id., at 615, 108 S.Ct., at 2577.
<P>
With respect to the claim that the program was unconstitutional
as applied, we remanded the case to the District Court &quot;for
consideration of the evidence presented by appellees insofar as
it sheds light on the manner in which the statute is presently
being administered.&quot; Id., at 621, 108 S.Ct., at 2580.
<P>
Specifically, we told the District Court, on remand, to &quot;consider
... whether in particular cases AFLA aid has been used to fund
'specifically religious activit[ies] in an otherwise substantially
secular setting.' &quot; Ibid., quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S.,
at 743, 93 S.Ct., at 2874. In giving additional guidance to the
District Court, we suggested that application of the Act would
be unconstitutional if it turned out that aid recipients were
using materials &quot;that have an explicitly religious content
or are designed to inculcate the views of a particular religious
faith.&quot; Ibid. At no point in our opinion did we suggest that
the breadth of potential recipients, or distribution on an evenhanded
basis, could have justified the use of federal funds for religious
activities, a position that would have made no sense after we
had pegged the Act's facial constitutionality to our conclusion
that advancement of religion was not inevitable. Justice O'CONNOR's
separate opinion in the case underscored just this point: &quot;I
fully agree ... that '[p]ublic funds may not be used to endorse
the religious message.' Post, at 642, 108 S.Ct., at 2591-2592
[ (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ].... [A]ny use of public funds to
promote religious doctrines violates the Establishment Clause.&quot;
Id., at 622-623, 108 S.Ct., at 2581-582 (concurring opinion) (emphasis
in original).
<P>
Bowen was no sport; its pedigree was the line of Everson v. Board
of Ed., 330 U.S., at 16-18, 67 S.Ct., at 511-513, Board of Ed.
v. Allen, 392 U.S., at 243-249, 88 S.Ct., at 1926-1930, Tilton
v. Richardson, 403 U.S., at 678-682, 91 S.Ct., at 2095-2098, Hunt
v. McNair, 413 U.S., at 742-745, 93 S.Ct., at 2873-2875, and Roemer
v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S., at 759-761, 96 S.Ct.,
at 2351-2352. Each of these cases involved a general aid program
that provided benefits to a broad array of secular and sectarian
institutions on an evenhanded basis, but in none of them was that
fact dispositive. The plurality opinion in Roemer made this point
exactly:
<P>
&quot;The Court has taken the view that a secular purpose and
a facial neutrality may not be enough, if in fact the State is
lending direct support to a religious activity. The State may
not, for example, pay for what is actually a religious education,
even though it purports to be paying for a secular one, and even
though it makes its aid available to secular and religious institutions
alike.&quot; 426 U.S., at 747, 96 S.Ct., at 2345 (opinion of Blackmun,
J.).
<P>
Instead, the central enquiry in each of these general aid cases,
as in Bowen, was whether *2544 secular activities could be separated
from the sectarian ones sufficiently to ensure that aid would
flow to the secular alone.
<P>
Witters, Mueller, and Zobrest expressly preserve the standard
thus exhibited so often. Each of these cases explicitly distinguished
the indirect aid in issue from contrasting examples in the line
of cases striking down direct aid, and each thereby expressly
preserved the core constitutional principle that direct aid to
religion is impermissible. See Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (distinguishing Meek v. Pittenger, 421
U.S. 349, 95 S.Ct. 1753, 44 L.Ed.2d 217 and School Dist. v. Ball,
473 U.S. 373, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 87 L.Ed.2d 267, and noting that
&quot; '[t]he state may not grant aid to a religious school, whether
cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct
subsidy to the religious school' &quot;) (quoting Witters, 474
U.S., at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 751); see also ibid.; Mueller, 463
U.S., at 399, 103 S.Ct., at 3069. It appears that the University
perfectly understood the primacy of the no-direct-funding rule
over the evenhandedness principle when it drew the line short
of funding &quot;any activity which primarily promotes or manifests
a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot;
(FN9) App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.
<P>
C
<P>
Since conformity with the marginal or limiting principle of evenhandedness
is insufficient of itself to demonstrate the constitutionality
of providing a government benefit that reaches religion, the Court
must identify some further element in the funding scheme that
does demonstrate its permissibility. For one reason or another,
the Court's chosen element appears to be the fact that under the
University's Guidelines, funds are sent to the printer chosen
by Wide Awake, rather than to Wide Awake itself. Ante, at 2523-2524.
<P>
1
<P>
If the Court's suggestion is that this feature of the funding
program brings this case into line with Witters, Mueller, and
Zobrest (discussed supra, at 2521-2522), the Court has misread
those cases, which turned on the fact that the choice to benefit
religion was made by a non-religious third party standing between
the government and a religious institution. See Witters, 474 U.S.,
at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 751; see also Mueller, 463 U.S., at 399-400,
103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070; Zobrest, *2545 509 U.S., at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2467-2469. Here there is no third party standing
between the government and the ultimate religious beneficiary
to break the circuit by its independent discretion to put state
money to religious use. The printer, of course, has no option
to take the money and use it to print a secular journal instead
of Wide Awake. It only gets the money because of its contract
to print a message of religious evangelism at the direction of
Wide Awake, and it will receive payment only for doing precisely
that. The formalism of distinguishing between payment to Wide
Awake so it can pay an approved bill and payment of the approved
bill itself cannot be the basis of a decision of Constitutional
law. If this indeed were a critical distinction, the Constitution
would permit a State to pay all the bills of any religious institution;
(FN10) in fact, despite the Court's purported adherence to the
no-direct-funding principle, the State could simply hand out credit
cards to religious institutions and honor the monthly statements
(so long as someone could devise an evenhanded umbrella to cover
the whole scheme). Witters and the other cases cannot be distinguished
out of existence this way.
<P>
2
<P>
It is more probable, however, that the Court's reference to the
printer goes to a different attempt to justify the payment. On
this purported justification, the payment to the printer is significant
only as the last step in an argument resting on the assumption
that a public university may give a religious group the use of
any of its equipment or facilities so long as secular groups are
likewise eligible. The Court starts with the cases of Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), Board
of Ed. of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226,
110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990), and Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), in which religious groups were held to
be entitled to access for speaking in government buildings open
generally for that purpose. The Court reasons that the availability
of a forum has economic value (the government built and maintained
the building, while the speakers saved the rent for a hall); and
that economically there is no difference between the University's
provision of the value of the room and the value, say, of the
University's printing equipment; and that therefore the University
must be able to provide the use of the latter. Since it may do
that, the argument goes, it would be unduly formalistic to draw
the line at paying for an outside printer, who simply does what
the magazine's publishers could have done with the University's
own printing equipment. Ante, at 2523-2524.
<P>
The argument is as unsound as it is simple, and the first of its
troubles emerges from an examination of the cases relied upon
to support it. The common factual thread running through Widmar,
Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel, is that a governmental institution
created a limited forum for the use of students in a school or
college, or for the public at large, but sought to exclude speakers
with religious messages. See generally Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954-955,
74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (forum analysis). In each case the restriction
was struck down either as an impermissible attempt to regulate
the content of speech in an open forum (as in Widmar and Mergens)
or to suppress a particular religious viewpoint (as in Lamb's
Chapel, see infra, at 2550-2551). In each case, to be sure, the
religious speaker's use of the room passed muster as an incident
of a plan to facilitate speech generally for a secular purpose,
entailing neither secular entanglement with religion nor risk
that the religious speech would be taken to be the speech *2546
of the government or that the government's endorsement of a religious
message would be inferred. But each case drew ultimately on unexceptionable
Speech Clause doctrine treating the evangelist, the Salvation
Army, the millennialist or the Hare Krishna like any other speaker
in a public forum. It was the preservation of free speech on the
model of the street corner that supplied the justification going
beyond the requirement of evenhandedness.
<P>
The Court's claim of support from these forum-access cases is
ruled out by the very scope of their holdings. While they do indeed
allow a limited benefit to religious speakers, they rest on the
recognition that all speakers are entitled to use the street corner
(even though the State paves the roads and provides police protection
to everyone on the street) and on the analogy between the public
street corner and open classroom space. Thus, the Court found
it significant that the classroom speakers would engage in traditional
speech activities in these forums, too, even though the rooms
(like street corners) require some incidental state spending to
maintain them. The analogy breaks down entirely, however, if the
cases are read more broadly than the Court wrote them, to cover
more than forums for literal speaking. There is no traditional
street corner printing provided by the government on equal terms
to all comers, and the forum cases cannot be lifted to a higher
plane of generalization without admitting that new economic benefits
are being extended directly to religion in clear violation of
the principle barring direct aid. The argument from economic equivalence
thus breaks down on recognizing that the direct state aid it would
support is not mitigated by the street corner analogy in the service
of free speech. Absent that, the rule against direct aid stands
as a bar to printing services as well as printers.
<P>
3
<P>
It must, indeed, be a recognition of just this point that leads
the Court to take a third tack, not in coming up with yet a third
attempt at justification within the rules of existing case law,
but in recasting the scope of the Establishment Clause in ways
that make further affirmative justification unnecessary. Justice
O'CONNOR makes a comprehensive analysis of the manner in which
the activity fee is assessed and distributed. She concludes that
the funding differs so sharply from religious funding out of governmental
treasuries generally that it falls outside Establishment Clause's
purview in the absence of a message of religious endorsement (which
she finds not to be present). Ante, at 2526-2528 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring). The opinion of the Court concludes more expansively
that the activity fee is not a tax, and then proceeds to find
the aid permissible on the legal assumption that the bar against
direct aid applies only to aid derived from tax revenue. I have
already indicated why it is fanciful to treat the fee as anything
but a tax, supra, at 2538, and n. 3; see also ante, at 2522 (noting
mandatory nature of the fee), and will not repeat the point again.
The novelty of the assumption that the direct aid bar only extends
to aid derived from taxation, however, requires some response.
<P>
Although it was a taxation scheme that moved Madison to write
in the first instance, the Court has never held that government
resources obtained without taxation could be used for direct religious
support, and our cases on direct government aid have frequently
spoken in terms in no way limited to tax revenues. E.g., School
Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385, 105 S.Ct., at 3223 (&quot;Although
Establishment Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes,
the Clause does absolutely prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored
indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith&quot;);
Nyquist, 413 U.S., at 780, 93 S.Ct., at 2969 (&quot;In the absence
of an effective means of guaranteeing that the state aid derived
from public funds will be used exclusively for secular, neutral,
and nonideological purposes, it is clear from our cases that direct
aid in whatever form is invalid&quot;); id., at 772, 93 S.Ct.,
at 2965 (&quot;Primary among those evils&quot; against which the
Establishment Clause guards &quot;have been sponsorship, financial
support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious
activity&quot;) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);
see also T. Curry, The First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At the time
*2547 of the framing of the Bill of Rights, &quot;[t]he belief
that government assistance to religion, especially in the form
of taxes, violated religious liberty had a long history&quot;).
<P>
Allowing non-tax funds to be spent on religion would, in fact,
fly in the face of clear principle. Leaving entirely aside the
question whether public non-tax revenues could ever be used to
finance religion without violating the endorsement test, see Allegheny
County v. American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S., at 593-594,
109 S.Ct., at 3100-3101, any such use of them would ignore one
the dual objectives of the Establishment Clause, which was meant
not only to protect individuals and their republics from the destructive
consequences of mixing government and religion, but to protect
religion from a corrupting dependence on support from the Government.
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 1267, 8 L.Ed.2d
601 (1962) (the Establishment Clause's &quot;first and most immediate
purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion
tends to destroy government and to degrade religion&quot;); Everson,
330 U.S., at 53, 67 S.Ct., at 529-530 (Rutledge, J., dissenting)
(&quot;The great condition of religious liberty is that it be
maintained free from sustenance, as also from other interferences,
by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that secular foundation
it vanishes with the resting&quot;) (citing Madison's Remonstrance
pp 7, 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 63-72, 67 S.Ct., at 534-539
(appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.)); School Dist. of Abington
v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 259, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1591, 10 L.Ed.2d
844 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) (&quot;It is not only the
nonbeliever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and
controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degree it
is the devout believer who fears the secularization of a creed
which becomes too deeply involved with and dependent upon the
government&quot;) (footnote omitted); Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution,
at 84-85. Since the corrupting effect of government support does
not turn on whether the Government's own money comes from taxation
or gift or the sale of public lands, the Establishment Clause
could hardly relax its vigilance simply because tax revenue was
not implicated. Accordingly, in the absence of a forthright disavowal,
one can only assume that the Court does not mean to eliminate
one half of the Establishment Clause's justification.
<P>
D
<P>
Nothing in the Court's opinion would lead me to end this enquiry
into the application of the Establishment Clause any differently
from the way I began it. The Court is ordering an instrumentality
of the State to support religious evangelism with direct funding.
This is a flat violation of the Establishment Clause.
<P>
II
<P>
Given the dispositive effect of the Establishment Clause's bar
to funding the magazine, there should be no need to decide whether
in the absence of this bar the University would violate the Free
Speech Clause by limiting funding as it has done. Widmar, 454
U.S., at 271, 102 S.Ct., at 275 (university's compliance with
its Establishment Clause obligations can be a compelling interest
justifying speech restriction). But the Court's speech analysis
may have independent application, and its flaws should not pass
unremarked.
<P>
The Court acknowledges, ante, at 2518, the necessity for a university
to make judgments based on the content of what may be said or
taught when it decides, in the absence of unlimited amounts of
money or other resources, how to honor its educational responsibilities.
Widmar, supra, at 276, 102 S.Ct., at 277-278; cf. Perry, 460 U.S.,
at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957 (subject matter and speaker identity
distinctions &quot;are inherent and inescapable in the process
of limiting a non-public forum to activities compatible with the
intended purpose of the property&quot;). Nor does the Court generally
question that in allocating public funds a state university enjoys
spacious discretion. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194,
111 S.Ct. 1759, 1773, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991)
<P>
(&quot;[W]hen the government appropriates public funds to establish
a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program&quot;);
Regan v. Taxation *2548 with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S.
540, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983) (upholding government
subsidization decision partial to one class of speaker). (FN11)
Accordingly, the Court recognizes that the relevant enquiry in
this case is not merely whether the University bases its funding
decisions on the subject matter of student speech; if there is
an infirmity in the basis for the University's funding decision,
it must be that the University is impermissibly distinguishing
among competing viewpoints, ante, at 2516-2517, citing, inter
alia, Perry, supra, at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 957; see also Lamb's
Chapel, 508 U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2144-2145 (subject matter
distinctions permissible in controlling access to limited public
forum if reasonable and viewpoint neutral); Cornelius v. NAACP
Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct.
3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985) (similar); Regan, supra, at
548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002. (FN12)
<P>
The issue whether a distinction is based on viewpoint does not
turn simply on whether a government regulation happens to be applied
to a speaker who seeks to advance a particular viewpoint; the
issue, of course, turns on whether the burden on speech is explained
by reference to viewpoint. See Cornelius, supra, at 806, 105 S.Ct.,
at 3439 (&quot;[T]he government violates the First Amendment when
it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of
view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject&quot;). As
when deciding whether a speech restriction is content-based or
content-neutral, &quot;[t]he government's purpose is the controlling
consideration.&quot; Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781,
791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2754, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989); see also ibid.
(content neutrality turns on, inter alia, whether a speech restriction
is &quot;justified without reference to the content of the regulated
speech&quot;) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
So, for example, a city that enforces its excessive noise ordinance
by pulling the plug on a rock band using a forbidden amplification
system is not guilty of viewpoint discrimination simply because
the band wishes to use that equipment to espouse antiracist views.
Accord, Rock Against Racism, supra. Nor does a municipality's
decision to prohibit political advertising on bus placards amount
to viewpoint discrimination when in the course of applying this
policy it denies space to a person who wishes to speak in favor
of a particular political candidate. Accord, Lehman v. Shaker
Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 304, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 2717-2718, 41 L.Ed.2d
770 (1974) (plurality opinion).
<P>
Accordingly, the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination serves
that important purpose of the Free Speech Clause, which is to
bar the government from skewing public debate. Other things being
equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows
one message while prohibiting the messages of *2549 those who
can reasonably be expected to respond. See First Nat. Bank of
Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1420-1421,
55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978) (&quot;Especially where ... the legislature's
suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of
a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views
to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended&quot;)
(footnote omitted); Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wisconsin
Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 175-176, 97 S.Ct. 421,
426, 50 L.Ed.2d 376 (1976) (&quot;to permit one side of a debatable
public question to have a monopoly in expressing its views ...
is the antithesis of constitutional guarantees&quot;) (footnote
omitted); United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 736, 110 S.Ct.
3115, 3124, 111 L.Ed.2d 571 (1990) (viewpoint discrimination involves
an &quot;inten[t] to discourage one viewpoint and advance another&quot;)
(plurality opinion) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
It is precisely this element of taking sides in a public debate
that identifies viewpoint discrimination and makes it the most
pernicious of all distinctions based on content. Thus, if government
assists those espousing one point of view, neutrality requires
it to assist those espousing opposing points of view, as well.
<P>
There is no viewpoint discrimination in the University's application
of its Guidelines to deny funding to Wide Awake. Under those Guidelines,
a &quot;religious activit[y],&quot; which is not eligible for
funding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a, is &quot;an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality,&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.
It is clear that this is the basis on which Wide Awake Productions
was denied funding.
<P>
Letter from Student Council to Ronald W. Rosenberger. App. 54
(&quot;In reviewing the request by Wide Awake Productions, the
Appropriations Committee determined your organization's request
could not be funded as it is a religious activity&quot;). The
discussion of Wide Awake's content, supra, at 2534-2536, shows
beyond any question that it &quot;primarily promotes or manifests
a particular belief(s) in or about a deity ...,&quot; in the very
specific sense that its manifest function is to call students
to repentance, to commitment to Jesus Christ, and to particular
moral action because of its Christian character. 
<P>
If the Guidelines were written or applied so as to limit only
such Christian advocacy and no other evangelical efforts that
might compete with it, the discrimination would be based on viewpoint.
But that is not what the regulation authorizes; it applies to
Muslim and Jewish and Buddhist advocacy as well as to Christian.
And since it limits funding to activities promoting or manifesting
a particular belief not only &quot;in&quot; but &quot;about&quot;
a deity or ultimate reality, it applies to agnostics and atheists
as well as it does to deists and theists (as the University maintained
at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, and as the Court recognizes,
see ante, at 2520). The Guidelines, and their application to Wide
Awake, thus do not skew debate by funding one position but not
its competitors. As understood by their application to Wide Awake,
they simply deny funding for hortatory speech that &quot;primarily
promotes or manifests&quot; any view on the merits of religion;
they deny funding for the entire subject matter of religious apologetics.
<P>
The Court, of course, reads the Guidelines differently, but while
I believe the Court is wrong in construing their breadth, the
important point is that even on the Court's own construction the
Guidelines impose no viewpoint discrimination. In attempting to
demonstrate the potentially chilling effect such funding restrictions
might have on learning in our nation's universities, the Court
describes the Guidelines as &quot;a sweeping restriction on student
thought and student inquiry,&quot; disentitling a vast array of
topics to funding. Ante, at 2520. As the Court reads the Guidelines
to exclude &quot;any writing that is explicable as resting upon
a premise which presupposes the existence of a deity or ultimate
reality,&quot; as well as &quot;those student journalistic efforts
which primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no
deity and no ultimate reality,&quot; the Court concludes that
the major works of writers from Descartes to Sartre would be barred
from the funding forum. Ante, at 2520. The Court goes so far as
to suggest that the Guidelines, properly interpreted, tolerate
nothing much more *2550 than essays on &quot;making pasta or peanut
butter cookies....&quot; Ante, at 2520.
<P>
Now, the regulation is not so categorically broad as the Court
protests. The Court reads the word &quot;primarily&quot; (&quot;primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality&quot;) right out of the Guidelines, whereas
it is obviously crucial in distinguishing between works characterized
by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens
to express views that a given religion might approve, or simply
descriptive writing informing a reader about the position of a
given religion. But, as I said, that is not the important point.
Even if the Court were indeed correct about the funding restriction's
categorical breadth, the stringency of the restriction would most
certainly not work any impermissible viewpoint discrimination
under any prior understanding of that species of content discrimination.
If a University wished to fund no speech beyond the subjects of
pasta and cookie preparation, it surely would not be discriminating
on the basis of someone's viewpoint, at least absent some controversial
claim that pasta and cookies did not exist. The upshot would be
an instructional universe without higher education, but not a
universe where one viewpoint was enriched above its competitors.
<P>
The Guidelines are thus substantially different from the access
restriction considered in Lamb's Chapel, the case upon which the
Court heavily relies in finding a viewpoint distinction here,
ante, at 2517-2518. Lamb's Chapel addressed a school board's regulation
prohibiting the after-hours use of school premises &quot;by any
group for religious purposes,&quot; even though the forum otherwise
was open for a variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes.
508 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2144 (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).
<P>
&quot;Religious&quot; was understood to refer to the viewpoint
of a believer, and the regulation did not purport to deny access
to any speaker wishing to express a non-religious or expressly
antireligious point of view on any subject, see ibid. (&quot;The
issue in this case is whether ... it violates the Free Speech
Clause of the First Amendment ... to deny a church access to school
premises to exhibit for public viewing and for assertedly religious
purposes, a film dealing with family and child-rearing issues&quot;);
id., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2144, citing May v. Evansville-Vanderburgh
School Corp., 787 F.2d 1105, 1114 (CA7 1986). (FN13)
<P>
With this understanding, it was unremarkable that in Lamb's Chapel
we unanimously determined that the access restriction, as applied
to a speaker wishing to discuss family values from a Christian
perspective, impermissibly distinguished between speakers on the
basis of viewpoint. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at ---- - ---- (considering as-applied challenge only).
Equally obvious is the distinction between that case and this
one, where the regulation is being applied, not to deny funding
for those who discuss issues in general from a religious viewpoint,
but to those engaged in promoting or opposing religious conversion
and religious observances as such. If this amounts to viewpoint
discrimination, the Court has all but eviscerated the line between
viewpoint and content.
<P>
*2551. To put the point another way, the Court's decision equating
a categorical exclusion of both sides of the religious debate
with viewpoint discrimination suggests the Court has concluded
that primarily religious and antireligious speech, grouped together,
always provides an opposing (and not merely a related) viewpoint
to any speech about any secular topic. Thus, the Court's reasoning
requires a university that funds private publications about any
primarily nonreligious topic also to fund publications primarily
espousing adherence to or rejection of religion. But a university's
decision to fund a magazine about racism, and not to fund publications
aimed at urging repentance before God does not skew the debate
either about racism or the desirability of religious conversion.
The Court's contrary holding amounts to a significant reformulation
of our viewpoint discrimination precedents and will significantly
expand access to limited-access forums. See Greer v. Spock, 424
U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976) (upholding regulation
prohibiting political speeches on military base); Cornelius, 473
U.S., at 812, 105 S.Ct., at 3454 (exclusion from fundraising drive
of political activity or advocacy groups is facially viewpoint
neutral despite inclusion of charitable, health and welfare agencies);
Perry, 460 U.S., at 49-50, and n. 9, 103 S.Ct., at 957-958, and
n. 9 (ability of teachers' bargaining representative to use internal
school mail system does not require that access be provided to
&quot;any other citizen's group or community organization with
a message for school personnel&quot;); Lehman, 418 U.S., at 304,
94 S.Ct., at 2718 (exclusion of political messages from forum
permissible despite ability of nonpolitical speakers to use the
forum) (plurality opinion).
<P>
III
<P>
Since I cannot see the future I cannot tell whether today's decision
portends much more than making a shambles out of student activity
fees in public colleges. Still, my apprehension is whetted by
Chief Justice Burger's warning in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.
602, 624, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2116, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971): &quot;in
constitutional adjudication some steps, which when taken were
thought to approach 'the verge,' have become the platform for
yet further steps. A certain momentum develops in constitutional
theory and it can be a 'downhill thrust' easily set in motion
but difficult to retard or stop.&quot;
<P>
I respectfully dissent. FN* The syllabus constitutes no part of
the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter
of Decisions for the convenience of the reader. See United States
v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50
L.Ed. 499.
<P>
FN1. The dissent suggests that the assessment bill would have
created a &quot;generally available subsidy program&quot; comparable
to respondent's Student Activities Fund (SAF). See post, at 2536,
n. 1. The dissent's characterization of the bill, however, is
squarely at odds with the bill's clear purpose and effect to provide
&quot;for the support of Christian teachers.&quot;
<P>
Everson, 330 U.S., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539. Moreover, the section
of the bill cited by the dissent, see post, at 2536-2537, n. 1,
simply indicated that funds would be &quot;disposed of under the
direction of the General Assembly, for the encouragement of seminaries
of learning within the Counties whence such sums shall arise,&quot;
Everson, supra, at 74, 67 S.Ct., at 540. This provision disposing
of undesignated funds hardly transformed the &quot;Bill Establishing
a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion&quot; into
a truly neutral program that would benefit religious adherents
as part of a large class of beneficiaries defined without reference
to religion. Indeed, the only appropriation of money made by the
bill would have been to promote &quot;the general diffusion of
Christian knowledge,&quot; id., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539; any possible
appropriation for &quot;seminaries of learning&quot; depended
entirely on future legislative action.
<P>
Even assuming that future legislators would adhere to the bill's
directive in appropriating the undesignated tax revenues, nothing
in the bill would prevent use of those funds solely for sectarian
educational institutions. To the contrary, most schools at the
time of the founding were affiliated with some religious organization,
see C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal
Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment
Religion Clauses 163 (1964), and in fact there was no system of
public education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment
bill was proposed, see A. Morrison, The Beginnings of Public Education
in Virginia, 1776-1860, p. 9 (1917); see also A. Johnson, The
Legal Status of Church-State Relationships in the United States
4 (1982) (&quot;In Virginia the parish institutions transported
from England were the earliest educational agencies. Although
much of the teaching took place in the home and with the aid of
tutors, every minister had a school, and it was the duty of the
vestry to see that all the poor children were taught to read and
write&quot;) (footnote omitted). Further, the clearly religious
tenor of the Virginia assessment would seem to point toward appropriation
of residual funds to sectarian &quot;seminaries of learning.&quot;
Finally, although modern historians have focused on the opt-out
provision, the dissent provides no indication that Madison viewed
the Virginia assessment as an evenhanded program; in fact, several
of the objections expressed in Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance
Against Religious Assessments, reprinted in Everson, supra, at
63, 67 S.Ct., at 534-535, focus clearly on the bill's violation
of the principle of &quot;equality,&quot; or evenhandedness. See
infra, at 2529-2530.
<P>
FN2. To the contrary, Madison's Remonstrance decried the fact
that the assessment bill would require civil society to take &quot;cognizance&quot;
of religion. Madison's Remonstrance p 1, reprinted in Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 64, 67 S.Ct. 504, 535, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947). Respondent's exclusion of religious activities
from SAF funding creates this very problem.
<P>
It requires University officials to classify publications as &quot;religious
activities,&quot; and to discriminate against the publications
that fall into that category. Such a policy also contravenes the
principles expressed in Madison'sRemonstrance by encouraging religious
adherents to cleanse their speech of religious overtones, thus
&quot;degrad[ing] from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose
opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority.&quot;
Id. p 9, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 69, 67 S.Ct., at 537.
*2551_ 
<P>
FN3. A number of other, less familiar examples of what amount
to direct funding appear in early Acts of Congress. See, e.g.
Act of Feb. 20, 1833, ch. 42, 4 Stat. 618-619 (authorizing the
State of Ohio to sell &quot;all or any part of the lands heretofore
reserved and appropriated by Congress for the support of religion
within the Ohio Company's ... purchases ... and to invest the
money arising from the sale thereof, in some productive fund;
the proceeds of which shall be for ever annually applied ... for
the support of religion within the several townships for which
said lands were originally reserved and set apart, and for no
other use or purpose whatsoever&quot;); Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch.
86, Secs. 1, 3, 6 Stat. 538 (granting to Georgetown College--a
Jesuit institution--&quot;lots in the city of Washington, to the
amount, in value, of twenty-five thousand dollars,&quot; and directing
the College to sell the lots and invest the proceeds, thereafter
using the dividends to establish and endow such professorships
as it saw fit); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 103,
105 S.Ct. 2479, 2514, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting)
(&quot;As the United States moved from the 18th into the 19th
century, Congress appropriated time and again public moneys in
support of sectarian Indian education carried on by religious
organizations&quot;).
<P>
FN4. The Virginia experience during the period of the Assessment
Controversy
<P>
itself is inconsistent with the rigid &quot;no-aid&quot; principle
embraced by the dissent. Since at least 1777, the Virginia legislature
authorized tax exemptions for property belonging to the &quot;commonwealth,
or to any county, town, college, houses for divine worship, or
seminary of learning.&quot; Act of Jan. 23, 1800, ch. 2, Sec.
1, 1800 Va.Acts. And even Thomas Jefferson, respondent's founder
and a champion of disestablishment in Virginia, advocated the
use of public funds in Virginia for a department of theology in
conjunction with other professional schools. See S. Padover, The
Complete Jefferson 1067 (1943); see also id., at 958 (noting that
Jefferson advocated giving &quot;to the sectarian schools of divinity
the full benefit [of] the public provisions made for instruction
in the other branches of science&quot;).
<P>
FN5. In the tax literature, this identity is called a &quot;tax
expenditure,&quot; a concept &quot;based upon recognition of the
fact that a government can appropriate money to a particular person
or group by using a special, narrowly directed tax deduction or
exclusion, instead of by using its ordinary direct spending mechanisms.
For example, a government with a general income tax, wanting to
add $7,000 to the spendable income of a preacher whose top tax
rate is 30%, has two ways of subsidizing him. The government can
send the preacher a check for $10,000 and tax him on all of his
income, or it can authorize him to reduce his taxable income by
$23,333.33 [resulting in a tax saving of $7,000]. If the direct
payment were itself taxable and did not alter his tax bracket,
the preacher would receive the same benefit from the tax deduction
as he would from the direct payment.&quot; Wolfman, Tax Expenditures:
From Idea to Ideology, 99 Harv.L.Rev. 491, 491-492 (1985). In
fact, Congress has provided a similar &quot;tax expenditure&quot;
in Sec. 107 of the Internal Revenue Code by granting a &quot;
'minister of the gospel' &quot; an unlimited exclusion for the
rental value of any home furnished as part of his pay or for the
rental allowance paid to him. See id., at 492, n. 6.
<P>
Although Professor Bittker is certainly a leading scholar in the
tax field, the dissent's reliance on Bittker, see post, at 20,
n. 7, is misplaced in this context. See Adler, The Internal Revenue
Code, The Constitution, and the Courts: The Use of Tax Expenditure
Analysis in Judicial Decision Making, 28 Wake Forest L.Rev. 855,
862, n. 30 (1993):
<P>
&quot;Early criticism of the tax expenditure concept focused on
the difficulty of drawing a dividing line between what is or is
not a special provision. Professor Boris Bittker, for example,
argued that since no tax is all inclusive, exemptions from any
tax could not be described as the equivalent of subsidies. Boris
I. Bittker, Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J.
1285 (1969). This wholesale rejection of tax expenditure analysis
was short-lived and attracted few supporters. Rather, the large
body of literature about tax expenditures accepts the basic concept
that special exemptions from tax function as subsidies. The current
debate focuses on whether particular items are correctly identified
as tax expenditures and whether incentive provisions are more
efficient when structured as tax expenditures rather than direct
spending programs. See generally [numerous authorities].&quot;
*2551_ FN1. Justice THOMAS suggests that Madison would have approved
of the assessment bill if only it had satisfied the principle
of evenhandedness. Nowhere in the Remonstrance, however, did Madison
advance the view that Virginia should be able to provide financial
support for religion as part of a generally available subsidy
program. Indeed, while Justice THOMAS claims that the &quot;funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects,&quot; ante, at 2529, it is clear that the bill
was more general in scope than this. While the bill, which is
reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 72-74,
67 S.Ct. 504, 538-540, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), provided that each
taxpayer could designate a religious society to which he wanted
his levy paid, id., at 73, 67 S.Ct., at 539, it would also have
allowed a taxpayer to refuse to appropriate his levy to any religious
society, in which case the legislature was to use these unappropriated
sums to fund &quot;seminaries of learning.&quot; Id., at 74, 67
S.Ct., at 540 (contrary to Justice THOMAS's unsupported assertion,
this portion of the bill was no less obligatory than any other).
While some of these seminaries undoubtedly would have been religious
in character, others would not have been, as a seminary was generally
understood at the time to be &quot;any school, academy, college
or university, in which young persons are instructed in the several
branches of learning which may qualify them for their future employments.&quot;
N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1st
ed. 1828); see also 14 The Oxford English Dictionary 956 (2d ed.1989).
Not surprisingly, then, scholars have generally agreed that the
bill would have provided funding for nonreligious schools. See,
e.g., Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot; Aid to Religion: A
False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 875,
897 (1986) (&quot;Any taxpayer could refuse to designate a church,
with undesignated church taxes going to a fund for schools ...
The bill used the phrase 'seminaries of learning,' which almost
certainly meant schools generally and not just schools for the
training of ministers&quot;); T. Buckley, Church and State in
Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-1787, p. 133 (1977) (&quot;The assessment
had been carefully drafted to permit those who preferred to support
education rather than religion to do so&quot;); T. Curry, The
First Freedoms 141 (1986) (&quot;[T]hose taxes not designated
for any specific denomination [were] allocated to education&quot;).
It is beside the point that &quot;there was no system of public
education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment
bill was proposed,&quot; ante, at 2529, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring);
because the bill was never passed, the funds that it would have
made available for secular, public schools never materialized.
The fact that the bill, if passed, would have funded secular as
well as religious instruction did nothing to soften Madison's
opposition to it.
<P>
Nor is it fair to argue that Madison opposed the bill only because
it treated religious groups unequally. Ante, at 2529 (THOMAS,
J., concurring). In various paragraphs of the Remonstrance, Madison
did complain about the bill's peculiar burdens and exemptions,
Everson, supra, at 66, 67 S.Ct., at 536, but to identify this
factor as the sole point of Madison's opposition to the bill is
unfaithful to the Remonstrance's text. Madison strongly inveighed
against the proposed aid for religion for a host of reasons (the
Remonstrance numbers 15 paragraphs, each containing at least one
point in opposition), and crucial here is the fact that many of
those reasons would have applied whether or not the state aid
was being distributed equally among sects, and whether or not
the aid was going to those sects in the context of an evenhanded
government program. See, e.g., Madison's Remonstrance, reprinted
in Everson, 330 U.S., at 64, 67 S.Ct., at 535, p 1 (&quot;[I]n
matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution
of Civil Society, and ... Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance&quot;);
id., at 67, 67 S.Ct., at 536-537, p 6 (arguing that State support
of religion &quot;is a contradiction to the Christian Religion
itself; for every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers
of this world&quot;); ibid., p 7 (&quot;[E]xperience witnesseth
that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the
purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation&quot;).
Madison's objections were supplemented by numerous other petitions
in opposition to the bill that likewise do not suggest that the
lack of evenhandedness was its dispositive flaw. L. Levy, The
Establishment Clause 63-67 (2d ed.1994). For example, the petition
that received the largest number of signatories was motivated
by the view that religion should only be supported voluntarily.
Id., at 63-64. Indeed, Madison's Remonstrance did not argue for
a bill distributing aid to all sects and religions on an equal
basis, and the outgrowth of the Remonstrance and the defeat of
the Virginia assessment was not such a bill; rather, it was the
Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which, as discussed
in the text, proscribed the use of tax dollars for religious purposes.
<P>
In attempting to recast Madison's opposition as having principally
been targeted against &quot;governmental preferences for particular
religious faiths,&quot; ante, at 2530 (emphasis in original),
Justice THOMAS wishes to wage a battle that was lost long ago,
for &quot;this Court has rejected unequivocally the contention
that the Establishment Clause forbids only governmental preference
of one religion over another,&quot; School Dist. of Abington v.

<P>
*2551_ FN2. Justice THOMAS attempts to cast doubt on this accepted
version of Establishment Clause history by reference to historical
facts that are largely inapposite. Ante, at 2530-2531, 2533 (concurring
opinion). As I have said elsewhere, individual Acts of Congress,
especially when they are few and far between, scarcely serve as
an authoritative guide to the meaning of the religion clauses,
for &quot;like other politicians, [members of the early Congresses]
could raise constitutional ideals one day and turn their backs
on them the next. [For example,] ... [t]en years after proposing
the First Amendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,
measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards. If the
early Congress's political actions were determinative, and not
merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning, we would
have to gut our current First Amendment doctrine to make room
for political censorship.&quot; Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577,
626, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2676, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (concurring
opinion). The legislation cited by Justice THOMAS, including the
Northwest Ordinance, is no more dispositive than the Alien and
Sedition Acts in interpreting the First Amendment. Even less persuasive,
then, are citations to constitutionally untested Acts dating from
the mid-19th century, for without some rather innovative argument,
they cannot be offered as providing an authoritative gloss on
the Framers' intent.
<P>
Justice THOMAS's references to Madison's actions as a legislator
also provide little support for his cause. Justice THOMAS seeks
to draw a significant lesson out of the fact that, in seeking
to disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia in 1776, Madison
did not inveigh against state funding of religious activities.
Ante, at 2530 (concurring opinion). That was not the task at hand,
however. Madison was acting with the specific goal of eliminating
the special privileges enjoyed by Virginia Anglicans, and he made
no effort to lay out the broader views of church and state that
came to bear in his drafting of the First Amendment some 13 years
later. That Madison did not speak in more expansive terms than
necessary in 1776 was hardly surprising for, as it was, his proposal
was defeated by the Virginia Convention as having gone too far.
Ibid.
<P>
Similarly, the invocation of Madison's tenure on the congressional
committee that approved funding for legislative chaplains provides
no support for more general principles that run counter to settled
Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I have previously pointed
out, Madison, upon retirement, &quot;insisted that 'it was not
with my approbation, that the deviation from [the immunity of
religion from civil jurisdiction] took place in Congs., when they
appointed Chaplains, to be paid from the Natl. Treasury.' &quot;
Lee, supra, at 625, n. 6, 112 S.Ct., at 2675, n. 6, quoting Letter
from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders'
Constitution, at 105. And when we turned our attention to deciding
whether funding of legislative chaplains posed an establishment
problem, we did not address the practice as one instance of a
larger class of permissible government funding of religious activities.
Instead, Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 791, 103 S.Ct. 3330,
3335-3336, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983), explicitly relied on the singular,
200-year pedigree of legislative chaplains, noting that &quot;[t]his
unique history&quot; justified carving out an exception for the
specific practice in question. Given that the decision upholding
this practice was expressly limited to its facts, then, it would
stand the Establishment Clause on its head to extract from it
a broad rule permitting the funding of religious activities.
<P>
FN3. In the District Court, the parties agreed to the following
facts: &quot;The University of Virginia has charged at all times
relevant herein and currently charges each full-time student a
compulsory student activity fee of $14.00 per semester. There
is no procedural or other mechanism by which a student may decline
to pay the fee.&quot; App. 37; see also App. 9, 21.
<P>
FN4. To the extent the Court perceives some distinction between
the printing and dissemination of evangelism and proselytization,
and core religious activity &quot;in [its] usual sense,&quot;
ante, at 2524, this distinction goes entirely unexplained in the
Court's opinion.
<P>
FN5. In a narrow band of cases at the polar extreme from direct
funding cases, those involving essential public benefits commonly
associated with living in an organized society (like police and
fire protection, for example), evenhandedness may become important
to ensuring that religious interests are not inhibited.
<P>
*2551_ FN6. In Zobrest, a deaf student sought to have an interpreter,
provided under a state Act aiding individuals with disabilities,
accompany him to a Roman Catholic high school. In Witters, a blind
student sought to use aid, provided under a state program for
assistance to handicapped persons, to attend a private Christian
college. In Mueller, parents sought to take a tax deduction, available
for parents of both public and nonpublic schoolchildren, for certain
expenses incurred in connection with providing education for their
children in private religious schools.
<P>
FN7. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct.
1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970), is yet another example of a case
in which the Court treated the general availability of a government
benefit as a significant condition defining compliance with the
Establishment Clause, but did not deem that condition sufficient.
In upholding state property tax exemptions given to religious
organizations in Walz, we noted that the law at issue was applicable
to &quot;a broad class of property owned by nonprofit [and] quasipublic
corporations,&quot; id., at 673, 90 S.Ct., at 1413, but did not
rest on that factor alone. Critical to our decision was the central
principle that direct funding of religious activities is prohibited
under the Establishment Clause. &quot;It is sufficient to note
that for the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment
the 'establishment' of a religion connoted sponsorship, financial
support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious
activity.&quot; Id., at 668, 90 S.Ct., at 1411. We emphasized
that the tax exemptions did not involve the expenditure of government
funds in support of religious activities. &quot;The grant of a
tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not
transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstains from
demanding that the church support the state.&quot; Id., at 675,
90 S.Ct., at 1415. Moreover, we noted that in the property taxation
context, &quot;exemption[s] creat[e] only a minimal and remote
involvement between church and state and far less than taxation
of churches,&quot; and in operation &quot;ten[d] to complement
and reinforce the desired separation insulating&quot; church and
state, id., at 676, 90 S.Ct., at 1415; and that religious property
tax exemptions have been in place for over 200 years without disruption
to the interests represented by the Establishment Clause, id.,
at 676-680, 90 S.Ct., at 1415-1417.
<P>
Justice THOMAS's assertion, that &quot;[a] tax exemption in many
cases is economically and functionally indistinguishable from
a direct monetary subsidy,&quot; ante, at 2531 (concurring opinion)
(footnote omitted), assumes that the &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;
tax base is so self-evident that any provision excusing a person
or institution from taxes to which others are subjected must be
a departure from the natural tax base rather than part of the
definition of the tax base itself. The equivalence (asserted by
Justice THOMAS, ante, at 2531) between a direct money subsidy
and the tax liability avoided by an institution (because it is
part of the class of institutions that defines the relevant tax
base by its exclusion) was tested and dispatched long ago by Professor
Bittker in Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J.
1285 (1969). Justice THOMAS's suggestion that my &quot;reliance
on Bittker ... is misplaced in this context,&quot; ante, at 2532,
n. 5, is not on point. Even granting that Justice THOMAS's assertion
of equivalence is reasonable, he cannot and does not deny the
fact that the Court in Walz explicitly distinguished tax exemptions
from direct money subsidies, 397 U.S., at 675, 90 S.Ct., at 1414,
and rested its decision on that distinction. If Justice THOMAS's
assertion of equivalence should prevail then the Walz Court necessarily
was wrong about a distinction critical to its holding. Justice
THOMAS can hardly use Walz coherently for support after removing
the basis on which it relies.
<P>
FN8. Although the main opinion in Tilton was a plurality, the
entire Court was unanimous on this point. See, 403 U.S., at 682-684,
91 S.Ct., at 2097-2099 (plurality opinion); id., at 692, 91 S.Ct.,
at 2102 (Douglas, J., joined by Black and Marshall, JJ., concurring
in part and dissenting in part);
<P>
Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 659-661, 91 S.Ct. 2125, 2134-2135,
29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971) (opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 665, n.
1, 91 S.Ct., at 2137, n. 1 (opinion of White, J.).
<P>
*2551_ FN9. Congress apparently also reads our cases as the University
did, for it routinely excludes religious activities from general
funding programs. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1062(b) (federal grant
program for institutions of higher education; &quot;[n]o grant
may be made under this chapter for any educational program, activity,
or service related to sectarian instruction or religious worship,
or provided by a school or department of divinity&quot;); 20 U.S.C.
Sec. 1069c (certain grants to higher education institutions &quot;may
not be used ... for a school or department of divinity or any
religious worship or sectarian activity ...&quot;); 20 U.S.C.
Sec. 1132c-3(c) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (federal assistance for renovation
of certain academic facilities; &quot;[n]o loan may be made under
this part for any educational program, activity or service related
to sectarian instruction or religious worship or provided by a
school or department of divinity or to an institution in which
a substantial portion of its functions is subsumed in a religious
mission&quot;); 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1132i(c) (grant program for educational
facilities;
<P>
&quot;no project assisted with funds under this subchapter shall
ever be used for religious worship or a sectarian activity or
for a school or department of divinity&quot;); 20 U.S.C. Sec.
1213d (&quot;No grant may be made under this chapter for any educational
program, activity, or service related to sectarian instruction
or religious worship, or provided by a school or department of
divinity&quot;); 25 U.S.C. Sec. 3306(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (funding
for Indian higher education programs; &quot;[n]one of the funds
made available under this subchapter may be used for study at
any school or department of divinity or for any religious worship
or sectarian activity&quot;); 29 U.S.C. Sec. 776(g) (grants for
projects and activities for rehabilitation of handicapped persons;
&quot;[n]o funds provided under this subchapter may be used to
assist in the construction of any facility which is or will be
used for religious worship or any sectarian activity&quot;); 42
U.S.C. Sec. 3027(a)(14)(A)(iv) (requiring states seeking federal
aid for construction of centers for the elderly to submit plans
providing assurances that &quot;the facilit[ies] will not be used
and [are] not intended to be used for sectarian instruction or
as ... place[s] for religious worship&quot;); 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5001(a)(2)
(1988 ed., Supp. V) (federal grants to support volunteer projects
for the elderly, but not including &quot;projects involving the
construction, operation, or maintenance of so much of any facility
used or to be used for sectarian instruction or as a place for
religious worship&quot;); 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9858k(a) (1988 ed., Supp.
V) (no child care and development block grants &quot;shall be
expended for any sectarian purpose or activity, including sectarian
worship or instruction&quot;).
<P>
FN10. The Court acknowledges that &quot;if the State pays a church's
bills it is subsidizing it,&quot; and concedes that &quot;we must
guard against this abuse.&quot; Ante, at 2524. These concerns
are not present here, the Court contends, because Wide Awake &quot;is
not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense of that
term as used in our case law.&quot; Ibid. The Court's concession
suggests that its distinction between paying a religious institution
and paying a religious institution's bills is not really significant.
But if the Court is relying on its characterization of Wide Awake
as not a religious institution, &quot;at least in the usual sense,&quot;
the Court could presumably stop right there.
<P>
FN11. The Court draws a distinction between a State's use of public
funds to advance its own speech and the State's funding of private
speech, suggesting that authority to make content-related choices
is at its most powerful when the State undertakes the former.
Ante, at 2518-2519. I would not argue otherwise, see Hazelwood
School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 270-273, 108 S.Ct. 562,
569-571, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988), but I do suggest that this case
reveals the difficulties that can be encountered in drawing this
distinction. There is a communicative element inherent in the
very act of funding itself, cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,
15-19, 96 S.Ct. 612, 632-635, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam
), and although it is the student speakers who choose which particular
messages to advance in the forum created by the University, the
initial act of defining the boundaries of the forum is a decision
attributable to the University, not the students. In any event,
even assuming that private and state speech always may be separated
by clean lines and that this case involves only the former, I
believe the distinction is irrelevant here because, as is discussed
infra, this case does not involve viewpoint discrimination. *2551_
FN12. I do not decide that all viewpoint discrimination in a public
university's funding determinations would violate the Free Speech
Clause. If, however, the determinations are made on the basis
of a reasonable subject-matter distinction, but not on a viewpoint
distinction, there is no violation. In a limited-access forum,
a speech restriction must be &quot;reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum&quot; as well as viewpoint-neutral.
E.g., Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147, quoting
Cornelius, 473 U.S., at 806, 105 S.Ct., at 3439. Because petitioners
have not challenged the University's Guideline as unreasonable,
I express no opinion on that or on the question whether the reasonableness
criterion applies in speech funding cases in the same manner that
it applies in limited-access forum cases.
<P>
FN13. See also Tr. of Oral Arg. in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 51, 121 L.Ed.2d
20, where counsel for the school district charged with enforcing
the restriction unequivocally admitted that anyone with an atheistic
or antireligious message would be permitted to use school property
under the rules of the forum. Id., at 47, 57-58. The complete
exchange during the oral argument in Lamb's Chapel went as follows:
<P>
&quot;QUESTION: But do I understand your statement you made earlier
that supposing you had a communist group that wanted to address
the subject of family values and they thought there was a value
in not having children waste their time going to Sunday school
or church and therefore they had a point of view that was definitely
antireligious, they would be permitted, under your policy, to
discuss family values in that context?
<P>
&quot;[COUNSEL]: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.
<P>
&quot;QUESTION: Counsel, in your earlier discussions with [the
Court] you indicated that communists would be able to give their
perspective on family. I--I assume from that that atheists would
be able to give theirs under your rules.
<P>
&quot;[COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.&quot;

Before ERVIN, Chief Judge, WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, and SPROUSE,
Senior Circuit Judge.
<P>
OPINION
<P>
ERVIN, Chief Judge:
<P>
We must decide whether a state university's refusal to disburse
monies from its student activities fund for the benefit of a student-run
religious publication violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments
to the Constitution. We hold that it does not.
<P>
I
<P>
A
<P>
The University of Virginia collects a mandatory student activities
fee of fourteen dollars per semester, together with tuition payments,
from each of its full-time students. The proceeds of the collection
are deposited in the University's Student Activities Fund (&quot;SAF&quot;),
which is used to support the wide variety of student organizations,
activities, and publications that function at the University.
<P>
To qualify for student-activity-fee funds, a student group first
must attain the status of a &quot;Contracted Independent Organization&quot;
(&quot;CIO&quot;) at the University. CIO status is available to
any group that is composed in its majority of students, is managed
by officers who are full-time students, keeps an updated copy
of its constitution on file with the University, and signs an
anti-discrimination disclaimer. CIOs are given access to University
facilities, including meeting rooms and computer terminals, as
well as the right to apply for student-activity-fee funds. The
standard CIO agreement executed between qualified student groups
and the University states that benefits provided to the groups
by the University
<P>
should not be misinterpreted as meaning that those organizations
are part of or controlled by the University, that the University
is responsible for the organizations' *271 contracts or other
acts or omissions, or that the University approves of the organizations'
goals or activities.
<P>
As the corporate body responsible under state law for governing
the institution, (FN1) the Rector and Visitors of the University
of Virginia (&quot;Rector and Visitors&quot;) wield ultimate decisionmaking
power over the operation of the SAF. The Rector and Visitors have
delegated responsibility for allocating SAF monies to the University's
Student Council. A CIO seeking an SAF grant must submit a detailed
application for funding to the Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee
of the full Student Council, which approves or denies the request.
Appeal from a denial of funding by the Appropriations Committee
may be taken to the full Student Council. Upon the Council's affirmance
of the Appropriations Committee's decision, a second appeal may
be argued before the University's Student Activities Committee,
a faculty body chaired by a designee of the Vice President for
Student Affairs.
<P>
The decisions of each of these authorities with respect to awards
of SAF monies must be taken in compliance with certain guidelines
promulgated by the Rector and Visitors. These guidelines, adopted
in 1970, charge the Student Council with administering the SAF
&quot;in a manner consistent with the educational purpose of the
University as well as with State and Federal law.&quot; The guidelines
prohibit several categories of student organizations from obtaining
SAF funds, according to the nature of the organization and the
purpose for which the funds would be used. Although they may attain
CIO status, fraternities and sororities, political and religious
organizations, and groups whose membership policies are exclusionary
in nature are ineligible for SAF funding. The following expenditures
and activities also are excluded by the guidelines: (1) honoraria
or similar fees; (2) religious activities; (3) social entertainment
and related expenses; (4) philanthropic contributions and activities;
and (5) political activities. (FN2)
<P>
Once a student organization attains CIO status and becomes eligible
for funding, the guidelines prescribe the following criteria for
allocating SAF monies among CIOs: (1) the size of the group; (2)
the University-wide benefits conferred by the group's activities;
and (3) the group's financial self-sufficiency. After a student
organization is approved for funding, it submits expense vouchers
to the SAF, which are paid only upon a determination that a particular
expense is fundable under the guidelines. SAF monies are not paid
to the group, but are disbursed directly to the group's creditors
to discharge the fundable expense.
<P>
For the academic year 1990-91, 343 student organizations qualified
as CIOs. Of these 343 groups, 135 applied for SAF funding, and
118 were awarded SAF monies. Numbered among the funded organizations
were fifteen student publications; (FN3) also included were the
Muslim Students Association, the Jewish Law Students Association,
and the C.S. Lewis Society.
<P>
B
<P>
In September 1990 Ronald W. Rosenberger, an undergraduate at the
University, joined with other University students to found Wide
Awake Productions. According to its constitution, Wide Awake Productions
is an unincorporated association with the stated purposes of (1)
&quot;publishing a magazine *272 of philosophical and religious
expression&quot;; (2) &quot;facilitating discussion which fosters
an atmosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints&quot;;
and (3) &quot;providing a unifying focus for Christians of multicultural
backgrounds.&quot; Wide Awake Productions publishes Wide Awake:
A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia (&quot;Wide
Awake &quot;), a nonprofit journal written and edited by the student
members of Wide Awake Productions. As stated by Rosenberger, who
serves as editor-in-chief of Wide Awake, the journal (FN4) was
launched when the members of Wide Awake Productions &quot;realized
that none of the fifteen student-run publications at the University
provided a forum for Christian expression,&quot; and decided to
fill this perceived void. See &quot;Letter from the Editor,&quot;
Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia,
Nov.-Dec. 1990, at 2. Wide Awake and Wide Awake Productions are
not affiliated with any religious institution, and allow any University
student to join without regard to sex, race, religion, or color.
<P>
At the time notice of the instant appeal was filed, three issues
of Wide Awake had been published, with approximately 5,000 copies
of each issue being distributed free of charge to persons on the
University campus. According to editor Rosenberger's comments
in the first issue, Wide Awake 's mission is twofold: &quot;to
challenge Christians to live, in word and deed, according to the
faith they proclaim[,] and to encourage students to consider what
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.&quot; Id. In
furtherance of this mission, Wide Awake &quot;offers a Christian
perspective on both personal and community issues, especially
those relevant to college students at the University of Virginia.&quot;
Id.
<P>
The content of the three issues of Wide Awake published thus far
forms part of the record in this case. The first issue's cover
story, &quot;Eracing Mistakes,&quot; offered Christian solutions
for the enduring calamity of racism, see id. at 1, 12-14; other
articles treated such diverse issues as &quot;crisis pregnancy,&quot;
Oxford Christian apologeticist C.S. Lewis's ideas about evil and
free will, &quot;beating stress,&quot; and &quot;praying with
a thankful heart,&quot; all written from an avowedly Christian
stance. See id. at 4-5, 6-8, 15, 21. The featured contribution
in the second issue, &quot;Out of the Closet and Into the Light,&quot;
addressed the question &quot;How should the Church respond to
homosexuals ... and vice versa?&quot; See id., Mar./Apr.1991,
at 1, 14-17. The second issue also included an interview with
a Christian professor of mathematics at the University, an article
on Christian missionary work throughout the world, and two commentaries
offering spiritual guidance (titled respectively &quot;God's Word:
<P>
A Spiritual Advantage,&quot; and &quot;On Your Own: Hope and Spirit&quot;).
See id. at 5-7, 11-13, 20-21. The third issue contained articles
about a University graduate's experiences as a missionary in Moldavia,
eating disorders (titled &quot;From Calorie to Calvary&quot;),
and a Christian musician (&quot;Keith Green: Piano Man for Christ&quot;).
See id., Sept.-Oct. 1991, at 5-7, 12-14, 18-20. Columns in all
three issues reviewed newly released recordings of music of religious
disposition. (FN5) *273 The plaintiffs do not dispute that in
publishing Wide Awake they are engaged in a &quot;religious activit[y]&quot;
as the SAF guidelines define the phrase. (FN6) Indeed, after reading
its contents dispassionately, we are compelled to mark Wide Awake
's unflagging (FN7) invocation of religious, specifically Christian,
themes. The journal's pages are pervasively devoted to providing
a &quot;Christian perspective&quot; in printer's ink at the University
of Virginia. Wide Awake 's editorial stance extends to its advertising
sales: by the public release of the third issue represented in
the record (dated September/October 1991), roughly eighty percent
of the journal's five commercial and notice columns were given
over to Christian churches or to business entities purveying goods
and services of Christian bent. (FN8) Even Wide Awake 's physical
appearance draws attention to its religious posture:
<P>
the Christian symbol of the Cross, lying in a dark oval field,
is printed at the top of each page; another Cross marks the end
of each contribution.
<P>
Wide Awake Productions attained CIO status shortly after its founding.
Commensurate with this status, as the plaintiffs acknowledge,
the University openly accords Wide Awake Productions the same
access to University facilities as other CIOs. Such access includes
the use of University property for the group's meetings, functions,
and programs. CIO status affords the members of Wide Awake Productions
liberal recourse to University computer terminals, printers, and
other equipment employed in the preparation of manuscripts for
publication.
<P>
In January 1991, Ronald W. Rosenberger, on behalf of Wide Awake
Productions, submitted an application for SAF funding to the Appropriations
Committee of the Student Council in the amount of $5,862.00, to
cover publishing costs for Wide Awake. On February 26 of that
year the Appropriations Committee denied Rosenberger's application,
stating:
<P>
In reviewing the request by Wide Awake Productions, the ...
<P>
Committee determined your organization's request could not be
funded as it is a religious activity. This determination was made
after reviewing your first issue of Wide Awake. In particular,
the committee noted in your Editor's Letter that the publication
was &quot;a forum for Christian expression&quot; and a means &quot;to
challenge Christians (in how) to live&quot;....
<P>
Please be aware that this decision simply denies Student Activity
Fee funding for your publication. Wide Awake Productions may still
print and distribute issues on Grounds. (FN9)
<P>
The members of Wide Awake Productions promptly appealed the decision
to the full Student Council on March 3, 1991, contending that
their organization had satisfied all applicable SAF funding guidelines
and that the Appropriations Committee's denial of funding violated
the Constitution of the United States. The Student Council affirmed
the Appropriations Committee's decision without comment.
<P>
*274 Wide Awake Productions then appealed the Student Council's
ruling to the University's Student Activities Committee. On April
16, 1991, Associate Dean of Students Ronald J. Stump informed
Rosenberger of the Student Activities Committee's decision to
affirm the funding denial. Stump wrote:
<P>
After reviewing your organization's constitution, copies of the
magazine's first two editions, and the arguments presented at
last week's appeal by Wide Awake Productions and by [the] Student
Council, the Committee determined that the Wide Awake magazine
could not be funded as it is a religious activity. In effect,
the Student Activities Committee fully supports the decision and
reasoning provided to you in the February 26 letter from [the
Appropriations Committee]. As noted in [that] letter, Wide Awake
Productions may still print and distribute copies of the magazine
and as a CIO has full and equal access to other University facilities
and services.
<P>
The Student Activities Committee's repudiation exhausted all internal
avenues of appeal within the University for the institution's
denial of SAF funding to Wide Awake Productions.
<P>
C
<P>
On July 11, 1991, the members of Wide Awake Productions brought
this action against the Rector and Visitors and Dean Stump pursuant
to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.
<P>
(FN10) The plaintiffs' complaint set forth three challenges to
the SAF guidelines' exclusion of &quot;religious activities,&quot;
including the publication of Wide Awake, from eligibility for
funding consideration, each predicated upon provisions of the
Constitution of the United States. To each of the plaintiffs'
federal constitutional claims were appended alternative and supplemental
claims seeking recovery under the provisions of Article I of the
Constitution of Virginia (FN11) and, in the case of Count Two,
under the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs.
57-1 to -2 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993). The plaintiffs did not
challenge directly the University's refusal to fund Wide Awake
Productions, except insofar as the adverse funding decisions flowed
directly from the requirements of the guidelines themselves.
<P>
(FN12)
<P>
Count One, the complaint's most comprehensive theory of recovery,
alleged that the guidelines' proscription of SAF funding for the
publication costs of Wide Awake violated the Free Speech and Press
Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
(FN13) and Article I, Section 12 of the Virginia Constitution
(FN14) (1) by unlawfully depriving the members of Wide Awake Productions
of government benefits solely because of the content and viewpoint
of their speech in Wide Awake; and (2) by illegally excluding
the members of Wide Awake Productions from the &quot;limited public
forum&quot; created by the Rector and Visitors' establishment
of the SAF and promulgation of the funding guidelines. Count One
also contended that the guidelines' &quot;definitions for allocating
SAF funds to CIOs&quot; are unconstitutionally vague because persons
of ordinary intelligence must guess at their meaning, and unlawfully
*275 overbroad because they impinge constitutionally protected
activity.
<P>
Count Two of the complaint maintained that the guidelines' denial
of SAF funding to &quot;religious activities&quot; violated the
Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution,
(FN15) Article I, Section 16 of the Virginia Constitution, (FN16)
and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs.
57-1 to -2 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993), (FN17) by discriminating
in the granting of a government benefit based upon (1) the religious
content of the expression in Wide Awake; and (2) the religious
beliefs, character, or affiliation of the members of Wide Awake
Productions. Count Two also imputed to the Rector and Visitors
&quot;conduct constitut[ing] a failure to give reasonable accommodation
to the plaintiffs' religious beliefs.&quot;
<P>
Count Three of the complaint alleged that the guidelines' prohibition
against subsidizing &quot;religious activit[ies],&quot; coupled
with the Rector and Visitors' denial of SAF funds to Wide Awake
Productions, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Federal Constitution (FN18) and the Anti-Discrimination
Clause of Article I, Section 11 of the Virginia Constitution.
(FN19) Specifically, Count Three contended (1) that the guidelines
&quot;den[ied] plaintiffs the benefits to which other students
and CIOs are entitled&quot; by unconstitutionally discriminating
against Wide Awake Productions on the basis of the content or
viewpoint of its members' speech and association; and (2) that
the guidelines unconstitutionally discriminated against the plaintiffs'
religious speech &quot;by denying [them] the benefits that other
students and CIOs engaged in religious speech and activities receive
and have received....&quot; This viewpoint- and religious-based
discrimination, Count Three maintained, was not justified by a
compelling state interest, nor was it narrowly tailored to achieve
whatever minimal interest the Rector and Visitors may have in
refusing to fund student &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
<P>
The plaintiffs sought redress for their alleged injuries in the
form of (1) a declaratory judgment that the guidelines' prohibition
against the funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; violated
their rights under the United States Constitution, the Virginia
Constitution, and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom; (2)
a permanent order enjoining the Rector and Visitors from promulgating
any proscription against the funding of Wide Awake Productions
on the basis of the content or viewpoint of its members' speech
in Wide Awake;
<P>
(3) compensatory damages of at least $5,862.00, the sum of SAF
funds unconstitutionally denied Wide Awake Productions; and (4)
an order awarding Wide Awake Productions reasonable costs and
attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988. (FN20)
<P>
*276 Agreeing that there were no material facts at issue, both
parties sought summary judgment as a matter of law. After hearing
oral argument on their opposing motions, the district court granted
summary judgment in favor of the Rector and Visitors on each count
of the plaintiffs' complaint, concluding (1) that the SAF was
not a &quot;limited public forum;&quot; (2) that application of
the funding guidelines did not result in viewpoint or content
discrimination against the speech of Wide Awake Productions; and
(3) that the denial of funding did not burden the plaintiffs'
free exercise of religion. See Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors
of Univ. of Va., 795 F.Supp. 175, 178-83 (W.D.Va.1992) (mem.).
The court also held that the plaintiffs' equal
<P>
protection challenge to the guidelines failed because the members
of Wide Awake Productions had not adduced evidence of the Rector
and Visitors' discriminatory intent. Although the district court
did not scrutinize the complaint's allegations that the guidelines
violated the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom, it held that the restrictions on funding for &quot;religious
activities&quot; did not &quot;impose an impermissible burden
on the plaintiffs' exercise of their rights as guaranteed by ...
the State Constitution[ ], or the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom.&quot;
Id. at 17.
<P>
This appeal followed.
<P>
II
<P>
Before addressing the substance of the plaintiffs' assignments
of error, we wish to make clear what precisely is at issue in
this appeal. The complaint alleges that the Rector and Visitors
have violated rights guaranteed the plaintiffs by the Constitution
of the United States, the Constitution of Virginia, and the Virginia
Act for Religious Freedom. Two of these sources derive from the
substantive law of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As such, they
comprise fonts of individual liberties independent of the Federal
Constitution, and are therefore susceptible of autonomous interpretation
by the courts of the Commonwealth. (FN21) Although the district
court embraced these pendent state-law claims in its favorable
grant of summary judgment to the Rector and Visitors, (FN22) they
were not controverted by the parties at the summary judgment hearing,
and were not subjected to independent scrutiny on their merits
below. We have no objective basis, therefore, upon which to assume
that any interpretation of the Virginia Constitution or the Virginia
Act for Religious Freedom contributed separately to the judgment
from which this appeal was taken. The parties have not attempted
to resuscitate them in their briefs or at oral argument. To bring
grounds for relief to the attention of an appellate tribunal,
the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure oblige the parties to
offer a written argument ... contain[ing] [their] contentions
... with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor,
with citations to the authorities ... and parts of the record
relied on.
<P>
Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(5), (b). We observe that none of the briefs
filed by either party in this court contains &quot;contentions&quot;
about the application of the Virginia Constitution's Declaration
of Rights or the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom to the instant
case, or &quot;citations to ... authorities&quot; that might illuminate
the special rights the state charter and religious-freedom statute
are said to guarantee. We therefore are compelled to conclude
that the parties have failed to appeal the district court's grant
of summary judgment with respect to these state-law theories of
recovery. Failure of this nature constitutes abandonment of the
claims, and precludes us from considering them further herein.
See Shopco Distrib. Co. v. Commanding Gen., 885 F.2d 167, 170
n. 3 (4th Cir.1989) (noting that failure to comply with terms
of former version of Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(5) constitutes waiver
of asserted claims).
<P>
*277 Therefore, the scope of our inquiry is confined to such of
the plaintiffs' assignments of error as rest upon the Constitution
of the United States. These are two. (FN23) First, the plaintiffs
contend that the guidelines' proscription of SAF funding for &quot;religious
activities&quot; violates the Free Speech and Press Clause of
the First Amendment (1) by depriving them of government benefits
based solely on the content and viewpoint of their speech in Wide
Awake, and (2) by excluding them from the &quot;limited public
forum&quot; represented by the SAF. Second, the plaintiffs argue
that the guidelines' funding restrictions discriminate against
them in contravention of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment (1) by denying them benefits which other CIOs engaged
in religious speech and activities have received, and (2) because
the restrictions serve no compelling state interest, and are not
narrowly tailored to satisfy whatever minimal interest the Rector
and Visitors may have in denying funding to &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
In the discussion that follows, we address these two claims in
turn, reviewing the legal conclusions on which the district court
granted summary judgment de novo. See, e.g., Brock v. Entre Computer
Ctrs., Inc., 933 F.2d 1253, 1259 (4th Cir.1991).
<P>
III
<P>
First, we examine the plaintiffs' contention that the guidelines'
proscription of SAF funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
violates the Free Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment
by depriving the members of Wide Awake Productions of government
benefits based solely on the content and viewpoint of their speech
in Wide Awake.
<P>
A
<P>
Because our decision rests ultimately upon our understanding of
the language of the First Amendment, we here undertake cursory
review of certain principles of constitutional interpretation
that guide our deliberations.
<P>
Like their cultural and ideological ancestors the Magna Carta
(1215) and the English Bill of Rights (1688), the first ten amendments
to the Federal Constitution represent what Justice Story called
&quot;a solemn recognition of limitations upon the power of parliament;
that is, a declaration, that parliament ought not to abolish,
or restrict&quot; certain fundamental rights of the person. III
Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States
Sec. 980, at 695 (1833). Taken as a whole, the provisions of the
Bill of Rights form a stout bulwark against government encroachment
upon the fundamental liberties of every person within the jurisdiction
of the United States. The amendments weigh as a counterpoise to
the specifically enumerated powers granted by the people of the
several states to their national government in the first three
Articles of the Federal Constitution.
<P>
By its terms the Free Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment
reflects the limiting purpose of the Bill of Rights. The Clause
pronounces the federal legislature's impotence to curb any individual's
freedom to express verbally her views upon any subject; it states
that Congress shall &quot;make no law ... abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 3
(emphasis added). While the First Amendment thus represents a
guarantee that freedom will be preserved in the face of legislative
ambition, it goes no further. Although the Amendment preserves
inviolate the individual's right to speak, it sustains speech
itself only indirectly. The Speech and Press Clause cannot be
metamorphosed into a promise that the federal government will
purchase a bullhorn, paper, and ink for the convenience of every
garrulous member of the American populace. The Constitution does
not guarantee the American people the means of self-expression;
it simply pledges that Congress (and, through application of *278
the Fourteenth Amendment, the states (FN24)) will not enact laws
or regulations restraining at its inception a person's right freely
to speak her views and to disseminate them by every means at her
disposal. A century and six decades after the publication of his
commentaries on our national charter, Justice Story's expression
of this principle retains all its peerless power:
<P>
That this amendment was intended to secure to every citizen an
absolute right to speak, or write, or print, whatever he might
please, without any responsibility, public or private, therefor,
is a supposition too wild to be indulged by any rational man....
It is plain, then, that the language of the amendment imports
no more, than that every man shall have a right to speak, write,
and print his opinions upon any subject whatsoever, without prior
restraint....
<P>
Story, supra, Sec. 993, at 703-04.
<P>
B
<P>
With these interpretative precepts firmly in hand, we turn to
the assignment of error lodged by the plaintiffs.
<P>
The plaintiffs do not suggest that the Rector and Visitors have
restrained them from speaking, writing, or printing commentary
upon religious themes, or indeed upon any other subject, on the
campus or within the purview of the University of Virginia. As
they freely admit, Wide Awake Productions is afforded the full
benefits of CIO status by the University. Its members are granted
the same access to meeting rooms on University grounds as other
CIOs, and are given generous run of University property for their
work and programs. The University affords Wide Awake Productions
liberal recourse to its computer terminals, printers, and other
equipment used to prepare manuscripts for publication. With the
University's full consent, the plaintiffs have thus far distributed
several thousand copies of Wide Awake on University grounds. The
plaintiffs do not, indeed cannot, suggest, therefore, that the
Rector and Visitors have placed a per se unconstitutional prior
restraint upon their freedom actually to speak or to publish their
views by denying them equal access to University facilities. Cf.
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 277, 102 S.Ct. 269, 278, 70 L.Ed.2d
440 (1981) (discussing erection of prior restraint against student
organization's use of state university property); Healy v. James,
408 U.S. 169, 180, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2345, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972)
(same).
<P>
Nor is the plaintiffs' complaint simply that the Rector and Visitors
have refused to pay for the publication of their speech with treasure
from the University fisc. If such were the nature of this dispute,
we might leave the field of independent analysis fallow. For there
is no question that the Commonwealth of Virginia, like any private
owner of property, may preserve the land and chattels under its
control for the use to which they are dedicated, and decline to
lend them for other purposes. E.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp;
Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 800, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3447-3448,
87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985); Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators'
Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).
As agents of the Commonwealth, the Rector and Visitors need not
subsidize extracurricular student activities in any form. Healy
v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 182 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346 n. 8, 33
L.Ed.2d 266 (1972). Having undertaken such subsidies, they need
not have promulgated criteria by which the Student Council could
differentiate between competing funding requests. Nor are the
Rector and Visitors under any affirmative obligation to ensure
that University students' expressive *279 activities are funded.
In language redolent of Justice Story's pointed commentary on
the Speech and Press Clause, the Supreme Court has rejected the
notion that the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the
press &quot;are somehow not fully realized unless they are subsidized
by the state.&quot; Regan v. Taxation with Representation, 461
U.S. 540, 546, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 2001, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983).
<P>
The Student Council's exercise of discretion in withholding SAF
monies from Wide Awake Productions is not, therefore, the basis
of the plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs contend, instead,
that once the Rector and Visitors have chosen to promulgate guidelines
governing the allocation of funds that support student speech
among competing student interests, such guidelines cannot condition
funding awards on the content or viewpoint of a prospective recipient's
speech. The Rector and Visitors have violated the First Amendment,
the plaintiffs maintain, by denying them the benefit of a University-funded
SAF grant on grounds that their publication of Wide Awake constitutes
a &quot;religious activit[y]&quot; (FN25) within the meaning of
the guidelines. Such discrimination contravenes the First Amendment,
they assert, because it implicitly condemns the content and viewpoint
of their speech in Wide Awake. This content and viewpoint discrimination
imposes a prior restraint upon the ability of Wide Awake Productions
to enjoy government largesse, and, the plaintiffs contend, must
therefore be struck down.
<P>
C
<P>
Having identified the constitutional character of the plaintiffs'
first assignment of error, we proceed to seek its resolution.
<P>
The notion that, whenever a government benefit or privilege might
be withheld altogether, it may be withheld on whatever conditions
government chooses to impose, has been thoroughly repudiated by
the Supreme Court since the middle of this century. See, e.g.,
Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 405, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1794-1795,
10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 518,
526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958); see also
Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law Sec. 11-5, at 781-84
(2d ed. 1988) (discussing &quot;elusive&quot; distinction between
withholding a government subsidy for and imposing a penalty upon
exercise of a constitutional right).
<P>
Unconstitutional conditions, which make enjoyment of a government
benefit contingent on sacrifice of an independent constitutional
right, are prima facie invalid. For if the government could deny
a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected
speech ..., his exercise of th[at] freedom[ ] would in effect
be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to
&quot;produce a result which [it] could not command directly.&quot;
Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.
<P>
Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2697, 33
L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (quoting Speiser, 357 U.S. at 526, 78 S.Ct.
at 1342). Whether a condition is unconstitutional depends on whether
the government may properly demand sacrifice of the particular
right asserted in the context of its exercise. FCC v. League of
Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 380, 395, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3117, 3125,
82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984).
<P>
We must decide whether the guidelines' prohibition against funding
&quot;religious activities&quot; *280 imposes an unconstitutional
condition upon receipt of the government benefit inherent in an
award of SAF monies by infringing the plaintiffs' claimed First
Amendment right to indulge religious expression. This decision
harbors a two-part inquiry. First, we must determine whether the
publication of Wide Awake constitutes &quot;speech&quot; protected
by the Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment. If we so
decide, we then must ask whether the Rector and Visitors are imposing
an unconstitutional condition upon the exercise of the plaintiffs'
protected speech; that is, we must determine whether the Rector
and Visitors are demanding that the members of Wide Awake Productions
cease publishing religious speech in Wide Awake before they may
become eligible (FN26) for an award of SAF funds.
<P>
1.
<P>
With respect to the first part of this inquiry, we easily conclude
that the plaintiffs' publication of religious speech in Wide Awake
falls within the protective ambit of the Speech and Press Clause.
There is no question that discussions of religion are, as they
long have been, a form of speech protected by the First Amendment.
See, e.g., Heffron v. International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness,
Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 647, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 2563-2564, 69 L.Ed.2d
298 (1981); Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558, 561-62, 68 S.Ct. 1148,
1150-51, 92 L.Ed. 1574 (1948). Although the Rector and Visitors'
prohibition of SAF funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
is not directed exclusively at religious speech, the phrase &quot;religious
activit[y]&quot; as defined in the guidelines necessarily encompasses
speech that &quot;primarily promotes or manifests a particular
belief[ ] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot; The
word &quot;activity&quot; is defined as &quot;an occupation, pursuit,
or recreation in which a person is active,&quot; Webster's Third
New International Dictionary 22 (1976).
<P>
There can be no doubt that the publication of a journal of religious
expression is precisely such an occupation, pursuit, or recreation.
<P>
2.
<P>
Having answered the first prong of the inquiry affirmatively,
we address the second prong: Have the Rector and Visitors effectively
demanded that the members of Wide Awake Productions cease publishing
religious commentary in Wide Awake before they may become &quot;eligible&quot;
for an award of SAF funds? We conclude that they have.
<P>
The guidelines lay upon the Student Council an affirmative obligation
not to fund &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot; This obligation
means that religious expression, such as that in Wide Awake, is
never allowed to compete for funds with other forms of speech
that might be indulged by University students. Even if a student
organization achieves CIO status, to the extent that its pursuits
and functions consist of religious speech, the organization's
funding requests will be summarily rejected by the Student Council.
In effect, then, the Rector and Visitors' restriction has operated
to erect a prior restraint on University subsidization of all
forms of religious expression in which a CIO might engage. While
we acknowledge that a CIO has no right to funding by the Rector
and Visitors, see, e.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union
Free Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146, 124
L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), when funds are made available to CIOs generally,
*281 they must be distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner, absent
considerations of equal constitutional dignity. See Board of Educ.
v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 2370-71, 110 L.Ed.2d
191 (1990) (plurality opinion); Grand Rapids Sch. Dist. v. Ball,
473 U.S. 373, 382, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3221-22, 87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985);
<P>
Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works, 426 U.S. 736, 746, 96 S.Ct. 2337,
2344-45, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976) (plurality opinion); Everson v.
Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 18, 67 S.Ct. 504, 513, 91 L.Ed. 711
(1947). Although government need not subsidize exercise of a constitutional
right, the lack of an affirmative duty of financial support does
not mean that government may, in general, penalize exercise of
constitutional rights by withholding from their possessors an
otherwise discretionary benefit.
<P>
We conclude that the Rector and Visitors' erection of a prior
restraint against University funding of such &quot;religious activities&quot;
as the publication of religious expression in Wide Awake constitutes
precisely such a penalty, because it restrains Wide Awake Productions
from gaining access altogether to a funding source generally available
to CIOs not engaged in religious expression. (FN27) This prior
restraint ultimately forces the members of Wide Awake Productions--unlike
their nonsectarian CIO colleagues--to seek financial sustenance
for their speech from coffers outside the University. The Rector
and Visitors' funding proscription thus creates an uneven playing
field on which the advantage is tilted towards CIOs engaged in
wholly secular modes of expression.
<P>
We hold, therefore, that the Rector and Visitors have conditioned
the plaintiffs' receipt of government benefits upon their foregoing
constitutionally protected religious expression.
<P>
D
<P>
In reaching and forbidding funding for speech that meets the definition
of &quot;religious activity,&quot; but not for speech of other
types, the SAF guidelines discriminate among speech on the basis
of its content. Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U.S. 221, 229-30, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1727-28, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987).
In order to justify differential treatment of funding eligibility
based on the content of the speech involved, &quot;the State must
show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state
interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.&quot; Id.
at 231, 107 S.Ct. at 1729; see also Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S.
263, 270, 102 S.Ct. 269, 274, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981); Carey v.
Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 461, 464-65, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 2292-93,
65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 184, 92 S.Ct.
2338, 2347-48, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972). It is to this inquiry that
we now turn.
<P>
In defense of the guidelines' prohibition, the Rector and Visitors
claim a compelling interest in maintaining strict separation of
church and state. (FN28) They derive this interest *282 from the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which admonishes
Congress (and, through application of the Fourteenth Amendment,
the states (FN29)) to &quot;make no law respecting an establishment
of religion.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 1. The Rector and
Visitors argue that they cannot fund &quot;religious activities&quot;
without violating the Establishment Clause.
<P>
We agree with the Rector and Visitors that their interest as state
officials in complying with federal constitutional obligations,
including avoiding the creation of an &quot;establishment&quot;
of religion at the University of Virginia, may be characterized
as compelling. See Widmar, 454 U.S. at 271, 102 S.Ct. at 275.
It does not follow, however, that offering Wide Awake Productions
an equal opportunity to compete for SAF funds necessarily would
be incompatible with the Establishment Clause. Id.
<P>
That government largesse ultimately should redound to the benefit
of persons engaged in promoting religion does not necessarily
entail violation of the Establishment Clause. If such were the
case, &quot;a church could not be protected by the police and
fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept in repair.&quot;
Id. at 274-75, 102 S.Ct. at 277. Moreover, such an extreme position
is plainly contrary to many of the Supreme Court's decisions upholding
government aid to parochial elementary and secondary schools.
See, e.g., Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., --- U.S.
----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466-67, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993)
(summarizing the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence with
respect to government aid to parochial schools).
<P>
To test the Rector and Visitors' Establishment Clause justification
for the guidelines' funding policy, then, we must consider whether
awarding SAF monies to the members of Wide Awake Productions to
defray the publication costs of Wide Awake would constitute an
&quot;establishment of religion&quot; at the University of Virginia.
In making this determination, we seek enlightenment in the Supreme
Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence. That jurisprudence
holds that a governmental policy will not offend the Establishment
Clause if it can pass constitutional muster under the three-pronged
test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d
745 (1971), which guides &quot;[t]he general nature of our inquiry
in this area,&quot; Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 394, 103 S.Ct.
3062, 3066, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983):
<P>
First, the [governmental policy] must have a secular legislative
purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that
neither advances nor inhibits religion ...; finally, the [policy]
must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.
<P>
Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. at 2111-12. (FN30) *283 In
the paragraphs that follow, we consider the Rector and Visitors'
Establishment Clause justification for prohibiting SAF funding
of &quot;religious activities&quot; in light of Lemon. (FN31)
<P>
1.
<P>
Lemon 's first prong focuses on the &quot;purpose that animated&quot;
the Rector and Visitors' adoption of the SAF funding guidelines,
Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 585, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 2578,
96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987), and asks whether that purpose was secular.
<P>
The obvious point of departure for analyzing the purpose of the
guidelines is the Rector and Visitors' comments at the time of
their adoption. Although the guidelines are the result of largely
undocumented deliberations by the Rector and Visitors, and thus
cannot be said to possess a &quot;legislative history&quot; as
that term usually is understood, they do contain a &quot;Student
Activity Fee Statement of Purpose&quot; relevant to our deliberations.
This statement reads:
<P>
The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial
support for student organizations that are related to the educational
purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee,
the monies collected by the University for funding student activities
are public funds which must be administered in a manner consistent
with the educational purpose of the University as well as with
state and federal law.
<P>
The funding guidelines themselves, which immediately follow the
&quot;Student Activity Fee Statement of Purpose&quot; and are
part of the *284 same document, were adopted by the Rector and
Visitors in an attempt to give practical effect to the SAF's goal
of providing financial support for student organizations related
to the University's educational purpose. In the third section
of the guidelines, titled &quot;Student Expenditures and Activities
Not Eligible for Funding,&quot; the Rector and Visitors proscribed
funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; on the ground that
such activities &quot;do not relate to the educational purpose
of the University.&quot;
<P>
These statements make clear that the Rector and Visitors' aim
in denying SAF funding to &quot;religious activities&quot; was
to comply with the University of Virginia's educational function--a
facially secular legislative purpose. (FN32) Because religion
is taught and studied as a subject of formal academic inquiry
at the University, however, the plaintiffs contend that religious
expression forms part of the institution's educational &quot;purpose.&quot;
They argue, therefore, that the University, already having admitted
religious discussion formally into the academic curriculum, can
have no stake in depriving such discussion of access to its coffers,
even if the source of the discussion is a student organization.
<P>
We disagree. That religion is studied at the University does not
mean that offering SAF funding to Wide Awake would promote the
essentially secular &quot;educational purpose&quot; of the institution,
or that such funding necessarily would not threaten the Establishment
Clause. Since its founding by Thomas Jefferson in the second decade
of the nineteenth century, the University's educational purpose
has included teaching and scholarship on a wide array of subjects,
(FN33) including the organized study of religious systems. As
the plaintiffs note, while serving as Rector of the University
Jefferson explained that no professorship of divinity had been
established &quot;in conformity with the principles of [the] constitution,
which place all sects of religion on an equal footing,&quot; but
that arrangements would be made to allow various denominations
to establish schools &quot;on the confines of the University&quot;
and to allow them access to University facilities. 19 The Writings
of Thomas Jefferson 408 (A. Bergh ed., 1905) (report to University
Visitors dated Oct. 7, 1822). That such &quot;schools&quot; were
incorporated into the University's intellectual and academic life
does not prevent the Rector and Visitors from employing funding
restrictions to advance the &quot;secular purpose&quot; of avoiding
an establishment of religion at the institution.
<P>
As we see it, it is clear from the SAF's statement of purpose
that the funding guidelines were motivated primarily, if not entirely,
by a legitimate secular purpose--the advancement of the University
of Virginia's educational mission. We do not question the propriety
of, nor the secular motivation for, the Rector and Visitors' interest
in preserving University funds for the institution's educational
mission. The Rector and Visitors do not dispute that, on the whole,
religious concerns were not the sole motivation behind the guidelines.
See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 680, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1362,
79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984). The record gives us no reason to doubt
that the Rector and Visitors' expressed purposes are &quot;sincere
and not a sham.&quot; Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 1366. Therefore,
we hold that the guidelines' proscription against funding of &quot;religious
activit[ies]&quot; is not motivated wholly by an impermissible
purpose, and does not offend the Establishment Clause.
<P>
2.
<P>
As is usual in Establishment Clause cases, see, e.g., Grand Rapids
School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 383-98, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3222-30,
*285 87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985), the more subtle question is whether
the primary effect of the guidelines restrictions is to inhibit
or advance religion. See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct. at 2111.
<P>
Although we concluded above that the prohibition against funding
&quot;religious activities&quot; denies religious speech the same
access to the SAF accorded secular speech, and thus violates the
Speech and Press Clause, whether &quot;religion&quot; is thereby
inhibited or advanced is a different matter. The Rector and Visitors
have not attempted to ban the publication of Wide Awake; indeed,
they have supported its religious mission by allowing the members
of Wide Awake Productions access to University meeting and printing
facilities equal to that afforded all other CIOs. The University
permits the plaintiffs to distribute Wide Awake on its grounds
without limitation.
<P>
Notwithstanding its refusal to subsidize the journal directly,
the University's sustenance of religion in these incidental respects
does not, in our view, inhibit religion. The University's policy
of allowing the members of Wide Awake Productions open access
to campus facilities accords the plaintiffs ample opportunity
to express their religious views, and leaves the University community
as a whole free to read and consider them. The Rector and Visitors'
funding policy simply declines to take the additional step of
actively subscribing University funds to Wide Awake 's particular
religious perspective. Under such circumstances as these, we are
unpersuaded that the primary effect of the guidelines restrictions,
involving as they do only the direct allocation of public monies,
would be to inhibit religion.
<P>
On the other hand, it would be difficult to view awarding SAF
monies to Wide Awake as anything but state sponsorship--and therefore
advancement--of religious belief. As the Constitution of Wide
Awake Productions attests, Wide Awake strives to challenge Christians
to live according to the faith they espouse, and to encourage
students at the University to consider &quot;what a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ means.&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at
2. The journal's contents--some of which are aimed at proselytizing
non-Christians--have pursued these goals indefatigably throughout
the three issues of Wide Awake represented in the record. Using
public funds to support a publication so clearly engaged in the
propagation of particular religious doctrines would constitute
a patent Establishment Clause violation. In the words of Justice
Powell:
<P>
Aid normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing
religion when it flows to an institution in which religion is
so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed
in the religious mission or when it funds a specifically religious
activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.
<P>
Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d
923 (1973) (emphasis added). Here, then, we hold that the primary
effect of an SAF subsidy of Wide Awake 's publication costs would
be to advance religion.
<P>
3.
<P>
It is the third of the three Lemon criteria--whether the guidelines'
prohibition of funding for &quot;religious activities&quot; fosters
an excessive government entanglement with religion--that is most
plainly implicated by this case. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct.
at 2111. The constitutional prohibition against excessive church-state
entanglement reflects James Madison's concern that secular and
religious authorities must not interfere with each other's respective
spheres of choice and influence. See III Jonathan Elliott, Debates
on the Federal Constitution 431-32, 729-31 (1891) (remarks of
James Madison); Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Educ., 333
U.S. 203, 212, 68 S.Ct. 461, 465-66, 92 L.Ed. 649 (1948). (FN34)
The entanglement principle thus stems ultimately from fears, originally
propounded by the First Amendment's principal framer, that church-state
entanglement might strain the political system, compromise *286
liberty of conscience, and, ultimately, &quot;destroy government
and downgrade religion.&quot; Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431,
82 S.Ct. 1261, 1267, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1961); Laurence H. Tribe,
American Constitutional Law Sec. 14-11, at 1226 (2d ed. 1988)
(summarizing the import of church-state entanglement).
<P>
The indirect and incidental conferral of a government benefit
to religious institutions has never been thought a sufficient
defect to warrant the invalidation of a state policy. Zobrest
v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466-69, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 274-75, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276-77, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981);
<P>
Committee for Public Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,
413 U.S. 756, 775, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 2966, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973).
Indeed, the Supreme Court has sanctioned awards of direct nonmonetary
benefits to religious groups where government has created open
fora to which all similarly situated organizations are invited.
In Widmar, for example, the Court held that a state university
which makes its facilities available to registered student groups
may not deny equal access to a registered student group desiring
to use those facilities for religious worship or discussion. 454
U.S. at 277, 102 S.Ct. at 278. Thus, although religious groups
may directly benefit from access to university facilities, a state
university may not discriminate against them based on the content
of their speech.
<P>
Direct monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects,
however, is a beast of an entirely different color. A proper respect
for the Establishment Clause compels the Rector and Visitors to
pursue a course of &quot;neutrality&quot; toward religion. Yet
providing SAF monies to defray the publication costs of Wide Awake
inevitably would advance Wide Awake 's Christian mission: &quot;to
encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with
Jesus Christ means.&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at 2. The
potentially divisive political effect of such funding is a factor
of recurring significance in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence
surrounding Lemon 's &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; prong.
As Justice Black emphasized in Everson v. Board of Education,
330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), competition among
religious sects for political and religious supremacy has occasioned
considerable civil strife throughout history, &quot;generated
in large part&quot; by competing efforts to gain or maintain the
support of government. Id. at 8-9, 67 S.Ct. at 507-509. As we
see it, the &quot;potential for political divisiveness related
to religious belief and practice&quot; would be aggravated if
the University were to fund the publication of Wide Awake. The
possibility of a continuing annual appropriation for the benefit
of a single religion carries the potential for seriously divisive
political consequences at the University of Virginia. The prospect
of such divisiveness, as Justice Powell has admonished, is a &quot;warning
signal&quot; the Rector and Visitors would ignore at their, and
the University's, peril. Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 798, 93 S.Ct. at
2978.
<P>
Because Wide Awake is a journal pervasively devoted to the discussion
and advancement of an avowedly Christian theological and personal
philosophy, for the University to subsidize its publication would,
we believe, send an unmistakably clear signal that the University
of Virginia supports Christian values and wishes to promote the
wide promulgation of such values. Since offering SAF funds to
the members of Wide Awake Productions would excessively entangle
the University of Virginia with the propagation of the Christian
religion, we hold that the Rector and Visitors have proved the
existence of a compelling state interest in complying with the
Establishment Clause. This compelling interest justifies the Rector
and Visitors' decision to promulgate guidelines excluding the
membership of Wide Awake Productions from access to SAF monies.
<P>
E
<P>
It remains for us to consider whether the funding guidelines'
proscription against &quot;religious activities&quot; is sufficiently
circumscribed to survive the strictest judicial scrutiny.
<P>
The Supreme Court has held that a government policy is &quot;narrowly
tailored&quot; if it &quot;targets and eliminates no more than
the exact source of the 'evil' it seeks to remedy.&quot; Frisby
v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2503, 101 L.Ed.2d
420 (1988). If *287 the guidelines' &quot;religious activities&quot;
proscription had a substantial deleterious effect on the ability
of student organizations to engage in meaningful religious expression,
the plaintiffs' contention that the proscription is not narrowly
tailored might carry considerable force. Yet it is difficult for
us to conceive how the Rector and Visitors may avoid offending
the Establishment Clause without extending the prohibition on
SAF funding to all &quot;religious activities.&quot; Because the
First Amendment forbids government to promulgate policies &quot;respecting
an establishment of religion,&quot; government is left no choice
but to foreswear financial support of the myriad forms of religious
endeavor in which a student organization might engage. Hence,
we believe that the guidelines' declaration that student organizations
involved in &quot;religious activities&quot; as that phrase is
defined (FN35) is not &quot;substantially broader than necessary&quot;
to achieve the Rector and Visitors' legitimate constitutional
ends, City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 808,
104 S.Ct. 2118, 2130, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984), and thus satisfies
the requirement of narrow tailoring.
<P>
F
<P>
In summary, we conclude that the Rector and Visitors' refusal
to permit funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; places a
presumptively unconstitutional condition upon access to government
benefits in violation of the Free Speech and Press Clause of the
First Amendment. We further conclude, however, that the Rector
and Visitors have shown the existence of a compelling state interest
in (1) foregoing funding awards that would have the primary effect
of advancing religion at the University of Virginia, and (2) preserving
the University of Virginia from an excessive entanglement with
religion. Finally, the Rector and Visitors' restriction against
funding &quot;religious activities&quot; is narrowly tailored
to achieve this compelling state interest. Having survived the
strictest judicial scrutiny, the funding restriction cannot be
labelled constitutionally invalid under the Speech and Press Clause.
<P>
IV
<P>
The district court rejected the plaintiffs' contention that the
guidelines' proscription of funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
violates the Free Speech and Press Clause by excluding them from
the &quot;limited public forum&quot; represented by the SAF. After
careful and reasoned consideration of the governing precedents,
see Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educ. Fund, Inc., 473
U.S. 788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3446, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985); Perry
Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 44,
103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983), the court concluded
that the Rector and Visitors' systematic, purposeful exclusion
of certain student groups from access to SAF funds indicated that
the Rector and Visitors intended the SAF to be a nonpublic forum.
See Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., 795
F.Supp. 175, 178-81 (W.D.Va.1992) (mem.)
<P>
We agree that the Rector and Visitors have not created a limited
public forum by awarding SAF funds only to those student organizations
which, in the view of University authorities, advance the institution's
essentially secular educational mission although we do so for
a different reason. As laid out in part III, supra, we believe
that the proper analysis of this case lies under the line of authority
dealing with content-based discrimination relating to government-generated
benefits or burdens. The long line of public forum cases have
taken &quot;forum&quot; in a fairly literalistic way involving
physical space, and we do not see how it advances the jurisprudence
to wrench that word out of its accepted form to encompass this
type of case already subject to First Amendment scrutiny.
<P>
V
<P>
We finally turn to the plaintiffs' contention that the guidelines'
prohibition against funding of &quot;religious activities&quot;
discriminates against them in contravention of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (1) by denying them benefits
which other CIOs engaged in religious speech and activities have
received, and (2) because the restrictions serve no compelling
state interest, *288. and are not narrowly tailored to satisfy
whatever interest the Rector and Visitors may have in denying
funding to &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
<P>
A
<P>
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides
that no state shall &quot;deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. XIV,
Sec. 1, cl. 4. The plaintiffs contend that the Rector and Visitors
have infringed their rights under the Equal Protection Clause
by awarding SAF monies to the Muslim Students Association, the
Jewish Law Students Association, and the C.S. Lewis Society while
denying funding to Wide Awake Productions.
<P>
To establish an equal protection violation, a plaintiff must show
discriminatory intent as well as disparate effect. See Crawford
v. Board of Educ., 458 U.S. 527, 544, 102 S.Ct. 3211, 3221, 73
L.Ed.2d 948 (1982);
<P>
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252,
265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 563, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); Washington v. Davis,
426 U.S. 229, 239, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976);
Irby v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 889 F.2d 1352, 1355 (4th
Cir.1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 906, 110 S.Ct. 2589, 110 L.Ed.2d
270 (1990). Upon careful review of the summary judgment record,
the district court found no evidence to indicate that the University's
denial of SAF funding to Wide Awake Productions was the product
of discriminatory intent. Because this finding is not contested
by the plaintiffs on appeal, we are constrained to hold that the
district court's factual findings on the point are not tainted
with clear error. Moreover, the plaintiffs' failure to argue the
existence of discriminatory intent as a matter of law on appeal
deprives us of jurisdiction to consider the merits of their equal
protection claim, and compels us to affirm the district court's
decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the Rector and
Visitors.
<P>
B
<P>
For the reasons stated in part III, supra, we already have held
that the Rector and Visitors' refusal to fund &quot;religious
activities&quot; serves the compelling state interest of preserving
the University of Virginia from an excessive entanglement with
religion, and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. We
therefore need not consider this question again for purposes of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The Rector and Visitors' stake in avoiding
an excessive entanglement with religion is equally strong in all
constitutional contexts, including that of the Equal Protection
Clause, if, as we hold, no prima facie violation of the plaintiffs'
equal protection rights exists. This assignment of error therefore
warrants no further discussion.
<P>

<P>
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court
is hereby AFFIRMED.

<P>
FN2. This case involves a challenge to the University's refusal
to fund a student organization engaged in religious expression.
Accordingly, we note that the guidelines offer definitions of
the phrases &quot;religious organization&quot; and &quot;religious
activity.&quot; A &quot;religious organization&quot; is defined
as &quot;an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.&quot; The guidelines
define a &quot;religious activity&quot; as &quot;an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot;

FN4. We note that the editors of Wide Awake would reject our use
of the noun &quot;journal&quot; to describe their publication:
<P>
We ... chose to call our magazine a perspective instead of a journal
or viewpoint. The word perspective embraces the idea of viewing
a situation from a particular angle (in this case a Christian
angle), rather than viewing a situation with a particular conclusion
in mind (as a politically partisan magazine would do). Our perspective
is a starting point, not a finish line.

<P>
FN25. The guidelines draw a distinction between &quot;religious
organizations&quot; and &quot;religious activities.&quot; &quot;Religious
organizations&quot; are student groups whose whole or primary
purpose is to practice devotion to an ultimate reality or deity;
such groups are wholly barred from receiving SAF funds. &quot;Religious
activities,&quot; on the other hand, are forms of conduct or behavior
that cannot, commensurate with the guidelines, be subsidized with
SAF monies. The result of the guidelines' identification of these
two categories, however, is the total proscription of SAF funding
for all forms of religious endeavor by CIOs at the University.
<P>
When the Student Council's Appropriations Committee, and later
the Student Activities Committee, informed Ronald W. Rosenberger
that Wide Awake Productions would not be the recipient of SAF
funds, they referred to the publication of Wide Awake as a &quot;religious
activity.&quot; It has not been suggested that the defendants
rejected the funding request because Wide Awake Productions constitutes
a &quot;religious organization.&quot; Hence we assume with the
parties that the denial of funding rested on a determination that
Wide Awake was &quot;an activity ... primarily promot[ing] or
manifest[ing] a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an
ultimate reality.&quot;
<P>
FN26. The parties wrangle at considerable length over the question
whether Wide Awake Productions ever was &quot;eligible&quot; for
SAF funding at all. The plaintiffs contend that attainment of
CIO status by Wide Awake Productions made the organization &quot;eligible&quot;
to receive SAF monies. The Rector and Visitors argue that Wide
Awake Productions never was &quot;eligible&quot; for funding because
its central purpose--publication of Wide Awake--constituted a
&quot;religious activity.&quot; We need not address the merits
of these opposing positions, because we reject forthwith the Rector
and Visitors' suggestion that they be given unlimited discretion
to determine the &quot;eligibility&quot; of student groups for
SAF funding to the extent such discretion derogates the provisions
of the Bill of Rights. The duty of upholding (and therefore of
not wounding indirectly) the Federal Constitution devolves upon
the Rector and Visitors as a matter of law; as agents of the Commonwealth
of Virginia, the Rector and Visitors are bound to observe the
strictures of the First Amendment, and may not issue regulations
transgressing its bounds. As we note elsewhere herein, once SAF
funds are made available to student groups at the University,
they must be distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner, absent
the showing of a compelling state interest.
<P>
*288_ FN27. We do not address the guidelines' prohibition of SAF
funding for such organizations as fraternities and sororities
or for such activities as social entertainment or philanthropic
contributions. Those excluded categories are not at issue in the
instant case. See supra note 2 and accompanying text.
<P>
FN28. In defense of their position, the Rector and Visitors cite
a number of recent decisions by the Supreme Court; without exception,
none of these cases are relevant to the question before us, and
we find it unnecessary to discuss them at length. For thoroughness'
sake, however, we observe that Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173,
111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), on which the Rector and
Visitors lay great emphasis, did not involve the erection of a
prior restraint on abortion counseling by recipients of family
planning funds under Title X of the Public Health Service Act,
42 U.S.C. Secs. 300 to 330a-6a. In Rust, regulations issued by
the Secretary of Health and Human Services simply limited the
ability of Title X fund recipients to engage in abortion-related
expressive activities. Id. at 176-77, 111 S.Ct. at 1764. Although,
like the SAF funding restrictions at issue here, the regulations
broadly prohibited Title X projects from engaging in activities
that &quot;encourage[d], promote[d] or advocate[d] abortion as
a method of family planning,&quot; id. at 180, 111 S.Ct. at 1765,
there was no question that the recipients were recipients--that
is, that they already had received Title X funding. In his opinion
for the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist emphasized this distinction:
<P>
Petitioners' reliance on [the Court's &quot;unconstitutional conditions&quot;
cases] is unavailing ... because here the government is not denying
a benefit to anyone, but is instead simply insisting that public
funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized.
<P>
Id. at 196, 111 S.Ct. at 1774. Thus, the issue in Rust was not--as
here--whether the recipients could obtain access to government
benefits. It was, instead, whether the government could be allowed
to dictate the use to which already-allocated funds could be dedicated.

FN30. As we are well-aware, the Supreme Court's applications of
Lemon have been characterized by fine distinctions, and have aroused
considerable controversy among the Justices themselves, even to
the point of frequent suggestion in nonmajority opinions that
Lemon be abandoned. We note, for example, Justice Scalia's recent
denunciation of Lemon:
<P>
Like some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits
up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed
and buried, Lemon stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudence
once again, frightening the little children....

As Justice Powell has stated, the three-pronged Lemon test ...
is the only coherent [Establishment Clause] test a majority of
the Court has ever adopted.... Lemon has never been overruled
or its test modified.

Clause question presented here, therefore, we are bound to consider
Lemon governing precedent.
<P>
*288_ FN31. We reject the plaintiffs' contention that the Supreme
Court's decision in Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1,
109 S.Ct. 890, 103 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (plurality opinion), controls
our analysis of the Establishment Clause issue presented by this
case, and obviates the need to examine the guidelines' restrictions
in light of Lemon v. Kurtzman. Texas Monthly involved a state
sales tax exemption for &quot;[p]eriodicals that are published
or distributed by a religious faith and that consist wholly of
writings sacred to a religious faith.&quot; Texas Monthly, 489
U.S. at 5, 109 S.Ct. at 894. The Court held that the exemption
was insufficiently broad--that is, that it did not reach an adequately
wide class of publications--to pass Establishment Clause scrutiny.
<P>
If Texas Monthly has application in the instant case, it is only
as an extra pillar for our initial, but not dispositive, holding
that the SAF guidelines' &quot;religious activit[y]&quot; prohibition
has erected a presumptively unconstitutional prior restraint on
the receipt of a government benefit. In his opinion for a three-Justice
plurality, Justice Brennan stated:
<P>
[W]hen government directs a subsidy exclusively to religious organizations
that is not required by the Free Exercise Clause and that either
burdens nonbeneficiaries markedly or cannot reasonably be seen
as removing a significant state-imposed deterrent to free exercise
of religion ..., it &quot;provide[s] unjustifiable awards of assistance
to religious organizations&quot; and cannot but &quot;conve[y]
a message of endorsement&quot; to slighted members of the community.
This is particularly clear where, as here, the subsidy is targeted
at writings that promulgate the teachings of religious faiths.
<P>
Id. at 15, 109 S.Ct. at 899 (quoting Corporation of Presiding
Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,
483 U.S. 327, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 2874-75, 97 L.Ed.2d 273 (1987)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)). As we explain below,
an award of SAF funds to defray publication costs of Wide Awake
would &quot;convey a message of endorsement&quot; of Christianity
to non-Christian members of the University of Virginia community.
&quot;This is particularly clear,&quot; id., because, as we observe,
such a subsidy would be targeted at a publication whose purpose
is &quot;to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ means,&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at
2--a goal plainly contemplating the &quot;promulgat[ion]&quot;
of Christian teachings.
<P>
That Texas Monthly supports one wing of our analysis does not,
however, release us from the obligation of testing the Rector
and Visitors' asserted state interest in complying with the Establishment
Clause. Indeed, Justice Brennan's opinion addressed Texas's Establishment
Clause defense of its sales tax exemption by holding that the
exemption lacked sufficient breadth to pass scrutiny under Lemon.
See Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 8-17, 109 S.Ct. at 895-901. Because
this case involves a direct governmental subsidy of religious
expression rather than a mere exemption from the payment of duties,
it is not directly on point with Texas Monthly.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
<P>
MICHAEL, District Judge.
<P>
In this case, the court is asked to resolve the difficult question
of whether a &quot;student activities fund,&quot; comprised of
mandatory student fees, constitutes a limited public forum. For
the reasons set forth below, *177 the court concludes that the
answer to this riddle is &quot;no.&quot;
<P>
I.
<P>
In September of 1990, plaintiff Ronald W. Rosenberger, an undergraduate
student at the University of Virginia (the University), joined
with other University students to form Wide Awake Productions
(WAP). WAP is an unincorporated association officially recognized
by the University as a Contracted Independent Organization (CIO).
This recognition is given to all student organizations which execute
an annual agreement with the University and meet certain minimal
requirements. (FN1) The benefit of becoming a CIO is that such
organizations are given access to University facilities; i.e.
meeting rooms, computer terminals, etc.
<P>
WAP publishes Wide Awake Magazine (Wide Awake), a non-profit journal
written, edited and published by the student members of WAP. Mr.
Rosenberger serves as the magazine's publisher, while other named
plaintiffs include members of the management and editorial staff.
To date, three issues of Wide Awake have been published, with
approximately 5,000 copies of each issue distributed free of charge
to students on the University campus.
<P>
In January of 1991, WAP submitted an application for funding from
the University in the amount of $5,862.00 to offset the cost of
publishing its magazine. Specifically, WAP sought funding from
monies deposited in the University's Student Activities Fund (SAF).
The SAF is funded by a mandatory student activities fee collected
from every full-time student at the University. The activity fee
is designed to provide financial support for student organizations
related to the educational purposes of the University.
<P>
The defendants in this action, the Rector and Board of Visitors
of the University (the Board) (FN2) have ultimate responsibility
for the operation of the SAF. The Board has delegated the responsibility
of allocating SAF funds to the University's Student Council. The
Student Council disburses SAF funds to those CIOs deemed eligible
for funding as determined by Guidelines issued by the Board. These
Guidelines prohibit several categories of student organizations
from obtaining SAF funds. Ineligible groups include fraternities
and sororities, political and religious organizations, and those
groups whose membership is exclusionary in nature. Further, the
following expenditures and activities are also excluded by the
Guidelines: (1) honoraria or similar fees;
<P>
(2) religious activities; (3) social entertainment or related
expenses; (4) philanthropic contributions and activities; and
(5) political activities.
<P>
A CIO seeking SAF monies must first submit a request for funding
to the Student Council Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee
of the full Student Council. As noted earlier, WAP made its first
and only request for funding in January of 1991. The Chairman
of the Student Council denied the funding request because the
Appropriations Committee determined that publication of Wide Awake
constituted a &quot;religious activity.&quot; (FN3) WAP appealed
this decision to the full Student Council, which affirmed the
appropriation Committee's denial of funding. WAP pursued all internal
means of appeal before filing suit in this court on July 11, 1991.
The plaintiffs allege that the denial of SAF benefits violates
*178 their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom
of association, free exercise of religion, and equal protection
of the laws in violation of the United States Constitution, the
Virginia Constitution, and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom.
Plaintiffs have also set forth a cause of action pursuant to 42
U.S.C. Section 1983.
<P>
On November 12, 1991, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary
judgment, asking this court for a declaratory judgment that the
defendants had indeed violated the plaintiff's constitutional
rights. The defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment
and both sides appeared before this court for oral argument on
these motions. Both sides agree, with minor exceptions addressed
herein, that there are no genuine issues of material fact in conflict.
Thus, this matter is ripe for disposition. (FN4)
<P>
II. The Freedom of Speech Claims
<P>
The preliminary question for this court to resolve is whether
the University's SAF qualifies as a &quot;limited public forum&quot;
as the plaintiffs assert, or whether the SAF is in fact a &quot;non-public&quot;
forum, as the defendants argue. This determination is crucial
as it dictates the degree of scrutiny to be used by this court
in reviewing the Board of Visitor Guidelines. (FN5) See Perry
Educ. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 44,
103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (&quot;The existence
of a right of access to public property and the standard by which
limitations upon such a right must be evaluated differ depending
on the character of the property at issue.&quot;) See also Cornelius
v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U.S.
788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3446, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985) (&quot;the
extent to which the Government may limit access [to a forum] depends
on whether the forum is public or nonpublic.&quot;)
<P>
The phrase &quot;limited public forum&quot; describes one of three
categories of fora identified by the Supreme Court in Perry, supra.
(FN6) A limited public forum is property &quot;which the State
has opened for use by the public even if it was not required to
create the forum in the first place.&quot; Perry, 460 U.S. at
45, 103 S.Ct. at 955 citing Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102
S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). A state may only restrict access
to limited public fora if such a restriction is narrowly drawn
to effectuate a compelling state interest.
<P>
Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955. A different category
of property consists of public property which is not &quot;by
tradition or designation a forum for public communication.&quot;
Id. Not surprisingly, this type of property is labeled &quot;nonpublic.&quot;
Access to such a forum can be limited by restrictions which are
&quot; 'reasonable and [are] not an effort to suppress expression
merely because the public officials oppose the speaker's view.'
&quot; Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 800, 105 S.Ct. at 3448 quoting Perry,
460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955.
<P>
It should be apparent from the preceding discussion that the label
affixed to the University's SAF (either limited public forum or
nonpublic forum) will have a rather profound impact on whether
the Board's Guidelines will be upheld by this court. The plaintiffs
rely heavily on Gay and Lesbian Students Assn. v. Gohn, 850 F.2d
361 (8th Cir.1988) for the proposition that &quot;compulsory student
activities fees&quot; constitute a limited public forum. In Gohn,
the Gay and Lesbian Students Association (GLSA) at the University
of Arkansas at Fayetteville challenged the decision of the Student
Senate denying funding to the *179 group. The money was to be
paid out of funds from &quot;tuition, state tax money, and general
fees collected from students.&quot; Id. at 361. In finding that
the denial of funding violated GLSA's First Amendment rights,
the court stated:
<P>
we hold that a public body that chooses to fund speech or expression
must do so even-handedly, without discriminating among recipients
on the basis of their ideology. The University need not supply
funds to student organizations; but once having decided to do
so, it is bound by the First Amendment to act without regard to
the content of the ideas being expressed.
<P>
Id. at 362.
<P>
This court does not read Gohn at holding that a student activities
fund is a limited public forum. Gohn merely stands for the proposition
that  content-based discrimination can be justified only if the
government demonstrates that its regulation is narrowly drawn
and is necessary to effectuate compelling state interests.&quot;
Id. at 367 citing Widmar, 454 U.S. at 270, 102 S.Ct. at 274. The
plaintiffs read this citation to Widmar and the mention of a &quot;compelling
state interest&quot; as a signal that the Eighth Circuit considered
the student activity fee as creating a limited public forum, thus
requiring the use of a heightened level of scrutiny. This reading
of Gohn stretches the Eighth Circuit's opinion beyond the breaking
point.
<P>
The mere mention of heightened scrutiny does not in and of itself
indicate that the court is dealing with either a traditional or
a limited public forum.
<P>
Heightened scrutiny can also be applied even if the forum is characterized
as nonpublic. The Supreme Court recognized this in Perry by stating:
<P>
Public property which is not by tradition or designation a forum
for public communication is governed by different standards. We
have recognized that the 'First Amendment does not guarantee access
to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.'
In addition to time, place, and manner regulations, the State
may reserve the forum for its intended purposes, communicative
or otherwise, as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable
and not an effort to suppress expression merely because the public
officials oppose the speaker's view.
<P>
460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955 (citations omitted).
<P>
This passage from Perry indicates that viewpoint discrimination
will rarely be tolerated, regardless of whether the restriction
applies to public, limited or nonpublic fora. Further, a careful
reading of Gohn indicates that the Eighth Circuit considered the
student service funds as creating a nonpublic forum. Specifically,
the court noted that:
<P>
We realize that the District Court made no explicit finding as
to the reason for denial of funding, that this is a question of
fact, and that appellate courts are not fact-finding forums. We
think, though, that the District Court's opinion, when read in
full and in context, includes an implicit finding that funds were
denied because of distaste for the GLSA's ideas. Otherwise, there
would have been no need to resort to the legal doctrines (e.g.
that there is no &quot;right&quot; to public money) used by the
Court to justify dismissing the complaint. A finding of fact that
funds were denied for some content-neutral reason would have sufficed
completely to dispose of the case. In any event, the facts of
this case are so obvious that a remand for an explicit finding
would be a waste of time. This record leaves no reasonable doubt
that funds were denied because of disagreement with GLSA's speech.
(emphasis added).
<P>
Gohn, 850 F.2d at 367. Here, the court indicates that GLSA would
have lost its case had the University of Arkansas put forth a
content neutral reason for denying funding. This is not the standard
used in limited public forum cases, but instead is the standard
used in nonpublic forum situations.
<P>
This court also looks to Cornelius, supra for guidance as to whether
the SAF qualifies as a public forum. Here, the Supreme Court began
its forum analysis by *180 noting that, &quot;[t]he government
does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited
discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional
forum for public discourse.&quot; Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802,
105 S.Ct. at 3449 citing Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955.
(emphasis added). In Cornelius, the Supreme Court held that the
Federal Government could exclude legal defense and political advocacy
organizations from participation in the Combined Federal Campaign
(CFC), a charity drive directed at federal employees. The Court
held that the campaign was a nonpublic forum because:
<P>
[t]he Government's consistent policy has been to limit participation
in the CFC to &quot;appropriate&quot; voluntary agencies and to
require agencies seeking admission to obtain permission from federal
and local Campaign officials ... The Civil Service Commission
and, after 1978, the Office of Personnel Management developed
extensive criteria to limit access to the Campaign to those organization
considered appropriate. Such selective access, unsupported by
evidence of a purposeful designation for public use, does not
create a public forum.
<P>
Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 804-5, 105 S.Ct. at 3450 (citations omitted).
<P>
In the present situation, the University has limited eligibility
for SAF monies to those organizations deemed &quot;appropriate.&quot;
Religious organizations are but one of several groups excluded
from participation in the SAF because the Board of Visitors has
decided that such groups do not further the educational purposes
of the University. This exclusion of religious groups and religious
activities has been in effect since the establishment of the Guidelines
in 1970, and has survived revisions in 1973, 1978, 1980 and 1991.

<P>
The plaintiffs attempt to counter this fact by arguing that &quot;the
defendants created the SAF mechanism to encourage the exchange
of opinions and viewpoints among students at the University of
Virginia in furtherance of the educational mission of the University.&quot;
In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs direct the court
to the page 1 of the Guidelines. The Guidelines, in pertinent
part, read as follows:
<P>
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
<P>
The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial
support for student organizations that are related to the educational
purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee,
the monies collected by the University for funding student activities
are public funds which must be administered in a manner consistent
with the educational purpose of the University as well as with
state and federal law.
<P>
This court does not read this passage to indicate a desire on
the part of the Board of Visitors to &quot;encourage the exchange
of opinions and viewpoints.&quot; Rather, the Guidelines suggest
that the SAF was established to fund only those CIOs whose activities
contributed to the educational focus of the University. The Board
of Visitors has not opened the SAF coffers to all CIOs; (FN7)
some groups, such as WAP, were excluded simply because the Board
of Visitors determined that their activities were not consistent
with the goals of the University. The consistent, purposeful exclusion
of certain groups indicates that the SAF is indeed a nonpublic
forum.
<P>
This conclusion is further supported by the Supreme Court's reasoning
in Perry, supra. The forum in Perry consisted of an interschool
mailing system used to facilitate communication between various
teachers. A teacher's union challenged the local Board of Education's
decision denying the union access to the system. The plaintiff
union argued that the school mail facilities became a limited
public forum because other private, non-school-connected groups
had previously been given access to the system. Perry, 460 U.S.
at 47, 103 S.Ct.
<P>
at 956. In rejecting this contention, the Court stated:
<P>
The use of the internal school mail by groups not affiliated with
the schools is no doubt a relevant consideration. If by policy
or by practice the Perry School *181 District has opened its mail
system for indiscriminate use by the general public, then PLEA
could justifiably argue a public forum has been created. This,
however, is not the case. As the case comes before us, there is
no indication in the record that the school mailboxes and interschool
delivery system are open for use by the general public. Permission
to use the system to communicate with teachers must be secured
from the individual building principal. There is no court finding
or evidence in the record which demonstrates that this permission
has been granted as a matter of course to all who seek to distribute
material. We can only conclude that the schools do allow some
outside organizations such as the YMCA, Cub Scouts, and other
civic and church organizations to use the facilities. This type
of selective access does not transform government property into
a public forum.
<P>
Id.
<P>
Similarly, the fact that the University has given certain CIOs
access to SAF funds does not lead to the conclusion that such
selective access transforms the SAF into a limited public forum.
<P>
Finally, the plaintiffs reliance on Widmar is misplaced. The present
case might very well be resolved in plaintiffs favor if the University
had denied CIO status to WAP. The defendants themselves take the
position that access to certification as a CIO is a limited public
forum. This is because only CIO's have access to University facilities.
(FN8) This is a far cry from the present situation and is the
reason why this court finds Widmar factually distinguishable from
the case at hand.
<P>
Having concluded that the SAF is a nonpublic forum, this court
must now determine whether the Board's Guidelines constitute restrictions
which are &quot;reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression
merely because public officials oppose the speaker' views.&quot;
Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955. The defendants offer
two basic rationales for excluding religious organizations such
as WAP from SAF eligibility. First, the University has only limited
funds to disburse and must therefore limit funding to those activities
which it determines advance its educational mission. Second, the
ineligibility of religious organizations and activities is justified
based on the Federal and State constitutional mandate of state
neutrality toward religion.
<P>
Although fiscal restraints are pertinent, this court may resolve
the reasonableness of the Guidelines by reference to the University's
second proffered reason. The parties devote considerable time
in their respective briefs addressing the obvious Establishment
Clause issues raised in this case. However, this court need not
resolve this issue on the facts of this case. For even if the
plaintiffs were correct in their assertion that funding Wide Awake
would not violate Federal or State law, it is not the province
of this court to second guess the legal judgments made by the
University. So long as the University's Establishment Clause fears
are reasonable, the Guideline restriction must stand. Given the
complexity of the law in this regard, this court has little trouble
in finding that the Guideline restriction is a reasonable limit
to access to SAF funds. Further, the restriction is a reasonable
response by the University to prevent excessive entanglement with
religion.
<P>
The court also finds that the Guideline limitations do not result
in viewpoint discrimination against religious organizations such
as WAP. The plaintiffs seem to argue that any across the board
restriction applied to a religious group results in content based
discrimination. This may be *182 true in the abstract, but this
court, and the University, must live in the real world. It could
be argued that every decision by the University results in viewpoint
discrimination. On this point, the court finds Justice Stevens'
comments in his concurring opinion in Widmar to be highly relevant.
Justice Stevens states that:
<P>
In performing their learning and teaching missions, the managers
of a university routinely make countless decisions based on the
content of communicative materials. They select books for inclusion
in the library, they hire professors on the basis of their academic
philosophies, they select courses for inclusion in the curriculum,
and they reward scholars for what they have written. In addition,
in encouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities,
they necessarily make decisions concerning the content of those
activities.
<P>
Widmar, 454 U.S. at 278, 102 S.Ct. at 278.
<P>
In brief, the plaintiffs' complaints about the Guidelines are
more properly directed at the wisdom and not the legality of the
restrictions. This is because the court finds, as a matter of
law, that the Board's Guidelines are reasonable and do not violate
any of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. (FN9)
<P>
III. The Free Exercise of Religion Claims
<P>
The heart of the plaintiffs' claim is that without SAF monies
WAP must devote more time to fund raising and less time to publishing
its religious speech. Thus, the denial of funding burdens the
plaintiffs' free exercise of religion by diverting energy away
from WAP's main goal: challenging Christians to live according
to their faith.
<P>
Both sides agree that this court's analysis should begin with
Dole v. Shenandoah Baptist Church, 899 F.2d 1389 (4th Cir.) cert.
denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 131, 112 L.Ed.2d 99 (1990). Here,
the Fourth Circuit stated that in reviewing a free exercise claim,
a court should:
<P>
... examine the burden on the exercise of ... [plaintiff's] sincerely
held religious beliefs, then determine whether the state presents
a compelling justification for imposing this burden, and finally
balancing the burden on free exercise against the state's ...
[compelling interest].
<P>
Id. at 1397.
<P>
In the present case, it is difficult for this court to identify
any burden of constitutional magnitude that has been imposed on
the plaintiffs. It is logical to assume that publishing a magazine
is easier if someone else pays the bills. However, if this incidental
burden was of constitutional significance, the free exercise clause
would be implicated in every funding decision involving a religious
organization. A review of the record indicates that WAP is unable
to point to any facts making their burden unique from other CIOs
which have been denied SAF monies. Political groups and fraternities
and sororities share a common plight with WAP: none of these groups
is eligible for funding. The only distinguishing factor is that
WAP engages in religious activity. However, WAP has not cited
this court to any authority indicating that religious organizations
should receive preferential access to a nonpublic forum.
<P>
The plaintiffs' attempt to bridge this gap in their argument by
asserting that &quot;freedom of expression may not be infringed
by denying a privilege.&quot;
<P>
WAP relies on Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404, 83 S.Ct.
1790, 1794, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) to support this position. This
court does not read Sherbert as broadly as do the plaintiffs.
In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources v. Smith, 494 U.S.
872, 883, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1602, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), the Court
stated that, &quot;[u]nder the Sherbert test, governmental actions
that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified
by a compelling governmental interest.&quot; (emphasis added).
This language *183 itself indicates that a burden must be substantial
before the court will consider whether the state has a compelling
reason for the restriction. (FN10) The Fourth Circuit appears
to have adopted this position in Goodall v. Stafford County School
Board, 930 F.2d 363 (4th Cir.) cert. denied --- U.S. ----, 112
S.Ct. 188, 116 L.Ed.2d 149 (1991). Here the court stated that
[w]here the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon
conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such
a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby
putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior
and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists. While
the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise
is nonetheless substantial.
<P>
Goodall, 930 F.2d at 369 quoting Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana
Employment Security Division, 450 U.S. 707, 717-18, 101 S.Ct.
1425, 1432, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). (FN11)
<P>
Even if this court were to consider the Board's Guidelines as
imposing a burden on WAP's free exercise of religion, WAP is still
bound by the Fourth Circuit's holding in Goodall, supra, that
avoidance of a violation of the Establishment Clause constitutes
a compelling state interest. Goodall, 930 F.2d at 370. Further,
balancing the minimal burden on the plaintiffs with the defendants
rationale for the Guidelines indicates that the scale must come
down in favor of the defendants.
<P>
IV. The Equal Protection Claims
<P>
The last issue for the court to resolve in the plaintiffs' claims
that the Guidelines have been applied in less than an even-handed
manner. Put somewhat differently, the plaintiffs contend that
they have been denied equal protection of the laws because other
&quot;religious groups&quot; have been given SAF monies. As evidence
of this unequal treatment, WAP focuses on the funding decisions
make with respect to other CIOs.
<P>
The defendants seek to counter this argument by citing this court
to Irby v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 889 F.2d 1352 (4th
Cir.1989), cert. denied 496 U.S. 906, 110 S.Ct. 2589, 110 L.Ed.2d
270 (1990). Irby stands for the proposition that a plaintiff challenging
a facially neutral statute with an equal protection claim must
show not only disparate effect, but also discriminatory intent.
Thus, the defendants do not argue that the Student Council's funding
decisions are always correct. Instead, the defendants argue that
there is no evidence to suggest that the Student Council's decision
to deny funding to WAP resulted from discriminatory intent.
<P>
In their reply brief, the plaintiffs do not dispute the defendants
statement of the law nor the facts on this issue. The court has
reviewed the entire record independently, and cannot find any
evidence to indicate that the decision to deny funding to WAP
was based on discriminatory intent. Accordingly, summary judgment
in favor of the defendants is appropriate.
<P>
In summary, the court holds that access to the SAF is a nonpublic
forum upon which the University has imposed reasonable restrictions.
These restrictions do not impose an impermissible burden on the
plaintiffs' exercise of their rights as guaranteed by either the
Federal or State Constitutions, or the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom. Thus, the court denies the plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment and grants the defendants' cross motion for summary judgment.
An appropriate order shall this day issue.
<P>
ORDER
<P>
For the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum opinion,
it is hereby *184.
<P>
ADJUDGED AND ORDERED
<P>
that:
<P>
1. The plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is denied;
<P>
2. The defendants' cross motion for summary judgment is granted.
<P>
This case shall be dismissed and stricken from the docket of the
court. The Clerk of the Court is hereby directed to send a certified
copy of this Order to all counsel of record.
<P>
FN1. There are four general criteria for CIO status: (1) at least
fifty-one percent of the group's members must be students; (2)
the group's officers must all be full-time, fee-paying students;
(3) the group must keep an updated copy of its constitution on
file with the University; and (4) the group must sign an anti-discrimination
disclaimer.
<P>
FN2. The individual Board members and Mr. Robert Stump, Associate
Dean of Students, are named defendants and are being sued in their
official capacities.
<P>
FN3. Mr. Rosenberger admits that Wide Awake is written from a
&quot;religious perspective.&quot; Further, Article 1 of WAP's
constitution states that the purpose of the organization is to:
(1) publish a magazine of philosophical and religious expressions;
(2) facilitate discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity
to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints; and (3) provide a unifying
focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds.
<P>
FN4. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs'
claim for damages under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 on the grounds that
such a claim is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment to the United
States Constitution. The court need not address this issue as
it has determined that all of the plaintiffs' claims must fail,
as a matter of law.
<P>
FN5. The plaintiffs have launched a general assault on the propriety
of certain exclusions in the Guidelines; i.e. those prohibiting
the funding of religious organizations and activities. Alternatively,
the plaintiffs set forth an equal protection claim by arguing
that the Guidelines have not been applied in an even-handed manner.
The court will address the equal protection issue in part IV of
this opinion.
<P>
FN6. The plaintiffs do not argue that the SAF is a traditional
public forum.
<P>
FN7. For the academic year 1990-91, 343 student organizations
qualified as CIOs. Of these 135 applied for SAF funds and 118
were actually allotted SAF monies.
<P>
FN8. The plaintiffs allege that they have been denied access to
certain University facilities yet have presented no evidence,
beyond Mr. Rosenberger's affidavit, to support of this claim.
For instance, there is no assertion that WAP has even attempted
to use University facilities or computers. The defendants have
submitted the affidavit of Mr. Stump, who swears that &quot;[a]s
a CIO, Wide Awake has been and is accorded the same access and
use of University facilities as other CIOs.&quot; The court has
considered this conflicting evidence in the light most favorable
to the plaintiffs, but comes to the conclusion that WAP has not
raised a genuine issue of material fact as to this issue.
<P>
FN9. In their briefs and in oral argument, the parties did not
separately address plaintiffs' claims under Federal and State
law. Although the court has focused on Federal Constitutional
law, the preceding analysis applies to the plaintiffs' claims
based on the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom.
<P>
FN10. The court notes that the plaintiffs have not identified
a religious practice which is infringed by the Board's Guidelines.
Apparently the plaintiffs contend that publishing a religious
magazine is itself a religious practice.
<P>
FN11. The court also notes that with few exceptions, Sherbert
has been limited to those cases involving the denial of unemployment
compensation benefits. See Smith, supra, 494 U.S. at 883, 110
S.Ct. at 1602.

Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated
association of individuals elected from various veterans groups,
was authorized by the city of Boston to organize and conduct the
St. Patrick's Day-Evacuation Day Parade. The Council refused a
place in the 1993 event to respondent GLIB, an organization formed
for the purpose of marching in the parade in order to express
its members' pride in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian,
and bisexual individuals, to show that there are such individuals
in the community, and to support the like men and women who sought
to march in the New York St. Patrick's Day parade. GLIB and some
of its members filed this suit in state court, alleging that the
denial of their application to march violated, inter alia, a state
law prohibiting discrimination on account of sexual orientation
in places of public accommodation. In finding such a violation
and ordering the Council to include GLIB in the parade, the trial
court, among other things, concluded that the parade had no common
theme other than the involvement of the participants, and that,
given the Council's lack of selectivity in choosing parade participants
and its failure to circumscribe the marchers' messages, the parade
lacked any expressive purpose, such that GLIB's inclusion therein
would not violate the Council's First Amendment rights. The Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed.
<P>
Held: The state courts' application of the Massachusetts public
accommodations law to require private citizens who organize a
parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message
that the organizers do not wish to convey violates the First Amendment.
Pp. 2343-2351.
<P>
(a) Confronted with the state courts' conclusion that the factual
characteristics of petitioners' activity place it within the realm
of non-expressive conduct, this Court has a constitutional duty
to conduct an independent examination of the record as a whole,
without deference to those courts, to assure that *2340 their
judgment does not constitute a forbidden
<P>
intrusion on the field of free expression. See, e.g., New York
Times Co. v.
<P>
Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 285, 84 S.Ct. 710, 729, 11 L.Ed.2d 686.
Pp.
<P>
2343-2345.
<P>
(b) The selection of contingents to make a parade is entitled
to First Amendment protection. Parades such as petitioners' are
a form of protected expression because they include marchers who
are making some sort of collective point, not just to each other
but to bystanders along the way. Cf., e.g., Gregory v. Chicago,
394 U.S. 111, 112, 89 S.Ct. 946, 946, 22 L.Ed.2d 134. Moreover,
such protection is not limited to a parade's banners and songs,
but extends to symbolic acts. See, e.g., West Virginia Bd. of
Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 632, 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1182,
1187, 87 L.Ed. 1628. Although the Council has been rather lenient
in admitting participants to its parade, a private speaker does
not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious
voices, by failing to edit their themes to isolate a specific
message as the exclusive subject matter of the speech, or by failing
to generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the
communication. Thus, petitioners are entitled to protection under
the First Amendment. GLIB's participation as a unit in the parade
was equally expressive, since the organization was formed to celebrate
its members' sexual identities and for related purposes. Pp. 2345-2346.
<P>
(c) The Massachusetts law does not, as a general matter, violate
the First or Fourteenth Amendments. Its provisions are well within
a legislature's power to enact when it has reason to believe that
a given group is being discriminated against. And the statute
does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate on the basis
of its content. Pp. 2346-2347.
<P>
(d) The state court's application, however, had the effect of
declaring the sponsors' speech itself to be the public accommodation.
Since every participating parade unit affects the message conveyed
by the private organizers, the state courts' peculiar application
of the Massachusetts law essentially forced the Council to alter
the parade's expressive content and thereby violated the fundamental
First Amendment rule that a speaker has the autonomy to choose
the content of his own message and, conversely, to decide what
not to say. Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle
is sound, since the Council selects the expressive units of the
parade from potential participants and clearly decided to exclude
a message it did not like from the communication it chose to make,
and that is enough to invoke its right as a private speaker to
shape its expression by speaking on one subject while remaining
silent on another, free from state interference. The constitutional
violation is not saved by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
FCC, 512 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497. The Council
is a speaker in its own right; a parade does not consist of individual,
unrelated segments that happen to be transmitted together for
individual selection by members of the audience; and there is
no assertion here that some speakers will be destroyed in the
absence of the Massachusetts law. Nor has any other legitimate
interest been identified in support of applying that law in the
way done by the state courts to expressive activity like the parade.

<P>
March 17 is set aside for two celebrations in South Boston. As
early as 1737, some people in Boston observed the feast of the
apostle to Ireland, and since 1776 the day has marked the evacuation
of royal troops and Loyalists from the city, prompted by the guns
captured at Ticonderoga and set up on Dorchester Heights under
General Washington's command. Washington himself reportedly drew
on the earlier tradition in choosing &quot;St. Patrick&quot; as
the response to &quot;Boston,&quot; the password used in the colonial
lines on evacuation day. See J. Crimmins, St. Patrick's Day: Its
Celebration in New York and other American Places, 1737-1845,
pp. 15, 19 (1902); see generally 1 H.S. Commager &amp; R. Morris,
The Spirit of 'Seventy Six 138-183 (1958); The American Book of
Days 262-265 (J. Hatch ed., 3d ed. 1978). Although the General
Court of Massachusetts did not officially designate March 17 as
Evacuation Day until 1938, see Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 6:12K (1992),
the City Council of Boston had previously sponsored public celebrations
of Evacuation Day, including notable commemorations on the centennial
in 1876, and on the 125th anniversary in 1901, with its parade,
salute, concert, and fireworks display. See Celebration of the
Centennial Anniversary of the Evacuation of Boston by the British
Army (G. Ellis ed. 1876); Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Group of Boston v. City of Boston et al., Civ.Action No. 92-1516
(Super.Ct., Mass., Dec. 15, 1993), reprinted in App. to Pet. for
Cert. B1, B8-B9.
<P>
The tradition of formal sponsorship by the city came to an end
in 1947, however, when Mayor James Michael Curley himself granted
authority to organize and conduct the St. Patrick's Day-Evacuation
Day Parade to the petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans
Council, an unincorporated association of individuals elected
from various South Boston veterans groups. Every year since that
time, the Council has applied for and received a permit for the
parade, which at times has included as many as 20,000 marchers
and drawn up to 1 million watchers. No other applicant has ever
applied for that permit. Id., at B9. Through 1992, the city allowed
the Council to use the city's official seal, and provided printing
services as well as direct funding.
<P>
1992 was the year that a number of gay, lesbian, and bisexual
descendants of the Irish immigrants joined together with other
supporters to form the respondent organization, GLIB, to march
in the parade as a way to express pride in their Irish heritage
as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to demonstrate
that there are such men and women among those so descended, and
to express their solidarity with like individuals who sought to
march in New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Id., at B3; App.
51. Although the Council denied GLIB's application to take part
in the 1992 parade, GLIB obtained a state-court order to include
its contingent, which marched &quot;uneventfully&quot; among that
year's 10,000 participants and 750,000 spectators. App. to Pet.
for Cert. B3, and n. 4.
<P>
In 1993, after the Council had again refused to admit GLIB to
the upcoming parade, the organization and some of its members
filed this suit against the Council, the individual petitioner
John J. &quot;Wacko&quot; Hurley, and the City of Boston, alleging
violations of the State and Federal Constitutions and of the state
public accommodations law, which prohibits &quot;any distinction,
discrimination or restriction on account of ... sexual orientation
... relative to the admission of any person to, or treatment in
any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement.&quot;
Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:98. After finding that &quot;[f]or at least
the past 47 years, the Parade has traveled the same basic route
along the public streets of South Boston, providing entertainment,
amusement, and recreation to participants and spectators alike,&quot;
App. to Pet. for Cert. B5-B6, the state trial court ruled that
the parade fell within the statutory definition of a public accommodation,
which includes &quot;any place ... which is open to and accepts
or solicits the patronage of the general public and, without limiting
*2342 the generality of this definition, whether or not it be
... (6) a boardwalk or other public highway [or] ... (8) a place
of public amusement, recreation, sport, exercise or entertainment,&quot;
Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:92A. The court found that the Council had
no written criteria and employed no particular procedures for
admission, voted on new applications in batches, had occasionally
admitted groups who simply showed up at the parade without having
submitted an application, and did &quot;not generally inquire
into the specific messages or views of each applicant.&quot; App.
to Pet. for Cert. B8-B9. The court consequently rejected the Council's
contention that the parade was &quot;private&quot; (in the sense
of being exclusive), holding instead that &quot;the lack of genuine
selectivity in choosing participants and sponsors demonstrates
that the Parade is a public event.&quot; Id., at B6. It found
the parade to be &quot;eclectic,&quot; containing a wide variety
of &quot;patriotic, commercial, political, moral, artistic, religious,
athletic, public service, trade union, and eleemosynary themes,&quot;
as well as conflicting messages. Id., at B24. While noting that
the Council had indeed excluded the Ku Klux Klan and ROAR (an
antibusing group), id., at B7, it attributed little significance
to these facts, concluding ultimately that &quot;[t]he only common
theme among the participants and sponsors is their public involvement
in the Parade,&quot; id., at B24.
<P>
The court rejected the Council's assertion that the exclusion
of &quot;groups with sexual themes merely formalized [the fact]
that the Parade expresses traditional religious and social values,&quot;
id., at B3, and found the Council's &quot;final position [to be]
that GLIB would be excluded because of its values and its message,
i.e., its members' sexual orientation,&quot; id., at B4, n. 5,
citing Tr. of Closing Arg. 43, 51-52 (Nov. 23, 1993). This position,
in the court's view, was not only violative of the public accommodations
law but &quot;paradoxical&quot; as well, since &quot;a proper
celebration of St. Patrick's and Evacuation Day requires diversity
and inclusiveness.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. B24. The court
rejected the notion that GLIB's admission would trample on the
Council's First Amendment rights since the court understood that
constitutional protection of any interest in expressive association
would &quot;requir[e] focus on a specific message, theme, or group&quot;
absent from the parade. Ibid. &quot;Given the [Council's] lack
of selectivity in choosing participants and failure to circumscribe
the marchers' message,&quot; the court found it &quot;impossible
to discern any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade
to protection under the First Amendment.&quot; Id., at B25. It
concluded that the parade is &quot;not an exercise of [the Council's]
constitutionally protected right of expressive association,&quot;
but instead &quot;an open recreational event that is subject to
the public accommodations law.&quot; Id., at B27.
<P>
The court held that because the statute did not mandate inclusion
of GLIB but only prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation,
any infringement on the Council's right to expressive association
was only &quot;incidental&quot; and &quot;no greater than necessary
to accomplish the statute's legitimate purpose&quot; of eradicating
discrimination. Id., at B25, citing Roberts v. United States Jaycees,
468 U.S. 609, 628-629, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3255-3256, 82 L.Ed.2d 462
(1984). Accordingly, it ruled that &quot;GLIB is entitled to participate
in the Parade on the same terms and conditions as other participants.&quot;
Id., at B27. (FN1)
<P>
The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed, seeing nothing
clearly erroneous in the trial judge's findings that GLIB was
excluded from the parade based on the sexual orientation of its
members, that it was impossible to detect an expressive purpose
in the parade, that there was no state action, and that the parade
was a public accommodation within the meaning of Sec. 272:92A.
<P>
Irish- *2343 American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston
v. Boston, 418 Mass. 238, 242-248, 636 N.E.2d 1293, 1295-1298
(1994). (FN2) Turning to petitioners' First Amendment claim that
application of the public accommodations law to the parade violated
their freedom of speech (as distinguished from their right to
expressive association, raised in the trial court), the court's
majority held that it need not decide on the particular First
Amendment theory involved &quot;because, as the [trial] judge
found, it is 'impossible to discern any specific expressive purpose
entitling the parade to protection under the First Amendment.'
&quot; Id., at 249, 636 N.E.2d, at 1299 (footnote omitted). The
defendants had thus failed at the trial level &quot;to demonstrate
that the parade truly was an exercise of ... First Amendment rights,&quot;
id., at 250, 636 N.E.2d, at 1299, citing Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293, n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3065,
3069, n. 5, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984), and on appeal nothing indicated
to the majority of the Supreme Judicial Court that the trial judge's
assessment of the evidence on this point was clearly erroneous,
ibid. The court rejected petitioners' further challenge to the
law as overbroad, holding that it does not, on its face, regulate
speech, does not let public officials examine the content of speech,
and would not be interpreted as reaching speech. Id., at 251-252,
636 N.E.2d, at 1300. Finally, the court rejected the challenge
that the public accommodations law was unconstitutionally vague,
holding that this case did not present an issue of speech and
that the law gave persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable
opportunity to know what was prohibited. Id., at 252, 636 N.E.2d,
at 1300-1301.
<P>
Justice Nolan dissented. In his view, the Council &quot;does not
need a narrow or distinct theme or message in its parade for it
to be protected under the First Amendment.&quot; Id., at 256,
636 N.E.2d, at 1303. First, he wrote, even if the parade had no
message at all, GLIB's particular message could not be forced
upon it. Id., at 257, 636 N.E.2d, at 1303, citing Wooley v. Maynard,
430 U.S. 705, 717, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 1436, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977)
(state requirement to display &quot;Live Free or Die&quot; on
license plates violates First Amendment). Second, according to
Justice Nolan, the trial judge clearly erred in finding the parade
devoid of expressive purpose. Ibid. He would have held that the
Council, like any expressive association, cannot be barred from
excluding applicants who do not share the views the Council wishes
to advance. Id., at 257-259, 636 N.E.2d, at 1303-1304, citing
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 104 S.Ct. 3244,
82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). Under either a pure speech or associational
theory, the State's purpose of eliminating discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation, according to the dissent, could be
achieved by more narrowly drawn means, such as ordering admission
of individuals regardless of sexual preference, without taking
the further step of prohibiting the Council from editing the views
expressed in their parade. Id., at 256, 258, 636 N.E.2d, at 1302,
1304. In Justice Nolan's opinion, because GLIB's message was separable
from the status of its members, such a narrower order would accommodate
the State's interest without the likelihood of infringing on the
Council's First Amendment rights. Finally, he found clear error
in the trial judge's equation of exclusion on the basis of GLIB's
message with exclusion on the basis of its members' sexual orientation.
To the dissent this appeared false in the light of &quot;overwhelming
evidence&quot; that the Council objected to GLIB on account of
its message and a dearth of testimony or documentation indicating
that sexual orientation was the bar to admission. Id., at 260,
636 N.E.2d, at 1304. The dissent accordingly concluded that the
Council had not even violated the State's public accommodations
law.
<P>
We granted certiorari to determine whether the requirement to
admit a parade contingent expressing a message not of the private
organizers' own choosing violates the First Amendment. 513 U.S.
----, 115 S.Ct. 714, 130 L.Ed.2d 621 (1995). We hold that it does
and reverse.

<P>
Given the scope of the issues as originally joined in this case,
it is worth noting some that have fallen aside in the course of
the litigation, before
<P>
reaching us. Although the Council presents us with a First Amendment
claim, respondents do not. Neither do they press a claim that
the Council's action has denied them equal protection of the laws
in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the guarantees
of free speech and equal protection guard only against encroachment
by the government and &quot;erec[t] no shield against merely private
conduct,&quot; Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13, 68 S.Ct. 836,
842, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948); see Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507,
513, 96 S.Ct. 1029, 1033, 47 L.Ed.2d 196 (1976), respondents originally
argued that the Council's conduct was not purely private, but
had the character of state action. The trial court's review of
the city's involvement led it to find otherwise, however, and
although the Supreme Judicial Court did not squarely address the
issue, it appears to have affirmed the trial court's decision
on that point as well as the others. In any event, respondents
have not brought that question up either in a cross-petition for
certiorari or in their briefs filed in this Court. When asked
at oral argument whether they challenged the conclusion by the
Massachusetts' courts that no state action is involved in the
parade, respondents' counsel answered that they &quot;do not press
that issue here.&quot; Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. In this Court, then,
their claim for inclusion in the parade rests solely on the Massachusetts
public accommodations law.
<P>
There is no corresponding concession from the other side, however,
and certainly not to the state courts' characterization of the
parade as lacking the element of expression for purposes of the
First Amendment. Accordingly, our review of petitioners' claim
that their activity is indeed in the nature of protected speech
carries with it a constitutional duty to conduct an independent
examination of the record as a whole, without deference to the
trial court. See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,
Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1958, 80 L.Ed.2d 502
(1984). The &quot;requirement of independent appellate review
... is a rule of federal constitutional law,&quot; id., at 510,
104 S.Ct., at 1965, which does not limit our deference to a trial
court on matters of witness credibility, Harte-Hanks Communications,
Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 688, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 2696,
105 L.Ed.2d 562 (1989), but which generally requires us to &quot;review
the finding of facts by a State court ... where a conclusion of
law as to a Federal right and a finding of fact are so intermingled
as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the Federal question,
to analyze the facts,&quot; Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380, 385-386,
47 S.Ct. 655, 656-657, 71 L.Ed. 1108 (1927). See also Niemotko
v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 271, 71 S.Ct. 325, 327, 95 L.Ed. 267
(1951); Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 189, 84 S.Ct. 1676,
1679, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (opinion of Brennan, J.). This obligation
rests upon us simply because the reaches of the First Amendment
are ultimately defined by the facts it is held to embrace, and
we must thus decide for ourselves whether a given course of conduct
falls on the near or far side of the line of constitutional protection.
See Bose Corp., supra, at 503, 104 S.Ct. at 1961. Even where a
speech case has originally been tried in a federal court, subject
to the provision of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) that
&quot;[f]indings of fact ... shall not be set aside unless clearly
erroneous,&quot; we are obliged to make a fresh examination of
crucial facts. Hence, in this case, though we are confronted with
the state courts' conclusion that the factual characteristics
of petitioners' activity place it within the vast realm of non-expressive
conduct, our obligation is to &quot; 'make an independent examination
of the whole record,' ... so as to assure ourselves that th[is]
judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field
of free expression.&quot; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376
U.S. 254, 285, 84 S.Ct. 710, 729, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964) (footnote
omitted), quoting Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235,
83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963).

If there were no reason for a group of people to march from here
to there except to *2345 reach a destination, they could make
the trip without expressing any message beyond the fact of the
march itself. Some people might call such a procession a parade,
but it would not be much of one. Real &quot;[p]arades are public
dramas of social relations, and in them performers define who
can be a social actor and what subjects and ideas are available
for communication and consideration.&quot; S. Davis, Parades and
Power: Street Theatre in Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia 6 (1986).
Hence, we use the word &quot;parade&quot; to indicate marchers
who are making some sort of collective point, not just to each
other but to bystanders along the way. Indeed a parade's dependence
on watchers is so extreme that nowadays, as with Bishop Berkeley's
celebrated tree, &quot;if a parade or demonstration receives no
media coverage, it may as well not have happened.&quot; Id., at
171. Parades are thus a form of expression, not just motion, and
the inherent expressiveness of marching to make a point explains
our cases involving protest marches. In Gregory v. Chicago, 394
U.S. 111, 112, 89 S.Ct. 946, 947, 22 L.Ed.2d 134 (1969), for example,
petitioners had taken part in a procession to express their grievances
to the city government, and we held that such a &quot;march, if
peaceful and orderly, falls well within the sphere of conduct
protected by the First Amendment.&quot; Similarly, in Edwards
v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d
697 (1963), where petitioners had joined in a march of protest
and pride, carrying placards and singing The Star Spangled Banner,
we held that the activities &quot;reflect an exercise of these
basic constitutional rights in their most pristine and classic
form.&quot; Accord, Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147,
152, 89 S.Ct. 935, 939, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969).
<P>
The protected expression that inheres in a parade is not limited
to its banners and songs, however, for the Constitution looks
beyond written or spoken words as mediums of expression. Noting
that &quot;[s]ymbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating
ideas,&quot; West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624,
632, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1182, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943), our cases have
recognized that the First Amendment shields such acts as saluting
a flag (and refusing to do so), id., at 632, 642, 63 S.Ct., at
1182, 1187, wearing an arm band to protest a war, Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505-506,
89 S.Ct. 733, 735-736, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), displaying a red
flag, Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 369, 51 S.Ct. 532,
535, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931), and even &quot;[m]arching, walking
or parading&quot; in uniforms displaying the swastika, National
Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S.Ct. 2205,
53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977). As some of these examples show, a narrow,
succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional
protection, which if confined to expressions conveying a &quot;particularized
message,&quot; cf. Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 411, 94
S.Ct. 2727, 2730, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974) (per curiam ), would never
reach the unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock,
music of Arnold Schonberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll.
<P>
Not many marches, then, are beyond the realm of expressive parades,
and the South Boston celebration is not one of them. Spectators
line the streets; people march in costumes and uniforms, carrying
flags and banners with all sorts of messages (e.g., &quot;England
get out of Ireland,&quot; &quot;Say no to drugs&quot;); marching
bands and pipers play, floats are pulled along, and the whole
show is broadcast over Boston television. See Record, Exh. 84
(video). To be sure, we agree with the state courts that in spite
of excluding some applicants, the Council is rather lenient in
admitting participants. But a private speaker does not forfeit
constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices,
or by failing to edit their themes to isolate an exact message
as the exclusive subject matter of the speech. Nor, under our
precedent, does First Amendment protection require a speaker to
generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the communication.
Cable operators, for example, are engaged in protected speech
activities even when they only select programming originally produced
by others. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ----,
----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2456, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994) (slip op.,
at 11) (&quot;Cable programmers and cable operators engage in
and transmit speech, and they are entitled to the *2346 protection
of the speech and press provisions of the First Amendment&quot;).
For that matter, the presentation of an edited compilation of
speech generated by other persons is a staple of most newspapers'
opinion pages, which, of course, fall squarely within the core
of First Amendment security, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,
418 U.S. 241, 258, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 2840, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974),
as does even the simple selection of a paid noncommercial advertisement
for inclusion in a daily paper, see New York Times, 376 U.S.,
at 265-266, 84 S.Ct., at 718-719. The selection of contingents
to make a parade is entitled to similar protection.
<P>
Respondents' participation as a unit in the parade was equally
expressive. GLIB was formed for the very purpose of marching in
it, as the trial court found, in order to celebrate its members'
identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the
Irish immigrants, to show that there are such individuals in the
community, and to support the like men and women who sought to
march in the New York parade. App. to Pet. for Cert. B3. The organization
distributed a fact sheet describing the members' intentions, App.
A51, and the record otherwise corroborates the expressive nature
of GLIB's participation, see Record, Exh. 84; App. A67 (photograph).
In 1993, members of GLIB marched behind a shamrock-strewn banner
with the simple inscription &quot;Irish American Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Group of Boston.&quot; GLIB understandably seeks
to communicate its ideas as part of the existing parade, rather
than staging one of its own.

The Massachusetts public accommodations law under which respondents
brought suit has a venerable history. At common law, innkeepers,
smiths, and others who &quot;made profession of a public employment,&quot;
were prohibited from refusing, without good reason, to serve a
customer. Lane v. Cotton, 12 Mod. 472, 484-485, 88 Eng.Rep. 1458,
1464-1465 (K.B.1701) (Holt, C.J.); see Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S.
226, 298, n. 17, 84 S.Ct. 1814, 1853, n. 17, 12 L.Ed.2d 822 (1964)
(Goldberg, J., concurring); Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267,
277, 83 S.Ct. 1122, 1127, 10 L.Ed.2d 338 (1963) (Douglas, J.,
concurring). As one of the 19th century English judges put it,
the rule was that &quot;[t]he innkeeper is not to select his guests[;]
[h]e has no right to say to one, you shall come into my inn, and
to another you shall not, as every one coming and conducting himself
in a proper manner has a right to be received; and for this purpose
innkeepers are a sort of public servants.&quot; Rex v. Ivens,
7 Car. &amp; P. 213, 219, 173 Eng.Rep. 94, 96 (N.P.1835); M. Konvitz
&amp; T. Leskes, A Century of Civil Rights 160 (1961).
<P>
After the Civil War, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was the
first State to codify this principle to ensure access to public
accommodations regardless of race. See Act Forbidding Unjust Discrimination
on Account of Color or Race, 1865 Mass. Acts, ch. 277 (May 16,
1865); Konvitz &amp; Leskes, supra, at 155-56; L.G. Lerman &amp;
A. Sanderson, Discrimination in Access to Public Places: A Survey
of State and Federal Public Accommodations Laws, 7 N.Y.U.Rev.L.
&amp; Soc. Change 215, 238 (1978); F. Fox, Discrimination and
Antidiscrimination in Massachusetts Law, 44 B.U.L.Rev. 30, 58
(1964). In prohibiting discrimination &quot;in any licensed inn,
in any public place of amusement, public conveyance or public
meeting,&quot; 1865 Mass.Acts, ch. 277, Sec. 1, the original statute
already expanded upon the common law, which had not conferred
any right of access to places of public amusement, Lerman &amp;
Anderson, supra, at 248. As with many public accommodations statutes
across the Nation, the legislature continued to broaden the scope
of legislation, to the point that the law today prohibits discrimination
on the basis of &quot;race, color, religious creed, national origin,
sex, sexual orientation ..., deafness, blindness or any physical
or mental disability or ancestry&quot; in &quot;the admission
of any person to, or treatment in any place of public accommodation,
resort or amusement.&quot; Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:98. Provisions
like these are well within the State's usual power to enact when
a legislature has reason to believe that a given group is the
target of discrimination, and they do not, as a general matter,
violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments. See, e.g., New York
State Club Assn., Inc. v. City *2347 of New York, 487 U.S. 1,
11-16, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 2233-2236, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988); Roberts
v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 624-626, 104 S.Ct. 3244,
3253-3254, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.
v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 258-262, 85 S.Ct. 348, 358-360,
13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964). Nor is this statute unusual in any obvious
way, since it does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate
on the basis of its content, the focal point of its prohibition
being rather on the act of discriminating against individuals
in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and
services on the proscribed grounds.
<P>
C
<P>
In the case before us, however, the Massachusetts law has been
applied in a peculiar way. Its enforcement does not address any
dispute about the participation of openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual
individuals in various units admitted to the parade. The petitioners
disclaim any intent to exclude homosexuals as such, and no individual
member of GLIB claims to have been excluded from parading as a
member of any group that the Council has approved to march. Instead,
the disagreement goes to the admission of GLIB as its own parade
unit carrying its own banner. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B26-B27,
and n. 28. Since every participating unit affects the message
conveyed by the private organizers, the state courts' application
of the statute produced an order essentially requiring petitioners
to alter the expressive content of their parade. Although the
state courts spoke of the parade as a place of public accommodation,
see, e.g., 418 Mass., at 247-248, 636 N.E.2d, at 1297-1298, once
the expressive character of both the parade and the marching GLIB
contingent is understood, it becomes apparent that the state courts'
application of the statute had the effect of declaring the sponsors'
speech itself to be the public accommodation. Under this approach
any contingent of protected individuals with a message would have
the right to participate in petitioners' speech, so that the communication
produced by the private organizers would be shaped by all those
protected by the law who wished to join in with some expressive
demonstration of their own. But this use of the State's power
violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment,
that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own
message.
<P>
&quot;Since all speech inherently involves choices of what to
say and what to leave unsaid,&quot; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal., 475 U.S. 1, 11, 106 S.Ct.
903, 909, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in
original), one important manifestation of the principle of free
speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide &quot;what
not to say,&quot; id., at 16, 106 S.Ct., at 912. Although the
State may at times &quot;prescribe what shall be orthodox in commercial
advertising&quot; by requiring the dissemination of &quot;purely
factual and uncontroversial information,&quot; Zauderer v. Office
of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626,
651, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 2281, 85 L.Ed.2d 652 (1985); see Pittsburgh
Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376,
386-387, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 2559-2560, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973), outside
that context it may not compel affirmance of a belief with which
the speaker disagrees, see Barnette, 319 U.S., at 642, 63 S.Ct.,
at 1187. Indeed this general rule, that the speaker has the right
to tailor the speech, applies not only to expressions of value,
opinion, or endorsement, but equally to statements of fact the
speaker would rather avoid, McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,
514 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 1516, 131 L.Ed.2d
426 (1995); Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N.C., Inc.,
487 U.S. 781, 797-798, 108 S.Ct. 2667, 2678, 101 L.Ed.2d 669 (1988),
subject, perhaps, to the permissive law of defamation, New York
Times, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710; Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,
418 U.S. 323, 347-349, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3010-3012, 41 L.Ed.2d 789
(1974); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 108 S.Ct.
876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988). Nor is the rule's benefit restricted
to the press, being enjoyed by business corporations generally
and by ordinary people engaged in unsophisticated expression as
well as by professional publishers. Its point is simply the point
of all speech protection, which is to *2348 shield just those
choices of content that in someone's eyes are misguided, or even
hurtful. See Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827,
23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69
S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949).
<P>
Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle of autonomy
to control one's own speech is as sound as the South Boston parade
is expressive. Rather like a composer, the Council selects the
expressive units of the parade from potential participants, and
though the score may not produce a particularized message, each
contingent's expression in the Council's eyes comports with what
merits celebration on that day. Even if this view gives the Council
credit for a more considered judgment than it actively made, the
Council clearly decided to exclude a message it did not like from
the communication it chose to make, and that is enough to invoke
its right as a private speaker to shape its expression by speaking
on one subject while remaining silent on another. The message
it disfavored is not difficult to identify. Although GLIB's point
(like the Council's) is not wholly articulate, a contingent marching
behind the organization's banner would at least bear witness to
the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the
presence of the organized marchers would suggest their view that
people of their sexual orientations have as much claim to unqualified
social acceptance as heterosexuals and indeed as members of parade
units organized around other identifying characteristics. The
parade's organizers may not believe these facts about Irish sexuality
to be so, or they may object to unqualified social acceptance
of gays and lesbians or have some other reason for wishing to
keep GLIB's message out of the parade. But whatever the reason,
it boils down to the choice of a speaker not to propound a particular
point of view, and that choice is presumed to lie beyond the government's
power to control.
<P>
Respondents argue that any tension between this rule and the Massachusetts
law falls short of unconstitutionality, citing the most recent
of our cases on the general subject of compelled access for expressive
purposes, Turner Broadcasting, 512 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445.
There we reviewed regulations requiring cable operators to set
aside channels for designated broadcast signals, and applied only
intermediate scrutiny. Id., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2469. Respondents
contend on this authority that admission of GLIB to the parade
would not threaten the core principle of speaker's autonomy because
the Council, like a cable operator, is merely &quot;a conduit&quot;
for the speech of participants in the parade &quot;rather than
itself a speaker.&quot; Brief for Respondent 21. But this metaphor
is not apt here, because GLIB's participation would likely be
perceived as having resulted from the Council's customary determination
about a unit admitted to the parade, that its message was worthy
of presentation and quite possibly of support as well. A newspaper,
similarly, &quot;is more than a passive receptacle or conduit
for news, comment, and advertising,&quot; and we have held that
&quot;[t]he choice of material ... and the decisions made as to
limitations on the size and content ... and treatment of public
issues ...--whether fair or unfair--constitute the exercise of
editorial control and judgment&quot; upon which the State can
not intrude. Tornillo, 418 U.S., at 258, 94 S.Ct., at 2840. Indeed,
in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, we invalidated coerced access to
the envelope of a private utility's bill and newsletter because
the utility &quot;may be forced either to appear to agree with
[the intruding leaflet] or to respond.&quot; 475 U.S., at 15,
106 S.Ct., at 911 (plurality) (citation omitted). The plurality
made the further point that if &quot;the government [were] freely
able to compel ... speakers to propound political messages with
which they disagree, ... protection [of a speaker's freedom] would
be empty, for the government could require speakers to affirm
in one breath that which they deny in the next.&quot; Id., at
16, 106 S.Ct., at 912. Thus, when dissemination of a view contrary
to one's own is forced upon a speaker intimately connected with
the communication advanced, the speaker's right to autonomy over
the message is compromised.
<P>
In Turner Broadcasting, we found this problem absent in the cable
context, because &quot;[g]iven cable's long history of serving
as a conduit for broadcast signals, there appears little risk
that cable viewers would assume *2349 that the broadcast stations
carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages endorsed by
the cable operator.&quot; 512 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2465.
We stressed that the viewer is frequently apprised of the identity
of the broadcaster whose signal is being received via cable and
that it is &quot;common practice for broadcasters to disclaim
any identity of viewpoint between the management and the speakers
who use the broadcast facility.&quot; Ibid., 512 U.S., at ----,
114 S.Ct., at 2466 (citation omitted); see id., at ----, 114 S.Ct.,
at 2480 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(noting that Congress &quot;might ... conceivably obligate cable
operators to act as common carriers for some of their channels&quot;).
<P>
Parades and demonstrations, in contrast, are not understood to
be so neutrally presented or selectively viewed. Unlike the programming
offered on various channels by a cable network, the parade does
not consist of individual, unrelated segments that happen to be
transmitted together for individual selection by members of the
audience. Although each parade unit generally identifies itself,
each is understood to contribute something to a common theme,
and accordingly there is no customary practice whereby private
sponsors disavow &quot;any identity of viewpoint&quot; between
themselves and the selected participants. Practice follows practicability
here, for such disclaimers would be quite curious in a moving
parade. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74,
87, 100 S.Ct. 2035, 2044, 64 L.Ed.2d 741 (1980) (owner of shopping
mall &quot;can expressly disavow any connection with the message
by simply posting signs in the area where the speakers or handbillers
stand&quot;). Without deciding on the precise significance of
the likelihood of misattribution, it nonetheless becomes clear
that in the context of an expressive parade, as with a protest
march, the parade's overall message is distilled from the individual
presentations along the way, and each unit's expression is perceived
by spectators as part of the whole.
<P>
An additional distinction between Turner Broadcasting and this
case points to the fundamental weakness of any attempt to justify
the state court order's limitation on the Council's autonomy as
a speaker. A cable is not only a conduit for speech produced by
others and selected by cable operators for transmission, but a
franchised channel giving monopolistic opportunity to shut out
some speakers. This power gives rise to the government's interest
in limiting monopolistic autonomy in order to allow for the survival
of broadcasters who might otherwise be silenced and consequently
destroyed. The government's interest in Turner Broadcasting was
not the alteration of speech, but the survival of speakers. In
thus identifying an interest going beyond abridgment of speech
itself, the defenders of the law at issue in Turner Broadcasting
addressed the threshold requirement of any review under the Speech
Clause, whatever the ultimate level of scrutiny, that a challenged
restriction on speech serve a compelling, or at least important,
governmental object, see, e.g., Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, supra,
at 19, 106 S.Ct., at 913; Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ----,
114 S.Ct., at 2469; United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377,
88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
<P>
In this case, of course, there is no assertion comparable to the
Turner Broadcasting claim that some speakers will be destroyed
in the absence of the challenged law. True, the size and success
of petitioners' parade makes it an enviable vehicle for the dissemination
of GLIB's views, but that fact, without more, would fall far short
of supporting a claim that petitioners enjoy an abiding monopoly
of access to spectators. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B9;
<P>
Brief for Respondents 10 (citing trial court's finding that no
other applicant has applied for the permit). Considering that
GLIB presumably would have had a fair shot (under neutral criteria
developed by the city) at obtaining a parade permit of its own,
respondents have not shown that petitioners enjoy the capacity
to &quot;silence the voice of competing speakers,&quot; as cable
operators do with respect to program providers who wish to reach
subscribers, Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ----, 114 S.Ct., at
2466. Nor has any other legitimate interest been identified in
support of applying the Massachusetts statute in this way to expressive
activity like the parade. *2350 The statute, Mass.Gen.Laws Sec.
272:98, is a piece of protective legislation that announces no
purpose beyond the object both expressed and apparent in its provisions,
which is to prevent any denial of access to (or discriminatory
treatment in) public accommodations on proscribed grounds, including
sexual orientation. On its face, the object of the law is to ensure
by statute for gays and lesbians desiring to make use of public
accommodations what the old common law promised to any member
of the public wanting a meal at the inn, that accepting the usual
terms of service, they will not be turned away merely on the proprietor's
exercise of personal preference. When the law is applied to expressive
activity in the way it was done here, its apparent object is simply
to require speakers to modify the content of their expression
to whatever extent beneficiaries of the law choose to alter it
with messages of their own. But in the absence of some further,
legitimate end, this object is merely to allow exactly what the
general rule of speaker's autonomy forbids.
<P>
It might, of course, have been argued that a broader objective
is apparent: that the ultimate point of forbidding acts of discrimination
toward certain classes is to produce a society free of the corresponding
biases.
<P>
Requiring access to a speaker's message would thus be not an end
in itself, but a means to produce speakers free of the biases,
whose expressive conduct would be at least neutral toward the
particular classes, obviating any future need for correction.
But if this indeed is the point of applying the state law to expressive
conduct, it is a decidedly fatal objective. Having availed itself
of the public thoroughfares &quot;for purposes of assembly [and]
communicating thoughts between citizens,&quot; the Council is
engaged in a use of the streets that has &quot;from ancient times,
been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties
of citizens.&quot; Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization,
307 U.S. 496, 515, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939) (opinion
of Roberts, J.). Our tradition of free speech commands that a
speaker who takes to the street corner to express his views in
this way should be free from interference by the State based on
the content of what he says. See, e.g., Police Department of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 33 L.Ed.2d 212
(1972); cf. H. Kalven, Jr., A Worthy Tradition 6-19 (1988); O.
Fiss, Free Speech and Social Structure, 71 Iowa L.Rev. 1405, 1408-1409
(1986). The very idea that a noncommercial speech restriction
be used to produce thoughts and statements acceptable to some
groups or, indeed, all people, grates on the First Amendment,
for it amounts to nothing less than a proposal to limit speech
in the service of orthodox expression. The Speech Clause has no
more certain antithesis. See, e.g., Barnette, 319 U.S., at 642,
63 S.Ct., at 1187; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, 475 U.S., at 20,
106 S.Ct., at 914. While the law is free to promote all sorts
of conduct in place of harmful behavior, it is not free to interfere
with speech for no better reason than promoting an approved message
or discouraging a disfavored one, however enlightened either purpose
may strike the government.
<P>
Far from supporting GLIB, then, Turner Broadcasting points to
the reasons why the present application of the Massachusetts law
can not be sustained. So do the two other principal authorities
GLIB has cited. In PruneYard, 447 U.S. 74, 100 S.Ct. 2035, to
be sure, we sustained a state law requiring the proprietors of
shopping malls to allow visitors to solicit signatures on political
petitions without a showing that the shopping mall owners would
otherwise prevent the beneficiaries of the law from reaching an
audience. But we found in that case that the proprietors were
running &quot;a business establishment that is open to the public
to come and go as they please,&quot; that the solicitations would
&quot;not likely be identified with those of the owner,&quot;
and that the proprietors could &quot;expressly disavow any connection
with the message by simply posting signs in the area where the
speakers or handbillers stand.&quot; Id., at 87, 100 S.Ct., at
2044. Also, in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, supra, at 12, 106 S.Ct.,
at 909, we noted that PruneYard did not involve &quot;any concern
that access to this area might affect the shopping center owner's
exercise of his own right to speak: the owner did not even allege
that he objected to the content of the pamphlets....&quot; The
principle of speaker's *2351. autonomy was simply not threatened
in that case.
<P>
New York State Club Association is also instructive by the contrast
it provides. There, we turned back a facial challenge to a state
antidiscrimination statute on the assumption that the expressive
associational character of a dining club with over 400 members
could be sufficiently attenuated to permit application of the
law even to such a private organization, but we also recognized
that the State did not prohibit exclusion of those whose views
were at odds with positions espoused by the general club memberships.
487 U.S., at 13, 108 S.Ct. at 2234; see also Roberts, 468 U.S.,
at 627, 104 S.Ct. at 3254. In other words, although the association
provided public benefits to which a State could ensure equal access,
it was also engaged in expressive activity; compelled access to
the benefit, which was upheld, did not trespass on the organization's
message itself. If we were to analyze this case strictly along
those lines, GLIB would lose. Assuming the parade to be large
enough and a source of benefits (apart from its expression) that
would generally justify a mandated access provision, GLIB could
nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contingent with
its own message just as readily as a private club could exclude
an applicant whose manifest views were at odds with a position
taken by the club's existing members.
<P>
IV
<P>
Our holding today rests not on any particular view about the Council's
message but on the Nation's commitment to protect freedom of speech.
<P>
Disapproval of a private speaker's statement does not legitimize
use of the Commonwealth's power to compel the speaker to alter
the message by including one more acceptable to others. Accordingly,
the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court is reversed and the
case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.

the city because it found that the city's actions did not amount
to inciting or assisting in the Council's violations of Sec. 272:98.
App. to Pet. for Cert. B12-B13. It also dismissed respondents'
First and Fourteenth Amendment challenge against the Council for
want of state action triggering the proscriptions of those Amendments.
Id., at B14-B22. Finally, the court did not reach the state constitutional
questions, since respondents had apparently assumed in their arguments
that those claims, too, depended for their success upon a finding
of state action and because of the court's holding that the public
accommodation statutes apply to the parade. Id., at B22.
<P>
FN2. Since respondents did not cross-appeal the dismissal of their
claims against the city, the Supreme Judicial Court declined to
reach those claims. 418 Mass., at 245, n. 12, 636 N.E.2d, at 1297.

Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Pursuant to a Wisconsin statute, respondent Mitchell's sentence
for aggravated battery was enhanced because he intentionally selected
his victim on account of the victim's race. The State Court of
Appeals rejected his challenge to the law's constitutionality,
but the State Supreme Court reversed. Relying on R.A.V. v. St.
Paul, 505 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 it held that
the statute violates the First Amendment by punishing what the
legislature has deemed to be offensive thought and rejected the
State's contention that the law punishes only the conduct of intentional
victim selection. It also found that the statute was unconstitutionally
overbroad because the evidentiary use of a defendant's prior speech
would have a chilling effect on those who fear they may be prosecuted
for offenses subject to penalty enhancement. Finally, it distinguished
antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional,
on the ground that they prohibit objective acts of discrimination,
whereas the state statute punishes the subjective mental process.
<P>
Held: Mitchell's First Amendment rights were not violated by the
application of the penalty-enhancement provision in sentencing
him. Pp. 2198-2202.
<P>
(a) While Mitchell correctly notes that this Court is bound by
a state court's interpretation of a state statute, the State Supreme
Court did not construe the instant statute in the sense of defining
the meaning of a particular word or phrase. Rather, it characterized
the statute's practical effect for First Amendment purposes. Thus,
after resolving any ambiguities in the statute's meaning, this
Court may form its own judgment about the law's operative effect.
The State's argument that the statute punishes only conduct does
not dispose of Mitchell's claim, since the fact remains that the
same criminal conduct is more heavily punished if the victim is
selected *2196 because of his protected status than if no such
motive obtains. Pp. 2198-99.
<P>
(b) In determining what sentence to impose, sentencing judges
have traditionally considered a wide variety of factors in addition
to evidence bearing on guilt, including a defendant's motive for
committing the offense. While it is equally true that a sentencing
judge may not take into consideration a defendant's abstract beliefs,
however obnoxious to most people, the Constitution does not erect
a per se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's
beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because they are
protected by the First Amendment. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S.
----, 112 S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309; Barclay v. Florida, 463
U.S. 939, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (plurality opinion).
That Dawson and Barclay did not involve the application of a penalty-enhancement
provision does not make them inapposite. Barclay involved the
consideration of racial animus in determining whether to sentence
a defendant to death, the most severe &quot;enhancement&quot;
of all; and the state legislature has the primary responsibility
for fixing criminal penalties. Motive plays the same role under
the state statute as it does under federal and state antidiscrimination
laws, which have been upheld against constitutional challenge.
Nothing in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, supra, compels a different result
here. The ordinance at issue there was explicitly directed at
speech, while the one here is aimed at conduct unprotected by
the First Amendment. Moreover, the State's desire to redress what
it sees as the greater individual and societal harm inflicted
by bias-inspired conduct provides an adequate explanation for
the provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders'
beliefs or biases. Pp. 2199-2201.
<P>
(c) Because the statute has no &quot;chilling effect&quot; on
free speech, it is not unconstitutionally overbroad. The prospect
of a citizen suppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence
of those beliefs will be introduced against him at trial if he
commits a serious offense against person or property is too speculative
a hypothesis to support this claim. Moreover, the First Amendment
permits the admission of previous declarations or statements to
establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent,
subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability,
and the like. Haupt v. United States, 330 U.S. 631, 67 S.Ct. 874,
91 L.Ed. 1145. Pp. 2201-02.

Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
Respondent Todd Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was
enhanced because he intentionally selected his victim on account
of the victim's race. The question presented in this case is whether
this penalty enhancement is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. We hold that it is not.
<P>
On the evening of October 7, 1989, a group of young black men
and boys, including Mitchell, gathered at an apartment complex
in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Several members of the group discussed
a scene from the motion picture &quot;Mississippi Burning,&quot;
in which a white man beat a young black boy who was praying. The
group moved outside and Mitchell asked them: &quot; 'Do you all
feel hyped up to move on some white people?' &quot; Brief for
Petitioner 4. Shortly thereafter, a young white boy approached
the group on the opposite side of the street where they were standing.
As the boy walked by, Mitchell said: &quot; 'You *2197 all want
to fuck somebody up? There goes a white boy; go get him.' &quot;
Id., at 4-5. Mitchell counted to three and pointed in the boy's
direction. The group ran towards the boy, beat him severely, and
stole his tennis shoes.
<P>
The boy was rendered unconscious and remained in a coma for four
days.
<P>
After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County, Mitchell
was convicted of aggravated battery. Wis.Stat. Secs. 939.05 and
940.19(1m) (1989-1990). That offense ordinarily carries a maximum
sentence of two years' imprisonment. Secs. 940.19(1m) and 939.50(3)(e).
But because the jury found that Mitchell had intentionally selected
his victim because of the boy's race, the maximum sentence for
Mitchell's offense was increased to seven years under Sec. 939.645.
That provision enhances the maximum penalty for an offense whenever
the defendant &quot;[i]ntentionally selects the person against
whom the crime ... is committed ... because of the race, religion,
color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry
of that person....&quot; Sec. 939.645(1)(b). (FN1) The Circuit
Court sentenced Mitchell to four years' imprisonment for the aggravated
battery.
<P>
Mitchell unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in the Circuit
Court. Then he appealed his conviction and sentence, challenging
the constitutionality of Wisconsin's penalty-enhancement provision
on First Amendment grounds. (FN2) The Wisconsin Court of Appeals
rejected Mitchell's challenge, 163 Wis.2d 652, 473 N.W.2d 1 (1991),
but the Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed. The Supreme Court held
that the statute &quot;violates the First Amendment directly by
punishing what the legislature has deemed to be offensive thought.&quot;169 Wis.2d 153, 163, 485 N.W.2d 807, 811 (1992). It rejected the
State's contention &quot;that the statute punishes only the 'conduct'
of intentional selection of a victim.&quot; Id., at 164, 485 N.W.2d,
at 812. According to the court, &quot;[t]he statute punishes the
'because of' aspect of the defendant's selection, the reason the
defendant selected the victim, the motive behind the selection.&quot;
Ibid. (emphasis in original). And under R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505
U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), &quot;the Wisconsin
legislature *2198 cannot criminalize bigoted thought with which
it disagrees.&quot; 169 Wis.2d, at 171, 485 N.W.2d, at 815.
<P>
The Supreme Court also held that the penalty-enhancement statute
was unconstitutionally overbroad. It reasoned that, in order to
prove that a defendant intentionally selected his victim because
of the victim's protected status, the State would often have to
introduce evidence of the defendant's prior speech, such as racial
epithets he may have uttered before the commission of the offense.
This evidentiary use of protected speech, the court thought, would
have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on those who feared the possibility
of prosecution for offenses subject to penalty enhancement. See
id., at 174, 485 N.W.2d, at 816. Finally, the court distinguished
antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional,
on the ground that the Wisconsin statute punishes the &quot;subjective
mental process&quot; of selecting a victim because of his protected
status, whereas antidiscrimination laws prohibit &quot;objective
acts of discrimination.&quot; Id., at 176, 485 N.W.2d, at 817.
(FN3)
<P>
We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question
presented and the existence of a conflict of authority among state
high courts on the constitutionality of statutes similar to Wisconsin's
penalty-enhancement provision, (FN4) 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct.
810, 121 L.Ed.2d 683 (1992). We reverse.
<P>
Mitchell argues that we are bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court's
conclusion that the statute punishes bigoted thought and not conduct.
There is no doubt that we are bound by a state court's construction
of a state statute. R.A.V., supra, at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at 2541-2542; New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769, n. 24, 102
S.Ct. 3348, 3361, n. 24, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982);
<P>
Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 895, 93 L.Ed.
1131 (1949). In Terminiello, for example, the Illinois courts
had defined the term &quot; 'breach of the peace,' &quot; in a
city ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct, to include &quot;
'stirs the public to anger ... or creates a disturbance.' &quot;
Id., at 4, 69 S.Ct., at 895. We held this construction to be binding
on us. But here the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not, strictly
speaking, construe the Wisconsin statute in the sense of defining
the meaning of a particular statutory word or phrase. Rather,
it merely characterized the &quot;practical effect&quot; of the
statute for First Amendment purposes. See 169 *2199 Wis.2d, at
166-167, 485 N.W.2d, at 813 (&quot;Merely because the statute
refers in a literal sense to the intentional 'conduct' of selecting,
does not mean the court must turn a blind eye to the intent and
practical effect of the law--punishment of motive or thought&quot;).
This assessment does not bind us. Once any ambiguities as to the
meaning of the statute are resolved, we may form our own judgment
as to its operative effect.
<P>
The State argues that the statute does not punish bigoted thought,
as the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said, but instead punishes only
conduct. While this argument is literally correct, it does not
dispose of Mitchell's First Amendment challenge. To be sure, our
cases reject the &quot;view that an apparently limitless variety
of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging
in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.&quot; United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20
L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); accord, R.A.V., 505 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at 2544; Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409, 94 S.Ct. 2727,
2729, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974) (per curiam );  Cox v. Louisiana,
379 U.S. 536, 555, 85 S.Ct. 453, 464, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965). Thus,
a physical assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive
conduct protected by the First Amendment. See Roberts v. United
States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 628, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3255, 82 L.Ed.2d
462 (1984) (&quot;[V]iolence or other types of potentially expressive
activities that produce special harms distinct from their communicative
impact ... are entitled to no constitutional protection&quot;);
NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 916, 102 S.Ct.
3409, 3427, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982) (&quot;The First Amendment
does not protect violence&quot;).
<P>
But the fact remains that under the Wisconsin statute the same
criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if the victim is
selected because of his race or other protected status than if
no such motive obtained. Thus, although the statute punishes criminal
conduct, it enhances the maximum penalty for conduct motivated
by a discriminatory point of view more severely than the same
conduct engaged in for some other reason or for no reason at all.
Because the only reason for the enhancement is the defendant's
discriminatory motive for selecting his victim, Mitchell argues
(and the Wisconsin Supreme Court held) that the statute violates
the First Amendment by punishing offenders' bigoted beliefs.
<P>
Traditionally, sentencing judges have considered a wide variety
of factors in addition to evidence bearing on guilt in determining
what sentence to impose on a convicted defendant. See Payne v.
Tennessee, 501 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2605, 115 L.Ed.2d
720 (1991); United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct.
589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); Williams v. New York, 337 U.S.
241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). The defendant's
motive for committing the offense is one important factor. See
1 W. LeFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law Sec. 3.6(b),
p. 324 (1986) (&quot;Motives are most relevant when the trial
judge sets the defendant's sentence, and it is not uncommon for
a defendant to receive a minimum sentence because he was acting
with good motives, or a rather high sentence because of his bad
motives&quot;); cf. Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 156, 107 S.Ct.
1676, 1687, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) (&quot;Deeply ingrained in our
legal tradition is the idea that the more purposeful is the criminal
conduct, the more serious is the offense, and, therefore, the
more severely it ought to be punished&quot;). Thus, in many States
the commission of a murder, or other capital offense, for pecuniary
gain is a separate aggravating circumstance under the capital-sentencing
statute. See, e.g., Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 13-703(F)(5) (1989);
Fla.Stat. Sec.
<P>
921.141(5)(f) (Supp.1992); Miss.Code Ann. Sec. 99-19-101(5)(f)
(Supp.1992); N.C.Gen.Stat. Sec. 15A-2000(e)(6) (1992); Wyo.Stat.
Sec. 6-2-102(h)(vi) (Supp.1992).
<P>
*2200 But it is equally true that a defendant's abstract beliefs,
however obnoxious to most people, may not be taken into consideration
by a sentencing judge. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S. ----, 112
S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309 (1992). In Dawson, the State introduced
evidence at a capital-sentencing hearing that the defendant was
a member of a white supremacist prison gang. Because &quot;the
evidence proved nothing more than [the defendant's] abstract beliefs,&quot;
we held that its admission violated the defendant's First Amendment
rights. Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1098. In so holding, however,
we emphasized that &quot;the Constitution does not erect a per
se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's beliefs
and associations at sentencing simply because those beliefs and
associations are protected by the First Amendment.&quot; Id.,
at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1094. Thus, in Barclay v. Florida, 463
U.S. 939, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1983) (plurality opinion),
we allowed the sentencing judge to take into account the defendant's
racial animus towards his victim. The evidence in that case showed
that the defendant's membership in the Black Liberation Army and
desire to provoke a &quot;race war&quot; were related to the murder
of a white man for which he was convicted. See id., at 942-944,
103 S.Ct., at 3421-3422. Because &quot;the elements of racial
hatred in [the] murder&quot; were relevant to several aggravating
factors, we held that the trial judge permissibly took this evidence
into account in sentencing the defendant to death. Id., at 949,
and n. 7, 103 S.Ct., at 3424, and n. 7.
<P>
Mitchell suggests that Dawson and Barclay are inapposite because
they did not involve application of a penalty-enhancement provision.
But in Barclay we held that it was permissible for the sentencing
court to consider the defendant's racial animus in determining
whether he should be sentenced to death, surely the most severe
&quot;enhancement&quot; of all. And the fact that the Wisconsin
Legislature has decided, as a general matter, that bias-motivated
offenses warrant greater maximum penalties across the board does
not alter the result here. For the primary responsibility for
fixing criminal penalties lies with the legislature. Rummel v.
Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 274, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1139, 63 L.Ed.2d 382
(1980); Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280,
1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958).
<P>
Mitchell argues that the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement statute
is invalid because it punishes the defendant's discriminatory
motive, or reason, for acting. But motive plays the same role
under the Wisconsin statute as it does under federal and state
antidiscrimination laws, which we have previously upheld against
constitutional challenge. See Roberts v. Jaycees, 468 U.S., at
628, 104 S.Ct., at 3255; Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S.
69, 78, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 2235, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984); Runyon v.
McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 176, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2597, 49 L.Ed.2d 415
(1976). Title VII, for example, makes it unlawful for an employer
to discriminate against an employee &quot;because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot; 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). In Hishon, we rejected the
argument that Title VII infringed employers' First Amendment rights.
And more recently, in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 2546, we cited Title VII (as well as 18 U.S.C. Sec.
242 and 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981 and 1982) as an example of a permissible
content-neutral regulation of conduct.
<P>
Nothing in our decision last Term in R.A.V. compels a different
result here. That case involved a First Amendment challenge to
a municipal ordinance prohibiting the use of &quot; 'fighting
words' that insult, or provoke violence, 'on the basis of race,
color, creed, religion or gender.' &quot; 505 U.S., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 2547 (quoting St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance,
St. Paul, Minn., Legis.Code Sec. 292.02 (1990)). Because the ordinance
only proscribed a class of &quot;fighting words&quot; deemed particularly
offensive by the city--i.e., those &quot;that contain ... messages
of 'bias-motivated' hatred,&quot; 505 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at *2201 2547 we held that it violated the rule against content-based
discrimination. See id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2547-2548. But
whereas the ordinance struck down in R.A.V. was explicitly directed
at expression (i.e., &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;messages,&quot;
id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2547, the statute in this case is
aimed at conduct unprotected by the First Amendment.
<P>
Moreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired
conduct because this conduct is thought to inflict greater individual
and societal harm. For example, according to the State and its
amici, bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory
crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and
incite community unrest. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 24-27;
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-15; Brief for Lawyers'
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law as Amicus Curiae 18-22; Brief
for the American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 17-19;
Brief for the Anti-Defamation League et al. as Amici Curiae 9-10;
<P>
Brief for Congressman Charles E. Schumer et al. as Amici Curiae
8-9. The State's desire to redress these perceived harms provides
an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement provision
over and above mere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases.
As Blackstone said long ago, &quot;it is but reasonable that among
crimes of different natures those should be most severely punished,
which are the most destructive of the public safety and happiness.&quot;
4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *16.
<P>
Finally, there remains to be considered Mitchell's argument that
the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because
of its &quot;chilling effect&quot; on free speech. Mitchell argues
(and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed) that the statute is &quot;overbroad&quot;
because evidence of the defendant's prior speech or associations
may be used to prove that the defendant intentionally selected
his victim on account of the victim's protected status.
<P>
Consequently, the argument goes, the statute impermissibly chills
free expression with respect to such matters by those concerned
about the possibility of enhanced sentences if they should in
the future commit a criminal offense covered by the statute. We
find no merit in this contention.
<P>
The sort of chill envisioned here is far more attenuated and unlikely
than that contemplated in traditional &quot;overbreadth&quot;
cases. We must conjure up a vision of a Wisconsin citizen suppressing
his unpopular bigoted opinions for fear that if he later commits
an offense covered by the statute, these opinions will be offered
at trial to establish that he selected his victim on account of
the victim's protected status, thus qualifying him for penalty-enhancement.
To stay within the realm of rationality, we must surely put to
one side minor misdemeanor offenses covered by the statute, such
as negligent operation of a motor vehicle (Wis.Stat. Sec. 941.01
(1989-1990)); for it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive
of a situation where such offenses would be racially motivated.
We are left, then, with the prospect of a citizen suppressing
his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of such beliefs will
be introduced against him at trial if he commits a more serious
offense against person or property. This is simply too speculative
a hypothesis to support Mitchell's overbreadth claim.
<P>
The First Amendment, moreover, does not prohibit the evidentiary
use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove
motive or intent. Evidence of a defendant's previous declarations
or statements is commonly admitted in criminal trials subject
to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability, and
the like. Nearly half a century ago, in Haupt v. United States,
330 U.S. 631, 67 S.Ct. 874, 91 L.Ed. 1145 (1947), we rejected
a contention similar to that advanced by Mitchell here. Haupt
was tried for the offense of treason, which, as defined by the
Constitution (Art. III, Sec. 3), may depend very much on proof
of motive. To prove that the acts in question were committed out
of &quot;adherence *2202. to the enemy&quot; rather than &quot;parental
solicitude,&quot; id., at 641, 67 S.Ct., at 878, the Government
introduced evidence of conversations that had taken place long
prior to the indictment, some of which consisted of statements
showing Haupt's sympathy with Germany and Hitler and hostility
towards the United States. We rejected Haupt's argument that this
evidence was improperly admitted. While &quot;[s]uch testimony
is to be scrutinized with care to be certain the statements are
not expressions of mere lawful and permissible difference of opinion
with our own government or quite proper appreciation of the land
of birth,&quot; we held that &quot;these statements ... clearly
were admissible on the question of intent and adherence to the
enemy.&quot; Id., at 642, 67 S.Ct., at 879. See also Price Waterhouse
v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 251-252, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1791-1792,
104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion) (allowing evidentiary
use of defendant's speech in evaluating Title VII discrimination
claim); Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 594, 89 S.Ct. 1354,
1366-1367, 22 L.Ed.2d 572 (1969).
<P>
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Mitchell's First Amendment
rights were not violated by the application of the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement
provision in sentencing him. The judgment of the Supreme Court
of Wisconsin is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
FN* The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court
but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience
of the reader. See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S.
321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.
<P>
FN1. At the time of Mitchell's trial, the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement
statute provided:
<P>
&quot;(1) If a person does all of the following, the penalties
for the underlying crime are increased as provided in sub. (2):
<P>
&quot;(a) Commits a crime under chs. 939 to 948.
<P>
&quot;(b) Intentionally selects the person against whom the crime
<P>
under par. (a) is committed or selects the property which is damaged
or otherwise affected by the crime under par. (a) because of the
race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national
origin or ancestry of that person or the owner or occupant of
that property.
<P>
&quot;(2)(a) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily
a misdemeanor other than a Class A misdemeanor, the revised maximum
fine is $10,000 and the revised maximum period of imprisonment
is one year in the county jail.
<P>
&quot;(b) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily
a Class A misdemeanor, the penalty increase under this section
changes the status of the crime to a felony and the revised maximum
fine is $10,000 and the revised maximum period of imprisonment
is 2 years.
<P>
&quot;(c) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is a felony, the
maximum fine prescribed by law for the crime may be increased
by not more than $5,000 and the maximum period of imprisonment
prescribed by law for the crime may be increased by not more than
5 years.
<P>
&quot;(3) This section provides for the enhancement of the penalties
applicable for the underlying crime. The court shall direct that
the trier of fact find a special verdict as to all of the issues
specified in sub. (1).
<P>
&quot;(4) This section does not apply to any crime if proof of
race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national
origin or ancestry is required for a conviction for that crime.&quot;
Wis.Stat. Sec. 939.645 (1989-1990). The statute was amended in
1992, but the amendments are not at issue in this case.
<P>
FN2. Mitchell also challenged the statute on Fourteenth Amendment
equal protection and vagueness grounds. The Wisconsin Court of
Appeals held that Mitchell waived his equal protection claim and
rejected his vagueness challenge outright. 163 Wis.2d 652, 473
N.W.2d 1 (1991). The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to address
both claims. 169 Wis.2d 153, 158, n. 2, 485 N.W.2d 807, 809, n.
2 (1992). Mitchell renews his Fourteenth Amendment claims in this
Court. But since they were not developed below and plainly fall
outside of the question on which we granted certiorari, we do
not reach them either.
<P>
FN3. Two justices dissented. They concluded that the statute punished
discriminatory acts, and not beliefs, and therefore would have
upheld it. See 169 Wis.2d at 181, 485 N.W.2d, at 819 (Abrahamson,
J.); id., at 187-195, 485 N.W.2d at 821-825 (Bablitch, J.).
<P>
FN4. Several States have enacted penalty-enhancement provisions
similar to the Wisconsin statute at issue in this case. See, e.g.,
Cal.Penal Code Ann. Sec. 422.7 (West 1988 and Supp.1993); Fla.Stat.
Sec. 775.085 (1991); Mont.Code Ann. Sec. 45-5-222 (1992); Vt.Stat.Ann.,
Tit. 13, Sec. 1455 (Supp.1992). Proposed federal legislation to
the same effect passed the House of Representatives in 1992, H.R.
4797, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992), but failed to pass the Senate,
S. 2522, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). The state high courts are
divided over the constitutionality of penalty-enhancement statutes
and analogous statutes covering bias-motivated offenses. Compare,
e.g., State v. Plowman, 314 Or. 157, 838 P.2d 558 (1992) (upholding
Oregon statute), with State v. Wyant, 64 Ohio St.3d 566, 597 N.E.2d
450 (1992) (striking down Ohio statute); 169 Wis.2d 153, 485 N.W.2d
807 (1992) (striking down Wisconsin statute). According to amici,
bias-motivated violence is on the rise throughout the United States.
See, e.g., Brief for the National Asian Pacific American Legal
Consortium et al. as Amici Curiae 5-11; Brief for the Anti-Defamation
League et al. as Amici Curiae 4-7; Brief for Atlanta et al. as
Amici Curiae 3-12. In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Statistics
Act, Pub.L. 101-275, Sec. 1(b)(1), 104 Stat. 140, codified at
28 U.S.C. Sec. 534 (note) (1988 ed., Supp. III), directing the
Attorney General to compile data &quot;about crimes that manifest
evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation,
or ethnicity.&quot; Pursuant to the Act, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation reported in January 1993, that 4,558 bias-motivated
offenses were committed in 1991, including 1,614 incidents of
intimidation, 1,301 incidents of vandalism, 796 simple assaults,
773 aggravated assaults, and 12 murders. See Brief for the Crown
Heights Coalition et al. as Amici Curiae 1A-7A.
