<i>While the Congress is primarily responsible for national domestic policy, the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces and is chiefly responsible for America's foreign policy. Next year's presidential race is therefore an important opportunity for Americans to debate the direction of America's military and our country's role in the world. In late September,</i> <b>Policy Review</b> <i>asked eight leading conservatives to define the most important defense and foreign-policy issues of the 1996 elections.</i>
<p>
<b><a name="george></a>GEORGE WEIGEL</b>
<p>	The United States has not had a foreign policy since January 20, 1993. Before then, with the exception of the Gulf War, the foreign and defense policies of the Bush administration were geared not to shaping the post-Cold War future, but to managing the Cold War's endgame. The Republican president inaugurated on January 20, 1997, will thus have an immense responsibility: creating the first post-Cold War foreign policy worthy of the name.
<p>	If the candidates in the 1996 GOP presidential primaries could forge agreement on the following six points, presidential leadership in 1997 and beyond will prove much easier:
<p><ol>

	<li>The United States needs a foreign policy. With the end of the Cold War, time, energy, and resources can and must be directed toward reconstructing civil society in America. But disengagement is not an option for the world's leading democracy and leading military power. The proliferation of ballistic-missile technology and weapons of mass destruction, hostile ideologies, and international terrorism place America always at risk. The risks are manageable, but not unless they are acknowledged and dealt with.<p>
<li>The completion and preservation of freedom's victory in the Cold War requires the expansion of NATO before the end of the century. Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia should be admitted as full members, and Ukraine and the Baltic states engaged in some form of associate membership en route to full participation. As even Strobe Talbott now concedes, NATO expansion is a mortal threat neither to Russia nor to the evolution of Russian democracy. An appropriate security relationship can be defined between the new NATO and the Russian Federation while the former democracy evolves. If the history of Europe in the 20th century teaches us anything, it is that an ounce of preventive diplomacy and collective security is worth a ton of terrible cure.
<P>

<li>Preventing the spread of ballistic-missile technology and weapons of mass destruction ought to be one of the highest priorities of U.S. national-security policy. This means clamping down on regimes that import or export such weapons, as well as improving counter-terrorist measures. The new president should confer quietly with Congress and America's principal allies on the conditions under which preemptive military action will be used to counter weapons proliferation against rogue states or terrorist organizations. The president should appoint a national coordinator of counter-terrorism, and he should instruct the relevant intelligence agencies and the FBI that a coordinated counter-terrorism program is essential to national security and that institutional roadblocks put in its way will be swiftly removed. <p>
<li>The essential technological complement to an assertive policy of nonproliferation and counter-terrorism is missile defense. It is criminally irresponsible to deny the American people and America's allies the benefits of missile-defense systems just because of Cold War shibboleths. Early in his term, the new president, in consultation with the Congress, should announce America's withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, while pledging to share appropriate defense technologies with its allies.
<p><li>For tens of millions of people around the world, the United States remains a beacon of freedom. U.S. human-rights policy must be reinvigorated, stressing the universality of such basic human rights as religious freedom, free speech, freedom of association, and freedom of the press. The United States should rebut the argument that these rights are "culturally conditioned," while making vigorous use of instruments like the National Endowment for Democracy to support proponents of freedom living in totalitarian and authoritarian societies. We should place special emphasis on aid to the democratic opposition in China and Cuba.
<p><li>On its 50th anniversary, the United Nations is in desperate straits. It has demonstrated its ineptitude at "peacekeeping" in Bosnia, its functional agencies (like the World Health Organization) are awash in corruption, and the "soft" side of the U.N. has become a hotbed of internationalized libertinism, as demonstrated by the 1994 (anti-) population conference in Cairo and the 1995 Beijing conference on women. The next administration should reform the U.N. and its functional agencies, while shunning wastes of time and energy like the Cairo and Beijing conferences and the 1995 Copenhagen "Social Summit." If, by the year 2000, the U.N. has not been dramatically cleaned up and slimmed down, another Republican administration should seriously consider withdrawing from an institution that, at present, hinders the pursuit of the very ends it was intended to serve.

<p>Any candidate worthy of consideration should begin by understanding and expressing that the peace and prosperity we enjoy were dearly bought with the blood of Americans on countless battlefields the world over. No nation has given more selflessly to the cause of liberty; no nation has ever had a people wiser in distinguishing among the nations of the world our natural friends, our inevitable enemies, and the barbarians to be left alone. Thanks to the sacrifices of American people, we can say today, as Abraham Lincoln said a century and a half ago, that "all the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined with all the treasure of the earth, our own excepted, could not by force make a track on the Blue Ridge or take a drink from the Ohio in a trial of a thousand years."
<p>	So, candidates, begin with pride in your country and gratitude to its people. We are a great country and deserve a prominent place in world affairs. We must never diminish our strength and purpose, since as Charles de Gaulle used to jest, the future lasts a long time. Serious threats will surely arise; whether they prove deadly will depend on us. Americans can be defeated or our interests thwarted only if we lose our moral virtues, make foolish moves in the world, and neglect our military power. No government has ever matched the Clinton administration in these failings.
<p>	America's only glaring weakness over the past half-century has been leadership sometimes unworthy of the American people. The nation's "leadership class" -- high officials, professors, and heads of big corporations -- has committed America's youth, blood, and credit to wars it did not intend to win. Communism was here to stay, they thought, and even Republican stars such as Henry Kissinger counseled accommodation with it. They dreamed not of freedom's triumph but of convergence and accommodation to tyranny. They dreamed up the idiocy that America's safety depends on continued vulnerability to missile attack, a doctrine that still prevails in Washington. These opportunities to equivocate will come again.
<p>	Since President Bush's time, this leadership class has decided that political and military history has ended and that our real enemies are the French and Japanese who sell us cheese and cars at good prices.
<p>	First observation: Foreign policy does not exist in a vacuum; it must have military capability to protect and project it. Diplomacy without power is a prayer -- not to God, but to one's adversary, and its fulfillment depends on the mood and whim of the party prayed to. No nation can devise a military posture until it has defined its purpose through national interest. America, therefore, needs a new doctrine to replace Monroe and containment.
<p>Such a doctrine must acknowledge that America has legitimate interests. First is the defense of the homeland. 
<p>	Second, our economy depends on trade. We need access to our trading partners.
<p>	Third, we are a nation that values travel—for trade, scholarship, science, and pleasure. Americans abroad must have a nation behind them.
<p>	Lastly, America's interest in regional stability cannot be ignored. If America's presence and purpose in the world can be doubted, if we tolerate vacuums of power, they will be filled by others, and ultimately American blood will be spilled. In the past century, we have been called upon time and again to secure peace and liberty after our leaders thought the world no longer needed us.
<p>	Along with the doctrine we need common sense -- in both diplomacy and military policy. This means not squandering American generosity in petty ventures cooked up by the U.N.'s petty bureaucrats. While our leaders downsize the U.S. military and tergiversate with our commitments to traditional allies in Europe and the Pacific Rim, the future and vitality of those regions is being shaped by petty tyrants whose only asset is the willingness to make war. The administration treats military matters as a spectator sport. The foreign-policy establishment calls Americans' objections to such leadership by turns warmongering and isolationism. Our candidates should recognize these objections as wisdom.
<p>	Collective response is a contemporary stupidity. The U.N. cannot respond, nor can Europe nor NATO nor the Pacific nations, unless one of them is both willing and able to respond alone. Joiners follow leaders, but when joiners have no leaders, they have conferences.
<p>	As for Bosnia, the president and the supreme Allied commander in Europe should tell our allies to join us in giving Serbia an ultimatum to stop the Balkan war or else face a united declaration of war by NATO's 15 nations. Otherwise, America should quit NATO, lift the embargo, and arm the Bosnians. The continuing policy vacuum has sapped America's prestige abroad and fostered European excuses for death, destruction, and "ethnic cleansing" in their own backyard.
<p>	Lastly, America needs missile defenses. There can be no further excuses for inaction. Even Democrats say that nothing so threatens regions and continents as the proliferation of nuclear weapons. To the nuclear threat, we can now add chemical and biological weapons. The Clinton idiocy is to make us all equally vulnerable. America has the technology to protect Americans and American allies from missiles. What possible excuse can be offered for failure to act? Why should Americans or their allies be threatened and blackmailed because our leaders are hooked on treaties and invalid concepts further outmoded by recent events?
<p>	Respect for Americans, pride in our selfless achievements in this dark century, and confidence in our future are the basis of military and foreign policy. These Americans are a wise and brave lot, and they deserve both common sense and courage from their leaders.

<p>	In a time of great uncertainty about America's role in the world, it is not the details of America's foreign policy that trouble her citizens so much as the sense that the man in the White House doesn't know what he's doing. Republican candidates will be tempted to dwell on the Clinton administration's specific foreign-policy blunders. Some of this will, of course, be necessary and valuable. But the American people will not and should not be satisfied solely with an indictment of the president's actions. 
<p>	Clinton's main problem as commander in chief is that, like many American liberals, he is uncomfortable with America's power. This makes him uncertain about how to use it. And this uncertainty is the source of the administration's misguided foreign and defense policies. The 1996 election is a superb opportunity to craft an alternative vision of presidential leadership. Articulating this vision, rather than promising a specific blueprint, should be the focus of the presidential campaign.
<p>By seeking the U.N.'s blessing on the American-led operation in the Persian Gulf War, where U.S. interests were clearly at stake, President Bush showed that Washington was uncertain about its newly acquired status as sole superpower. Over the past three years, the Clinton administration has taken this precedent to extremes. It has subjected U.S. and NATO actions in Bosnia to U.N. approval, even where those actions directly risked the lives of troops from our major NATO allies. It has accommodated U.N.-instigated "nation-building" in Somalia, going well beyond the Bush administration's original humanitarian objectives. In an astounding abandonment of American prerogatives, Clinton sought U.N. approval of the occupation of Haiti last fall, but sought no such approval from Congress. 
<p>	Many Americans have passively accepted the notion, implicit in Clinton's approach, that actions taken in the name of the U.N. are morally purer than actions taken or led by the United States. A look at the source of U.N. power reveals the emptiness of this point of view. 
<p.	Whereas American decisions are shaped by Virginians, Texans, Rhode Islanders, and the free citizens of 47 other states, a majority of the nations represented at the U.N. have political and social structures that are, to one degree or another, undemocratic. Many have governments that abuse their citizens and threaten other nations. None of the representatives at the U.N., including our own, is freely elected. 
<p>	Presidential candidates need to articulate the argument in a straightforward way: American power is the greatest force for good in the material world, and that power is derived from our Constitution, not from the U.N. Charter. How can the decisions of the United Nations have greater moral authority than those taken by the U.S. Congress which, despite its flaws, embodies the most representative and accountable political system in the world? No president should feel guilty for using wisely American power derived from our constitutional system. 
<p>	As they make this argument, candidates must brace themselves for the inevitable charge of "isolationism." The use of this term, now being leveled against the administration's congressional critics, is meant to conjure up frightening images of the 1930s and the unchallenged rise of fascism. It fits neatly with the liberal view of the world, which sees our commitment to world leadership and our participation in the United Nations as one and the same. Much like the domestic debate over welfare, this worldview also equates our "compassion" for developing nations to the amount of foreign aid money we give away. 
<p>	The candidates must explain, in positive terms, America's deep involvement in world affairs, and how this has very little to do with either the United Nations or our foreign-aid program. The combined dollar value of our foreign-aid budget and our contribution to the U.N. amounts to a tiny fraction of our private-sector trade. And we should not forget that much of our $270 billion military budget goes to keep the peace around the world, which is in everyone's interest. 
<p>In a very imperfect world, our military and economic power is derived from the fairest, most humane system of government ever devised. This should be a source of tremendous confidence for a president, not confusion and embarrassment.
<p>As a trading partner, a military ally, and a beacon of democracy, the United States has a huge stake in world affairs. The successful candidate should affirm these roles and dispute any suggestion that our internationalism should be measured by the degree of our subservience to U.N. policies.

<p>Foreign policy without armed force is like sheet music without the orchestra. We must be concerned about the Big Questions, but we must not neglect what has been happening to the "orchestra." 
<p>General George C. Marshall once said, "The soldier's heart, the soldier's spirit, the soldier's soul are everything. Unless the soldier's soul sustains him, he cannot be relied on and will fail himself and his country in the end." Marshall understood the decisive military importance of the intangible moral factors. No doubt he knew Napoleon's dictum that "in warfare, the moral is to the material as three is to one." 
<p>	The Clinton administration appears bent on crippling the military's moral powers as well as its material strength. Though it's uncomfortable, Americans must face the fact that revolutionary social policies are undermining the cohesion and combat effectiveness of the forces. Political correctness is replacing military character.
<p>	Most uniformed people agree, but dare not say it openly. Thus the problem of women in combat roles or homosexuals in the ranks is compounded by an institutionalized lie necessary to inject social deconstruction into an unwilling organism. And it leaches away the ethic of honor and integrity that are the heart of an effective military. Junior ranks see their seniors denying what everybody knows and forcing others to lie. They see careers of fine officers ruined because they will not genuflect to falsehood. They see flag officers putting self-interest above the welfare of their people. The moral damage is potentially disastrous.
<p>	Since a soldier must be "obedient unto death," sending him into battle is a moral transaction. He must be certain his life will not be wasted because of moral blindness or character defects in his commander. If his leaders are contemptuous of his sacrifice -- as was the British commander who reportedly remarked in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign in 1915, "Casualties? What do I care about casualties?" -- it breaks the vital link that enables him to do the bloody, terrifying work of grappling with and killing the enemy.
<p>	But mutual trust does not happen overnight. It takes attention and commitment. Commissioned and non-commissioned officers have to set good examples, displaying truthfulness and integrity as well as military competence. Any policy that undermines this process hurts national defense as surely as cutting the budget or canceling vital weapons programs. 
<p>	Liberals have a teleological compulsion to remake every institution in their own image, and politicize everything they touch. They love to get their hands on the military, largely because it is a command institution and can be reshaped with relative ease from the top down (just as the Left, which is antidemocratic despite its sanctimonious posturing, would like to do to our entire society). 
<p>	To be sure, most military men still cling to the martial virtues, the very antithesis of liberal enlightenment. The military may yet manage to remain resistant to alien transformation. But it may still be forced to undertake more "acceptable" missions, like nation-building and peacekeeping, even though the operations in Somalia and Haiti got men killed, hurt morale, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, without benefiting any vital national interest. Liberals hope thereby to drain away the ethos of the warrior and replace it with the ethos of the global welfare caseworker.
<p>	Social policy and defense policy intersect at this issue. It could unite conservatives concerned about national security with those worried about the moral health of the nation. But strangely, Republican presidential candidates haven't focused on it. They are missing a good bet. In 1993, Clinton's decision to open the services to homosexuals generated an unprecedented outpouring of opposition. That deep reservoir of concern about the welfare of the armed forces is still there, waiting to be tapped. 
<p>	Perhaps it is hard to believe that the force that triumphed so magnificently in the Persian Gulf War could ever lose its soul. After all, that extraordinary victory was due as much to superior motivation, morale, leadership, and training as it was to technological superiority. Nevertheless, we cannot afford to take these qualities for granted, for they require constant cultivation. Throughout history, complacency has always been the forerunner of military disaster. Because it occurs outside the material domain, damage to the military spirit can't be quantified. It is subtle, insidious, and generally not noticed until it is revealed in the unforgiving crucible of combat.
<p>	Every candidate who wants to become commander in chief had better make sure he will have reliable forces to carry out the nation's foreign policy and defend our vital interests. Otherwise he may one day find this now unmatched military instrument crumbling in his hands just when it is needed most.

<p>	In July 1992, members of the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces visited the carrier U.S.S. John F. Kennedy, to hear what Navy men thought about the question of women in combat. In anticipation of the two-day field trip, the Kennedy's commanding officer recorded a videotape encouraging all crew members to express their opinions freely -- whether in favor or opposed --provided they were prepared to explain their rationale.
<p>	Since that time, a great deal has changed. Almost nothing remains of the laws and rules exempting women from service in or near the front lines, and candor about the consequences of unprecedented policy changes now in progress can end a military career.
<p>	The armed forces have become a prime venue for social experimentation because those most directly affected must follow orders, without visible dissent. Navy Secretary John Dalton's new policy regarding pregnant women on combat ships, for example, forbids "adverse comments" about deployability problems resulting from absences due to pregnancy.
<p>	At a time when international commitments are growing, defense budgets are shrinking, and the armed forces are carrying a heavy burden of social and cultural change, the next president must insist on complete information and objective evaluations throughout the chain of command. He must also be willing to reverse experimental policies that detract from morale, discipline, unit strength, and overall readiness.
<p>	A pro-defense administration should begin with sound priorities. Contrary to the notion that the volunteer force exists to provide job opportunities, the next president must recognize that the armed forces exist to defend the country, and the needs of the military must come first.
<p>	Technology and hardware are important, but money alone cannot buy a strong national defense. Wars are deterred, or fought, not by computers and weapons, but by people -- young men and women who volunteer to defend their country in a still-dangerous world, despite countless sacrifices and personal risk. To improve the recruitment and retention of qualified troops, we must avoid anything that makes military life more difficult or dangerous.
<p>	Current policies placing women in or near close combat units must be reevaluated -- not in terms of career opportunities, but in terms of military strength and readiness. Lives must not be sacrificed, nor missions undermined, because of front-line soldiers who are less strong, less deployable, and more vulnerable to wartime violence and capture. The definition of the word "qualified," as in "qualified to do the job," must not become flexible and therefore meaningless for the sake of women or any other favored group.
<p>	Affirmative-action quotas that subvert high training standards historically based on merit and wartime requirements should be ended by executive order. In the tradition of Harry Truman, who promoted social change by ending racial segregation in the armed forces, the next president should insist on policies that judge people as individuals, not as members of groups.
<p>	The next president must seek a more sensible balancebetween the interests of parents, field commanders, and children who stand to lose the most when their mothers are sent to fight a war. Overly generous pregnancy benefits offered without regard to marital status, for example, degrade cultural values while escalating family stress, child-care costs, and non-deployability numbers. Disciplinary problems must be addressed as well, since human emotions do not always respond to military orders.
<p>The Clinton administration has persisted in promoting homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle, despite the law passed in 1993 intended to exclude homosexuals from the military. The next president should deny the gay agenda, which has gained significant ground in all branches of government, including the uniformed services.
<p>	Ronald Reagan, who enlisted but did not serve in the front lines, demonstrated that a pro-defense presidency does not depend on military background alone. In the tradition of Ronald Reagan, the next commander in chief must convey a deep respect for military values, and be willing to defend the interests of the troops against civilian activists with different agendas.
<p>	Clinton has tried to convey respect for the military by using soldiers, sailors, and aviators as backdrops for "photo ops." The next commander in chief must earn the respect of the troops by standing on principle, not public relations.

	The three most important foreign-policy and defense issues of the 1996 elections are America's vulnerability to nuclear missiles, foreign aid, and the extent of America's international engagement, including the use of force overseas.
<p>	    In a post-Cold War world, a nuclear attack against American territory poses the single gravest security challenge. Despite several strategic-arms control agreements signed over the last decade, Russia retains a large nuclear arsenal. China is also modernizing its nuclear forces. A number of other countries are aggressively developing small, but potent, nuclear forces.
<p>   America's failure to deploy ballistic-missile defenses doesn't just perpetuate our national vulnerability. It also greatly weakens our diplomatic prowess. Imagine how different the outcome of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait might have been if, just as the Bush administration was contemplating its options, Saddam Hussein had informed the world that he had already built a dozen or so nuclear-tipped ICBMs.
<p>	Contrary to the musings of traditional arms-control theorists, American ballistic-missile defense deployments are likely to discourage other countries from embarking on the path of nuclear proliferation. I suggest that the candidate inform the American public about our vulnerability to nuclear attack and explain the imperative, including costs, of appropriate solutions. I propose a measured missile-defense program that deploys "brilliant pebbles"-like weapons as its first phase.
<p>	The popularity of foreign aid with the American people has reached a nadir. Americans complain, correctly, that significant amounts of U.S. aid have been misdirected, and many object to providing any foreign assistance when we have urgent domestic problems. But foreign aid, if it advances specific U.S. national interests, can be a useful foreign policy investment. I recommend that the presidential candidate begin a candid dialogue with the American people about the merits of a judicious foreign-aid program. While streamilining our foreign aid delivery by merging AID into the state department and eliminating wasteful social and developmental programs, I would show how it serves America's interest to use foreign aid to promote democracy and free markets in other countries. Furthermore, U.S. aid should be provided directly to its intended recipients rather than funneled through international institutions.
<p>	Finally, the use of American troops in such places as Somalia and Haiti and the speculation that American ground forces may be sent into combat in the former Yugoslavia have reintensified the long-standing debate about the proper scope of America's international engagement and the role of force in support of our national interests.
<p>	Presented with these realities, I suggest reestablishing the basic public consensus on this critical national-security issue. The American people need to understand that we must remain a key international player and that our troops should be deployed for combat overseas only when vital American interests are at stake. Once deployed, our troops should be given all the resources they need to prevail in combat quickly and decisively. Nothing would be more harmful than the specter of American forces suffering casualties because they either lacked heavy armor (as in Mogadishu), could not engage in an air-defense suppression (as in Bosnia), or were commanded by bungling U.N. officials.

<p>
	There are two foreign and military policy issues that seem to me of greatest significance during the forthcoming campaign.
<p>	The first issue is missile defense. The spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology can be slowed but not avoided, for primitive versions of the bomb and of delivery systems are, after all, 50-year-old technology. The bizarre theory of mutual assured destruction and the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty keep us defenseless against all logic, and the time has come to replace them with a policy of defending the country. The more plainly candidates speak about this, the more public support there will be.
<P>	The second issue is intervention: When do we risk the lives of our soldiers in crises overseas? This is obviously a complex issue and, with the Cold War over, many Americans (including some candidates) will be tempted to answer: "Never." I would like to see a candidate address this issue in more or less the following manner:<p><blockquote>
	"During the Cold War, we had to lead a coalition of nations against the twin threats of communism and Soviet power. We rose to that struggle and won it, and our victory saved our own freedom was well as the freedom of hundreds of millions of others.<p>
	"Now that it is over, we can do less and spend less overseas. There are places on the globe that simply don't matter enough to demand American involvement. But just as we had interests to defend before there was a Cold War, and just as there were threats to us before then, the same is true now.
<p>	"Some of these interests are very old: The first American statesmen saw what we had at stake in Mexico and the Caribbean; today, drug and migration flows are still major issues. Some interests are new: The spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology now gives small nations and terrorist groups the ability to strike at America. But it is clear that a world in which every petty tyrant is armed to the teeth, and our foreign markets are in turmoil, and our own region is plagued by instability, will not be a very good gift to our children. America still has an irreplaceable role if the world is to be a less dangerous place.
<p>	"Why us? Because our wealth, power, and freedom grant us the leadership of the world's democracies. It is true that our power provides a continual temptation to meddle in situations where our interests do not require us to jump in, and one test of a president is to keep his cool and stay out of those.
<p>	"But if we are to keep the world moving toward freedom, and protect our freedom, safety, and prosperity, we cannot act as if we lived on some other planet. Another test of a president is to know when our interests really are at risk today, and the toughest test is to understand when they will be at risk tomorrow if we don't act now. We can pass those tests or fail them, but we cannot avoid them."</blockquote><p>

<p>	The overriding foreign-policy issue in the coming presidential campaign is the loss of the strong place America held in 1991—the year of victory in the Persian Gulf War and the formal disintegration of the Soviet Union -- and the nation's progressive weakness in international affairs. Do the American people approve of this direction?<p>
	Presidential candidates would be wise to reject the conventional wisdom that Americans are uninterested in foreign policy, that their desire to address serious domestic problems comes at the expense of concerns about U.S. influence abroad. Voter confusion is understandable, since no national political leader has explained why Americans should be interested. The task of a challenger is to show plainly what a world bereft of American leadership looks like. This should be at the heart of any conservative presidential candidate's foreign-policy position.<p>
	At risk in Bosnia is America's historical commitment to the principle that employing force to seize another country is unacceptable. The current administration has effectively given the U.N. secretary-general veto power over the use of our forces in the Balkans. This failure has neutered U.S. policy there and promises to cripple it in the future.
<p>	Up to now, American weakness in Bosnia -- as evidenced by years of inaction, and demonstrably poor military advice -- 0has encouraged only one leader (Jacques Chirac of democratic France) to fill the void. But if this administration's incomprehensible Bosnia policy continues, it will eventually embolden some dangerous challenger armed with nuclear weapons. The conflict in the former Yugoslavia could also spread throughout the Balkans and beyond. Presidential candidates should remind voters of this century's brutal history and of America's immediate economic and security interest in maintaining a peaceful, prosperous Europe.
<p>	To underline the character of excessive multilateralism, the eventual challenger to Clinton in 1996 should use in a political advertisement the videotape of the U.N. spokesman Ahmad Fawzi's press announcement on July 26. That's when he declared that "the secretary-general has decided to delegate the necessary authority [to conduct air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions] to commanders in the field." Insofar as Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali really holds the power to decide when American commanders may or may not use force, the challenger should make the current administration's responsibility for this plain. Voters will not be pleased.
<p>	America's gyrating policies in Asia for the past three years undermine this nation's general commitment to free trade, as well as its specific commercial and security ties to Japan and the future of its relationship with China. Asia has the fastest-growing economies in the world, and American exports there support more than three million jobs. Blown by domestic political winds, the current administration's policies in Asia have touched every point on the compass. Going to the brink of a trade war with Japan is, politically, perhaps unassailable. But if Japan is true to form, there will be no significant increases in imports of American auto parts by this time next year. 
<p>	The challenger should exploit this fact. He should call attention to the inconsistency between the administration's support for NAFTA and GATT, and its managed-trade policy towards Japan. He should also note that Japan is slowly becoming more democratic by itself, and that U.S. pressure for managed trade thwarts this evolution.
<p>	Finally, the candidate should demonstrate that he will take his responsibility as commander in chief seriously. A missile defense is only one thing that this administration is ignoring in order to keep the military as ready as it needed to be during the Cold War. America now has within its technological grasp the ability simultaneously to reduce defense spending and construct a military that can move swiftly to any part of the world, and from a safe distance wield decisive conventional power. This is the kind of force that we should be building, not a smaller version of the Cold War model. To achieve this, the defense department must shrink the huge and ungainly central bureaucracy it has developed over the years. The candidate will be on firm ground in arguing that the sound political principle of decentralization and returning authority to the states should apply equally to the wise management of the nation's defenses.
<p>	It has been years since a presidential candidate said anything about defense except that there should be more of it, or less of it. The candidate who breaks this pattern next year will add to his qualification as prospective commander in chief, and perform for the defense department a vital task that it may not be able to accomplish on its own.

<title>Missing: $13.5 Billion -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<center><h3><i>Missing: $13.5 Billion</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 30, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) wins my annual award for the most outrageous example of government bungling. If this isn't an example of why government should be entrusted with as little responsibility as possible, I don't know what is.
<p>
	A recently completed Inspector General's (IG) audit found that the department's Food and Consumer Services (FCS) division -- which is responsible for the school lunch and food stamp programs -- could not document what it did with $13.5 billion of the $36.7 billion it spent in 1994. That's right: 34 percent of what it spent was unaccounted for! Talk about waste, fraud and abuse!
<p>
	The auditors reported that at one point, when figures from the Treasury Department -- which writes the government's checks -- didn't match its own, FCS just "fudged" the numbers and forced a match. According to the IG, the employees made no effort to figure out why the discrepancies existed or what was done with the unaccounted-for money. In the private sector, this is called "fraud." 
<p>
	Even big-government liberals like Vice President Al Gore now agree that government is rife with waste and foolishness. For a good laugh -- rather, a good cry -- just read Gore's <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/npr/nptoc.html">"National Performance Review."</a> As I noted, the Agriculture Department is responsible for running two very costly and politically charged programs: school lunches and food stamps. These programs affect millions of American families and suck up billions of your tax dollars every year. And the bureaucrats responsible for running the programs don't even know where your money went!

<p>	Of course, the USDA bureaucrats have an excuse. They complain about a recent switch to a new automated bookkeeping system. In other words, everything was humming along just fine until somebody tried to make things work more efficiently.
<p>	Come on. Either Agriculture Department managers are incompetent and need to be replaced or the welfare state has grown so large that nobody can keep track of where our money is going.
<p>	
The so-called "War on Poverty" -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, subsidized school lunches, etc. -- has cost American taxpayers $5.4 trillion over the past 30 years. There really aren't enough "good intentions" in the world to justify spending that much money with basically no result. The percentage of Americans living in poverty is still around the same level it was in 1965, when the spending spree began. When something doesn't work, it should be fixed. Or gotten rid of.
<p>	Of course, conservatives like me are demonized when we suggest that the welfare state  undermines personal responsibility. Now, along comes this audit to suggest that welfare also affects the responsibility of the people running the system.
<p>
	Think about it. Wouldn't you get a little jaded about accountability after years of passing out billions of dollars for a system that doesn't work -- and the more it is seen as a failure, the more money you are given to pass out?
<p>
	It is probably a pretty safe bet that this particular agency is not unusual, that similar outrages would be found if the rest of the welfare system were audited.
<P>
	In fact, the auditors in this case had to give up before finishing because the bookkeeping was so sloppy. "We discontinued our review because we did not believe that we could complete our sample in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost," they said.
<P>
	At least someone was thinking of who was picking up the tab.

<h2>WHY "KING COTTON" IS TRASHING FARM REFORM</h2>
By John Frydenlund<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
9/21/95
<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
	While most folks in Washington fled the summer heat and humidity for the August recess,  a little-known special interest stayed behind to plot strategy. And so far it's working like gangbusters.
<p>	The National Cotton Council of America lobbies on behalf of cotton producers, ginners, warehousemen, merchants, crushers, cooperatives and manufacturers. During the recess, "King Cotton" declared war on Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture. And last week, it paid off.
<p>	The Council's efforts were instrumental in defeating in committee Roberts' attempt to end 60 years of failed New Deal agriculture policies. His farm-reform bill, the "Freedom to Farm Act of 1995," would have ended a special deal cotton producers enjoy. By allowing them to receive federal crop-support payments as three separate entities -- as individuals, corporations and partnerships, for example -- a mile-wide loophole in the current farm program lets cotton producers pull down two-and-a-half times the national average per-capita income. 
<p>	Roberts' plan was simple: Get the U.S. Department of Agriculture out of the business of deciding what farmers grow on their farms, and instead let individual farmers decide what they want to plant based on what they think they can grow profitably for markets around the world. The bill also would have eliminated the various government-reserve programs that encourage farmers to idle potentially productive farm land.
<P>	Of course, since the Roberts bill would have cut off the money spigot for the Cotton Council, an army of lobbyists descended on the capitol. The Council insisted that nothing less than keeping the status quo was "acceptable." In a recent "Action Request," the Council urged its members to tell their congressmen that Roberts' bill "abandons U.S. agriculture, will depress land values and will discourage new investment."
<p>	In fact, the American Farm Bureau Federation estimates farmers would have actually gained more than $7 billion extra over seven years as a result of the Roberts bill than they would under the current farm program. This is because the Roberts plan would have provided generous transition payments to help farmers switch from the current system to a free market, and because of  increased sales as farmers were freed from federal limits on how much they can plant.
<p>	Of course, the battle isn't over -- the House Budget Committee may take up farm reform next. It's members should be interested in a report released earlier this year by the General Accounting Office (GAO), which characterized the cotton program as a costly, complex maze of domestic and international price supports that benefit a small group of wealthy cotton producers. Cost to the taxpayers: more than $12 billion since 1986.
<p>	A privileged 300 cotton producers received between $250,000 and $1 million apiece in taxpayer dollars in 1993, and about 2,000 got between $100,000 and $250,000, thanks to the cotton loophole, according to GAO. The rest of the cotton industry's 95,000 participants have little to show from this sweetheart deal with Washington.
<p>	In fact, if the majority of America's cotton farmers knew the truth, they would be outraged. It so happens that of the 35 board members who attended the Council's June meeting in Charlotte, N.C. --  the group pushing hardest for the status quo -- only five actually were cotton farmers. The rest were ginners, warehousemen, merchants, crushers, heads of cooperatives, and manufacturers. In other words, 86 percent of the Cotton Council's top leaders don't even grow cotton. The processors and marketers who fill the majority of the board's seats want to keep nearly $1 billion in payments the Roberts bill would give to actual cotton growers to help them transition to a free market.<p>
	A simple question needs to be asked: Why does the government even have a price-support program for cotton at all? The argument typically put forward for having agricultural price-support programs is so that America will have "a stable food supply." But cotton isn't food. Besides, worldwide demand for cotton is at record levels. Cotton prices are higher than they have been at any time since the Civil War. 
<p>	Like so many government programs, the cotton subsidy, originally intended to help small farmers, has turned into another special-interest boondoggle. Pat Roberts took a courageous stand against corporate special interests who have wrapped themselves over the years in federal largesse, and lost. 
<p>	Now the House Republican leadership should give the Budget Committee a shot at deciding whether American farmers will be set free to compete in world markets, or stay chained to the special interests.

<TITLE>Freeing U.S. Agriculture to Take Advantage of the New Global Market -- Heritage </TITLE>

<P>
INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Congress is expected soon to consider legislation to implement
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the multilateral trade talks concluded successfully last
December. Among other provisions, the new pact for the first time
subjects trade in farm products to GATT's international trading rules.
(For a full discussion of the provisions of the Agriculture Agreement,
see Joe Cobb, "A Guide to the New GATT Agreement," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 985, May 5, 1994.) 
<P>
     This means that U.S. farmers will face substantially lower trade
barriers when trying to export their products. Under the agreement,
the signatories agreed that all existing non-tariff barriers
(including import quotas) must be converted to tariffs, and every
agricultural product must be allowed at least some minimum level of
access to their domestic markets under low or minimal tariff rates.
Countries that export farm products will be required to reduce the
volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent and the amount of the
subsidy by 36 percent over six years. The agreement also calls for
reduction of all domestic agricultural subsidies (such as U.S. farm
subsidies) tied to production of commodities and significant reduction
of all existing direct agricultural export subsidies. (Specific
changes in U.S. law required by the GATT agreement will have to be
made in the implementing legislation. Section 22 of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act, which provides authority to impose quotas if imports
are undercutting price support programs, will be repealed and replaced
with authority for tariff rate quotas. The implementing legislation
similarly curtails restrictions on imported peanuts, in addition to
limiting subsidized exports of government-held dairy stocks and
repealing the Meat Import Act.)
<P>
     Along with the new regional market opened up by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the prospect of expanding
free trade arrangements involving the United States, (See Michael G.
Wilson, "Building on the NAFTA: Forging a Free Trade Agreement with
Chile," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 991, June 27, 1994.)
ratification of GATT will open up a potential marketplace of six
billion customers for U.S. farmers -- compared with the U.S. domestic
market of only 250 million people. 
<P>
     The ability of American farmers to seize the opportunity provided
by this vast new market, however, will depend upon changes in U.S.
farm policy. America possesses the most productive land resources and
advanced agricultural infrastructure in the world, yet U.S. farmers
have been unable to capitalize on these advantages. Even though world
consumption of food and agricultural products has increased
substantially since 1981, U.S. agricultural exports have decreased
overall, and exports of unprocessed agricultural commodities have
fallen (see chart on page 3).
<P>
     One obstacle that must be removed if U.S. farmers are to take
advantage of GATT is supply-control policies, specifically the annual
acreage reduction programs (ARPs) and the Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP). These programs have removed on average over 15 percent of U.S.
acreage from production annually and thus limited the opportunity of
farmers to export. To appreciate what this means, it is as though
government policies had shut down 15 percent of the U.S. computer
industry while the international market for computers is booming.
Meanwhile, agricultural producers in the rest of the world have
increased their production to fill the void created by reduced U.S.
production. These foreign producers have sold their products at a
lower price, thereby making the United States the "residual supplier,"
or the last seller to be chosen in most markets.
<P>
     Another obstacle that stands in the way of farmers taking
advantage of GATT is the Export Enhancement Program (EEP), which
subsidizes the dumping of U.S. agricultural products on the world
market. Although EEP was intended to make U.S. farm products more
competitive, the program is counterproductive. In fact, U.S. export
subsidies depress world prices while domestic prices remain high,
creating a price differential that has made the United States an
importer of some agricultural products. (This was demonstrated earlier
this year when U.S. supply control programs contributed to a short
supply of durum wheat -- a specialty crop used in making pasta
products -- leading to increased imports of Canadian wheat in order to
supply U.S. pastamakers.)
<P>
     The United States has an opportunity to reverse these policies
and restore the competitive position of American agriculture when
Congress considers the 1995 farm bill. Because farm policy is
reauthorized only every four or five years in the farm bill, next
year's bill will be the first opportunity to revise these policies to
take advantage of GATT.
<P>
     For U.S. farmers to benefit from the world market opened up by
GATT, Congress needs to incorporate the following changes in farm
legislation: (Additional changes needed in U.S. agricultural policy
will be addressed in future papers.)
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction or set-aside programs.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program to include only highly
erodible acres.
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program.
<P>
     The U.S. policy of unilaterally idling massive land resources
already has led to a significant loss in America's share of the
expanding world market. This has shrunk farmers' ability to earn
income from the marketplace, held back the development of agribusiness
infrastructure, and caused economic problems for many rural areas. By
eliminating acreage reduction programs and modifying the Conservation
Reserve Program, Congress could make sure that U.S. agriculture once
again becomes the leading force in the world export market by enabling
U.S. farmers to take advantage of the promised benefits of GATT's
trade liberalization and reform. And by eliminating the Export
Enhancement Program, the U.S. will no longer be employing a trade-
distorting practice that actually undermines the potential of certain
export markets.
<P>
     The enormous export potential of American agriculture has been
held back for years by federal policies that largely ignore the huge
world market. GATT makes that world market potentially even larger and
attractive to U.S. farmers. If the 1995 farm bill revamps policies so
that farmers can make full use of agriculture's productive capacity to
compete in the world's market, U.S. farm income will increase and the
rural economy will receive an enormous boost, creating jobs, producing
greater prosperity, and reinvigorating distressed communities. But if
the farm programs are not revised, rural America will stagnate while
other countries exploit the new markets opened up by GATT.
<P>
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. AGRICULTURE
<P>
     Implementing GATT will mark the beginning of a new era for world
agriculture and agricultural trade. Before the diplomatic breakthrough
which made the GATT agricultural agreement possible, trade
protectionism in agriculture was practiced throughout the world,
especially by such developed countries as the United States and the
nations of the European Union.
<P>
     This protectionism has not helped domestic producers, even in
developed countries. Explicit import restrictions, including quotas
and tariffs, and non-tariff trade barriers, such as unwarranted food
safety and quality regulations, merely have hindered the ability of
developing countries to penetrate the developed countries' markets. At
the same time, the United States and the European Union have been
waging a mutually destructive and trade-distorting bidding war, using
export subsidies to finance underpriced sales into the developing
countries. The costs of such distortions to agricultural production
and trade have been rising steadily while U.S. market share has
declined, as demonstrated in the chart on the preceeding page. The
GATT Uruguay Round agreement is significant because it reverses this
trend and reopens competition for markets based on productivity, not
protectionist policies.
<P>
     GATT will open up marketing opportunities for U.S. livestock
products throughout the world, including Japan and Europe (where
import barriers have been particularly restrictive). More
significantly, GATT will raise the incomes and standards of living in
the developing world because global economic expansion (the GATT
agreement is expected to expand the world economy by $6 trillion by
the turn of the century) will stimulate growth throughout the world.
This will lead in turn to more demand for higher-protein sources of
food. This trend is likely to be most pronounced in the fastest-
growing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where half the
population is under 15 years of age and the nutritional requirements
are greater than in older populations. By the end of this century, 60
percent of the world's population will be living in Asia, where
incomes are rising dramatically. And before the year 2050, it is
expected that world population will double and that, due to rising
standards of living, world food needs will triple. (Dennis T. Avery,
"Saving the Planet with High-Yield Farming," paper presented at The
Heritage Foundation's Agricultural Policy Roundtable, May 23, 1994.)  
<P>
     For U.S. farmers, this translates into an extraordinary
opportunity to increase the export of many agricultural commodities,
especially corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, and livestock
products. There are also indirect opportunities due to a larger world
market. For instance, the new access into the fast-growing Asian
market for beef, pork, and poultry will mean increased domestic
consumption of grains by U.S. livestock. Thus, the U.S. grain sector
will benefit not only from direct sales of grain, but also from
greater sales of grain-fed livestock.
<P>
     Since U.S. agricultural productivity is rising faster than
domestic food demand, agriculture's well-being depends heavily on
international trade. If U.S. farmers manage to regain the competitive
edge internationally, the share of overall U.S. production going to
export will increase significantly; but if this historic opportunity
is lost because domestic farm policies hold back potential exports,
farming communities will suffer greatly.
<P>
     Existing U.S. agricultural policies already have hastened the
loss of much of the agricultural market in Western Europe. Rather than
concentrate their efforts on the daunting task of trying to regain
limited markets already lost, however, U.S. farmers stand to gain much
more from looking to the growing markets of the future. For instance,
farmers need to develop the Asian and Latin American markets and be
poised to move into Africa as that market awakens. U.S. agriculture is
now at a crossroads where it must use its advantageous position to
capture a greater share of these expanding markets stimulated by the
rising food needs of a growing population.
<P>
DOMESTIC BENEFITS OF GROWTH-ORIENTED PRODUCTION AND EXPORT POLICIES
<P>
     American farmers have much to gain if policies are amended to
take full advantage of GATT. First, however, U.S. policies will have
to be changed to raise output rather than curb it and to make prices
more competitive. U.S. farm programs today use non-recourse loans,
target prices, and deficiency payments to stabilize the income of
farmers producing certain commodities. "Non-recourse" means a farmer
can borrow money from the government on his harvested crop and then
either repay the loan and sell the crop or default on the loan and
forfeit the crop to the government. The farmer's credit rating is not
affected by his default, and the loan in reality is a minimum
guaranteed income from his crop. If a target price is established for
a particular commodity, the government pays the farmer a "deficiency
payment" (the difference between the target price and the average
market price) if the market price falls below that target. Again, this
means the farmer has a minimum guaranteed income.
<P>
     The loan rates also establish a floor under the commodity price
and signal to the rest of the world what a foreign producer must
charge for his product to beat the American price. Because the U. S.
product is usually the higher-priced product in the international
export market, buyers often turn to the U.S. market only after first
exhausting the supplies offered by other exporters.
<P>
     Increasing Farm Incomes. Periods of export growth historically
have been periods of large income gain for U.S. farmers. In the early
1970s, for example, U.S. grain exports doubled in just four years.
According to J.B. Penn, then Deputy Administrator for Economics at the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, "net farm income reached the highest
level since World War II and parts of the agricultural sector enjoyed
nearly unparalleled prosperity." (D. Gale Johnson, ed., "Food and
Agricultural Policy for the 1980's," American Enterprise Institute for
Public Policy Research, 1981.)
<P>
     In the 1980s, on the other hand, the United States priced itself
out of international markets by setting too high a floor under
commodity prices in the 1981 farm bill. That legislation provided
automatic increases in loan rates to reflect the double-digit
inflation the country was experiencing at the time. These rigid
minimum loan rates effectively established a minimum export price.
(Farm legislation sets loan rates for major commodities which
establish a floor under the commodity price by allowing the producer
to choose to sell his crop and repay the loan or forfeit his crop to
the government and keep the money. The 1981 farm bill established
these loan rates with automatic escalators, which ultimately exceeded
the inflation rate. Rather than selling their crop which conceivably
could then have found their way to an export outlet, most producers
forfeited their crops to the government and kept the government loan,
which was higher than the prevailing world market prices.) Foreign
competitors undersold these artificially high prices, and U.S. exports
fell. 
<P>
     Domestic commodity prices fell even lower because the resulting
stockpile of surplus commodities continued to depress the markets.
Recognizing that the automatically escalating loan rates in the 1981
farm bill priced American agricultural producers out of the export
market, Congress provided flexibility to decrease loan rates in the
1985 farm bill. 
<P>
     Unfortunately, new mistakes were made in the 1985 farm bill.
Target prices were kept relatively high, which meant that U.S. farmers
became dependent on the federal government for an even greater share
of income. Rather than dealing with this budget concern directly, the
1985 farm bill called for a greater reliance on the use of acreage
reduction programs to control costs and created the Conservation
Reserve Program (CRP), also intended to reduce production available
for program eligibility, despite the fact that attempting to bolster
domestic farm prices by restricting supply severely limits the export
potential of U.S. farmers. Thus, after gaining a growing share of
world grain usage in the 1970s, U.S. farmers saw that share fall
significantly after the return to supply management policies in the
early 1980s.
<P>
     As in any other sector of the economy, a farm policy designed to
raise farm incomes should promote growth in world consumption and try
to capture a larger share of that consumption for U.S. exporters.
Fuller and more efficient use of production resources is the key to
this since it lowers unit costs and increases export revenues. In
short, greater and more efficient production increases total volume
and widens the margin of profit.
<P>
     A recent study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed
Foundation indicates that returning 38 million idled acres to
production could increase gross farm revenue by $8 billion and net
farm income by $4 billion. (Abel, Daft and Earley, an economic
analysis consulting firm, located in Alexandria, Virginia, conducted a
study on behalf of the U.S. Agriculture 20/20 Project of The National
Grain and Feed Foundation. The study "Large-Scale Land Idling Has
Retarded Growth of U.S. Agriculture," was released in May 1994.)
Taxpayers also would benefit from such increased production because
farmers would receive a greater share of their income from the
marketplace rather than from the federal government -- which for the
last 10 years has spent an average of some $14 billion annually on
commodity programs (see the above chart).
<P>
     Reinvigorating the Rural Economy. The federal government's supply
control policies have a widespread impact on the entire U.S. economy.
Stagnant economic activity in the U.S. agricultural sector leads to a
loss of jobs not just in farming, but also in the supply, processing,
and marketing industries. In addition, agribusinesses reduce their
investments of capital needed to replace obsolete equipment and fully
utilize technological advancements. This hits major businesses
producing such items as heavy farm equipment. Moreover, without
capital investment, the United States cannot be a dominant force in
processing and selling agricultural products internationally. 
<P>
     Changes in U.S. agricultural policy that stimulate greater
output, on the other hand, will give agribusiness the incentive to
invest in greater economic efficiency. Such a growth-oriented policy
would restore the United States as the world's premier farm producer
and exporter. It also would revive the vast and valuable agricultural
infrastructure, much of which -- though still surpassing that of other
countries -- has been allowed to deteriorate during the past decade. A
free market revolution thus would bring economic growth to rural
communities, generating jobs in businesses that provide inputs to
farmers and that process and market their crops. This expanded
economic activity could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs,
providing a much-needed boost to the rural economy.
<P>
     Increasing agricultural production also would have an impact on
the rest of the American economy. A multiplier effect would spread the
benefits of increased production from producers to processors and
distributors and would include the seed, fertilizer, chemical,
transportation, equipment manufacturing and construction industries.
Thus, the study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed Foundation
concludes that returning 38 million acres to production would not
merely boost farm income by $4 billion, but could "increase national
income by $28.9 billion annually and generate over 225,000 more full-
time jobs." (Ibid.)
<P>
A PRO-GROWTH FARM BILL IN 1995
<P>
     Ten years ago, the one significant reform in the 1985 farm bill
was based on a recognition that the United States, if it was to be a
successful agriculture exporter, had to allow farm prices to be
competitive. The 1995 farm bill could build on this by enabling
farmers to capture the benefits of agricultural trade reform.
<P>
     In order to capitalize on the future expansion of world trade,
the 1995 farm bill must promote and reward growth. The United States
produces more agricultural products than it can consume domestically,
and the gap between its production potential and its domestic demand
base is widening. Agricultural productivity will continue to advance
because of biotechnological breakthroughs and the use of such new
technologies as "site specific production." (When site-specific
production becomes available for commercial use, producers will be
able to use this satellite technology to maximize production by
applying the optimum amount of seed, fertilizer, and nutrients per
acre of cultivation.) 
<P>
     The first goal of the 1995 farm bill thus must be to enhance U.S.
agriculture's position as a competitive exporter. In an increasingly
competitive market, it is the low-cost producer that will capture new
markets and the resultant income. But supply controls and export
subsidies inhibit U.S. agriculture's ability to exploit its
competitive position. Specifically, in order to achieve a pro-growth
agricultural policy and realize the benefits that will flow from such
a policy, the following actions must be taken in the 1995 farm bill:
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction (ARP) or set-aside programs. 
<P>
     U.S. agricultural policy uses subsidy programs that rely
generally on supply control mechanisms instead of the market to
maintain farm income. For most of this decade, the United States has
been the only major farm producer to follow a policy of deliberately
idling productive land. More recently, the U.S. has persuaded the
European Union to begin similar supply control policies. This policy
does more than physically limit the amount of product available for
export, it also undermines the competitiveness of U.S. farm products
overseas because fixed production costs are spread across fewer
producing acres. This raises the farmer's cost of production per
bushel and leaves the established network of agricultural supply,
servicing, and processing industries to operate at a reduced capacity,
which raises handling costs and discourages maintenance and
reinvestment. Moreover, land idling tends to reduce demand for -- and
lower the prices of -- such things as seeds and fertilizers. When
these are exported because of limits on domestic production, the
result is lower production costs for America's competitors, who wisely
do not limit production.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). 
<P>
     The CRP, authorized by the 1985 farm bill, was intended to target
erodible croplands for removal from production and to encourage
conservation. It now includes over 36 million acres on which
landowners receive rental payments under ten-year contracts in return
for removing the land from production. Much of this acreage actually
is highly productive land that, through utilization of readily
available conservation practices, is not vulnerable to unacceptable
erosion. The CRP contracts will begin to expire in 1995, and about
two-thirds will expire by 1997. A modified CRP should include only
highly erodible acres. Based upon USDA's land capability
classification system, about 22 million of the acres enrolled in the
CRP are in the top land capability classes with relatively low
erodibility. Only 4 million are highly erodible, while the remaining
10 million are of debatable erodibility.
<P>
     In the last twelve years, acreage reduction programs and the
Conservation Reserve Program have removed a total of almost 650
million acres from production. This would cover an area about four
times the size of Texas and is some 45 percent greater than the total
area of U.S. cropland annually under production, which is
approximately 450 million acreas (see the chart on the preceeding
page).
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). 
<P>
     The EEP pays exporters to dump agricultural products on the world
market at discounted prices by providing the exporter a dollar subsidy
price for specified quantities of commodities to be exported. Since
its inception, the EEP has been used primarily on grains. Previously,
the EEP was provided in the form of bonus commodities from CCC stocks.
Then, at least, the program added to exportable supplies. Now, even
that marginal benefit has disappeared.
<P>
     Such a program cannot be justified in a post-Uruguay Round world.
For one thing, the GATT agreement requires governments to cut back
such subsidies. For another, because export subsidies tend to
encourage sales of certain commodities by making the purchase of those
commodities relatively attractive, regardless of actual demand, they
distort markets to the disadvantage of the exporter with the greatest
growth potential, which is the United States. Because the EEP allows
the United States to continue temporarily to export products based on
an artificial stimulus rather than on real demand, it makes the U.S.
agricultural system sluggish and unresponsive and wastes resources
that could be used better elsewhere. 
<P>
     Continued use of export subsidies will serve only to depress
world grain and oilseed prices while distorting buyer-seller
relationships between countries. The elimination of export subsidies
on grain in particular would improve the global competitiveness not
only of grain, but also of oilseeds and livestock produced in the
United States.
<P>
     If these changes in U.S. farm policy are made, U.S. producers
will be the best positioned to serve growing world demand. By using
the natural advantages that enable it to be the low-cost producer, the
United States once again can become a successful exporter of
agricultural products.
<P>
OBSTACLES TO REFORM
<P>
     These reforms will not happen automatically, however. Certain
sectors of U.S. agriculture, such as the National Association of Wheat
Growers, National Cotton Council, and National Farmers Union, do not
seem to recognize the economic and job-creating opportunities created
by the new global marketplace. They believe that GATT will make U.S.
farmers more vulnerable to competition from imports. In fact, in
hearings held this past summer, a number of commodity and farm groups
claimed that GATT reforms will make it even more important to keep
present farm programs with little or no change in order to protect
U.S. agriculture from competition. (The House Agriculture Subcommittee
on General Farm Commodities held hearings in June and July of 1994 to
review the general outlook for the farm economy and commodity
programs.)
<P>
     Such reluctance to change is natural, since very few farmers have
ever known anything other than a system of subsidies and supply
controls. But if this siege mentality prevails, it will condemn U.S.
agriculture to stagnation while other countries enjoy the fruits of
new markets. Fortunately, in a recent survey of readers conducted by
Top Producer magazine, when asked their opinion of a proposal to
reform farm programs that would eliminate deficiency payments and set-
asides, 26 percent responded favorably. Although 31 percent were
opposed, 34 percent were interested but said they needed more
information. (Top Producer, opinion survey, conducted in February and
March 1994.) Some farmers evidently recognize that dependence on
government subsidies also subjects them to a lackluster future.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Entrepreneurial farmers and agricultural groups should join
forces with those agribusiness concerns that led the fight for NAFTA
and GATT. Much of agribusiness understands the economic benefits of
agricultural trade liberalization and reform. Through past experience
with short supply situations, they have learned that supply controls
and export subsidies undermine their ability to do business, both here
and abroad, and to provide jobs and prosperity in rural America. 
<P>
     A strong voice for a future based on opportunity, not
protectionism, is needed now more than ever. U.S. agriculture faces an
historic opportunity, as a result of NAFTA and GATT reforms, to
reestablish its preeminence in the world export market. If Congress
takes the actions necessary to establish America's position as the
world leader in meeting the growing demands of this new market, the
result will be decades of prosperity ahead for farmers and greater
economic growth and stability in rural America. 
<P>
     The 1995 farm bill provides the opportunity to make the necessary
changes in agricultural policy. Four or five more years likely will
pass before farm legislation is considered again. By then, farmers in
the rest of the world already will have taken advantage of the
opportunity to meet the demands of the global marketplace. Thus, if
this opportunity is missed, rural America will face a future of
continued economic stagnation.

CONGRESS DECIDING FUTURE OF AMERICA'S FARMERS
<P>
By John Frydenlund
<P>
 
<P>
 Everyone who buys food or pays federal taxes should be interested
in the coming congressional battle over the 1995 farm bill. The
issue is simple: Whether Congress will unleash the unrivaled productive
power of U.S. agriculture or keep U.S. farmers plodding along
under a tired, worn-out farm program created during the Great
Depression.
<P>
 The right decision could produce significant savings for both
consumers and taxpayers, while producing an estimated $35 billion
windfall for rural America.
<P>
 Gradually doing away with the current farm program over a five
year period -- and letting farmers produce for customers around
the world without interference from Washington -- is the way to
get there. The farm bill is the place to start.
<P>
 The prospect of generating $35 billion worth of new farm income
ought to be a powerful incentive for Congress to act, especially
considering how the new prosperity would be spread throughout
the country, according to a detailed computer model we put together
at The Heritage Foundation to measure the impact of phasing out
the farm program.
<P>
 While all states would benefit in the long-run, from California
to Florida, the greatest short-term benefits would be seen in
the midwest farm belt.  Five heartland states -- Colorado, Kansas,
 Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota -- would receive a healthy
$5.7 billion chunk of the increased farm income. This is after
factoring in added production costs and decreased &quot;deficiency
payments&quot; in which the government pays farmers the difference
between the market price and a government-imposed &quot;target
price&quot; or loan rate, whichever is smaller. By the way, the
following figures are for net income after the end of all federal
deficiency payments:
<P>
 * Colorado -- The Centennial State's wheat and corn producers
would see an $82 million increase by 2000, and a total of $1.05
billion more by 2005.
<P>
 * Kansas -- The Jayhawk State's wheat, corn, oats, barley and
soybean growers would receive $158 million in added net income
by the year 2000, and a cumulative total of more than $2.5 billion
by 2005.
<P>
 * Missouri -- Thanks to increased farm production nationwide,
the Show Me State's food processors, as well as Missourians growing
corn, soybeans and wheat, would enjoy $43 million in added net
income in five years, and $709 million by 2005.
<P>
 * Nebraska -- Farm machinery producers would share $25 million
in added net income by 2000 with ranchers and grain producers
in the Cornhusker State. By 2005, the state's farm sector  would
have received nearly $1 billion in increased income.
<P>
 * South Dakota -- Oat, flax seed, sunflower seed and rye growers
here would receive $21 million in added net income by 2000, and
more than $546 million total by 2005.
<P>
 Texas is another big winner. By 2000, the Lone Star State's wheat,
cotton, rice and peanut producers would see a $13 million increase,
but by 2005 the total would skyrocket to $1.08 billion.
<P>
 With such a cornucopia available, one naturally wonders why farmers
failed to reap such benefits before now? The answer is because
the United States has never weaned itself off the current system,
which was created in the 1930s to protect farmers from the volatility
of a Depression-era marketplace.
<P>
 Reform opponents are defending a costly, bureaucratic maze of
special interest subsidies, deficiency payments, price supports,
acreage allotments and red tape. Everybody but the politicians,
Department of Agriculture bureaucrats and a few richly favored
farmers will be big losers if Congress protects this creaky relic.
<P>
 This is because under the current farm program 65 percent of
all federal farm payments go to a mere 16 percent of farmers,
those with gross annual sales of $100,000 or more. Small farmers
-- those who sell less than $10,000 worth of farm products each
year -- receive only 5 percent of the payments.
<P>
  Worst of all, the current system forces farmers to plan, invest
and plant as if their only customers are the 250 million consumers
here in America, thus ignoring a growing worldwide food market
of 6 billion hungry people beyond the United States.
<P>
 If our farmers were instead free to plan for the near doubling
population and rising living standards in Asia, Africa and Latin
America in coming years -- where demand for food is expected to
triple -- there is no telling how much prosperity could be ahead.
<P>
 Members of Congress should understand that, if the 1995 farm
bill begins the process of eliminating government subsidies and
controls, America's farmers will be able to out-produce and outsell
the rest of the world, with the expanded production fueling tremendous
increases in farm income and in farm-related businesses. If Congress
keeps the subsidies and controls, farm prosperity will wither
on the vine for years to come.

<title>Disestablishing the Department of Education</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>DISESTABLISHING THE<br>
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<h4>Testimony of Robert G. Morrison<br>
Education Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
before the House Committee on Economic<br>
and Educational Opportunities<br>
June 29, 1995</h4></center>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:  my name is Robert
G. Morrison and I am here to represent Gary Bauer and the Family
Research Council.  Our organization serves more than 250,000 members
nationwide.  I served with Gary Bauer in the U.S. Department of
Education from 1985-87.  My testimony today will call for the
disestablishment of the Department of Education and the repeal
of Goals 2000, the Educate America Act.
<p>
In 1979, when President Jimmy Carter first proposed the creation
of a U.S. Department of Education to repay the National Education
Association for its political support,  columnist Marvin Stone
warned of  the centralization of power over education:  writing
for <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>, Stone asked:  &quot;Would
the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's
traditional local control of education?  Of course it would. 
Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility
to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the
donors -- or else.&quot;  Despite half-hearted objections at the
time, the Department has moved inexorably toward greater and greater
control over local education.  With Goals 2000, the U.S. Education
Department and other federal bureaucracies seek to tighten their
grip on the genuine education reform movement and extinguish it.
<p>
Of course, these ceaseless efforts at centralization will fail.
 They must fail, because they sap local community spirit and individual
responsibility.  They must fail because, as Mr. Jefferson said:
 &quot;If we waited for Washington to tell us when to sow and
when to reap, we should soon want bread.&quot;  They must fail
for an even more profound reason.  Alexis de Tocqueville has been
recently quoted both by President Bill Clinton and by Speaker
Gingrich.  But Tocqueville, as a genius of political science,
explained <I>why</I> the attempt to centralize administration
ultimately fails.
<p>
<blockquote><i>However enlightened and skillful a central power may be, it
cannot of itself embrace all the details of the life of a great nation.
 Such vigilance exceeds the powers of man. And when it attempts
unaided to create and set in motion so many complicated springs,
it must submit to a very imperfect result or exhaust itself in
bootless efforts.
<p>
Alexis de Tocqueville<br>
Democracy in America, 1835</i></blockquote>
<p>
&quot;Imperfect results&quot; and  &quot;bootless efforts&quot;
pretty well describe the record of the U.S. Education Department.
 Under the spur of Goals 2000, the Department has seen fit to
endorse the new national history standards.  These politically-correct
standards seek to teach all American students that Madonna and
the Simpsons are significant figures, while neglecting Paul Revere,
the Wright Brothers, Marian Anderson and Jonas Salk.  They speak
of &quot;Soviet advances in space&quot; and the <I>Challenger</I>
disaster, while completely omitting the U.S. landing on the moon
even though Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a respected liberal historian,
has said that the moon landing may be the most significant event
of the twentieth century.  Worse, the standards could be fairly
termed &quot;anti-American&quot; history standards because they
teach young people that U.S.-Soviet &quot;swordplay&quot; led
to the American involvement in Korea, Vietnam and U.S. interventions
around the world.  Never do the standards speak of Soviet invasions
of Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan.  Never do the standards
acknowledge communist efforts at subversion in the U.S. or Western
Europe.  We urge this committee and the full House to join the
Senate in denouncing these history standards.
<p>
Not only do we at Family Research Council believe that the national
history standards that have been produced are unacceptable, we
believe that <I>any</I> effort of the federal government to dispense
official truth is misguided and dangerous.  We have only to look
at the Clinton administration's recently reported failure in the
area of childhood immunizations to recognize the harm that government
can do when it manufactures a crisis based on faulty data and
a political agenda.  Yet, if there are any of our liberal friends
who still defend the idea of a political determination of  U.S.
history, we would ask them to consider this:  what if national
history and economics standards were to be devised by Professor
Gingrich, Professor Gramm and Professor Armey?
<p>
The reality in contemporary American life is that parents, taxpayers
and citizens generally are not of one accord about all education
programs.  There is broad support, measured by polls, for safe
and drug-free schools.  There is consistent public backing for
schools which teach children reading, writing, arithmetic and
history, for schools which impart reliable standards of right
and wrong.  But there is no stable consensus on many other hotly-debated
issues.   Family life and sex education continue to be points
of contention.  Methods of teaching reading, similarly, divide
Americans.  So, too, does the teaching of evolution.  Even bilingual
education is fraught with controversy.  What the Education Department
and Goals 2000 do is put the federal government in the middle
of all these controversies. 
<p>
When the federal government becomes an antagonist, it is viewed
increasingly as hostile to one or another group of parents or
interests.  That is why we at Family Research Council support
the <I>disestablishment </I>of the U.S. Department of Education
and the <I>repeal</I> of Goals 2000.  We seek the return of decision-making
 authority  to local communities -- to elected school boards which
are close to the people they serve.  We also strongly support
parental choice of schools.  Only when every parent can freely
choose a safe and effective public, private, religious or home
school will we have an end to the interminable clashes over education
and values. 
<p>
Many in the education establishment, we know, question whether
parents are capable of wisely choosing a school for their children. 
To this we can only answer:  if parents are capable of choosing presidents, 
governors and members of congress, then surely they can choose a school.
 Further, if advocates of a public school monopoly persist on
this point, we must challenge them.  If Americans cannot make
an<I> educated</I> choice of schools for their own children, whom
they love, then who bears the responsibility for their failure?
We have had compulsory public schools in this country for a century
and a half.  Nearly ninety percent of Americans attend those schools.
 The fact is, of course, parental choice works.  That's why some
of those most knowledgeable about education -- including teachers'
union members, the Clintons and the Gores -- choose their own
children's' schools. 
<p>
Our vision for education reform includes a de-centralization of
decision-making which will not only be effective in getting us
&quot;back to basics,&quot;  but which will also reinvigorate
democracy at the grassroots.  One of the reasons why Goals 2000
will fail is because it saps local initiative and disperses accountability.
 There are also historical reasons.  We have attempted a more
modest, arguably a more realistic national goals effort before.
<p>
In 1984, the Reagan administration sought to set out Goals 1990.
 It hoped to have American students recoup just <I>one-half</I>
of the points lost in the SATs since the mid-60s.  Initially,
there were some hopeful upticks.  But, by the end of the decade
of the 80s, it became clear that American students were not listening
to even the best lectures from the Bully Pulpit.  In 1990, President
Reagan had retired to California, deservedly honored for his central
role in the defeat of communism, respected throughout the world
for unleashing a great and productive economy and looked to with
gratitude by millions of American families for his championing
of parental rights and traditional values.  No one criticized
Ronald Reagan for the failure of U.S. students to achieve Goals
1990. 
<p>
The education establishment says that &quot;kids deserve a place
at the table with the President.&quot;  It's an attractive soundbite.
 But it would be far better for us to have a nation of  &quot;education
mothers and fathers&quot; and empowered local education leaders
than it would be to hold out a role for the President or Congress
that is neither realistic nor constitutionally appropriate.  The
truth is, the President and Congress are always going to be preoccupied
with taxing and trading, with national defense and international
cooperation.  We need to move beyond &quot;kids as props&quot;
to show Washington's intimate concern for education. 
<p>
This Congress has before it legislation which will disestablish
the Department of Education and repeal Goals 2000.  Family Research
Council shares these objectives.  We look forward to working with
the members of this committee and with your staff to perfect it.
 We urge this committee to give the resources and the responsibility
back to the parents, taxpayers and locally elected leaders who
can most effectively act to improve education. 
<p>
To de-centralize education decision-making is to recognize once
again &quot;the genius of the people&quot; of which Madison spoke
in <I>The Federalist Papers</I>.  By disestablishing the U.S.
Department of Education and repealing Goals 2000, this Congress
will demonstrate its respect for the Constitution and, especially,
the Tenth Amendment.  This Congress will show that it listens
to the petitions and the concerns of millions of parents.  Congress
will also prove that it is serious about cutting wasteful federal
spending.  While this action may not gain this body the title
of  the &quot;Education Congress&quot; from the vested interest,
it will win for this Congress a new measure of gratitude and respect
for restoring &quot;Democracy in America.&quot;

<h2>Abolishing the Department of Education In Order to Liberate Parents and Schools</h2><p>
<h3>A Joint Statement by Former Secretaries of Education</h3><br>
<h3>Lamar Alexander and William J. Bennett</h3><p>
<i><b>Delivered before the House Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigation</i></b><br>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: <p>
 
It is a particular pleasure for us to address this Committee with its 
new name, new majority and new chairman. Thank you for the 
opportunity to set forth our views on the federal role in education. 
You have an extraordinary opportunity to change the course of 
history in this domain. <p>
 
In this statement we outline a fundamental transformation; namely, 
reversing the direction of a mighty river that, for the past thirty 
years, has flowed in the direction of Washington, D.C. We have 
long been convinced that this river -- of responsibility, authority and 
accountability for American education -- should instead flow 
toward our families, schools, communities and states we sketch in 
this statement, and the principles on which they rest, are not new 
for us, for the Presidents we have served, or for many more of our 
fellow Republicans. What has changed is that it is finally within the 
capacity of the Congress to put them into action. <p>
 

<center><h3>What's Gone Wrong </h3></center><p>
 
The federal education apparatus illustrates what has gone awry in 
Washington over the past several decades. The national government 
has become meddlesome, intrusive and bullying. It now impedes 
more than it fosters. Much of what it mandates or encourages is 
misguided. It keeps people from doing what they know is right for 
their children, communities and states. It substitutes the rules of 
distant bureaucrats for the on-site knowledge of parents and 
teachers. And, particularly in the last several years, it has begun to 
lift from our communities the sense that they are responsible for the 
renewal and reform of American education and to suggest, instead, 
that Washington knows best and is taking charge. <p>
 
We and Presidents Reagan and Bush did all we could to reverse the 
flow, place the emphasis on states and communities, promote 
flexibility and choice, forge a true partnership with the governors, 
end discrimination against individuals without preferential treatment 
for any group, and halt Washington's growing regulatory apparatus. 
But every such effort was rebuffed by the Democratic Congress -- 
now aided and abetted by the Clinton administration -- which has 
pressed relentlessly in the opposite direction, encouraged in this 
endeavor by education's myriad special interest groups. <p>
 
To anyone who thinks we exaggerate, we recommend reading the 
full texts of Goals 2000 and "H.R.6", the administration's two main 
education bills -- particularly as these were finally enacted by the 
103rd Congress. Especially when they are taken in combination, it 
becomes plain that their authors 'want to substitute decisions made 
in Washington for decisions made by individual households and 
communities. They transform what had been a national movement 
into a federal program. They create new governance structures and 
regulatory mechanisms at both national and state levels. They use 
federal funding in a deceptive way that is designed to elicit the 
behaviors that other parts of the legislation declare to be 
"voluntary". They throw obstacles onto such promising reform 
pathways as school choice and private management of public 
schools. They strip the bi-partisan National Assessment Governing 
Board of much of its independence. And they do all this while pretending otherwise, by wrapping themselves in rhetoric of 
"helping" education and pasting friendly-sounding titles on the 
cover (H.R.6 was dubbed the "Improving America's Schools Act") 
while in reality their contents were written by and for lobbyists and 
interest groups to whom the skills and knowledge of children are 
not the top priority. <p>
 
Federal education policy has been moving in this direction since 
1965. It took a breather, at least within the executive branch 
between 1981 and 1992, but the past two years have seen the pent-
up "governmentalism" of that decade unleashed upon the land. For 
a time we supposed that it was possible to have a national 
education reform project that worked like a true and durable 
partnership and did not evolve into another rule-bound federal 
program. The last two years have proven us wrong. In addition to 
Goals 2000 and H.R.6, we have seen the executive branch give 
blanket endorsement to scholarships based on race; take the heat 
off those who would use "diversity" as a criterion for accreditation; 
propose the race-norming of state assessment results; and persecute 
states that employ test-based standards for high school graduation. 
It's now clear that the federal government will eventually break 
whatever it touches. Rather than tinker around the margins, 
therefore, the time has come for a great and thorough change. <p>
 

<center><h3>A Different Philosophy </center></h3><p>
 
The essential part of our proposal is not its particulars but the four 
principles on which it rests. It is these, above all, that we commend 
to the Committee's consideration. One can adjust the details that 
follow. Any comprehensive overhaul based on these principles, 
however, will represent fundamental redirection -- and an historic 
accomplishment, worth the new Congress. <p>
 
First, education in America is the constitutional responsibility of the 
states the social responsibility of communities, and the moral 
responsibility of families. <p>
 
Second, except when the civil rights of individuals are menaced, the 
federal government should never impede the capacity of families, 
teachers, communities and states to decide how best to provide 
education to their children, and should never substitute its judgment 
for theirs. <p>
 
Third, goals, standards, assessments, the dissemination of 
information and ideas, and the encouragement of bold innovation 
are legitimate leadership and "bully pulpit" activities of national 
officials, but they must always be truly voluntary on the part of 
states and communities. Nor should federal funds be used as 
"carrots" or "sticks" in ways that effectively diminish state and local 
control. <p>


Fourth, insofar as the federal government is engaged at all in the 
field of education, it should dedicate itself to (a) fostering family 
responsibility and local control; (b) assisting states to fulfill their 
responsibilities as they see fit; (c) providing sound statistics, prompt 
and accurate assessment results and other information; and (d) 
safeguarding individuals from illegal discrimination. <p>
 

<center><h3>Repairing Recent Damage </center></h3><p>

In the 1,200 or so pages of the Goals 2000 and H.R.6 legislation 
enacted last year is considerable mischief that should immediately 
be defunded and then repealed. Ten leading candidates include: <p>
 
1. The National Education Standards and Improvement Council -- 
the "national school board" that is so vivid a symbol of education 
wrong-think in Washington, and the new state panels mandated by 
Goals 2000. Our states and communities have all the governments 
they need; they don't need new decision-making structures designed 
in Washington. <p>
 
2. Federal ''certification'' of national and state education standards 
and federal approval of state and local education reform plans. 
Those controversial new standards should make their own way 
through the marketplace of ideas without any federal "seal of 
approval." Nor do federal bureaucrats have any business second-
guessing state and local priorities for school reform. <p>
 
3. Prohibitions and disincentives for state/local testing programs 
and accountability systems. Among the most dismaying features of 
Goals 2000 (and recent actions by the Office for Civil Rights) is the 
effort to discourage the very tests that might actually encourage our 
students to learn more -- and give parents and taxpayers better 
information. <p>
4. New "gender equity" programs. The last thing we need is the 
federal government telling America's 15,000 communities how to 
teach little boys and little girls about one another -- or mandating 
how teachers are to handle such matters. Nor do we need a new 
"special assistant for gender equity" to enforce such mandates. <p>
 
5. Federal regulation of schools' weapons policies and sex 
education. That's why we have parents, teachers, principals and 
school boards. <p>
 
6. All references to "opportunity to learn" standards. If the 
experience of American education these past thirty years has taught 
us anything, it's the importance of maintaining a laser-like focus on 
student achievement and of creating accountability systems that are 
based on school results. The recent legislation deflects attention 
back toward such "inputs" as spending levels, class size, and 
degrees conferred by colleges of education -- and invites even more 
litigation based on such spurious gauges while discouraging true 
accountability for schools, teachers and students. <p>


7. Disincentives for states and localities that want to try such 
reforms as vouchers, charter schools and privatization. If we are 
ever to transform American education, we must give families -- 
especially poor families -- the right to choose their children's 
schools from among all the schools in their communities; give 
communities opportunities to create "break the mold schools" that 
are not regulated to death by the bureaucracy; and invite the private 
sector to help interested communities create the best schools in the 
world. Yet the recent legislation places obstacles in the path of 
states and communities that want to try such things. -What sort of 
choice program allows the sending" school to deny children the 
right to leave? The sort enacted in H.R.6. <p>
 
8. Extension of Davis-Bacon provisions to school construction and 
renovation. That means a principal in Moline who wants to hire a 
contractor to rewire his school for new computers must pay the 
prevailing union wage rather than getting the job done for the 
lowest cost. It's a big favor for the unions, but no favor at all for 
schools, efficiency or economy. <p>
 
9. The addition of two more national goals to the original six. 
Parent involvement and teacher training are fine, but goals should 
be limited to specific, measurable results, such as President Bush 
and the Governors (including then-governor Bill Clinton) 
established in Charlottesville. <p>
 
10. Weakening the National Assessment Governing Board. Our 
best source of reliable student achievement data at the national and 
state levels is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the 
integrity of which depends on the absolute independence and 
complete policy control of its Governing Board. H.R.6 undermined 
that board, giving greater influence to education interest groups and 
to a sluggish federal bureaucracy that is easily politicized. <p>
 

<center><h3>Reasons for Devolution</center></h3><p>
 
Mr. Chairman, here is the heart of our proposal for the long term: 
the Congress should take every single activity currently housed in 
the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) 
send it home to the states and communities; (b) entrust it to another 
federal agency that is suited to conduct it in harmony with related 
activities; or (c) abolish it on grounds that the federal government 
can no longer afford to spend money on programs that have 
outlived their usefulness or that can be handled satisfactorily by 
others. We will not endeavor here to fill in every detail or answer 
each question that might be asked about this far-reaching 
recommendation, but the examples that follow indicate its main 
features. <p>
 
<center><h3>Sending responsibility home </center></h3><p>
 
* Virtually all major programs assisting elementary/secondary 
education should be combined into a "block" and returned to the 
states and communities. This can be accomplished in several ways: 
the best, in our judgment, is a "responsibility swap" whereby the 
states assume full responsibility for education in return for federal 
assumption of other burdens now borne by the states; or a resource 
base transfer in which some federal tax is reduced by an amount 
equivalent to the programs in question, thereby leaving it to state 
and communities to raise and deploy these revenues as they see fit. 
A third approach is a no-strings "block grant" of federal fund to the 
state, though we like this least because of the well-known tendency 
of block grants to grow strings as time passes. <p>
 
The core of this block are programs under the headings of 
"education reform" (including goals 2000), school improvement, 
education for the disadvantaged, bilingual education, and vocational 
and adult education -- approximately $10 billion in all. That means 
upwards of a billion dollars a year for a big state like California and 
about $200 million for a smaller one like Tennessee, funds that the 
state and its communities would be free to spend it for any 
educational purpose, including such innovations as charter schools 
and vouchers. (The distribution formula can retain the equity-
conscious fiscal effects of today's programs.) The federal 
government would no longer define legitimate education reform, 
nor would states and communities have to submit their plans to 
Washington for approval. <p>
 
We will leave it to the budget-and-appropriations process to 
determine whether the block should equal the sum of its antecedent 
programs, but we note that a number of governors have made clear 
their willingness to endure a funding reduction in return for the 
freedom to deploy the remainder as their states see fit. We also note 
that eliminating the heavy overhead and "middleman" costs of 
current categorical programs (at both federal and state levels) will 
concentrate more resources on teaching and learning. <p>
 
A block grant to the states should also combine a number of the 
smaller higher education programs, with the exception of the main 
student financial aid programs. These deserve serious consultation 
with the governors and persons knowledgeable about higher 
education and finance. Today, one out of two college students in 
America has a federal grant or loan, and helping needy students 
attend college is a national function worth preserving. But these 
programs are poorly managed, needlessly costly, and full of 
middlemen, each of which takes its cut. In the near term, we 
recommend transferring the main student aid programs to a federal 
agency with greater competence in handling complex financial 
transactions with millions of individuals (and in collecting what is 
owed the government). An obvious candidate is the Treasury 
Department, with its Internal Revenue Service. Over the longer 
term, additional student aid strategies should be fully explored, 
including devolution to the states and privatization. <p>
 
* Special education and rehabilitation services also warrant 
consultation with the governors. This is by far the largest 
"unfunded" education mandate, i.e. federal regulations require the 
expenditure by states and localities of many billions more than the 
federal aid provided. It would, therefore, be reasonable to 
incorporate these programs into the main elementary/secondary 
block grant. Alternatively, they could become a smaller block grant 
of their own. (Total current value: approximately $5.7 billion.) Or 
these programs could be transferred to the Department of Health 
and Human Services. <p>


We want to be clear on this point: protection of the civil rights of 
disabled individuals would remain a federal responsibility, to be 
carried out by the Justice Department. <p>
 

<center><h3>Transfers </center></h3><p>
 
* All civil rights enforcement would move to the Justice 
Department, with the admonition that it be vigorously carried out 
when discrimination against individuals is involved, but not used as 
a tool for granting or withholding rights and benefits on the basis of 
group membership. <p>
 
The gathering, analysis and reporting of education statistics would 
be placed under the jurisdiction of the National Education Goals 
Panel, consisting of governors, legislators, members of Congress 
and senior officials of the executive branch. Assessment of student 
achievement at the international, national and state levels would 
become the unambiguous responsibility of a rehabilitated National 
Assessment Governing Board, overseen in turn by the Goals Panel. <p>
 
* As noted above, any student aid programs not devolved to the 
states would move to a fiscal agency such as the Treasury 
Department, while any special education and rehabilitation 
programs not turned over to the states would move to the 
Department of Health and Human Services. <p>
 
* Indian education programs would be transferred to the Interior 
Department. <p>
 
A small number of federal programs that assist specialized 
institutions (e.g. Gallaudet College, Howard University) and are 
now the responsibility of the Education Department deserve 
scrutiny to see whether the present subsidy arrangements should 
continue. Insofar as they do, any of a number of executive branch 
agencies can oversee future resource transfers. <p>
 
<center><h3>Abolition </center></h3><p>
 
The Education Department currently manages about 250 separate 
programs. Perhaps fifty of these have entirely outlived their 
usefulness, or support activities that the federal government could 
beneficially stop subsidizing, or provide marginal aid for activities 
that are fundamentally the responsibility of others but have been 
maintained as federal "categorical" programs due to the strength of 
special interest lobbies. Such programs should be abolished or "de-
funded" and the savings returned to federal taxpayers. (We estimate 
these at $2 to 3 billion annually, i.e. as much as $15 billion over five 
years.) We will not here provide a complete list, but illustrative 
examples include federal technical assistance centers of several 
kinds, regional "educational laboratories," library support programs, 
literacy programs for prisoners, women's educational equity, law 
school clinical experience, Olympic scholarships and "star schools." <p>


Savings would also result from dismantling the regulatory 
infrastructure, including most of the costs of Education Department 
management (about $444 million) and the National Education 
Standards and Improvement Council. <p>
 

<center><h3>Structural Implications </center></h3><p>
 
Inasmuch as adoption of our substantive recommendations would 
leave  The Department of Education with nothing to do, there 
would be no need to retain it. <p>
 
Although any "news" coming out of our testimony may be that 
"two former education secretaries urge abolition of department they 
once headed," let us be clear that we did not come before the 
Committee to recommend a label change or symbolic beheading. <p>
 
Today's Department of Education has two essential failings. First, it 
has come to contain bad ideas, harmful practices, needless 
expenditures, obsolete programs, dysfunctional regulations and the 
depredations of special interests that care more about the well-
being of education's "producers" than for its "consumers." <p>
 
Second, it has an irresistible and uncontrollable impulse to stick its 
nose into areas where it has no proper business. Most of what it 
does today is no legitimate affair of the federal government. The 
Education Department operates from the deeply erroneous belief 
that American parents, teachers, communities and states are too 
stupid to raise their own children, run their own schools and make 
their own decisions. <p> 
Abolishing the Department will accomplish little if its meddlesome 
ways are transferred intact to another federal bureaucracy. Indeed, 
such a shift could even be harmful to the extent that it serves to 
"hide" those activities in less visible locations. In our view, the way 
to think about the Education Department is first in terms of what it 
does, then in terms of its structure and status. <p>
 
Because we believe that each of the Department's activities that is 
worth preserving in some form could better be handled elsewhere, 
we see no need for a separate federal education agency of any kind. <p>
 
Our purpose is not to reduce the attention that the nation pays to 
education. Indeed, there's never been a time in our history when 
education was more important -- or more in need of a complete 
overhaul. Whether one is concerned with developing virtue in the 
young, preparing tomorrow's adults for life in the information age, 
widening the shared core knowledge base of a diverse population, 
strengthening our economic competitiveness or enabling poor 
people to move from the back of the line to the front, we have few 
assets of greater value than effective education. <p>


"National leadership" can be helpful in focusing people on problems 
and opportunities. We look to the President, with the help of an 
education advisor housed in the White House, to the National 
Education Goals Panel to ensure that the national project of 
educational renewal continues apace. But true leadership means 
energizing people and communities change, not shackling them with 
mandates and regulations -- and calling it leadership. We do not 
need a raft of federal programs. We do not need a giant 
bureaucracy. We do not need a federal department. What we need 
is a national movement. We are convinced that the-- prospects for 
such a movement -- and for real educational renewal in America -- 
will be far brighter when the Congress signals unmistakably and 
irrevocably that responsibility rests with teachers and parents, with 
communities and states, not with federal bureaucrats. <p>
 
Reversing the flow of this river is no small undertaking. But it 
would do immeasurable good for our children, our schools, our 
communities and our future. <p>

<TITLE> Candidates for Rescission in the FY 1995 Education Budget  -- Heritage </TITLE>

        A Special Report to the Appropriations Committees
<P>
<H3> CANDIDATES FOR RESCISSION IN THE FY 1995              
            EDUCATION BUDGET
</H3>

<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Committee Brief #7<br>
          (published at 3 pages, February 24, 1995)
<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

 
     We are here today to determine ways to cut the 1995 education
budget. Let me say at the outset that, despite rhetoric to the contrary, only
a very small percentage of the over $31 billion the federal government
spends on education ever actually makes it into America's classrooms. Most
of the Department of Education's budget and programs go to fund technical
assistance, clearinghouses, information, and specific programs that educators
in our states and communities neither need nor want. I spend a good amount
of my time working with educators in these states and communities. When
asked what the federal government and the U.S. Congress can do to improve
their schools, they overwhelmingly reply, "Leave us alone!"
<P>
     Federal funding for education has tripled in constant dollars from
1965 to the present. Student performance, by contrast, has declined over the
same period. Clearly, additional federal spending on education is not the
answer. Yet, the Clinton Administration, in its 1995 budget, sought $26.1
billion in discretionary budget authority, a $1.7 billion increase over last
year. Similarly, the Administration sought $5.6 billion for mandatory
programs, an increase of $1.1 billion over the $4.5 billion spent in 1994.
They sought a total increase in budget authority from $28.8 billion to $31.7
billion, an increase of $2.8 billion or 9.9 percent.
<P>
     The appropriation for the Department of Education has more than
doubled in the last fourteen years from around $15 billion to over $31
billion. From 1981-1992, the amount the U.S. Congress appropriated for the
Department of Education was actually greater than the amounts that
Presidents Reagan and Bush requested in their budgets every single year.
Since President Clinton has taken office, the President's request for the
Department of Education has exceeded the appropriation. It is also
interesting to note that the amount spent by the Department of Education for
post-secondary education (programs that include student loans, Pell Grants,
research grants, etc.) was greater than the amount spent on elementary and
secondary education from 1981-1990. This was because the original role of
the federal government in education was to ensure access to post-secondary
education and to fund research programs. The Clinton Administration has
reversed this historical breakdown and now spends more on elementary and
secondary education than on post-secondary education. This is unfortunate
since a greater percentage of federal spending on post-secondary education
actually helps individual students gain access to education. By contrast, most
of the federal money spent on elementary and secondary education goes to
fund the education bureaucracies and comes with burdensome mandates to
the state and local education agencies. Students benefit only from a very
small percentage of federal government spending on elementary and
secondary education.
<P>
     The goal of the 104th Congress, both in rescissions for the 1995
budget and in authorizations for future years, must be to evaluate each and
every one of the over 240 Department of Education categorical programs
(up from 140 programs in 1980) and determine whether these programs
actually improve the education of our children. The Congress also must
consolidate effective programs, eliminate ineffective programs, and stop
funding programs that benefit bureaucracies. To meet these ends, Congress
should make the following specific reforms:
<P>
End Several Programs. The Clinton Administration proposed cutting 34
categorical programs from the Department of Education. The 103rd
Congress cut only 13 of the programs. The 104th Congress should start by
rescinding funding for the remaining programs, including: the Ellender
Fellowships (Close-Up Foundation), Education for Native Hawaiians,
Foreign Language Assistance, Consumer and Homemaking Education, State
Student Incentive Grants, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Leadership Program,
Cooperative Education, Assistance to Guam, College Housing and Academic
Facilities Loan Program, Public Library Construction, Library Literacy
Programs, Library Education and Training, Library Research and
Demonstrations, Foreign Periodicals Program, Impact Aid 3(b) Payments,
Educational Partnerships Program, Immigrant Education, Dropout Prevention
Demonstrations, Vocational Education Community Based Organizations, and
Civics Education.
<P>
Change Recently Enacted Programs. There were four major education
programs either created or reauthorized in 1993 and 1994. All of these
programs, including Goals 2000: Educate America Act, reauthorization of
federal elementary and secondary programs in the Improving America's
Schools Act, the Federal Direct Student Loan program, and the National
Service Trust Act of 1993 should be revisited.
<P>
Goals 2000: Educate America Act
President Clinton proposed spending $700 million in 1995 for Goals 2000,
an increase of $595 million over the 1994 level. He called for $1 billion a
year for this program, to continue indefinitely, beginning in fiscal year 1996.
Congress appropriated $403.4 million, up 298.4 percent from the $105
million appropriated in 1994. The Clinton Administration claims that states
must distribute 85 percent of their Goals 2000 grants to local educational
agencies which must then use the money to "create and implement content,
performance, and opportunity-to-learn standards in academic areas, improve
professional development and licensure, and improve curricula and teaching
practices in individual schools." Goals 2000 funds go to three new
educational bureaucracies: the National Education Goals Panel, the National
Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and a National
Skills Standards Board. None of these activities, despite rhetoric to the
contrary, will improve local schools. Many of these activities are merely
new mandates put on the states and localities. This ineffective program will
become much larger, more bureaucratic, and more expensive unless it is
downsized and eventually eliminated through the appropriations process.
<P>
Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act
 <P>    There are many areas in which funding can be cut and rescinded in
this expansive program. President Clinton requested $10.281 billion in his
1995 budget, and Congress appropriated $9.94 billion, a $475 million
increase from 1994. Much of this money goes to fund bureaucracies and
should be cut, including: the Eisenhower Professional Development
Program, Arts in Education, Eisenhower Professional Development Federal
Activities, Women's Educational Equity Fund for Improvement of
Education, Indian Elementary and Secondary Education, and the Ready to
Learn Act, among others. Congress should also alter the expansive Title I
program, perhaps giving the money directly to poor parents in the form of
educational vouchers that they can then use at the school of their choice.
<P>
The Federal Direct Student Loan Program
<P>     This act has done nothing to reduce the complexity of administering
student loans, eliminate unnecessary costs, and provide better service to
students and schools. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the Department of
Education has hired 600 new employees to administer the direct loan
programs and anticipates hiring 20,000 contract employees when the phase-
in of the program is completed. Congress should cap this program, which
has gone from being an "experimental" program when passed to a
"transitional" program. All new funding for this program should be
rescinded.
<P>
 The National Service Trust Act of 1993<P>
This act created a new bureaucracy, the Corporation for National and
Community Service, and a new entitlement for middle-class students. In
1995, Congress appropriated $575 million for National Service activities,
included in eight programs. This is an increase of $205 million from the
1994 appropriation. These numbers do not include the $791.8 million
appropriated in 1995 for the five programs operating under the Corporation
for National and Community Service. This amount is an increase of $216.4
million from the $575.4 million appropriated in 1994. These funds should
either be eliminated through rescission or merged into means-tested work
study and Pell Grant programs.<P>
Eliminate Institutional Aid. There are currently seven programs, totaling
$229.7 million, that aid specific institutions. Congress increased the
authorization for these institutions by $16.7 million in 1995. These programs
should be eliminated. Similarly, Congress currently appropriates $193
million to Howard University for the endowment and research programs. No
other university in this country receives such a high level of federal support.
The appropriations for Howard should be rescinded and eliminated, and the
university should rely on private sector support as do all other major private
universities.
<P>
     It is impossible, given the time constraints, to go into all of the other
programs that should be merged, eliminated, or rescinded. However, the
104th Congress should consider merging the many higher education grant
and campus-based programs into one grant, one loan, and one work study
program. It should reevaluate many of the programs falling under the
category of "Educational Research and Improvement" since many of these
programs do little to help educate children. It should privatize the student
loan collection program; revisit, eliminate, and consolidate many Chapter 2
block grant programs; and review and cut many of the categorical programs.
The appropriations committees will ultimately make many of the decisions
on which programs to eliminate. This subcommittee has the power actually
to improve American public education by eliminating many of the programs
containing the mandates and regulations that have strangled innovation for
the past 15 years.

<h2>Education Reform: Putting Power in Parents</h2>
<i><b>A column by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin</i></b> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As parents and members of a community, one of the greatest  
responsibilities we have is to educate our children. <p>
As the proverb goes, "It takes an entire village to raise a child." And there  
is perhaps no greater duty for that "village" than to make sure its children  
gain the knowledge, skills and confidence to succeed as adults and  
contribute to their community. <p>
Yet as parents and as a community, we have surprisingly little control 
over how our children are educated. Parents and communities are not 
given the tools or the authority they need to make sure their children are 
succeeding in the classroom. <p>
Currently the power and control over educating our children rests in  
Madison. We have an antiquated, centralized system of education where  
faceless bureaucrats decide how your child should be taught, then place a  
plethora of mandates on local school districts. These mandates tie the  
bands of parents and community leaders who want to have a real voice in  
the education of their children, and they stifle innovation and creativity in  
the classroom. <p> 
In short, the current education system trusts government more than it  
trusts parents and communities. <p> 
Somewhere along the way, government responsibility replaced parental  
responsibility. Somewhere along the way, the bureaucracy became more  
important than the children. Somewhere along the way, defending the  
status quo took precedence over pursuing innovation and improvement. <p> 
No more. The challenge now facing our state is to make the needed  
changes to our education system to put power back into the hands of  
parents, school boards, classroom  teachers and local taxpayers. <p> 
We need to put our trust back into the "village," empowering our parents  
and communities to decide what is best for our children's education.  
trusting parents -- what a radical idea. <p> 
If Thorpe is facing a problem with its schools, I trust that the people of  
Thorpe are best equipped to resolve that problem, not a group of  
bureaucrats in Madison. <p> 
When it comes to education, one size does not fit all. We must give local  
communities the flexibility to meet the unique needs of their children. <p> 
My budget provides an array of initiatives that will facilitate the shift in  
power over education from Madison to our local communities. This starts  
with building a new education structure for the state. The current  
bureaucracy is too mired in the past to change and too self-serving to  
seriously pursue a better way.  <p> 
The new Department of Education proposal in the budget will serve as a  
catalyst for change to a system that cares more about the future of our  
children than about the future of bureaucratic jobs -- a system that trusts  
parents, not government. <p> 
The Department of Education's role will be clear: serve the public. The  
department will help set educational standards for the state and make sure  
our children are meeting those standards (via testing, etc.), but otherwise  
it will step aside and give local communities the flexibility to teach their  
children as they see fit. <p> 
Parents, school boards, teachers, community leaders and local  
taxpayers will work together to chart the best course for their children to  
meet the state's educational standards. The Department of Education  
will serve as a resource center, there to help communities when asked. <p> 
The budget also includes unique programs that meet the same goal of  
giving more control over education to the local community. <p> 
The charter schools initiative gives every community in the state the  
ultimate in flexibility to design schools to meet their unique needs. This  
initiative allows -- and encourages - communities to be innovative and  
visionary in meeting its children's needs. <p>
The public school choice proposal would allow every parent the choice of  
which public school to send their child. If a parent is unhappy with their  
child's school, they would now have a choice. There's no doubt that this  
will help improve the overall quality of all our public schools. <p> 
For Milwaukee only, we would allow low-income parents to send their  
child to a private school if they so choose. With nearly half of the  
students in Milwaukee Public Schools failing to graduate we need to try  
radical ideas that empower parents, particularly poor, minority parents.  
Remember, we all pay the consequences when a young man or woman  
fails to graduate and subsequently falls into a life of government  
dependence. <p> 
This budget is dedicatcd to the pursuit of excellence in education. making  
sure our children can compete -- and win -- in the global marketplace. <p> 
We need to restore some common sense to our education system, and that  
begins with returning power to parents and communities. <p>
When Milwaukee Public Schools Superintendent Howard Fuller resigned  
recently, he recited the words of William Daggett, who I believe puts our  
education priorities in the proper perspective.  <p> 
Daggett said, "We must love our children's hopes, dreams and prayers  
more than we love the institutional heritage of the school system." <p> 
In short, we need to return power to the village so its people can  
properly raise our children. We need to trust parents and communities,  
not government. <p>

<title>Heritage Lecture: Getting Gov't Out of Higher Education -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><b>Heritage Lecture No. 533

<h3>Getting Government Out of Higher Education</h3>
<p>
By Jon Westling
Provost and President-elect, Boston University, delivered May 3, 1995
<p>

One of the pleasures of visiting Washington is the sense of reassurance which gleams from the limestone and marble buildings, the Capitol dome, and the sober monuments. Those of us who live and work far outside the Beltway sometimes need that reassurance, which is a little like the need parents feel when leaving a son or daughter in the safekeeping of a university. After eighteen years of the hard and loving work of raising a child, parents rightly expect a college to be vigilant, caring, and prudent. Nonetheless, as the station wagon pulls away from the curb in front of the dormitory, many a parent suppresses a shudder at what may actually lie ahead.<p>
That feeling is particularly familiar to me because less than a week ago, Boston University submitted an important set of forms to the Department of Education:  our application for continued certification to participate in "Title IV Student Financial Aid Programs."  Except in certain government agencies, of course, eight or nine pounds of paperwork is not the equivalent of a child, but I do feel a certain parental responsibility to this certification homunculus. Boston University labored over it for fourteen weeks and spent about 2,700 hours of employee time feeding it data. We stayed up nights when it had the colic, and we even changed it frequently, as we found that the bureaucrats at DOE who devised the 26 separate schedules hadn't bothered to consult over definitions such as what constitutes an "academic program." <p>

 Anyway, we have now entrusted our little bundle to the DOE and, like the parents in the station wagon, are putting a brave face on our fears. We have confidence that those DOE people are scrupulous and that it was somehow our own fault that it took 2,700 hours --       almost 1 1/2 man-years -- to complete the form, since those scrupulous DOE folk say right on page three of the instructions, "the estimated time to complete the application is three hours." <p>

 The instructions also say, "Most institutions will have the information required for the  application readily available."  This, I admit, is a little more worrisome. I grant that my experience as a university administrator is limited entirely to twenty years at Boston University, so it may be that other colleges and universities routinely permute data on admissions and financial aid according to six or seven disparate formulas. We don't, but Boston University will be able to catch up now that DOE has shown us this remarkable productivity-enhancing tool. <p>

Filling in this application helped Boston University accomplish one of the goals of education:  It made us a little more self-aware. We now know, for example, that of the 35,979 students who enrolled in at least one Boston University course in 1994, precisely ten did not possess a high school diploma. Thanks to the DOE, our cup runneth over with such factoids -- although, I admit, we are not entirely sure what most of them have to do with our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. One would think DOE would observe that our default rate on guaranteed student loans is 4.7 percent, which is 21.3 percent below the so-called "cohort-default rate threshold," and that would be that. <p>

The United States is, by any account, the world's leader in higher education. It has achieved that status by building in the last two hundred years a tremendously diverse array of independent colleges and universities which grew up with distinct educational philosophies and missions. Many were begun by religious denominations, others by self-educated visionaries, some by businessmen and entrepreneurs concerned with the need for educated workers. Typically, they adopted the form that Thomas Jefferson gave to the University of Virginia:  They were governed by boards of trustees charged with making sure the institution lived up to its educational mission. <p>

A lot has changed, little of it for the better. Higher education today is beset with self-inflicted problems. The wrenching of curricula to fit the bizarre doctrines of multiculturalism has left a dislocated and miseducated generation of college graduates. At all-too-many     supposedly elite campuses, students imbibe the theory of writing but can't write beyond a junior high school level. At more than a few universities, we have the shameful spectacle of students -- and faculty members -- shouting down speakers whose views they find exceptionable. Faculty unions, tenured layabouts, charging grant overhead for floral arrangements -- the sweet whiff of corruption -- all these derelictions of responsibility are now well-known, especially to this audience. Tempting as it is, however, I have not come here today to bury these faults deeper in obloquy. <p>

For, in addition to the self-inflicted wounds, higher education bears some other bruises. I draw your attention to the Good Samaritan who thrashes us with a club each time one of us staggers to his feet. I refer, of course, to the federal government and its handy cudgel, the Department of Education. <p>

The DOE no doubt means well. Congress has asked it to fix the problem of soaring default rates in the federally insured student loan program. The problem itself is not intractable, but the combination of experts and tools and instructions which Congress and DOE have assembled is cause for some apprehension. Imagine balancing your checkbook with the aid of three economists, a socket wrench, a can of spray paint, and a copy of Black's Law Dictionary, and you will have some sense of the situation. I'll come to the details in a minute. If matters proceed in this fashion, we still will not have a balanced checkbook, but government bureaucrats will be in charge of virtually every detail of what colleges and universities do. <p>

In speaking of threats, I do not mean to sound like the moping owl in the ivy-mantled tower who "does to the moon complain."  Along with the threats, there are some great opportunities, and this is an occasion to point those out too. If we can pull back from the brink, we will find that American higher education still has tremendous potential to contribute to the vigor, the intellectual and spiritual richness, and the prosperity of American life. <p>

But the brink is real. American higher education is on the verge of losing its most precious asset. It is abandoning or being forced to abandon its robust independence, and it will fade into something worse than mediocrity if the government's regulatory assault is not stopped. <p>

Before describing that regulatory rampage, I should say a word or two about my perspective. "Never confess, never, never confess," says Joseph Conrad's deeply observant man of the sea, Marlowe. I will nonetheless divulge that I was a civil rights protester in the early 1960s. I retain a strong conviction that society can change for the better and that government has an important part to play in that process. I agree with Edmund Burke that, "A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation," and that to criticize is one thing, but "at once to preserve and to reform is quite another." <p>

Until the 1960s, the federal government intruded very little into university management. The GI Bill and the research funding that followed World War Two were accompanied by surprisingly little red tape. Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, however, changed this. By     establishing numerous programs designed to expand access to higher education, the federal government became enmeshed in the attempt to re-shape higher education. <p>

Many of these programs had broad bipartisan and public support. At first, the reams of new government regulations seemed a harmless enough price for programs that promised to benefit everyone, including colleges and universities. Few had the foresight to see that, over the next thirty years, Congress would transform programs meant to open doors to educational opportunities into welfare systems. <p>

Federally insured student loans, for example, were designed with the help of conservative legislators as a means of providing greater access to higher education with a minimum of government involvement. Initially, they expanded opportunity on an equal basis, assisting anyone who met the usual criteria for getting into college. Over these thirty years, however, they have been increasingly used by the government as a low-visibility way to  subsidize selected institutions. <p>

The program began with default rates comparable to those accepted by commercial    lenders. In 1972, the government lifted the ceiling beyond what any commercial lender would tolerate -- and, finding it was good, lifted it again in 1976, in 1978, and in 1983. It is now 25 percent for most institutions and more for "historically black colleges and universities [and] tribally-controlled community colleges."  The average default rate at proprietary schools is over 30 percent. <p>

At the same time, the government began lowering the minimum academic standards   necessary to qualify for loans. Today, neither a high school diploma nor equivalency exam is required for taking out a federally guaranteed loan for what is called "post-secondary" education. Finally, the default rates have soared partly because the government is unwilling to require "disadvantaged" members of society to pay back the loans. <p>

In short, today's student loan crisis is largely the result of permitted defaults by unqualified students who borrowed money to attend vocational schools which provided inadequate education and few job prospects. <p>

Neither universities nor private lenders would have, on their own, permitted the student loan crisis. The key ingredient was Congress, which insisted that the real decisions about who would receive the student loans would be made by the federal government. This is one instance of how the federal government's attempts to direct higher education have gone awry. I do not have time to present anything like a systematic account of the destruction Congress has wrought in this area in the last three decades, but I will try to give you a Cook's tour of the most monumental follies. Our first stop has been the Great Converge,  formerly known as the Great Divide. Rivers once flowed east and west from this point. Institutions, ideas, and people went their separate ways. But Congress, through some elegant diversions, has now ensured that everything flows to Washington. <p>

I should also like to suggest some ways in which these monuments to folly can be replaced with the verdant fields and pleasant vistas of good sense. In the case of federally insured student loan programs, good sense points in one clear direction. The programs should again be made commercially viable. The exemptions for those institutions which are allowed to exceed the 25 percent default rate should be abolished, and the tolerated default rate should be lowered to a commercially acceptable level. No student who is not a high school graduate or who has not passed a high school equivalency examination should be  considered qualified for federally insured student loans. <p>

New educational institutions or ones which have exceeded the default rate threshold should be required to put up an insurance bond to protect against future loan defaults. I would add to this that tuition refund regulations should be clearly defined; the current state of confusing formulae leads to abuse. <p>

We should take a close look at the patterns of abuse and respond accordingly. Physicians, for example, are close to the top in the rankings of those who default on student loans. This could be corrected almost overnight by barring Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements to doctors who default on their student loans and who fail to make amends within one year. That principle can be extended. Loan recipients who default and fail to make amends within one year should be barred from receiving any federal funds or contracts. <p>

These initiatives will return student loan programs to what was originally intended:  expanded educational opportunity at modest cost. In 1970, the taxpayer's bill for guaranteed student loans was $2.3 million on a volume of $770 million. In 1993, the bill had grown to $5 billion on a volume of $18 billion. Adjusted to 1993 dollars, the cost to taxpayers per  dollar loaned has risen from about .28 cents in 1970 to 28 cents in 1993. That is a 9,900 percent increase. <p>

If we knew then what we know now, or if the clock could be turned back thirty years,  perhaps we would not choose to go down the road of federally insured student loans. In that case, there would be far fewer colleges and universities, and there would be far fewer students at those which remained. But this is like wishing for a United States with an agrarian economy. We can't undo the past. This society has made a commitment to mass higher education. The attempt to reel in the percentage of the young who attend college to a European or Japanese level is not politically feasible, even in the unlikely event that we   decided it would be a good idea. <p>

Besides, as we have seen, there are simple ways in which the federally insured student loan crisis can be -- and should have been -- solved. Unfortunately, Congress and the Department of Education had an entirely different idea. They responded by adding yet more bureaucratic regulation and by making the programs even less commercially viable. The most intrusive part of this misguided response involves university and college accreditation. <p>


I approach this topic with a little trepidation. H.L. Mencken once called the Bible Belt "the Sahara of the Beaux Arts."  Accreditation is something like the Death Valley of the life of the mind. It is a dusty plain, leagues below the sea level of normal human cogitation, inhabited by scorpions and sidewinders. I could tell tales of college administrators stranded in this desperate landscape and languishing after mirage oases labeled "the assessment movement" and "teaching portfolios."  But that's for another time. What I am concerned with now is the invasion of the dirt-bikers. <p>

Accreditation at its best puts quacks out of business, but it is more typically a technique used by professional interests to feather their own nests. The most egregious example is the American Bar Association, which has a stranglehold on American legal education. Many of the ABA accreditation rules have only gossamer connections to the quality of legal education, but all of them have a laser-like focus on the perquisites of being a law professor -- down to specifying the number of square feet in each faculty member's office. You can get a fair picture of the world of specialized accreditation by imagining 250 or so would-be ABAs, each carping for a finer grade of ivory in its part of the tower. <p>

When all is said and done, however, we university administrators have a certain grudging respect for the specialized accreditors. Some know their business, and at worst they are driven by old-fashioned greed. In any case, specialized accreditors do not come close to the other great branch of academic accreditation, the regional accreditation agencies, for exemplifying lassitude, incompetence, and day-to-day bewilderment, combined with a solemn sense of rectitude and, of course, a desire to augment their authority. I realize that that description could apply rather well to several government agencies, but the regional accreditation agencies are not -- or not quite -- part of government. They are part of that shadowy world of quasi-governmental agencies which enjoy governmental authority but are largely unaccountable. <p>

The six regional accreditation agencies, which accredit whole institutions rather than   specific programs, gain their prominence from the stipulation that only accredited colleges and universities can participate in federal financial aid programs, including the Title IV    student loan programs. <p>

In 1992, when Congress recognized that default rates had gotten out of hand, it observed, correctly, that some of the worst offenders were schools that it had exempted from the   loan-default rate ceilings, along with a small number of proprietary schools. You and I could probably think of several solutions to this problem. I've sketched some of those earlier. But it's unlikely that in our most demented fantasies we would come up with the particular answer that Congress wrote into the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992. Instead of merely shutting off the spigot to the offending institutions, Congress decided to turn the      regional accreditation agencies into an enforcement wing of the Department of Education. <p>

Instead of isolating problem institutions and kicking them out of the program, it told accreditation agencies that they would be responsible for fixing the problem, on pain of losing their ability to operate. This brings us to our current pass, in which the Department of Education and several of the accreditation agencies, operating under the curious but imposing title "The National Policy Board," have developed a proposal to nationalize accreditation. <p>

The arid landscape of accreditation is now roaring with joy-riding regulators, the dirt-bikers of Death Valley. Again, the solution is common sense. Congress must intervene to keep government from taking over accreditation. The linkage between accreditation and the    Department of Education must be broken, and the government-mandated monopoly of    accreditation agencies should be abolished. <p>

I can think of several very concrete things Congress could do to bring some sanity back to this process. First, Congress should change the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992 to eliminate the requirement that higher education accrediting agencies themselves be accredited. This requirement is at the bottom of DOE's attempt to take over accreditation and of the National Policy Board's attempt to nationalize the system. <p>

Accreditation agencies should be, in effect, accredited by their customers. If they have anything worthwhile to offer colleges and universities, colleges and universities will pay them for it. Generally, colleges and universities will pay to be reviewed by the agency which has the strictest standards that the institution thinks it can pass. A free market in accreditation agencies will quickly stratify, with the toughest agencies attracting the best colleges and universities. The public will benefit from a genuine ranking system. <p>

Congress should eliminate the link between accreditation and eligibility for federal funds, including federally guaranteed student loans (Title IV). Accreditation should be about the quality of academic programs, not about the rate at which students default on government-backed loans. <p>

Congress should also stipulate that the Department of Education has no role to play in   accrediting institutions of higher education. The DOE has made clear that it is not a good judge on issues of academic quality, and the prospect of its telling others how to promote academic quality is grimly amusing. <p>

Let us leave Death Valley. I have a great deal of hope that the current Congress will undo the mischief of years past, but it is a vast and bleak landscape, and relief is long overdue. The next stop on this tour is the Old Growth Forest, a place of deep calm, even torpor, where the government has decided there will be no harvesting of even the most mature trees. The Old Growth Forest lies in pleasant Tenure County. The deep calm exists because those who live there know that no matter how feeble their performance, how desultory their efforts to keep up with the times, and how pressing the need to start new seedlings, Congress has determined they can stay put so long as they can breathe. <p>

As of January 1994, universities and colleges are no longer permitted to have a mandatory retirement age for faculty. This intrusion into the terms of faculty employment nominally makes professors like workers in any other sector of the economy. But in reality, it does nothing of the kind, because no other part of the economy is encumbered with the tenure system. This law has effectively given tenured faculty a lifetime appointment. <p>

The problem clearly has two sides. Universities and colleges should be seeking ways to  reform or abolish tenure. The traditional legs on which tenure stands are economic security and academic freedom. Economic security is a fine thing, but in universities it should never trump competence. And the major threats to academic freedom today come not from a repressive society but from repressive ideologies espoused mostly by those who live under the cover of tenure. Boston University successfully abolished tenure in its Medical and  Dental Schools in 1973, and we have been making some inroads in other areas since, most recently by offering some faculty members long-term contracts instead of tenure. It is,   however, a hard nut to crack. A single institution has to have powerful attractions to recruit individuals who have the possibility of guaranteed lifetime employment at a competing institution. <p>

By outlawing mandatory retirement for faculty, the government is making the effort to eliminate tenure even more difficult, and it is -- inadvertently -- closing opportunities for many other people. The life of most senior faculty members is generally not so strenuous. Many faculty members are willing to keep going in the absence of a stick or a carrot that gives them some incentive to stop. The result is that there is less turnover and fewer positions for faculty members who are attempting to establish their careers. <p>

 The Old Growth Forest is getting older. Congress must repeal the law which prohibits universities and colleges from setting mandatory retirement ages for faculty. <p>

The enxt stop on our tour is the High Plateau, the setting for a wonderful new institution, Learning Disabled University. LDU got its start from laws designed to prohibit discrimination against the handicapped. The Americans With Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are being used -- perhaps contrary to legislative intention, but nonetheless -- to force colleges and universities to lower academic standards. <p>

Children are now reaching college having been swaddled for years in the comforting illusions of learning disabled theory. Enormous numbers of students in grade school and high school have been diagnosed "learning disabled."  In Massachusetts, almost one in five      students is crammed into this category. The national average is twelve percent. Are we in the midst of a silent genetic catastrophe? <p>

LDU is trying to keep LD philosophy students safe from the perplexities of Aristotle, to accommodate foreign language majors who have foreign language phobia, and to comfort physics students who suffer from dyscalculia, which is, of course, the particular learning   disablement that prevents one from learning math. <p>

I do not wish to imply that Boston University has escaped all the moonbeams illuminating campuses coast to coast. A month or so ago, I discovered that our Office of Disability Services had, without permission, begun issuing exemptions from the language and math  requirements on precisely the bases I described. I put a stop to it, and now I await as intrepidly as a brewer of hot coffee the lawsuits that are sure to follow. I think, for example, of the suit against Tufts University, filed by a student who claimed that Tufts was required  under the ADA to accommodate her psychological disability, which consisted of an aversion to taking tests. <p>

Nor do I wish to mislead you by suggesting that Learning Disabled University is entirely the province of students and their LD counselors. I think, for example, of the former philosophy professor that Boston University fired after finding him guilty of sexually assaulting another faculty member and of forcing his attentions on three undergraduate students. He responded with the novel defense that his lecherous behavior was the result of a disability:  namely, inhibitions chronically lowered by his ingestion of prescription drugs. He is now   suing Boston University, claiming that his behavior was protected by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. I wish I were making this up, but I'm not. <p>

The disability laws are sacred cows, but they must at the very least be tethered so that they cannot be used to force universities to lower academic and other standards. <p>

My tour of follies in higher education has concentrated on sites that have benefited, so to speak, from Congress's helping hand. The Great Converge of student loan programs, the Death Valley of accreditation, the Old Growth Forest of mandatory retirement, and the High Plateau, home to Learning Disabled University, could not have become what they are without the wise counsel of Congresses past. <p>

I am conscious that in this speech I have been finding a great deal of fault with existing  arrangements. Burke, whom I referred to before, also observed that "those who are habitually employed in finding and displaying faults are unqualified for the work of reformation.... By hating vices too much, they come to love men too little."  In fact, I do not think I am    habitually employed in finding fault; this is a rather special occasion. <p>

Also, by concentrating on the evils brought on higher education by the government, I do not mean to suggest that only government can solve the problems it has created. Boston University, for example, has a number of initiatives which show how universities can help get government off the back of higher education. <p>

We have sought to lessen our dependence on federal research funding through Boston University's Community Technology Foundation, a venture capital fund established to develop the commercial potential of the work of our own researchers. We have invested about $60 million in Seragen, Inc., a start-up biotechnology company based on a breakthrough by a researcher in our Medical School. Seragen is currently in Stage III Clinical   Trials for a promising treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. <p>

Disregarding Conrad's advice yet again, I must also note that Boston University has received several large federal grants -- earmarked funds, if you will -- which paid part of the costs of very expensive science and engineering facilities on our campus. The Heritage Foundation is a place where one does not expect such a statement to be met with resounding applause, but I mention it for good reason. Our nation's universities are one of its major sources of commercially developable ideas and patents. The nation as a whole stands to gain a great deal economically and in other ways by treating some universities, in some respects, like venture capital firms. The public should invest in those who have the energy, the  know-how, and the overall promise to deliver -- and then wait and see. Government micromanagement of research grants is wasteful. Perhaps paradoxically, and certainly contrary to the assumptions of many, pork barrel projects often give the public its best return. <p>

That's my apostasy for the day. Boston University has taken some other steps that I am more confident you will agree are in the right direction. We have shown it isn't necessary to take a laissez-faire attitude toward drugs, toward uncivilized behavior in the dorms, and     toward bully-boy political behavior on the streets in order to attract students. <p>

We have shown that it is still possible to have a university that isn't kidding when it says that its principal mission is the pursuit of truth. <p>

I observed at the outset that leaving a child at college for the first time leaves a parent with some anxiety. I rather facetiously compared that to the anxiety a university administrator feels entrusting to the DOE the mounds of make-work the federal government now demands of us. There is, however, a more serious side to this anxiety. Most children learn to live responsibly with the freedom of campus life as a prelude to the responsibilities of full adulthood. With some trepidation, parents grant their children the independence to live up to the challenges. <p>

We'd like a government that has at least that much faith in its citizens. American higher education is one of this country's most outstanding accomplishments. A federal government that is prudently supportive is all we need. Most things we can do better on our own. <p>

<B><FONT SIZE=5>Crime:</B></FONT><P>
Aside from a handful of federal responsibilities, most criminal justice issues are a local matter and the Congress in Washington should let state and local governments deal with them.  If the Congress wants to do more about crime, it should lift the federal tax burden on the states and let them raise money for law enforcement and prisons.  I'm in favor of truth-in-sentencing, but I think John Engler, Tommy Thompson, Bill Weld, and the other governors can run their own prison systems.  If Members of Congress want to set the length of state prison sentences, they ought to resign and run for state legislator.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Drug Legalization:</B></FONT><P>
The last thing we should do is make drugs legal.  That would only make them more available, dramatically increase the number of babies born having been exposed to drugs when their mothers were pregnant, increase the number of children and coworkers who use drugs, and make it almost impossible for addicts to quit.  We made great strides in the late 1980s in reducing drug use and we should keep at it.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  America 2000 v. Goals 2000:</B></FONT><P>
We need to send education back to states, communities and families -- where it belongs.  That was the idea behind America 2000.  The Clinton Administration's Goals 2000 goes in exactly the opposite direction.  They've turned a national movement into a federal program.<P> 
	* America 2000 was all about encouraging high standards in the core academic subjects.  Goals 2000 is about how much is spent on education.<P> 
	* America 2000 was about making schools more accountable for their performance.  Goals 2000 makes it harder to know how well schools are doing.<P>
	* America 2000 sought to give all families more choices of all schools.  Goals 2000 creates more obstacles for choice.<P>
<HR WIDTH=30%> 
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  The Federal Role:</B></FONT><P>
Abolish the Department of Education in order to liberate parents and schools.  On January 26, I testified before the U.S. Congress and argued that it should take each activity currently housed in the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) send it home to states and communities; (b) entrust it to another federal agency; or (c) terminate it and return the money to the taxpayers.  I've been looking at this issue for more than 15 years and I am convinced that the people in a position to know what is best for education are those closest to the child.  Education policy should be geared toward giving parents and teachers more control over what goes on in the classroom.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Gun Control:</B></FONT><P>
I have never thought gun control equalled crime control.  If we are really interested in controlling crimes involving guns, we should have stricter penalties against those who commit the crimes.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Health Care Reform:</B></FONT><P>
Our health care system is still in need of repair.  When President Clinton tried to fix it last year, he went in exactly the wrong direction:  a "one size fits all" plan, run by Washington, D.C., full of new rules, mandates, and penalties.  We shouldn't repeat his mistakes.  We need to involve all 50 governors to help advance some important reforms state-by-state.  A few basic insurance reforms would make health insurance more flexible and easier to keep when we change jobs or move.  We should also amend the tax code so that individuals who buy health insurance get the same break that companies and their employees now receive.  It is also time we started looking at medical IRAs, the most direct way of giving individuals control over their own health care costs.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>History Curriculum Standards Sponsored by the Administration:</B></FONT><P>
They are not standards Lynne Cheney and I had in mind when we encouraged school boards to adopt voluntary educational standards. The history panel ended up presenting a warped view of our nation's past.  President Clinton should condemn these standards and make sure they are not promulgated or endorsed by the federal government.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Medicaid:</B></FONT><P>
We would save money -- and deliver better medical care to the poor -- if we capped the growth of spending but gave governors the power to run Medicaid as they see fit.
<BR>
<BR>
The best way to reform Medicaid is the welfare "swap."  President Reagan tried a version of this in the early 1980s. The first step is to give the states complete responsibility  for welfare in exchange for the federal government picking up a comparable portion of state Medicaid expenditures.  The second step is to delegate responsibility for administering the program back to the states without the mandates from Washington.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>School Prayer:</B></FONT><P>
I signed a bill permitting a moment of silence in schools in 1981 and I would sign one again today.  We should remember that on the first day of the very first session of Congress, the House and the Senate adopted the Bill of Rights.  On the second day, they adopted a national day of prayer called "Thanksgiving."
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Welfare:</B></FONT><P>
Instead of fixing welfare in Washington for the sixth time, we should end welfare reform in Washington. Let's end welfare as a federal program and send responsibility for it back to the states, communities, and private agencies.  States are way ahead of Washington on this one.  Michigan requires all welfare recipients to get a job, go to school, or do volunteer community service.  Wisconsin says two years and you're out.  Massachusetts says 60 days.  California docks welfare checks when kids don't go to school.  New Jersey doesn't pay more to mothers on welfare who have more children.  I would add:  no marriage penalty, no added benefits for children born to unmarried mothers on welfare, a certain end to payments to able-bodied adults after a set time, jail time for deadbeat dads, no payment to anyone who commits a crime while on welfare, reduction of welfare for parents whose children quit school, privatize job finding programs.

<b>David Sacks and Peter Thiel</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number74</i></center><p>
	Recent revelations in <i>U.S. News and World Report</i>'s annual college guide that the cost of a top undergraduate degree now exceeds $100,000 may represent a watershed. At more than $25,000 a year, many students and their families will have to think hard about whether an Ivy-League education is worth the expense. For some parents, the answer will be to send their capable child to a less prestigious university or college for about $50,000 less. Most parents, however, will decide to scrimp, save, and sacrifice -- and perhaps take out a second mortgage on their home -- rather than turn down that rare admission offer from a Harvard, Yale, Brown, or Duke.<p>	By no means unrepresentative of what is meant by a "prestige" school is Stanford University, consistently ranked in the top five in <i>U.S. News</i>'s survey and privileged by an ideal climate, sumptuous facilities, and a $2-billion endowment. The yearly competition for admission reflects this status: More than 15,000 applicants vie for 1,600 places in the freshman class. A year there does not come cheaply: $25,749 for tuition, room, and board -- about the cost of a new BMW 325i.<p>	For almost every year in the last two decades, Stanford's tuition increases have outpaced inflation and, more importantly, the rate of personal income growth in the United States. The increases primarily fund what Gerhard Casper, Stanford's president, has called a "mini-welfare state" -- an ever-expanding range of student services and new programs centered around the university's multicultural "experiment." In the 1980s, then-president Donald Kennedy declared that Stanford's multicultural venture was "a bold experiment that must succeed," and the university began spending with a vengeance to make sure it did.<p>	To administer its great experiment, Stanford employs nearly 7,000 staff—more than one bureaucrat for every undergraduate -- including a $50,000-a-year "Multicultural Educator." (By contrast, there are only 1,400 faculty members.) And there is a large assortment of new m
ulticultural departments (feminist studies, African-American studies, Chicano studies, Asian-American studies, Native-American studies), ethnic centers, "residential education" (which receives more than $3 million a year), and new classes and conferences. In 1991, the university established an Office for Multicultural Development as a cabinet-level department and invested it with sweeping powers to ensure the university's "transformation."<p>	You can't achieve transformation on the cheap. Stanford raised tuition by 5 percent this year, 7.5 percent a year ago, and a whopping 9.5 percent for the 1992-93 school year. A record two-thirds of undergraduates (and an even higher percentage of graduate students) now receive some form of financial aid. However generous this aid, the squeeze invariably falls on parents or the students themselves. And much of it is unnecessary: Last year, the <i>Stanford Review</i> examined the 1993-94 university budget for ways to cut costs and reduce tuition. The <i>Review</i> identified $10 million in savings by merging scaled-back gender- and race-studies departments with other programs. The paper saved an additional $1 million by eliminating "multicultural dorm programming." All told, the Review produced a plan to reduce Stanford's tuition by about 14 percent by trimming multicultural programs.<p>It would be welcome. Explains Patrick Callahan, executive director of the California Higher Education Policy Center, "There is close to a middle-class panic in this country from increases in tuition by private and public institutions."<p>Such fear is hardly overblown. In the trendy world of academia, which covets the latest politically correct program like a shiny new hood ornament, there is competition to keep up with the Stanfords. Yet Stanford's tuition ranks only 41st of 106 private colleges and universities surveyed by Cambridge Associates. <p>Many parents may be shocked to learn that the extra expense has not increased the quality of a undergraduate degree at Stanford, but rather ha
s undermined it. Students can still receive first-rate training in engineering, the sciences, and economics, where results are more testable. But many humanities and social science students will find themselves awash in courses that trivialize logical thinking and seem incapable of taking history, ideas, or truth seriously.<p>The curriculum boasts of literature courses that filter Shakespeare through the lens of lesbianism, American history courses that find no time to teach about the Constitution, English classes that require students to write grant proposals for environmental groups, and psychology courses that give high marks for finding "gender discrepancies" in pizza parlors. In short, much of the undergraduate humanities curricula has been transformed into a vehicle for shameless politicization and indoctrination. Parents of these youngsters may begin to wonder why they didn't just keep the money and open up their very own McDonald's franchise.<p><b>The New Classics</b><p>With the now-notorious chant "hey hey, ho ho, Western Culture's got to go," Stanford's activists demanded in 1987 that the core reading list be dumped in order to make room for a new curriculum. Ever since the university capitulated to these demands, the humanities have been undergoing a quiet revolution. As a start, consider the multiple-track "Cultures, Ideas, and Values" (CIV) program, the relativist 15-unit requirement (about $8,000 per student) that replaced the Western Culture core:<p><ul>
<li>Required reading in the Philosophy CIV track includes works by Chief Seattle—the 19th-century Indian leader whose alleged writings were later judged to be just of a pale face. Although the instructors have retained Plato and Aristotle, they primarily use them to contrast the "logocentrism" of Western philosophers with the more holistic approach of Australian Aborigines (whose unwritten "philosophy" is explained by Western anthropologists). One of the class's feminist instructors, Carol Delaney, teaches that the American role in World War II is "phallocentric" because men invented the atomic bomb without women. She compares the Manhattan Project to Frankenstein, both evil attempts to thwart women's role in the reproductive process.<p><li>The Bible is still read in all the CIV tracks, but many classes teach that Genesis is rife with sexism, and some sections even make the Apostle Paul politically correct by saying he may have been homosexual. Shakespeare is also still studied in all the tracks, but <i>The Tempest</i> is now viewed from a "slave perspective" and is made to serve as a case study in Western imperialism.</ul><p>
	Although CIV is perhaps the single biggest waste of student tuition, it represents just the tip of the scandal. Multiculturalism has overrun most of the major humanities and social-sciences departments. The cumulative effect has been a kind of institutionalized silliness. Consider just some of the more blatant examples:<ul>
<p><li>"Black Hair as Culture and History," one of the new multicultural history seminars, addressed how black hair "has interacted with the black presence in this country, and how it has played a role in the evolution of black society." Lectures included "The Rise of the Afro" and "Fade-O-Rama, Braiding and Dreadlocks," and local hair stylists were brought in for a week of discussions. Enrolled students viewed the 1960s musical <i>Hair</i> and read the lyrics to Michael Jackson's hit single "Man in the Mirror." "I couldn't have taught this class 10 years ago," Kennell Jackson explains. "But people don't look at me like I'm crazy anymore. What history does has broadened considerably."<p>
<li>History 267, "The History of Rights in the United States," was so busy extolling 1960s protest ("rights") movements that the class never even studied the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.<p>
<li>"19th-Century American History," taught by Estelle Freedman, devoted half of class time to a study of women, because they had constituted half the U.S. population during that time. As a result of these priorities, the class did not have enough time to learn about the War of 1812. <p><li>"Religions in America," a religious-studies class that can satisfy three different graduation requirements, devoted whole lectures to Shamanism, the peyote cult, and the Kodiak sect, but not one to the Catholic Church. When discussed at all, Christianity was viewed from a feminist or gay "perspective" through such works as <i>Jesus Acted Up: A Gay and Lesbian Manifesto</i>, <i>A Second Coming Out</i>, and <i>Beyond the Father: Towards a Philosophy of Women's Liberation</i>.<p>
<li>Anthropology 1 (which can also fulfill three different graduation requirements) devoted lectures to "language imperialism" and criticized CNN for the phenomenon because the network broadcasts in English to non-English-speaking countries.<p><li>In Psychology 167D, students received academic credit for becoming "contraceptive peer counselors" and for demonstrating these skills by placing condoms on a plastic penis at dorm meetings. <p>
<li>In Stanford's mandatory freshman English classes, students are required to write grant proposals for their professors' favorite community-service agencies, including homeless advocacy projects, AIDS support groups, and environmental action leagues. Instead of focusing on reading and writing skills, these classes revolve around the "Community Service Writing Project," which assigns freshmen to such activities as answering telephones at Stanford's Center for Public Service and visiting East Palo Alto elementary schools. <p><li>Enrolling more than 100 students each quarter, Linguistics 73 is one of the most heavily subscribed courses fulfilling Stanford's new race-studies requirement. Entitled "African-American Vernacular English," the premise of the class is that inner-city slang (of the type heard in rap songs) is a legitimate dialect of the English language deserving scholarly attention.<p>
<li>"Interdisciplinary" courses provide the opportunity for politicization along several vectors. One example is "Peace Studies," taught by faculty from the departments of sociology, political science, psychology, history, and education. The class begins by defining "peace" as "collaborative well-being," a euphemism for a smorgasbord of the lecturers' pet policy choices -- nationalized health care, government-guaranteed employment, transfer payments to inner cities, radical feminism, and so forth -- all taught under the rubric of "peace." Meanwhile, the curriculum completely omitted the study of the origins of World War I, World War II, the War for Independence, or any other significant historical conflagrations. The Vietnam War and Gulf War were reviewed briefly, but only as they related to the "peace movement" and its (often unpacific) protests. The class's final lecture was entitled "Peace and You," in which the course's lecturers fondly recounted their own 1960s activism and exhorted students to join the "peace movement" and "to act responsibly and effectively on behalf of peace."<p><li>Comparative Literature 189, "Representing Sappho: the Literature of Lesbianism," sought, in the words of Terry Castle, "to resexualize lesbian history." Shakespeare's <i>As You Like It</i> was identified as a "<i>locus classicus</i> of lesbianism," and the remainder of the course readings -- books both new and old -- were probed for "male and female representations of lesbian desire" and for "lesbianism as 'symbolist,' 'decadent,' 'modernist,' and 'utopian' literary motif."</ul><p>Other courses addressing human sexuality:<p>
<ul>
<li>Feminist Studies 295, "How Tasty Were My French Sisters"; Comparative Literature 110, "The Politics of Desire: Representations of Gay and Lesbian Sexuality"; and Law 587, "The History and Politics of Sexual Orientation: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives."<p>
<li>"Representing Sexualities: Whitman to AIDS" (English 187D) is another of Stanford's X-rated English classes. The course syllabus warns that "sexually explicit materials, both hetero- and homoerotic, may be viewed and discussed in this class." Readings included articles entitled "A Posttranssexual Manifesto," "Capitalism and Gay Identity," "From Thoreau to Queer Politics," and "How to Bring Your Kids up Gay," in addition to two videos, "Voices from the Front," by the militant homosexual group ACT-UP, and "Tongues Untied," a pornographic gay film. Jay Grossman spent his first class session presenting an episode of the television comedy <i>Cheers</i> and then deconstructing the show as "homophobic." His first reading assignment was several weeks of a cartoon strip in which a teenage character reveals that he is gay. In Stanford's English department, if the material is trendy enough, it does not even have to be literature.<p>
<li>Psychology 116, "The Psychology of Gender," is based on the premise that gender discrimination is everywhere, and so, not surprisingly, the class tends to find it everywhere. In her Spring 1994 class, Laura Carstenson required students to complete a group research project. Her favorite project was entitled "Gender Discrepancies in Pizza Consumption." The student authors first conducted their laborious research by "observing couples eating at a local pizza restaurant and recording the number of slices each individual consumed," and concluded that "gender discrepancies exist not only in quantity, but also in rate of consumption." Because this class meets the new feminist-studies requirement, it is heavily enrolled each quarter; hundreds of students are enlisted in this kind of inane multicultural research. </ul><p>
Such anecdotes do not simply exist on the fringes of an otherwise terrific Stanford education. Many involve core classes that fulfill graduation requirements, subjects at the heart of a liberal-arts education. All students must take CIV and Freshman English. In addition, the university has imposed a number of "distribution requirements" (DRs) which can only be fulfilled by classes in certain areas. While there is no requirement in American History, for instance, all students -- including science majors -- are now required to take at least one course in feminist studies, one course on race theory, and one course on Third World cultures. There are three additional social-studies requirements, usually satisfied by classes from such departments as anthropology, English, and sociology where the multicultural revolution has been pushed furthest. "Psychology of Gender," "African-American Vernacular English," Anthropology 1, and "Religions in America" are all classes that fulfill Drs.<p>
	The DR system limits the flexibility of conscientious students who wish to avoid swallowing large quantities of academic junk food. Of the 180 units necessary for graduation, distribution requirements in new or revamped subjects like CIV, Freshman English, race studies, feminist studies, and multicultural social studies now constitute almost 60 units. As a result, even those students who pursue majors in economics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, or engineering will spend close to one-third of their four years at Stanford -- at a cost of about $25,000 per year -- studying thoroughly politicized multicultural requirements.<P>Just in case these requirements do not suffice, however, Stanford's multiculturalists provide powerful incentives to take their electives. The average grade in Stanford's humanities departments is above an A-. Many of the most radical multiculturalists are also radical egalitarians who give everyone As, so from a student's point of view their classes are not necessarily the ones to avoid. What student wouldn't be attracted to a class like Peace Studies, where a "take-home" midterm and an "open-book" final exam guarantee an easy A? Science majors are particularly prone to building "trophy transcripts" by taking multicultural courses whenever possible, because they face the stiffest competition in admission to graduate programs and medical schools. <p>For those students pursuing a degree in the humanities or social sciences, there are even fewer options. The numerous examples already mentioned -- all fairly indicative -- represent just the beginning of an indoctrination into New Age thinking. For these hapless students, being principled or conscientious about course selection simply does not make much difference: Instead of "Black Hair" or Feminist Studies 101, such a student might find himself in "19th-Century American History" or "History of Rights," where the course title falsely advertises the subject matter. While there are, of course, still many solid courses (and good teac
hers) at Stanford, especially in engineering and the hard sciences, Stanford's activists have largely succeeded in killing the core undergraduate humanities curriculum. <p><b>The Multicultural Waste Land</b><p>The death of the humanities at Stanford does not imply that institutions like it will serve no function whatsoever. In the hard sciences, economics, and engineering, our top colleges and universities will graduate people who have amassed an impressive array of scientific knowledge and technical skills. At the same time, business, law, and medical schools will continue to churn out trained professionals. From the outside perspective of companies seeking to hire new computer engineers, biochemists, or investment bankers, everything will continue as before.	<p>	But in the process, Stanford risks becoming a technical school, along the lines of MIT or Caltech -- highly esteemed in narrow areas of expertise and not much more. Behind the facade of normalcy, much may be lost. The university may be transformed into a multiversity, no longer capable of providing a universal framework for students to integrate a wide assortment of knowledge into a coherent whole. That kind of framework, so essential for thinking about the larger problems facing individuals and societies, simply cannot be provided by science; it must be gleaned from the humanities, and can be reached only after rigorous study -- in philosophy, literature, and history. <p>	Most students have only the vaguest notion of what some of the alternatives might be -- what Socrates, Jesus, or Jefferson said that might be relevant to the contemporary situation. They have only a minimal understanding even of the ideas that built the American regime. Most have not read John Locke or Adam Smith, much less <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, Alexis de Tocqueville, or Abraham Lincoln. Though the loss of this framework cannot readily be translated into dollars and cents, it will be felt keenly nonetheless, by a generation of students increasingly alienated from an inc
oherent and senseless world, unable even to diagnose the source of their troubles.<p>The scope of this loss has been hinted at, indirectly, by one of Casper's most sweeping proposals. He has suggested replacing the four-year undergraduate degree with a three-year degree. His proposal is particularly heretical, because it suggests that students are not getting much added value out of a fourth year at Stanford and that the university's distribution requirements might need to be scrapped. "If resources were available, I'd say four years are wonderful, the more the better," he says. "On a cost-benefit analysis, there will be more questions as to whether these four years are sustainable in the long run." <p>In a narrow sense, Casper was clearly right: If there was no real humanities program left, then a three-year professional education would represent a sensible change. At the same time, however, the call for such a drastic remedy indicated how much had been lost and how little else could be done about this loss.<p>If higher education in America is not altogether finished, then perhaps it is in the midst of a massive and unprecedented displacement. An intellectual renaissance in our traditional centers of higher learning may be a long time coming, but this does not necessarily imply that people simply will stop thinking in the intervening years. To the extent that it continues, intellectual life will likely shift from elite universities to historically less significant colleges that have survived the multicultural transformation, or move altogether outside the academic context.<p>New educational venues may arise and meet demands no longer being satisfied by existing institutions. One promising area involves new computer networks in which people connect with one another from all parts of the country to discuss matters of common interest. Not surprisingly, a number of these networks focus on areas that no longer have much of a place in the multicultural academy, such as free-market economics or Thomistic theology
. Because learning need not take place in the classroom, this sort of technological breakthrough may in time undermine the near-monopoly on higher education currently enjoyed by America's elite universities.<p>Admittedly, that distant prospect offers small solace to students who are eager to attend prestigious schools like Stanford, but are hard pressed to find there academic mentors to guide them toward answers to ancient and modern questions: What constitutes justice, rather than political propaganda about the size of welfare payments; what the Bible teaches about man's political nature, rather than radical speculation about the Apostle Paul's sexual orientation; or the Founders' view of slavery and race relations, instead of courses on hairstyles. At $100,000 for a degree, is that really asking too much?

<H2>NATIONAL HISTORY STANDARDS:  <BR>
 CLINTONITES MISS THE MOON</H2>

<P>
When Americans look back on the twentieth century, they may well
view the landing on the moon as <I>the</I> most significant event
of our time.  So said historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. 
<P>
Not if they are taught U.S. history according to the National
History Standards.  That's because, incredibly, the team that
labored for two years and spent $2 million in federal grants to
come up with &quot;world class&quot; standards completely missed
the moon.  They include references to &quot;Soviet advances in
space&quot; and to the <I>Challenger</I> disaster, but neglect
to mention that the United States won the space race.
<P>
Hardly an American has been unaffected by the U.S. landing on
the moon.  Thousands of us are alive today because of advances
in medical technology that are a &quot;spinoff&quot; of the space
program.  The computer revolution and the development of worldwide
communications networks are a direct result of the massive U.S.
drive to reach the moon.  Schlesinger is clearly right to signal
its importance.  And it is ironic that the national history standards,
rightly assailed by conservatives as &quot;politically correct,&quot;
should have effaced the memory of Jack Kennedy's most enduring
accomplishment.
<P>
It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the failure.  For the
Department of Education, this embarrassing public fiasco is indisputable
evidence of bureaucratic ineptitude.  If we adopt these amnesiac
history standards, we will succumb to a kind of national identity
crisis.  We will cease to remember who we are and why it matters
that there is an America.
<P>
This gaffe is almost unbelievable.  I say <I>almost</I> because
as Undersecretary in the U.S. Department of Education under President
Reagan, I gained an appreciation for how bureaucracies work. 
And I learned why we can never have national standards in education
determined by political bodies.  However well intended, the Goals
2000 legislation, which drives national standards, is deeply flawed.
 The attempt to have government determine &quot;official knowledge&quot;
in this country cannot help but become a political football. 
What George Will has called a &quot;cranky anti-Americanism&quot;
has come to dominate too many professional historians' worldview.
 That's why their depiction of America's &quot;war of vengeance&quot;
against Japan forced the Smithsonian's <I>Enola Gay</I> exhibit
to be cancelled. 

<P>
The Clinton administration's national history standards project
did not just miss the moon.  Major U.S. advances in medicine have
been lost as well, such as the development of anesthesia, the
conquest of Yellow Fever, and the discovery of the polio vaccine.
 Similarly, there is an anti-free enterprise bias to the history
standards.  Students are encouraged to put John D. Rockefeller
on trial for his sharp business tactics.  But where do the standards
lead young Americans to an understanding of the most productive
and free economic system in history?  Nowhere.
<P>
Defenders of the history standards complain that the criticisms
are all coming from conservatives, from the angry white male caucus.
 Well, the history standards' dismissal of Paul Revere and Robert
E. Lee, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein would appear to fit
this category.  But how can these apologists explain the omission
of leading black Americans like Thurgood Marshall, Gen. Colin
Powell, Gen. Benjamin O. Davis, Ralph Bunche, Roy Wilkins and
the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy?  And how to explain the cultural
importance the history standards give to &quot;Madonna&quot; and
Roseanne, while pushing Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson off
the bus?  Further, how do historians who gave us six references
to the Seneca Falls Convention on women's rights explain their
failure to include Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and Ambassador Claire
Booth Luce?  These influential women were Republican leaders and
early advocates of the E.R.A. Was their adherence to the E.R.A.
<I>and </I>the GOP offensive to the panel?  Whatever became of
the big tent?  
<P>
It goes without saying that the history standards' emphasis on
race, gender, and class forces young Americans to accept a secular
world view.  But for millions of us, our religous ties are more
important than ethnicity, gender and geography.  The history standards
panel clearly failed to comprehend the influence of religion in
American life.  How else to explain the fact that they consistently
employ the term &quot;fundamentalists,&quot; a term generally
viewed as pejorative.  Some 30 million Evangelicals, recognized
even by <I>TIME </I>and <I>Newsweek</I>, receive no mention. 
Some groups seem more equal than others.  Catholic Americans will
find it odd that their children will learn of Mother Jones, but
never hear about Mother Seton.  Father Coughlin gets in, but Bishop
Fulton J. Sheen is an &quot;unperson.&quot;  Jewish Americans
will find a similar skittishness about recognizing the accomplishments
of Jews as Jews.  Interestingly, too, for a document that emphasizes
group experience and all claims of victimhood, the national history
standards are strangely silent about America's role in four Arab-Israeli
wars.  
<P>
Tocqueville recognized that centralization of administration was
always the enemy of excellence because it enervates local initiative.
 Not only will national standards in education, bureaucratically
derived and politically driven, fail to overcome a rising tide
of mediocrity, they will become a part of it.  As President Kennedy
often said: &quot;We can do better.&quot;

<title>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
The U.S. Department of Education recently launched a series of
events to encourage greater family and community involvement in
learning.  While it is surely odd for an Administration that opposes
parental choice in education to lead such an effort, this public
relations blitz -- or at least the research that undergirds it
-- truly deserves wide attention.
<p>
Families exert far more influence over their children's intellectual
development than is commonly realized.  In fact, more than three
decades of research shows that families have greater influence
over a child's academic performance than any other factor -- including
schools.
<p>
In the mid-1960s, University of Chicago sociologist James Coleman
led a major research study which found a &quot;powerful relation
of the child's own family background characteristics to his achievement,
a relation stronger than that of any school factors.&quot;  Coleman's
research spawned a number of studies replicating his work and
building upon it.  These studies consistently confirmed Coleman's
chief finding that families exert considerable influence over
student achievement.
<p>
What is especially important about this body of research is that
it consistently shows that what families <I>do</I> really matters.
 That is, differences in student learning are not determined simply
by the quality of one's gene pool or by which side of the tracks
one lives on.  Instead, differences stem significantly from the
values, habits, and relational dynamics at work within the household.
<p>
Take, for example, family meals together.  While some might consider
this a rather trivial family ritual, several studies have found
the frequency of family meals together to be a strong predictor
of student test scores.  In explaining this high positive correlation,
 Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute says that consistent mealtimes
give parents regular opportunities to ask questions about what
kids are doing in school.  Mealtimes also give 
parents regular opportunities to broaden children's educational
horizons.  For example, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in public
affairs is said to have been cultivated by the rich dinnertime
discussions his family regularly enjoyed when he was a boy.
<p>
Just as family interactions around the dinner table pay surprising
dividends, the number and variety of learning tools (books, tapes,
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers, and the like) in the home have
a profound effect on children's learning, especially when these
materials are used in direct parent-child interaction.  For example,
a 1985 report from the National Academy of Education found that
the single most important activity for building the knowledge
required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children.
 Moreover, a 1992 study at the City University of New York found
that average IQ scores of low-income preschoolers are boosted
by nearly seven percentage points for each day of the week that
their mother reads to them.
<p>
The benefits of parent-child verbal interaction can also be seen
in recent research showing preschoolers placed in full-time day
care settings often lag behind their home-reared peers in language
development.  What is the primary reason for the difference? Young
children at home spend much of their day interacting verbally
with people (particularly Mom) whose language skills are more
advanced, whereas kids in day care spend most of their day interacting
verbally with peers whose language skills are no more developed
than their own.
<p>
Given the extraordinary influence families have over their children's
learning, it is curious that almost all public discussion about
improving education in this country centers around school-based
reforms of one kind or another.  While no one would deny many
school-based reforms are needed, Seattle public schoolteacher
David Guterson believes the promise of such reforms is often overblown.
 &quot;We should think clearly about the problems of schools and
ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed to
fail,&quot; Guterson writes.  &quot;We should recognize that schools
will never solve the bedrock problems of education.&quot;  
<p>
Only families can.  Only families will.
<p>
Unless and until our education debate begins to focus on the family,
significantly improving student performance in America is likely
to remain an elusive goal.

Lecture 536: Downsizing Government, by Senator Abraham
 -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 536</b>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and Seminars</h2></a>
<hr>
<h3>Downsizing Government:  Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3>
Senator Abraham addressed a meeting of The <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage">Heritage Foundation</a>'s Washington Policy Roundtable on July  26,  1995.
<p>
<br>
As the Co-Chair of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and the <a href="gopher://gopher.senate.gov/">Senate</a> sponsor of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity this morning to discuss our efforts to eliminate the <a href="http://www.doc.gov/">Commerce Department</a>. I also want to take this opportunity to thank The Heritage Foundation for putting forward detailed proposals for eliminating several Cabinet departments; many of your suggestions have found their way into the four Cabinet elimination bills that the task force has developed.
<p>
In my mind, no issue better symbolizes the dramatic changes that have occurred since the November elections than the ongoing efforts to eliminate departments of the federal government.  Just a year ago, members walking the halls of Congress were discussing the merits of making the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> a Cabinet-level department.  Today, Morton Kondracke is predicting on "The McLaughlin Group" that, contrary to prevailing opinion, the Department of Commerce will not be eliminated this year.  I don't agree with his prediction, but I like his choice of topics.
<p>
Our task force was set up to examine ways to dismantle four Cabinet departments:  Commerce, <a href="http://www.doe.gov/">Energy</a>, <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Housing and Urban Development</a>, and <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Education</a>. These four departments alone employ more than 74,000 bureaucrats and have combined budgets of $70 billion -- 133 times more than the entire federal government spent at the turn of the century. We must target these departments if we are truly to restrain the growth of government, reduce the tax burden on American businesses and workers, and balance the budget.
<p>
The goal of our task force is not simply to "zero out" these Cabinet departments, but rather to examine rational approaches to consolidate, privatize, and/or devolve back to the states their functions.  In our efforts, we adopted the following four principles as our guide:
<ul>
<p>
1) Those programs deemed unnecessary or wasteful are terminated;
<p>
2) Those programs duplicative of other departments or agencies are consolidated;
<p>
3) Those programs that serve a valid purpose are transferred to more appropriate agencies; and
<p>
4) Those programs which can be better performed outside the government will be privatized.
</ul>
<p>
By applying these guiding principles, our Cabinet proposals both reduce the federal spending on, and increase the effectiveness of the truly vital functions of, each department. 
<p>
Now let me turn to our efforts to dismantle the Commerce Department -- the only department slated for elimination in the congressional budget resolution.  As former Commerce Secretary Mosbacher notes, the department is "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  In my judgment, no other department better symbolizes the waste and duplication prevalent in the federal government than Commerce.
<p>
First, many of the department's functions are either duplicated or outperformed by other government agencies and private industry. Its own Inspector General notes that the department has evolved into a "loose collection of more than 100 programs," while the GAO states that Commerce "faces the most complex web of divided authorities," sharing its "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."
<p>
Second, its bureaucracy is bloated, its infrastructure is in disrepair, and more than 60 percent of its resources are dedicated to noncommercial activities. For example, almost 60 percent of the department's $3.6 billion budget is consumed by the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> -- the nation's weather and ocean mapping service.
<p>
Third, many of its programs are simply a waste of taxpayer dollars.  A prime example is the notorious Economic Development Administration.  At some point in its history, 40 percent of the EDA's loans were in default, while economic assistance grants were being distributed to such economically troubled areas as Key Biscayne, Florida.  Even when it is effective, the EDA duplicates the efforts of numerous other programs in other departments.
<p>
Today's Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented." Its problems can be solved only if it is dismantled. Using the four guiding principles I mentioned earlier, our Commerce legislation would do the following:
<p>
First, we would eliminate unnecessary, duplicative, and wasteful programs such as the EDA, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, the Technology Administration, and the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a>.
<p>
Second, we would transfer the various functions of NOAA -- which comprises the lion's share of the department's budget -- to more appropriate agencies and departments, or to private institutions.  For example, seafood inspection would be transferred to the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/">Department of Agriculture</a>, which already carries out most food inspection programs.  Marine and estuarine sanctuary management would be transferred to the <a href="http://info.er.usgs.gov/doi/avads/index.html">Interior Department</a>, which already manages some fisheries.
<p>
Third, we would transfer many of the Commerce Department's trade programs to agencies where their functions may be better performed.  Nineteen distinct federal agencies are charged with promoting U.S. exports, but only 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion is directed by Commerce. Secretary <a href="http://www.doc.gov/misc/BrownBio.html ">Ron Brown</a> may argue that Commerce leads federal efforts at export promotion, but almost three-quarters of the export promotion funds go to the Department of Agriculture, not Commerce. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the very traits that make Commerce a likely target for elimination -- its hodgepodge of unrelated agencies -- also make navigating its elimination through the legislative process extremely difficult.  Commerce offers something for everyone, and our efforts have stepped on a lot of toes. In the end, however, I believe we will prevail for the simple reason that, while one can justify many of the programs under the Commerce umbrella, there is no justification for the umbrella itself.  It's an accident of political evolution, not the product of sound policy.
<p>
For that reason, dismantling the department presents us with the unique opportunity to rationalize many of the functions currently under its jurisdiction, including those functions related to trade.  Let me say at the outset that I am a big proponent of free and expanded trade.  During my campaign for the U.S. Senate, I endorsed the <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Bulletins/nafta.html">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>, a politically difficult position to take coming from an industrial state like Michigan.  In fact, I was the only candidate from either party to do so.  Expanded trade does increase American jobs and living standards.
<p>
Clearly, establishing contacts and building trade relationships is important.  But just how effective is the current structure of our federal trade programs?  Opposition to dismantling Commerce comes from two sources -- bureaucrats in the Department who stand to lose their power and prestige, and certain portions of the business community who are concerned about our proposed reforms of the department's trade functions. Their principal concern is that Commerce is essential to promoting American exports abroad.  In fact, in testimony before a House committee the other day, Secretary Brown claimed that the Commerce Department is a "job creator" that builds the economy by increasing exports.
<p>
You might have heard the claim that trade advocacy and counseling efforts by the Commerce Department "returned $10.41 to the federal Treasury for every dollar invested in export promotion."  According to the Department of Commerce, this number and others like it are based upon undefined estimates.  As the Heritage Foundation's Joe Cobb pointed out in testimony Monday before the House Commerce Committee, "estimate" means "made up." Other economists agree. Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute and former economic advisor to Bill Clinton argues that there is "no economics" to the notion that export promotion creates jobs. Shapiro states, "All you can do with them is increase jobs for companies with the clout to get the subsidy. But that's at the expense of industries that don't have the clout. You're just shifting things around."
<p>
None of this is to say that the federal government has no role in promoting international trade.  My legislation begins the important process of consolidating our trade functions by transferring them to more appropriate agencies, thereby increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. As former Commerce official Wayne Berman points out, "You shouldn't negotiate open markets in one department and then try to exploit those open markets in another department. It ought to be a focused, well coordinated effort."
<p>
The Commerce Department Dismantling Act embraces this view by transferring over 70 percent of the International Trade Administration, including the Import Administration and the Foreign Commercial Service offices, to the USTR, creating one office where our trade agreements are negotiated and enforced.  In addition, the legislation creates a series of Industry Advisory Boards composed of representatives from the private sector to provide advice to policymakers and to ensure that industry has a "voice" in any administration.
<p>
Another trade-related agency my bill affects is the Bureau of Export Administration.  As it is currently situated, the Export Administration is criticized for two failings.  According to the defense community, it does a poor job of analyzing risks and protecting U.S. security interests.  Meanwhile, businesses criticize the Administration for being unresponsive to many requests by industry, often sitting on applications for extended periods of time instead of notifying the exporter of possible problems.
<p>
Given these criticisms, I see legislation to dismantle the Department of Commerce as an opportunity to make the Export Administration more responsive through two basic reforms: First, setting a time limit for granting export licenses and second, formalizing, either legislatively or through report language, the inter-agency process by which licensing concerns are raised.  These two reforms would make the BXA a much more effective partner with businesses while protecting our national security.
<p>
In conclusion, let me say that the 104th Congress has a historic opportunity to stop the growth of government and move us toward the limited central government envisioned by our Founding Fathers.  Given this opportunity, it would be a tragedy if one of the flagship efforts of the new leadership, the effort to eliminate the Department of Commerce, is defeated.  It will be impossible, in my judgment, to successfully address the massive growth of government and balance the budget if we cannot even address dismantling this department and redesignating its core functions to other agencies.  If we lack the will to do this, it will be virtually impossible to implement the reductions in social service programs that will be necessary to achieve balance.
<p>
My point is this: If we cannot dismantle the Department of Commerce simply because 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion must be spent by the department, then where can we cut spending? In my judgment, if we don't dismantle one of the least defensible Cabinet departments, then we won't make the tough decisions to limit spending for other sympathy-engendering spending programs.
<p>
In closing, I believe the goals of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and those of American industry are the same -- limited government, efficient regulation, low taxes. In that sense, the elimination of the Department of Commerce is more than just a symbol for eliminating government waste;  it's a  key step in downsizing government for the benefit of all Americans. I hope that we can work together to make the elimination of this department a reality.

<h3>Dismantling the U.S. Department of Commerce</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>
 Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology
<br>Government Reform and Oversight Committee
<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the "Department of Commerce Dismantling Act."  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.

<P>	Let me start off by putting your minds at ease.  In no way does the survival of America's small businesses depend upon the continuing existence of the U.S. Department of Commerce, despite what some Commerce Department supporters may tell you.  For example, in a Small Business Survival Committee survey earlier this year, we found that 65 percent of small business owners saw the government as an opponent, while only 34 percent perceived government as a partner.  While the Commerce Department may help a few, select businesses, the other businesses and taxpayers who foot the bill see it as just another federal government department costing them money.  In contrast, the dismantling of the Commerce Department could have a very significant, positive impact on the entrepreneurial sector of our economy.	<P>
Rather than perpetuating failed industrial policy in the form of the Commerce Department, the most productive steps Congress can take to help the entrepreneur would be to downsize government, cut taxes, deregulate industry, and lower trade barriers -- essentially, get government out of the way.  The Small Business Survival Committee believes that the seemingly relentless trek toward a $2-trillion federal government must be stopped and reversed.  Eliminating the Commerce Department is an important early step in this process for three main reasons:
<ul>
<li> First, as described in the attached Small Business Survival Committee report, which I ask be placed into the record, the Commerce Department is a $3.6 billion department filled with programs and endeavors that either would be better left to the private sector (such as economic development and technology investment), or should be moved to other federal departments (like the Patent and Trademark Office to the Justice Department).
<P>
<li> Second, the Commerce Department stands as an example of the grand delusion of government's powers and abilities.  Supporters of the Commerce Department, most prominently Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, claim that the department serves taxpayers and the economy well by increasing U.S. exports, seeding new technologies, and boosting economic growth.  Secretary Brown even asserted at the White House Conference on Small Business on June 13, 1995 that the Commerce Department leveraged a "$250 million export promotion budget into $25 billion in overseas sales."  He also stated that an end to the Department's Manufacturing Extension Program would leave "America's 380,000 small manufacturers, with nearly twelve million employees, without accessible and supportive local extension programs providing up-to-date strategies and technologies."  
<P>
Such declarations are, to say the least, most difficult to believe.  Indeed, if America's small manufacturers relied on a government program for "up-to-date strategies and technologies" and exporters depended on Commerce bureaucrats to sell their wares, our economy today would be a third-world basketcase.  Again, Secretary Brown and other Commerce Department proponents fall prey to the grand delusion of industrial policy.  
<P>
In reality, government does not possess the proper knowledge and incentives to be picking industry winners and losers; nor should taxpayer dollars be placed at risk in such futile endeavors.  As for expanding U.S. exports, the federal government's role should be limited to lowering trade barriers.  And in terms of boosting economic growth, the economy would be far better served, as I've already said,  if taxes were cut -- boosting incentives to work, invest, and take risks -- and the Commerce Department terminated.  In the end, individuals buying, selling, creating, and investing in the marketplace always work better than government bureaucrats pushing paper and spending taxpayer dollars.
<P>
<li> Third, if you are going to cut spending across the federal budget, as the Small Business Survival Committee urges Congress to do, then it makes sense to start with the easy cuts.  
<P>The Commerce Department is an easy cut.  If you can't make the easy cuts, then what happens when you get to the more politically difficult, though still very much economically sound, spending reductions?  
</ul><P>
The Commerce Department does not serve the taxpayers well and should be eliminated.  It is the Small Business Survival Committee's position that this be done in a timely fashion.  We support the idea of the Commerce Programs Resolution Agency (CPRA) being given a set time period in which to dismantle the department and then terminate its own operations.  

<P>
While not offering specifics in terms of budgets and resources for CPRA, we assume it will be a lean entity operating on a portion of the savings from the immediate cuts in Commerce Department programs.  The Small Business Survival Committee does offer a few principles that should govern the Commerce Department termination process:
<ul>
<li> The goals and mission of the CPRA should be clear cut from the beginning.  The final resting place for each program and agency within the Commerce Department should be already determined (i.e., either termination, privatization, or transfer to another agency) prior to the CPRA team being established.
<P>
<li> Congress should be strict with its time limitation on the CPRA, and leave no door ajar for extensions.  Indeed, we urge you to more closely examine whether three years are actually necessary to carry out this process.  It seems rather lengthy.   After all it does not take a business that was sunk by high taxes and onerous regulations that long to close its doors.
<P>
<li> To ensure that the CPRA remains a temporary entity that does not turn into a permanent bureaucracy, the Small Business Survival Committee suggests that its duties be contracted out to a private firm specializing in organizational overhauls and business downsizings.  The firm's performance would be reviewed regularly while under contract.  Indeed, Congress should offer incentives to speed up the process of closing the doors of the Commerce Department in order to save taxpayer dollars.
<P>
<li> The CPRA should be viewed neither as an extension of the Commerce Department or as a new agency.  Instead, it should be viewed as a temporary transition team to shut down the Commerce Department.  In fact, Congress probably should not call it an "agency" at all -- avoiding any sense of permanency.
</ul>
<P>
In closing, I would just urge you to be bold.  The vast majority of America's entrepreneurs and taxpayers see a clear need for reducing government's role in the economy.  Eliminating the Commerce Department should be the beginning of downsizing the federal government.	Thank you again for inviting me here today, and I would be glad to answer any of your questions.

<title>Abolish The Department of Commerce -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Abolish the Department of  Commerce: <br>
Move the Undersecretary for International Trade to the Treasury Department</h3></i>
By Joe Cobb<br>
John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #425<br>
August 14, 1995<br>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%><p> </center>
	The legislation in Congress to dismantle the Department of Commerce (DOC) has raised concerns about how necessary functions currently performed by the department will be preserved. Business leaders in particular have expressed concern about protecting U.S. interests in international trade. Although the idea of creating a new Cabinet-level Department of International Trade is gaining momentum, it would not reduce the size of the Cabinet. Responding to the concerns of the business community about U.S. trade policy need not conflict with the initial goal of dismantling Cabinet agencies and reducing the size and scope of government. A more effective solution is to transfer international trade functions to the Treasury Department.
<p>
	<b>Re-examine the Initial Proposal.</b> Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act transfers international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees. It conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place more than 2,500 Commerce Department employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's role as a world economic leader, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports.
<p>
	The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation to establish a new U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, like the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
	Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. Insulating trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
	<b>Create an Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade.</b> Congress should transfer Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade. The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
	The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department now has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy, so the Secretary of Commerce is perceived abroad as a minor Cabinet officer. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring.
<p>
	To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements -- which is a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries -- the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department is currently responsible for all enforcement relating to taxation of transnational corporations, which has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department. As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct invoicing of these imports and exports both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.
<p>
	Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the administration.
<p>
	<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to a new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had not corrected a number of problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer -- without substantial reorganization -- of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<P>
	<B>What Congress Should Do.</B> Export and import concerns should continue to occupy a priority position in the President's Cabinet, and the role of the USTR should not be diminished by any administrative reorganization. Congress should reject any proposals to create a new Cabinet-level international trade department. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet and would not carry the same authority internationally as the Treasury Department. The American people would see through the "shell game" nature of any such exercise and question the commitment of Congress to reducing the size of government. The Clinton Administration would be handed a strong argument for vetoing the entire reorganization proposal. Establishing a new Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade responsible for all current functions of the Commerce Undersecretary would address these problems and strengthen the administration of U.S. trade policy.

<h2>How to Close Down the Department of Commerce</h2>
By Joe Cobb<br>

Backgrounder #1049<br>
August 21, 1995
<hr size = 3 width = 30%>

<p>
<br>
INTRODUCTION
<p>
The congressional budget resolution for fiscal year 1996<i>1</i> calls for elimination of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). With its many sweeping changes, this resolution is both symbolic of the change in philosophy of this Congress and a very practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to dismantle the Department of Commerce,<i>2</i> and both the House Commerce Committee and Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have held hearings.<i>3</i> The congressional leadership has indicated that the FY 1996 budget reconciliation bill will include language to close down the Commerce Department.<i>4</i>
<p>
The idea of closing the department comes entirely from Congress. The Administration's reinventing government initiative barely touches the Department of Commerce, which indeed cannot be "reinvented."  The proper course of action is to dismantle the agency, which is little more than a collection of disparate programs. The Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, and 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments.
<p>
To close the department, obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated, and duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments. Commercial activities should be privatized or ended -- leaving private corporations to pay for their own research, advertising, and other costs of doing business.
<p>
Specifically, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration.
<p>
<li>Use the staff of the Inspector General as the core for the transition work but abolish the office upon completion of this work.
<p>
<li>Close the Economic Development Administration, with outstanding loans to be collected by the Treasury Department.
<p>
<li>Consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistics Administration, within a single new independent agency.
<p>
<li>Transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department.
<p>
<li>Close the domestic offices of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the Minority Business Development Agency.
<p>
<li>Close down the Travel and Tourism Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- the major part of the Commerce Department -- to other Cabinet departments that perform similar functions and close down the NOAA Corps.
<p>
<li>Establish the National Weather Service as an independent agency, with commercial services privatized.
<p>
<li>Establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation.
<p>
<li>Close down the Office of Technology Policy (Technology Administration).
<p>
<li>Privatize the National Technical Information Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology and transfer residual functions to the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and privatize electromagnetic spectrum.
<p>
</ul>
A Cabinet department reporting directly to the President of the United States ought to have a clearly defined mission and not continue year after year to function simply as an organization chart, tying together a loose collection of agencies. Defenders of the Commerce Department argue that its various activities are valuable and useful, but no case has been made that these functions cannot be performed in the private sector or elsewhere in government, or that they are more valuable than the budgetary resources consumed.
<p>
Because Commerce would be the first Cabinet department in U.S. history to be dismantled, the absence of clear precedents and procedure presents a challenge for the House and Senate task forces chaired by Representative Dick Chrysler (R-MI) and Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Title I of both their bills establishes a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. An administrator of this temporary agency, appointed by the President, would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function" according to "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency" that the President must submit to Congress within six months. The agency would have three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property.<i>5</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>THE "DEPARTMENT OF MISCELLANEOUS AFFAIRS"</b>
<p>
According to its own Inspector General, Commerce has evolved into "a loose collection of more than 100 programs delivering services to about 1,000 customer bases."<i>6</i>  The General Accounting Office reports the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" and shares "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<i>7</i>
<p>
Most of the department's resources have little or no relation to its purported mission:  "encourag[ing], serv[ing], and promot[ing] the Nation's international trade, economic growth, and technological advancement."<i>8</i>  For instance, nearly 60 percent of the agency's budget (about $2 billion per year) and some 37 percent of its staff are in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which conducts a number of environmental programs, including weather-related activities and research programs in marine and atmospheric sciences. Meanwhile, export promotion programs are distributed among ten different federal agencies:  "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<i>9</i>
<p>
Not only are many of the department's other activities -- especially its commercial operations — questionable as federal functions, but most badly need modernization and capital investment. Due to political and budgetary pressures, much of its capital stock is in disrepair. The GAO reports that departmental infrastructure -- "federal laboratories, a fleet of ships, weather satellites and radar, information systems, and other facilities and equipment -- will require investments of at least $7.4 billion over a 15-year period."<i>10</i>  The National Weather Service modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>11</i>
<p>
The Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented."  The optimal course of action is indicated by the congressional budget resolution:  The department should be dismantled. Its obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated. Its duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments, and its commercial activities should be privatized or closed.
<p>
The following analysis examines each organizational unit in the Commerce Department and recommends how to terminate or transfer its activities. For reference, data from the President's budget<i>12</i> are included in tables at the head of each section, with full-time employment levels and budget outlays in millions of dollars for fiscal years 1994 through 1997. In addition, major programs are detailed with obligated spending in millions of dollars.
<p>
<br>
<b>Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration</b><br>
The position of Commerce Secretary was established in 1913 when Labor was separated from the original Department of Commerce and Labor, which was established in 1903. The new agency was supposed to foster modern industrial production, rather than agriculture (which already enjoyed its own Cabinet department for 41 years). 
<p>
The Secretary of Commerce often is portrayed as the advocate of pro-business policies in a President's cabinet.<i>13</i> But public policy decisions affecting business generally are not made in the Commerce Department. Rather they come from such agencies as the President's Economic Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, or the Department of the Interior. The Secretary of Commerce, in recent administrations, has served more often as an important fund-raiser for his President's election campaigns than as the architect of policies to help the nation's commerce.
<p>
</b>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
The administrative and coordination functions of the Secretary of Commerce and supporting bureaus under his immediate authority should be assigned to a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency, as provided in Title I of the legislation introduced by Representative Chrysler and Senator Abraham. The President would submit to Congress within six months "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency," and an administrator appointed by the President would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function."  This temporary agency would have no more than three years to execute the legislative mandate:  terminating programs, reassigning civil service personnel, and disposing of surplus property.<i>14</i>
<p>
<b>Inspector General</b><br>
The Office of Inspector General was established in 1978 to provide agency-wide audits and investigations and to recommend corrections for waste, fraud, and mismanagement.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b> 
<p>
Congress should close the Office of Inspector General, although its personnel could form the core staff for the temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency established by the Chrysler-Abraham legislation.
<p>
<b>Economic Development Administration</b><br>
During the Johnson Administration, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 established a program of grants and other financial assistance to targeted cities and rural regions identified as "economically distressed."  The Economic Development Administration (EDA) also operates the Revolving Loan Fund, lending money to state and local governments that they in turn lend to businesses. The EDA will spend roughly $362 million in fiscal 1995 and $401 million in fiscal 1996.<i>15</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should close down the Economic Development Administration and direct the U.S. Treasury to collect all outstanding loans.<i>16</i> Congress approved $408 million in EDA spending for fiscal 1995, including $202 million for public works, $26 million in planning grants, $120 million for defense economic conversion, and $45 million in economic adjustment grants.<i>17</i> The EDA's development functions duplicate the activities of programs within the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Small Business Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.<i>18</i> On these grounds alone the program should be terminated.
<p>
Throughout the EDA's history, grants have been used by Members of Congress to distribute favors to constituents by "earmarking" funding to projects, bypassing the formal hearing process. This often means EDA grants go to locations with healthy economies that do not need federal assistance. In fact, the 17 states represented by the members of the relevant House and Senate subcommittees received $1.10 per capita in EDA grants during 1994, compared with 68 cents per capita in those states without representation, despite the fact that the average unemployment rate for the states represented was only 5.2 percent, compared with the national average of 5.4 percent that year.
<p>
The pork-barrel projects funded in the FY 1995 appropriation bill include:
<p>
<b>Egegik, Alaska.</b> The small fishing village of Egegik, with a population of 101, rests on the western shore of Alaska. Egegik has a per capita income of nearly $20,000 and is home to 23 families with an average family income of more than $60,000. Yet, in 1994, EDA granted the village $826,000 for the construction of a public dock. This is the equivalent of $8,178 for every person in Egegik.
<p>
<b>Key Biscayne, Florida.</b> A town of 8,854 residents, Key Biscayne is located in the middle of one of the most popular vacation spots in the country. Taking advantage of its beautiful climate and year-round influx of tourists, the local population enjoys a per capita income of more than $37,500. Yet Key Biscayne was awarded a 1994 EDA grant of $750,000 for the installation of a storm sewer system.
<p>
<b>St. Cloud, Minnesota.</b> St. Cloud University was awarded $91,512 in 1994 for the rehabilitation of its university center. According to EDA guidelines, these centers "must focus on service areas with significant economic distress."<i>19</i>  But this area hardly qualifies as distressed; St. Cloud has an unemployment rate of 3.0 percent and an above-average per capita income. Minnesota's unemployment rate is 3.2 percent, the fourth lowest in the nation.
<p>
Almost all federal development programs, moreover, have proven to be expensive failures. Federal public works, job training, and regional development programs create few new jobs for the considerable amounts of money they cost to administer.<i>20</i> As a typical example, the General Accounting Office noted that no more than 35 percent of the beneficiaries of the Emergency Jobs Act of 1983 actually had been unemployed.<i>21</i> Another analysis suggested that only 84 previously unemployed people received jobs under the program at a cost of some $307,000 per job. The average private-sector job costs only about $40,000 to create.<i>22</i> Congress could do far more to spur economic development by closing down the EDA and using the savings to reduce the tax burden faced by private-sector employers, who are in a better position to create jobs.
<p>
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has  jurisdiction over the sections of the Commerce Department Dismantling Act that abolish EDA, voted instead on August 2 to support a measure that would preserve all of the pork barrel substance of the program.<i>23</i> It creates a new Undersecretary of Commerce and an Office of Economic Development to "replace" the current EDA and authorizes funding of $340 million per year for five years. Section 605 of the legislation even contains a provision to assure that EDA's functions will survive the elimination of the Commerce Department.
<p>
The proposed substitute bill adopts the model of the Appalachian Regional Commission, established in 1965 as a temporary response to poverty in 13 states, which today continues to provide highway construction grants and other financial aid to those states and local governments. The House committee not only reauthorized the Appalachian Regional Commission for five years, it created eight additional regional commissions as independent agencies, administering grants and loans for spending on government-financed projects. Up to 45 percent of the United States would qualify for pork barrel spending based on the following eligibility criteria:  per capita income of 80 percent or less of the national average; or an unemployment rate one percent above the national average for the most recent 24-month period; or sudden and severe job loss; or "a pocket of poverty."<i>24</i>
<p>
This effort by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is extremely ill-advised. The proposal for a group of regional commissions to hand out grants and below-cost loans will only perpetuate and expand the unsound practices of subsidizing construction projects for political gain. 
<p>
<b>Bureau of the Census</b><br>
The Bureau of the Census was established as a permanent office in 1902. In addition to conducting the decennial census as required by the U.S. Constitution, the bureau continuously gathers and tabulates a wide range of economic and demographic statistics.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer the U.S. Census Bureau to a new independent agency, a Bureau of National Statistics, which would house all data collection functions of the government. Former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood, in her recent <i>Organizing to Count:  Change in the Federal Statistical System,</i> puts forth a practical and detailed proposal for such reorganization.<i>25</i> A centralized statistical agency for the United States, similar to that of Canada, also was recommended in The Heritage Foundation's <i>Rolling Back Government:  A Budget Plan to Rebuild America 26</i> and by the National Association of Business Economists.<i>27</i>
<p>
Section 207 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation would transfer the Census Bureau to the Treasury Department, which already performs substantial data collection in administering the Internal Revenue Code and collecting customs duties. The House and Senate task forces set out to reduce the size of government, not merely to rename existing bureaucracies (although Census would remain under their bill), so they call for no new independent federal agencies. But the benefits from establishing an independent Bureau of National Statistics are substantial. One of the most important would be to take statistical functions out of politicized bureaucracies and place them in an agency with no policy functions, thereby helping to insure that data collection is not influenced by political considerations.<i>28</i>
<p>
<b>Economics and Statistics Administration</b><br>
The Bureau of Economic Analysis was established by the Secretary of Commerce in 1953. It reports to the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs, who also oversees the Census Bureau. The two agencies together are known as the Economics and Statistics Administration, although the much larger Census Bureau is always identified separately. The agency draws upon the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and other data collection sources to compile the national income and product accounts and prepare forecasts and indicators of economic activity, widely followed by the news media and economists.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should incorporate the Bureau of Economic Analysis (along with the Census Bureau) within an independent Bureau of National Statistics, which would be responsible for all economic and demographic data collection and analysis for the federal government. Statistical functions of the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health, and Labor also should be merged within the new agency.
<p>
Section 208 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation provides for transfer of the Bureau of Economic Analysis to the Federal Reserve System, which already performs substantial data collection as part of its banking regulation and monetary policy functions. As with the Census Bureau, sponsors are reluctant to establish any new federal agencies. The independent Federal Reserve, however, should not be assigned functions by Congress only tangentially related to its central role of monetary policy and policing the nation's payments system.
<p>
<b>International Trade Administration</b><br>
The International Trade Administration (ITA) was established in 1980 by the Secretary of Commerce and also encompasses the Bureau of Export Administration. The ITA is charged with promoting U.S. exports, both through "export promotion" advocacy and diplomatic intervention by Commerce officials. It also processes petitions by U.S. industries seeking antidumping duties, countervailing duties, and other retaliatory weapons to erect trade barriers against foreign producers and products.<i>29</i>
<p>
The Undersecretary for International Affairs also runs numerous other programs, such as the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Service, which target a handful of industries for export development. The Undersecretary has a Deputy Undersecretary and a Director of Administration, as well as a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Planning and three other Assistant Secretaries, plus the Director General of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (which has offices in 68 countries throughout the world as well as 47 district offices and 21 branch offices in the United States).
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer all Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, including direction of the Import Administration, Trade Development, and the Foreign Commercial Service (see chart above). The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy. Outside the United States, the Secretary of Commerce is perceived correctly as a minor Cabinet officer. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for U.S. currency exchange rates, U.S. policy in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and macroeconomic coordination among the G-7 industrialized countries. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring to the task.
<p>
To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements, a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries, the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department currently is responsible for all enforcement relating to matters involving taxation of transnational corporations, and this has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department.
<p>
As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct pricing of these imports and exports, both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.<i>30</i>
<p>
Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, which has been considered in hearings before the House Commerce Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, transfers all international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective but small agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees, which conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place all trade functions and more than 2,500 additional employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's economic leadership among world leaders, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports. Most witnesses at the recent congressional hearings expressed concerns about this change.
<p>
The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation<i>31</i> to establish a U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, along with the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. The insulation of trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the Administration.
<p>
<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to the new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had failed to correct a number of organizational problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer  --  without substantial reorganization  --  of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<p>
<br>
<b>Bureau of Export Administration</b><br>
The seven-year-old Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) administers export controls and coordinates the 17-nation Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). The BXA's primary mission, therefore, is to safeguard the national interest by monitoring the export of potentially dangerous "dual-use" technologies.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department. Controlling the export of militarily useful commodities is a national security matter. If such technologies proliferate, the burden falls on the military to solve the problem. The Department of Defense deserves to be involved directly in the export licensing process because it is in the best position to judge the military utility of particular technologies. Putting the responsibility for export controls in the hands of the USTR or the Treasury Department implies that export controls should be treated as a trade issue, not a national security issue. It would be appropriate, however, for controversial licensing decisions to be appealed to the presidential level.
<p>
A special interagency report issued by the DOC with the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State drew attention to the duplication of export control programs by the BXA. The four-agency report concluded:  "Consolidating these functions under the appropriate official will provide not only the proper oversight but also a more efficient and effective approach for tracking referred applications and examining export trends."<i>32</i>
<p>
The bill introduced by Senator Abraham transfers BXA functions to the Defense Department, but the version introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Chrysler transfers export licensing to the State Department.<i>33</i> The legislation introduced by Representative Mica transfers all export licensing functions to the proposed new Cabinet department for trade.<i>34</i> Both the Chrysler and Mica proposals would introduce greater uncertainty for key U.S. export industries such as aircraft, chemicals, and computer technology. Transferring all BXA responsibilities to the Defense Department would correct the problem of administrative conflicts between agencies, but exporters will object that dual-use technology sales will still be made by other countries. New procedures for review of the Defense Department's licensing decisions at the presidential level are needed to address this concern. The USTR, as the President's trade envoy, would be able to address these problems in trade policy and work to stop foreign export sales of dual-use technology.<i>35</i>
<p>
<b>Minority Business Development Agency</b><br>
The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) was created by executive order in 1971 to help promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to show these businesses how to secure government contracts. The MBDA also provides funds for numerous Minority Business Development Centers (MBDCs) and American Indian Development Centers (IBDCs). Congress appropriated nearly $45 million for this program in fiscal 1995.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should close down the Minority Business Development Agency.<i>36</i> Although hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on the MBDA since 1971, it has never been authorized formally by Congress. The MBDA's stated objective is to show businesses how to get government contracts, which is hardly the best way to encourage minority business development. Its approach merely duplicates the efforts of the failed 8(a) loan program of the Small Business Administration. Numerous reports have criticized this kind of preference program lending, finding that many of the small businesses favored by these kinds of programs are never able to stand alone without government assistance.<i>37</i>
<p>
In recent years, Congress has altered the MBDA's mission toward what is best described as corporate welfare, subsidizing high-technology firms and university research projects. These questionable expenditures duplicate dozens of other wasteful federal programs and seem little more than an attempt to justify the existence of an agency whose only rationale is dispensing special-interest funds.
<p>
The most effective way for Congress to help small minority-owned businesses would be to repeal labor regulations that generally frustrate small start-up firms and to amend the tax code to encourage investment in new small enterprises. In addition, minority firms serving the public sector would be helped by repeal of such discriminatory laws as the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 and Service Contract Act of 1965. These laws raise the costs of government construction and service contracts by requiring companies that bid for such contracts to file mountains of paperwork documenting that they pay their workers above-market wages. Larger firms, which tend not to be minority-owned, have the advantage in bidding on such contracts. Repealing these laws would create a level playing field, instantly making smaller firms more competitive.
<p>
<b>Travel and Tourism Administration</b><br>
Created in 1981, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) spends nearly $20 million per year supposedly to promote tourism and recreational activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material, and running regional marketing shows. The USTTA administers the Disaster Relief Financial Assistance Program, which supports tourism for states recently hit by natural disasters. A new program is "developing a regional and global understanding within Governments on the relation between tourism and the environment."<i>38</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should close down the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration.<i>39</i> There is no reason for the federal government to be involved in an activity already well handled by a vast private travel and tourism industry. In 1992, over 45 million foreign travelers visited the United States. These tourists spent more than $55 billion in this country, including $17 billion in fares to U.S. air carriers. 
<p>
Private industry thus has a significant financial interest in promoting tourism and does not need taxpayers to pay its advertising costs. The agency often works with private-sector organizations, including the Travel Industry Association of America, to organize events such as the "Discover America International Pow Wow" or the "Pow Wow Europe."  There is no justification for federal involvement in such commercial promotional activities, with taxpayer funds used to pay for normal business marketing costs. Tourist promotion should be organized by private-sector interests without taxpayer assistance. The federal government does not belong in the travel industry.
<p>
<b>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</b><br>
The $2 billion-per-year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was formed in 1970 to consolidate commercially oriented ocean resource activities housed in other government agencies. NOAA's non-weather-related programs include a broad range of unrelated activities, such as commercial fisheries management, endangered species protection, habitat management, and research projects.<i>40</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should (1) separate the National Weather Service from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), establishing it as an independent agency with its functions reduced to specialized data collection and emergency warning activities,<i>41</i> and (2) reduce by 50 percent all non-Weather Service NOAA funding over five years. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) should be transferred to the current Department of Interior. Most functions of the National Ocean Service should be privatized, and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet should be closed down. To accomplish this, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Return the functions performed by the National Marine Fisheries Service to what are now the Departments of Interior and Agriculture and the Coast Guard.<i>42</i>
<p>
<li>Impose fees on commercial and recreational fishing interests for fishing in federal waters. These fees should be sufficient to cover the costs associated with managing federal fishing stocks.
<p>
<li>Privatize most National Ocean Service functions.
<p>
<li>Terminate the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet.<i>43</i>
<p>
</ul>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) consumes nearly 60 percent of the budget of the Department of Commerce and about 37 percent of its staff. NOAA oversees three significant non-Weather Service agencies:  the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Ocean Service (NOS), and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet. Many functions of these programs can be moved to other agencies, terminated, privatized, or turned over to the states.
<p>
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is the primary agency managing marine mammal and commercial fisheries resources in federal marine waters. Savings can be achieved by transferring NMFS fisheries and protected species management activities to the Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service. NMFS fisheries monitoring and enforcement activities can be transferred to the Coast Guard, which already has policing powers over federal waters. Specific fisheries management functions can be transferred to the regional councils in New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the Gulf states. Federal funding should be ended for state fisheries grants, commercial fisheries promotion and development programs, and aquaculture research. The seafood inspection program could be transferred to the FDA inspection program.
<p>
Currently, unlike commercial interests that use public lands and extract minerals, the commercial and recreational fishing industries pay nothing for the right to fish in federal waters. Because these resources are considered free, and because the industry is overcapitalized as the result of government loan and fishing vessel construction programs, the federal fishing stock is rapidly becoming depleted. Indeed, the government has paid millions in income supplements to Northeast fisherman who have seen their profits fall due to depleted stocks. It also spends millions on fisheries recovery programs, stock surveys, and hatcheries. The industry that benefits from these programs contributes nothing to their cost.
<p>
Charging commercial and recreational fishing interests a fee or requiring them to pay a royalty to the federal government would place a premium on fishing in federal waters. Such a fee system would help defray the cost of resource management and a smaller fishing fleet would reduce the stress placed on federal fishing stocks that has forced a moratorium on fishing from many ports.
<p>
The National Ocean Service (NOS) engages in such diverse activities as mapping and charting, oil spill research, coastal monitoring, and marine sanctuary management. Savings can be achieved by privatizing the agency's navigational and aeronautical charting and mapping activities currently performed by its National Geodetic Survey office.<i>44</i> The Geodetic Survey has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, created by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 to chart navigational routes. There already are private companies drafting and marketing aeronautical services. Those activities that cannot be privatized should be transferred to the Coast Guard.
<p>
In addition, all regional coastal management programs, such as the $45 million Coastal Zone Management grant program and the $1 million Charleston area management plan, should be terminated and continued by state authorities if they choose to do so. Marine sanctuary programs can be merged into the Department of Interior or transferred to state governments.
<p>
The NOAA Corps also has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Today the Corps operates a fleet of 18 research vessels, as well as ten fixed-wing aircraft and four helicopters. All of these functions should be terminated. The NOAA Corps is outmoded, and its research fleet, reports the GAO, is "old and technologically obsolete."  NOAA is calling for a 15-year, $1.9 billion program to modernize and purchase 24 vessels but "has no assurance that its fleet modernization plan represents the most cost-effective means of meeting future program requirements."<i>45</i>  Many of the Corps' charting activities are duplicated by private companies or the Coast Guard and need not be continued; its ships should be given to universities and marine research centers, and its aircraft to the Air Force. Hurricane research now can be performed entirely through satellites.
<p>
<b>National Weather Service</b><br>
The primary function of the National Weather Service (NWS) is to issue warnings of severe weather and floods in order to minimize life and property loss. The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service -- an NWS adjunct -- operates the satellites producing the data the NWS uses to conduct its forecasts. The combined budgets of these programs comprise over half of NOAA's nearly $2 billion annual budget.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should reduce funding for the National Weather Service by 50 percent over three years. The Weather Service should reduce its role by specializing in data collection and emergency warning efforts. NOAA's satellite program could be merged with the redundant Air Force weather satellite program. An assessment then should be made of the possibility of privatizing polar-orbiting satellites and information distribution functions.<i>46</i>
<P>
Due to mismanagement and bureaucratic inefficiencies, the reputation of the National Weather Service is under fire. For example, according to the General Accounting Office, its modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>47</i> The only way to salvage this program is to reduce it to its core functions and introduce a significant dose of competition and private-sector capital.
<p>
Many functions of the Weather Service should be contracted out to private firms or simply transferred to the private sector. There are now approximately 300 private companies in the U.S. preparing and disseminating weather forecasts to businesses and the public on a commercial basis. According to the Commercial Weather Services Association, "private meteorologists and for-profit companies provide the public upwards of 85 percent of its weather forecasts, through television weathercasts, in newspaper weather maps, and on radio."<i>48</i>
<p>
The Weather Service should turn over to private firms its specialized services, such as fruit frost and agricultural forecasting, aviation forecasting, and fire weather forecasting, and privatize or close the regional climate centers that compete directly with private firms.<i>49</i> In addition, the Service spends about $200 million per year in "fringe" weather operations -- such as Seasonal to Interannual Climate Forecasts and Decadal to Centennial Change -- which have little scientific validity and no practical value. These should be terminated.
<p>
The Service's field structure should be consolidated. The NWS has five headquarters offices, six regional offices, four national centers, and 334 field offices. This field office structure was designed when technology did not allow instant communication. Little has been done to alter this outmoded structure. Reducing these offices to no more than 25 facilities would save millions each year.
<p>
The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes privatizing such specialized NWS services as aviation, marine, and agricultural forecasting. The Office of Management and Budget projects these measures will save $40 million over five years. These recommendations are a small but good beginning.
<p>
<b>Patent and Trademark Office</b><br>
The patent system was established by the first Congress "to promote the progress of the useful arts" under Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution. The registration of trademarks was first authorized in 1870. About 110,000 patents and about 69,700 trademarks were registered for fiscal 1992 alone, and 5,700 trademark registrations were renewed. A substantial portion of the annual Patent Office budget is funded by fees and other payments for publication and services by the public.
<p>
<br>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
Section 205 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation places the Patent and Trademark Office under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department. Other alternatives also have been proposed. Representative Carlos J. Moorhead (R-CA) has introduced legislation<i>50</i> to establish an independent government corporation, an idea favored by the American Bar Association's Section on Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Law.<i>51</i> An independent corporation, as proposed by the ABA, is clearly superior because this function can be fully self-financing. Documenting the ownership of patent and trademark rights is an activity that provides specific economic value to private parties, who can enforce these rights in civil lawsuits.
<p>
<b>Technology Administration (Office of Technology Policy)</b><br>
The Technology Administration (TA) was created in 1988 as a successor to the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation. This program oversees the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), which are intended to promote commercially useable technology through research grants and subsidies. The office of the Undersecretary for Technology is an example of administrative overhead that can be eliminated by dismantling the Department of Commerce. The Undersecretary for Technology exercises executive and policy direction over the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Technological Information Service, which is one of the largest publishing firms in the United States. The principal functions of the office, however, are to send representatives to interdepartmental meetings throughout the federal government and to supervise public relations activities, such as the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Awards.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should close down the Technology Administration. The National Technical Information Service should be closed or privatized. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Advanced Technology Program, in addition to the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships program,<i>52</i> also should be abolished. The technology programs represent most clearly the failed theories of government-industry "partnership," in which bureaucrats pick projects to subsidize and encourage private-sector interests to pursue government funding rather than to invest in entrepreneurial research. The House of Representatives has voted to discontinue funding for the Advanced Technology Program.<i>53</i>
<p>
<b>National Technical Information Service</b><br>
The National Technical Information Service is a publishing firm within the federal government which collects and disseminates scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information generated by government and foreign sources. It provides databases and other computer services to private-sector and governmental clients and essentially covers its costs by setting prices for its publications and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should privatize the National Technical Information Service. The NTIS is required by law to pay its own costs and usually does so. This Commerce Department program is essentially a publishing business which already prices its products and services to those who benefit from them. Since it has proven itself able to operate in a businesslike way on its own, it should be privatized immediately.
<p>
<b>National Institute of Standards and Technology</b><br>
Most of Commerce's recent growth in spending is due to increases in the budget for industrial policy funding of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Overall, outlays for NIST are scheduled under current law to skyrocket from $167 million in FY 1994 to $466 million in FY 1995 -- a 180 percent increase in one year. The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes that outlays for NIST nearly double by FY 1997, to $1.02 billion.
<p>
NIST's primary role is to promote commercial research and development projects. It carries out this mission through research projects and grant programs such as the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and Manufacturing Extension Partnerships(MEPs).<i>54</i> In FY 1996, the Clinton Administration proposes a 622 percent increase in budget authority for ATP, when compared with 1993 levels. MEP budget authority will jump by 716 percent over the same period under the Administration proposal. NIST, once called the National Bureau of Standards, also sets industry standards for various technological goods and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br>
Congress should close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This means ending NIST's Advanced Technology Program and its Scientific and Technical Research and Services, in addition to halting construction of new NIST research facilities. Weights and measures and other standards can be supervised by the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
Although the Clinton Administration and many in Congress believe industrial policy initiatives like NIST are the key to America's competitive success, the exact opposite is true. Industrial policy programs rarely encourage the development of vibrant new industries, and when they do it is usually at very high cost. More important, NIST already shows signs of becoming one of the federal government's leading high-technology pork-barrel programs, replacing highway and other infrastructure programs. 
<p>
NIST should be abolished before any more harm is done to the economy and before any more taxpayer dollars are distributed wastefully to favored interest groups. Its research programs and facilities could be privatized very quickly. Robert M. White, president of the National Academy of Engineering, notes that such transformations have been proved successful even for organizations funded exclusively with federal money. White argues that privatization of federal R&D labs makes sense because, "With their new freedom to pursue research in whatever areas the market demands -- rather than just fulfilling government missions -- these laboratories might, if successful, spin-off companies and attract new businesses at a far greater rate than they do today. Research universities and private R&D companies with less governmental direction of their activities tend to contribute significantly to their region's economies."<i>55</i>
<p>
<b>National Telecommunications and Information Administration</b><br>
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) jointly manages the electromagnetic spectrum with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The NTIA also gives Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) grants to public television and radio organizations to help expand the audience for public programming. The newest NTIA promotional effort, the National Information Infrastructure (NII), hopes to channel funds into various "information highway" projects. Although an estimated $70 million - $100 million is to be spent on such projects in 1995, the Administration has set higher funding goals of $1 billion - $2 billion annually for future years.<i>56</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should cut by 75 percent the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and transfer the remaining functions (those concerning oversight of public bands of the radio spectrum) to the Federal Communications Commission.<i>57</i> These functions then would be phased out with the FCC as the entire spectrum is privatized.
<p>
Efforts like the Public Telecommunications Facilities and Information Infrastructure programs are little more than high-technology pork projects. But whether it is spectrum management or public programming promotional efforts, the NTIA has little reason to be independent from the FCC. Communications policy should be embodied in one agency to minimize duplication and cut costs. Hence, all current NTIA tasks, after funding has been reduced 75 percent, should be transferred to the FCC. In addition, Congress should not allow the FCC to use the transfer of authority as an excuse to increase its budget. This should encourage the FCC to reform and simplify federal spectrum management policies, which are inefficient and discourage the advance of telecommunications competition.<i>58</i> Congress's goal should be to place all spectrum into private hands as rapidly as possible, abolish the FCC, and transfer responsibility under international spectrum management treaties to the State Department.

<title>Commerce Department Funds Blatant Lobbying -- Heritage</title>

No part of the money appropriated by any enactment of Congress shall, in the absence of express authorization by Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any...printed or written matter, or other device, intended or designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress, to favor or oppose...any legislation....</blockquote>
<center>											18 USC 1913</center>
<p>
Opponents of the effort to end 40 years of political corruption manifested in a system of taxpayer-subsidized lobbying often state that existing federal law already prohibits using grant funds for advocacy.  They cite the above section of the U.S. Code to defend this view.
<p>
	It appears, however, that the law is irrelevant.  In recent weeks, the Department of Commerce has provided $200,000 to HandsNet, Inc., a California group which operates an online computer service focused on lobbying and available on the Internet.  According to its own Internet-based documents, HandsNet links "5,000 public interest and human service organizations across the United States."  Among the services offered: "the latest Action Alerts."
<p>
	A description of the grant award1 prepared by the grant provider, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (part of the Commerce Department), specifically mentions that the grant will allow "National organizations [to] help local ones keep up to date by publicizing action alerts...."  A recent selection of alerts includes:
<p><ul>
<li><b>"Istook Amendment--Call Your Representatives 10/30/95"</b><br>
"Now is the time to turn up the heat.... So Call, E-Mail, or Fax Your Representative Today!"
<p>
<li><b>"Give President Clinton a Wake-Up Call"</b><br>
"If President Clinton signs immoral welfare and Medicaid 'reform' bills, the 60-year-old guaranteed safety net for children will be destroyed."
<p>
<li><b>"Stop English-only Proposals in Congress 10/24/95"</b><br>
"Call and write to your Representative and Senator. Ask to meet with them directly."
<p>
<li><b>"Congress Yields To Traditional Values Coalition"</b><br>
"The hearing, dubbed 'Parental Involvement in Social Issues in Education'...is likely to become a tax-funded platform for gay bashing."
</ul><p>
Each of the alerts is supported by information to describe what action needs to be taken and what arguments can be used to lobby Congress most effectively.

<p>

<b>About the Grant to HandsNet</b>
<p>
	The $200,000 awarded to HandsNet, Inc., of California was to be used for the nationwide training of public interest organizations on how to use the Internet more effectively. The NTIA award summary states that HandsNet "will train 250 organizations in Internet skills, so that they can publish information on the new system."	In addition, HandsNet will "conduct a national outreach campaign" to introduce human services groups to the Internet.
<p>
	The major component of the grant appears to be a new training center in Washington, D.C. The center will be fully functional around January 1, 1996, according to HandsNet documents, but is housed temporarily at the headquarters of Families USA (funder of the 1994 Clinton health care bus caravans).  The national center will be operated in conjunction with the Institute for Global Communications, also of California.
<p>
<b>About HandsNet</b>
<p>
	In reviewing the HandsNet site on the Internet, it appears that its principal purpose is explicit political advocacy.  The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment, among many other issues.  The three key information components provided are Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest (a summary of the alerts), and daily updates on key issues.  According to its Internet site, HandsNet is affiliated with the Institute for Global Communications, an arm of the Tides Foundation.  Members of HandsNet include the major opponents of the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich reform effort, including OMB Watch and the Alliance for Justice.
<p>
<b>About the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure 
Assistance Program (TIIAP)</b>
<p>
	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program is operated by NTIA in the Commerce Department.  Under the Clinton Administration, this program has mushroomed in cost, from $10 million in FY 1994 to $25 million in FY 1995.  In 1994 there were 92 grants; in the most recent round (to be announced in mid-November, but already awarded), there are 120.  There also are indications that the TIIAP may subsidize other lobbying activities, in addition to those of HandsNet, Inc.
<p>
	According to NTIA documents, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America received $300,000 in 1994 to set up a "nationwide on-line information system" for itself and all 164 affiliates.  Also in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet received funding to "establish a network of regional field representatives" and "demonstrate a model for building a national grassroots information system," among other things.
<p>
	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, ACORN (which led noisy demonstrations in Congress earlier this year), the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and Citizens Fund (an affiliate of Citizen Action, an active grassroots lobbying organization).  It is unclear which, if any, will receive funding.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The Commerce Department, through NTIA, has awarded a grant to an online lobbying organization for the specific purpose of engaging more groups in its Internet advocacy efforts.  The $200,000 gift to HandsNet, Inc., to train people in the publishing of action alerts and other lobbying materials represents a blatant misuse of taxpayer funds.
<P>
	Supporters of taxpayer-funded political patronage argue that the current system is designed to prevent abuses.  The case of the Commerce Department and HandsNet, Inc., provides a serious test of this claim. The fact that such a significant grant could be made with no effort to hide the fact that it directly funds lobbying activities clearly demonstrates the need for Congress to reform this costly and irresponsible form of political corruption.

<title>How to Close Down the Department of Energy -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3><i>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1061<br>
November 9, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.doe.gov">U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</a> was created as a Cabinet-level department in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter as part of the federal effort to address the energy crisis of the late 1970s. Fearing that international energy shortages were the wave of the future, the President felt a highly visible national agency was necessary to promote energy conservation, control federal supplies of power, and develop alternative sources of energy. However, the OPEC oil embargo then collapsed -- without any assistance from the DOE -- and international oil supplies stabilized. 
<p>
And yet, the department remains. In fact, DOE has grown in tax dollars spent and functions performed -- the result of 15 years of searching for something to do. As Victor Rezendes of the General Accounting Office has testified, "DOE's mission and priorities have changed dramatically over time so that the Department is now very different from what it was in 1977. While energy research, conservation and policy-making dominated early DOE priorities, weapons production and now environmental cleanup overshadow its budget."<sup>1</sup>  Thanks to this continual empire-building, the department's budget has increased by 235 percent, and 85 percent today is spent on activities other than energy resources. For instance, nearly $12 billion is budgeted annually for environmental quality and nuclear waste disposal, with close to another $3 billion earmarked for fundamental science research.
<p>
The Department of Energy not only has strayed from its original mission of energy oversight, but also has failed to conduct efficiently the services it now provides. Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review reported that due to inefficiencies as high as 40 percent within DOE's Environmental Management program, more than $70 billion could be lost over the next 30 years.<sup>2</sup>  Victor Rezendes testified that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management... to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight.... "<sup>3</sup>. These management problems and the inefficiencies that flow from them have been caused largely by DOE's continual efforts to re-align itself and justify its existence.<p>It is time to close the Department of Energy. Senator Rod Grams (R-MN) and Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) have developed legislation that would dismantle the department.<sup>4</sup>  Title I of both bills redesignates the Department of Energy as the "Energy Programs Resolution Agency," modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. Both bills would establish a three-year limit for closing DOE, privatize Energy's valuable oil reserves and other assets, establish a commission to recommend DOE laboratory privatizations, set new guidelines for toxic waste disposal, and transfer control over the nuclear weapons stockpile to the Department of Defense.
<p>
Under a plan developed by analysts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, DOE's defense-related programs would be transferred to an agency under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, and its primary research functions would be transferred to universities or the National Science Foundation.<sup>5</sup>  Federal funding for commercially oriented energy supply, research, and development projects would be terminated, and the research responsibility would be transferred to the private sector. All commercial energy functions, including the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), Petroleum Reserves, and Uranium Enrichment activities, would be denationalized and sold to the private sector.
<p>
Specifically, under the Heritage Plan, Congress would:
<p><ul>
<li> Transfer all defense-related nuclear weapons functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. This new agency would have primary management and oversight responsibility for environmental cleanup activities.
<p>
<li> Decrease the Department of Energy's <a href="http://www.em.doe.gov">environmental management</a> budget by 30 percent and adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
<p>
<li> Establish the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management as a federal corporation with the ultimate goal of full privatization.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Supply Research and Development programs and privatize the government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Conservation funding, including state grants and research programs.
<p>
<li> Phase out federal funding for General Science and Basic Research and transfer the laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them.
<p>
<li> Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the U.S. Uranium Enrichment Corporation to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the five Power Marketing Administrations to the private sector, using a variety of stock sale approaches.
<p>
<li> Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency.
<p>
<li> Close down or privatize the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/">Energy Information Administration</a>.
</ul><p>
Closing the department and making the related reforms would save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five years, including $16 billion in asset sales. By contrast, Secretary Hazel O'Leary's "re-invention" plan would save only $14.1 billion over five years, including $5.7 billion in asset sales. The proposals to close the department developed by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would save more than $17 billion over five years.
<p>
There are two ways to close down a federal department. The first is simply to shift the department's responsibilities to other agencies and throw the old letterhead into the trash. The alternative is to eliminate, devolve, or privatize responsibilities whenever possible, and transfer only essential responsibilities to other departments. This latter approach is the one that should be used with the Department of Energy. DOE's history of failure and ineffectiveness demands nothing less.

<p>
<b>CHANGING MISSIONS AND BUREAUCRATIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
Created in 1977, the Department of Energy has changed missions numerous times over its almost two decades. Its original mission -- administering the complex set of regulations, price controls, and allocation laws established in response to the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-1974 -- was a dismal failure that actually resulted in higher energy costs and increased dependence on foreign oil.<sup>6</sup><p>Ronald Reagan promised during his 1980 campaign to eliminate the Department of Energy. Instead, he changed its mission from energy conservation, imposed through a centralized structure of regulations, to energy promotion by means of market mechanisms. The department also gained responsibility for the production of nuclear weapons during the 1980s because of a belief that production and stockpile management should be controlled by a civilian agency.
<p>
DOE's central mission changed once again with the end of the Cold War. The high level of weapons production was no longer necessary, and world energy supplies remained constant. Ever vigilant about finding a purpose, DOE began to concentrate on environmental remediation of past actions, including cleaning up its own contaminated weapons facilities. DOE's fiscal 1996 budget request makes this change in mission clear. Thirty-nine percent of the $17.8 billion budget request is earmarked for "Environmental Quality," while only 15 percent is for "Energy Resources."<sup>7</sup>  Another large portion of Energy's budget is dedicated to research and development of alternative-source energy supply, including solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear power generation (see <a href="bg1061c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Despite this massive effort, petroleum and coal remain the dominant sources of power in America.
<p>
DOE's newest initiative, the fourth change in mission, is the creation of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). These "agreements" are contracts whereby the Department of Energy allows individual companies to use federal laboratories, and even conducts research and development, all at taxpayer expense. CRADAs are meant to increase the competitiveness of American companies and support quality jobs at a time when much of the defense-related work completed at DOE's laboratories in the past is no longer seen as necessary. CRADAs thus offer the dual advantage of providing private companies with free research while preventing the closing of federal facilities -- or so proponents argue.
<p>
The Department of Energy's CRADA initiatives are among the most egregious examples of corporate welfare that benefits individual companies at tremendous expense to American taxpayers. According to a recent series on "High-Tech Handouts" in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, researchers who once worked for a private company are now employed by DOE but continue to do the same work. The only thing that has changed is that taxpayers are picking up the tab.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, when this research is successful, individual companies can earn protected trade secrets or patents that often are not available even to the federal government. Millions of American taxpayers thus may be underwriting a single company's market position. <p> The results of most efforts are both disappointing and expensive. For example, the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> notes that DOE has spent some $792 million on CRADAs between 1992 and 1995. The result has been 46 new companies at a cost of $17 million per company.<sup>9</sup>  Even more disappointing, many recipients of DOE assistance are reducing their research and development budgets and trimming their workforces. General Electric, which earned $4.7 billion in profits in 1994, received $25.4 million in federal assistance between 1990 and 1994. Over the same period, GE cut 80,000 positions from its payroll. Clearly, DOE's CRADA program is not meeting its stated goal of job creation.
<p>

<b>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT</b>
<p>
There is no legitimate rationale for a Department of Energy. Centralized planning of energy production and distribution, including operation of the Power Marketing Administrations, has proven ineffective and expensive. Mass-scale nuclear weapons production is no longer needed with the end of the Cold War. Environmental remediation efforts have been inefficient and often impractical. And efforts to bolster private industry through CRADAs are expensive, ineffective, and fast becoming a primary source of congressional earmarking and corporate welfare. All defense-related functions now being administered by DOE, including environmental remediation, should be transferred to the Department of Defense. All assets that are commercially viable should be privatized. Whatever remains should be terminated (see Table 1).
<p>
<b>Environmental Cleanup</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy was responsible for the production of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and the pressure of competing with the Soviet Union prevented environmental protection from being a top priority at weapons production facilities. Today, although production has ceased, the environmental remediation of DOE's facilities remains. The vast majority of contamination problems at the department's nuclear weapons plants involve some level of radioactivity. Since 1989, the department has managed, stored, and cleaned up hazardous wastes produced at the plants under the Environmental Management (EM) program, which has three basic components:  Environmental Restoration, Waste Management, and Facility Transition and Management (created in 1992).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Move the Department of Energy's environmental management responsibilities to a new independent agency within the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li>Adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Since its inception in 1989, DOE's Environmental Management program has almost quadrupled its budget to a fiscal 1996 request of $6.6 billion. The General Accounting Office estimates that the total cost of remediation at federal nuclear waste disposal sites will run as high as $200 billion.<sup>10</sup>  However, given DOE's poor performance in the past, this could be only a fraction of the eventual total. DOE also should re-evaluate its original goals and strategies for dealing with this problem. This is not to imply that contamination of these sites is insignificant. To the contrary, the amount of radioactive and hazardous waste at the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex is so great that more effective action is absolutely essential.
<p>
The Environmental Management program was supposed to clean up all sites within 30 years. Agreements signed by DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and state regulatory agencies specify requirements and set milestones for achieving those requirements. Unfortunately, however, the costs of cleanup have escalated rapidly, breakthroughs in technology have not occurred at the pace originally estimated, and the nature and scope of the contamination problem simply are not known. "As a result," notes the General Accounting Office, these cleanup "agreements taken together do not reflect a national strategy of targeting resources based on the highest risks to human health and the environment."<sup>11</sup>  It is now clear that DOE will not be able to clean up the sites either within the 30-year time frame or any time soon thereafter.<p>Much of the problem lies with the assumptions that were made in setting these goals. The focus has been on timelines for reducing contamination rather than on the more sensible goal of reducing risk to human health and safety to the maximum extent possible for any given level of funding. This "biggest bang for the buck" approach would save far more lives at far less cost. For instance, if a site poses little threat to the local population, it may be better to delay cleanup until it becomes a higher priority. This would allow funds to be spent on sites that pose a more likely threat. Additionally, since the value of money is a function of time (how far in the future it is spent), cleanups would cost relatively less in the future -- especially if new technologies are invented. Alternative strategies such as land use controls also might encourage more effective cleanup decisions.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills contain solid provisions for prioritizing remediation actions at the various contamination sites. First they would transfer cleanup responsibilities to a civilian office within the Department of Defense. Then clear goals for reducing overall risks to public health would be adopted to ensure that the most dangerous sites are cleaned up first. These sensible reorganization and prioritization plans would ensure an efficient yet effective process of remediation.
<p>
<b>Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management</b>
<p>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is charged with constructing a permanent repository for the nuclear waste generated at civilian nuclear power plants. In the past, this material has been stored "on-site."  Realizing the danger to residents of surrounding areas, Congress in 1982 passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), which mandated the construction of a single storage site that could hold all of the nation's nuclear waste beginning in 1998.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Reconstitute OCRWM as a mixed government-private corporation as a first step toward full privatization.<sup>12</sup><p><li>Redefine the new corporation's mission to concentrate on interim rather than permanent storage.<p><li>Establish concrete goals leading to the commencement of storage in 1998.<p></ul>Rationale:  The Department of Energy's efforts to create a safe and permanent repository have been dismal from the start. DOE has spent more than $4 billion just to study the viability of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada and estimates that another $2.3 billion will be necessary over the next 15 years. The construction, maintenance, and operation of the future repository will cost an estimated $30 billion. Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office now estimates that storage cannot begin until 2023.<sup>13</sup>  In other words, for every year OCRWM has been in existence, it has fallen a year behind schedule.
<p>
These inefficiencies are attributable primarily to two factors. First, the National Waste Policy Act specifically requires the permanent, rather than temporary, storage of nuclear wastes. This has added great costs to the investigation process and will add even more to the future cost of storage and maintenance. Several proposals over the years, including Senator Grams's legislation and this year's House-passed appropriations bill, require the federal government to consider interim storage.<sup>14</sup>  This would allow storage and waste consolidation to begin in the near future. It also would allow for more detailed research and development into viable options for permanent storage.<p>Second, the program's organizational structure reflects many of the inefficiencies that haunt the Department of Energy in general:  excessively high expenses, scheduling lapses, poor contractor management, and a politically charged environment. Numerous studies over the past decade have commented on these problems and suggested that their cause is OCRWM's position within the Department of Energy. As early as 1984, only two years after the office was created, a report to the Secretary of Energy found that "Location of OCRWM within the Department of Energy makes it vulnerable to changes of policy and senior management as Administrations come and go."<sup>15</sup>  Studies generally have suggested that OCRWM be moved out of the Department of Energy and given the freedom to operate without political constraints.<sup>16 </sup><p>It is widely felt that the dangers presented by the transportation and storage of nuclear waste justify both stringent federal oversight of OCRWM and the timely and cost-effective construction of a nuclear waste repository. In the short term, both goals can be accomplished by creating a mixed government-private corporation. Such an organization would retain government oversight to ensure safety while allowing for efficiencies associated with private-sector incentives. In the long run, full privatization w
ill encourage the most efficient waste disposal by eliminating government interference in day-to-day operations. Safety standards could still be enforced through stringent congressional oversight.
<p>
Neither congressional proposal addresses the future of OCRWM privatization. Instead, control over civilian nuclear waste disposal is given to the Army Corps of Engineers. Given the long history of failure within the Army Corps,<sup>17</sup> it is disturbing that both Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would give it such a sensitive responsibility. It also does not seem likely that simply transferring its responsibilities to another government organization will solve the office's structural deficiencies.
<p>
High-Energy Science Research<sup>18</sup><br>The Department of Energy spends over $1.1 billion per year on basic research in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and other general science programs. Many of these projects, such as the recently terminated <a href="http://www.ssc.gov">Superconducting Super Collider</a>, are considered "big science" because they require large and expensive facilities and teams of researchers.
<p>
The department owns nearly 30 research facilities around the country, nearly all of them managed and operated under contract by universities and private organizations. Of these facilities, 17 direct most of their programming to basic science and technology, high-energy physics, or nuclear physics research. Five are multi-program laboratories like <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne</a> near Chicago; <a href="http://suntid.bnl.gov:8080/bnl.html">Brookhaven</a> in Upton, New York; and <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore</a> in Berkeley, California. Another 12 are specialized, or "program-dedicated."  These include Fermilab near Chicago; the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> near Stanford, California; and the Structural Biology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (formerly known as the Laboratory of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences) at the University of California at Los Angeles.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Phase out over three years all federal funding for general science and basic research.
<p>
<li>Transfer the federal laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them or sell them to private-sector operators. 
<p>
<li>Shift any remaining funding for basic research to the National Science Foundation. 
<p>
<li>Award all funds based on competitive bids.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Many of the laboratories now owned by the Department of Energy were established during World War II in conjunction with the Manhattan Project, which resulted in the world's first atomic bomb. Since then, they have "expanded their missions to encompass civilian research and development in many disciplines -- from high-energy physics to advanced computing," reports the GAO; but because of DOE mismanagement, "the multi-program laboratories -- both individually and as a group -- do not have either clearly defined missions or specific implementation strategies that bring together laboratory resources to focus on accomplishing departmental objectives or national goals."<sup>19</sup>  With no defined mission, other analysts report, these laboratories often compete directly with the private sector.<p>More surprising is the amount of money DOE has spent subsidizing private companies. For instance, the department has spent more than $5.2 billion on "technology transfer" programs. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary defends this by stating, "It's about jobs; it's about creating jobs. If we don't create jobs, then it's a failure."  As two <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> reporters note, "By O'Leary's own measure then, it's a flop."<sup>20</sup>  Between 1990 and 1994, for example, the federal government, largely through the DOE laboratories, transferred $293.1 million to eight large companies with annual revenues of $700 billion. Yet, over the same four-year period, these eight firms reduced their U.S. payrolls by 329,438 positions and their research and development budgets by $516 million (two dollars for every dollar of government subsidy).<sup>21</sup><p>Numerous studies, including the recent Galvin Commission report, have made recommendations to DOE on how to focus the work of these laboratories, but the department has failed to do so. Indeed, many laboratory managers report that the Energy bureaucracy often stands in the way of scientific progress. These managers "view DOE's day-to-day management as costly a
nd unproductive in meeting the laboratories' missions."<sup>22</sup> <p>The only way to free these laboratories from DOE's bureaucratic micromanagement is to sell them to private research firms or transfer them at nominal charge to the universities currently operating them. This would allow these facilities to forge partnerships with other private technology interests or to pursue basic research independent of the political or budgetary process. 
<p>
Federal funding should be phased out over a three-year period to give these facilities time to find other sources of funding. One option would be to use the $1.6 billion realized from selling the Naval Petroleum Reserve to establish an endowment for university basic research facilities, freeing them permanently from the uncertainties of the budget process.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals would establish a laboratory closure commission, similar to the present military base closure commission, to study the problem and recommend which DOE laboratories (except for those engaged in defense-related activities) should be closed, privatized, or downsized. It is important that Congress establish strict guidelines for the commission so that facilities which remain within the structure of the federal government engage solely in research directly applicable to federal functions. Such guidelines would mandate that all laboratories, regardless of stated mission, are investigated for inefficiencies and wasteful programs.
<p>
<b>Power Marketing Administrations</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) which sell wholesale electricity generated by 131 dams built and maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. These PMAs (Alaska, Bonneville, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Area) sold nearly $3 billion worth of electric power in 1994 -- just under 8 percent of all power generated in the United States.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>End all federal assistance to the PMAs, including direct appropriations and the authority to borrow from the Treasury.
<p>
<li>Sell the Power Marketing Administrations to private investors through a variety of privatization schemes by the end of 1998. 
<p>
<li>Sell the hydroelectric power plants by the turn of the century.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  After nearly 50 years of taxpayer subsidies, it is time for the five Power Marketing Administrations to become fully private enterprises. Customers have enjoyed hidden subsidies for years because these government-owned utilities have been able to borrow from the Treasury at below-market interest rates and take as long as 50 years to pay back the loans. Of the more than $16 billion lent to the PMAs by the Treasury, only about 25 percent has been repaid.<sup>23</sup><p>PMA electricity is not sold to the highest bidder. Instead, it is sold at varying rates to municipal utilities, cooperatives, industrial users, other government facilities, and investor-owned utilities. Municipal utilities and rural cooperatives are "preference customers," which means they pay for electricity at cost -- often as little as half the rates paid by customers in other parts of the country. Industrial users have a different rate schedule. Aluminum companies, for example, consume as much as one-third of Bonneville's power, and "the rate they pay is, by contract, tied to aluminum prices."  Thus, when aluminum prices fell over the past five years, Bonneville was buying power "for as much as 3.5 cents a kilowatt hour, [but] it had to sell it to those utilities for 1.8."<sup>24</sup> <p>Selling the PMAs is the only way to bring sound business practices to these government-owned utilities. Congress should follow the example of countries around the world that are moving to privatize their state-owned utilities. In 1993, for instance, Argentina, Germany, and the United Kingdom raised a total of $4.4 billion by selling state-owned electric utilities to private investors -- including U.S. investors. 
<p>
The British experience is particularly relevant to the United States. In 1991, the British government restructured its government-owned electricity-generating facilities into four regional corporations and sold them to the public in a stock offering. These companies compete to offer electricity through a national grid system. They also compete with various small producers. The stock offering included preferential pricing for employees as well as discounts and incentives for electricity customers and small investors. Stock also was offered for purchase on foreign exchanges. This strategy of building support for the sale among employees, customers, and small investors made the sale very popular. The stock offering was heavily oversubscribed and yielded over $6 billion for taxpayers.
<p>
When the Reagan Administration failed to get Congress to act on its 1987 proposal to sell the Alaska and Southeastern PMAs, it tried unsuccessfully to reform the PMAs' debt repayment schedules. This effort has continued under the Bush and Clinton Administrations. This year, the Clinton Administration also is renewing the effort to sell four of the PMAs (excluding Bonneville) for a total of about $3.7 billion. The White House says it will work with Congress to develop specific proposals to privatize these assets. President Clinton's fiscal 1996 budget projects that the Alaska sale could generate $83 million. This sale has been in negotiation for more than six years and could be completed quickly if Congress acts to authorize it.
<p>
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that the relatively small Southeastern and Southwestern PMAs could be sold for $500 million each.<sup>25</sup>  The Southeastern PMA, which sells less than 2 percent of the power in its region, could be sold swiftly to regional utilities because it does not own or operate any transmission facilities. It simply pays a fee to various utilities to market power through their transmission lines. The Southwestern PMA, which accounts for 4 percent of the energy sold in its region, also could be sold to regional investor-owned utilities.
<p>
OMB estimates that selling the much larger Western Area PMA (WAPA) headquartered in Golden, Colorado, could generate some $2.6 billion. According to the Department of Energy, while WAPA markets about 9 percent of the power in its region, its service area covers 1.3 million square miles, and its wholesale customers provide power to 16 million consumers in 15 central and western states. Because of its large distribution area, WAPA should be broken up and sold in manageable pieces to investors.
<p>
Selling Bonneville (BPA) would be more complicated because of its size and the fact that it provides about 65 percent of the electric power in the Northwest. One method, used successfully by such countries as Britain, would be to sell through a broad-based stock option plan in order to neutralize opposition from the interests served by Bonneville and win popular support from public investors. Stock could be sold at favorable prices to employees, residential customers, environmentalists, fishing and agricultural interests, or others who may feel they stand to lose from privatization. Such a move also might bring support from the many investor-owned and public utilities in the region which reportedly have threatened to build their own power generators to free themselves from BPA's near-monopoly status.<sup>26</sup><p>Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals call for immediate sale of the Alaskan, Western, Southwestern, and Southeastern Power Marketing Administrations. This would result in savings of roughly $3 billion over the next five years. In addition, both plans transfer control of the Bonneville Power Marketing Administration to the Department of the Interior and direct the Secretary of Interior to conduct a study outlining future courses for Bonneville.
<p>
<b>Energy Supply Research and Development</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $3.7 billion per year on research designed to develop or improve sources of energy. Initiated in response to the OPEC oil embargo to free U.S. consumers from dependence on foreign oil, these projects involve research on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and nuclear power, and such non-renewable sources as fossil fuels. Appropriations approved by Congress for fiscal 1995 include, among others, $442 million for fossil energy R&D, $288 million for solar energy research, $37 million for geothermal research, $293 million for nuclear energy research, and $49 million for wind energy systems.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all federal funding for energy supply research and development, including fossil fuel R&D.
<p>
<li>Privatize all government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In today's dollars, the federal government has spent over $70 billion on energy research programs since the Department of Energy was created in 1977 and has little or nothing to show for it. The United States imports 30 percent more petroleum now than before the oil shock of 1973, and alternative energy supply methods account for only one percent of all energy produced in this country.<sup>27</sup><p>Much of this DOE-funded research is already conducted by private firms or simply irrelevant to market needs. Electric utilities, for instance, voluntarily fund the $240 million-per-year Electric Power Research Institute at no government expense. Moreover, "the major new technologies for enhanced oil recovery... have come from private industry, not DOE," according to the Congressional Budget Office, and DOE's $9 billion investment in nuclear fission research has gone to waste because the private sector has no interest in building new nuclear power plants. Thus, Energy "has little in the way of commercial applications to show for its investment."<sup>28</sup>  All the federal government's attempts to outguess the energy market have produced are such expensive failures as the Synthetic Fuels Corporation and the Clinch River Breeder Reactor.<sup>29</sup>  Federal funding for renewable and non-renewable energy research and development should be halted immediately.<p>There are seven federal laboratories engaged in Energy Supply R&D research:  one multi-program laboratory (the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) and six program-dedicated laboratories like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. These facilities consume over $1 billion of total Energy Supply R&D funds. Congress should move to sell all seven to the private firms which currently operate them or transfer them to the universities with which they are affiliated. Private firms then can choose to continue funding for any research they decide is commercially relevant.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills include a review of these research and development activities by a laboratory closure commission. The Tiahrt plan is bolder because it establishes specific spending reductions for each of the next five fiscal years (a 25 percent reduction in fiscal 1997 and 50 percent reductions in each following year); Senator Grams proposes to leave any reductions to the discretion of the commission. The problem with allowing a commission to review DOE's research activities is that, while it helps remove political pressures from the process, it also fails to take into account the dismal record of these activities. DOE's energy supply research and development should be terminated, immediately and completely.
<p>
<b>Naval Petroleum Reserves</b>
<p>
Established in 1912, the federally owned Naval Petroleum Reserve (NPR) is comprised of two commercial oil fields at Elk Hills (near Bakersfield, California) and Teapot Dome (near Casper, Wyoming) and oil-shale reserves (near Rifle, Colorado).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the highest bidder.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no longer any compelling national, strategic, or commercial reason for the federal government to own the Naval Petroleum Reserve. These oil fields were set aside by Presidents William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson to assure fuel for the Navy as it converted from coal to oil. By and large, they sat idle until the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974, when Congress decided that NPR oil should be pumped and sold and the proceeds used to ready the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Department of Energy owns 78 percent of the Elk Hills facility, and a private oil company (Chevron) owns the remaining 22 percent. Overall, the NPR is the equivalent of less than one percent of total U.S. domestic output -- hardly enough to be vital to national security interests.
<p>
Although the NPR generates more than $400 million per year in revenue to the government, studies have found that these fields are operated far less efficiently than comparable privately owned oil fields. The NPR was targeted for privatization by the Reagan Administration in a proposal endorsed by the President's Commission on Privatization in 1988. The Clinton Administration's fiscal 1996 budget also proposes selling the NPR, but Congress so far has failed to act. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the government's interest could be sold for some $1.5 billion, netting roughly $321 million after deducting the more than $400 million in revenues the NPR produces each year.<sup>30</sup>  Congress should embrace this effort and remove any legislative obstacles to selling these assets as quickly as possible.<p>The Tiahrt bill would transfer responsibility for the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the Department of the Interior and mandate the sale of a significant portion of the reserves to the private sector. The Secretary of Interior would then conduct a study to determine the best course of action concerning the remaining reserves. The Grams proposal, on the other hand, calls for sale of the entire reserve. This approach is preferable because it would result in much larger savings and serve taxpayers better.
<p>
<b>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</b>
<p>
Created by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, the nearly 600 million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a government-owned stockpile of crude oil available for release in the event of market disruptions such as the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974. The Department of Energy operates six underground salt dome storage sites on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserve immediately.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has become an expensive and obsolete vestige of the regulated oil markets that existed before the Reagan Administration deregulated them in 1981. Over the past 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the United States has spent about $4 billion constructing the SPR storage facilities and another $17 billion to fill the reserves. Although Congress has not approved funds to expand the reserve beyond its current level of 592 million barrels, the annual cost of operating these facilities is some $200 million. 
<p>
Since deregulation, the oil market has become increasingly diversified and the futures market, which hedges against price fluctuations, has become highly sophisticated. As a result, interruptions in the world oil supply of the sort that occurred during the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990 and 1991 do not have the same impact on the economy they once did. Moreover, the CBO notes, while the market responded efficiently to the Gulf War interruption, "both the process of deciding to use the SPR and the mechanism for selling the oil may have actually contributed to market uncertainty at the time."<sup>31</sup>. <p>The CBO estimates the SPR's current market value at $10 billion, or about $17 per barrel. However, the sales value may be less because the SPR is suffering water leakage as well as heat and gas buildups, which may present difficulties in extracting the oil. But even a more reasonable purchase price of $7 to $10 per barrel would generate revenues of $4 billion to $6 billion. 
<p>
Both congressional plans to terminate DOE call for partial sale of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, principally those held at Weeks Island, Louisiana. Representative Tiahrt proposes to transfer control over the other portions to the Interior Department, with the Secretary of Interior responsible for determining whether there is justification for selling further reserves. Senator Grams proposes to transfer responsibility for the SPR to the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense then would be responsible for determining what portion of the reserves should be maintained and what portion sold. Whoever is responsible, the goal should be to privatize the maximum amount of SPR possible. The final bill should set strict guidelines to ensure this.
<p>
<b>Uranium Enrichment Facilities</b>
<p>
For some 40 years, the U.S. government ran two uranium enrichment facilities, one at Portsmouth, Ohio, and the other at Paducah, Kentucky. In 1992, the Energy Policy Act transformed this federal program into a wholly owned government corporation (similar to Amtrak) called the United States Enrichment Corporation. The USEC currently produces and markets uranium enrichment services to more than 60 private utilities that own and operate commercial nuclear power plants in this country and abroad. The corporation generates revenues of approximately $1.5 billion annually and, after expenses, returns a "dividend" of roughly $30 million to the Treasury.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<ul><p>
<li>Sell the U.S. Enrichment Corporation to the private sector in FY 1996.
</ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no reason for the U.S. government to operate a commercial business, especially one that returns only a small profit to the Treasury while maintaining effective market control over the industry. According to its own promotional material, the USEC serves "approximately 90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the world market."<sup>32</sup>  Its annual revenues of $1.5 billion would rank it 286th on the <i>Fortune</i> 500 list of industrial firms. <p>Congress should remove the many needless obstacles and impediments placed on the corporation by the 1992 Act so that it can be made more attractive to private buyers and investors and sold in FY 1996 for top dollar. A businesslike enrichment corporation could bring bids of at least $1 billion if freed from oppressive congressional restrictions. Ideally, the two facilities should be sold to different buyers to avoid creating a private monopoly.
<p>
The House already has passed legislation to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
<p>
<b>Energy Conservation Research and Grant Programs</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $800 million per year for energy conservation and research. This research is targeted toward improving energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy, such as transportation, industry, private and public buildings, and utilities.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all DOE conservation research and grant programs.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  This program funds research and grants that should be financed by the private sector and state or local governments. For FY 1995, for example, Congress approved over $430 million for research targeted toward private industry. This funding includes some $20 million for building systems, $2 million for heating and cooling technology, over $25 million for industrial co-generation, $22 million for materials and metals processing, over $50 million for alternative fuels utilization, $1.2 million for "engine optimization in alternative fuels utilization," $1 million for vehicle systems materials, $1.5 million for light duty engine development, and some $3 million for international market development.
<p>
Congress also earmarked $226 million for state-based weatherization programs, $22 million for state conservation programs, and an additional $29 million for the "institutional conservation program."33  However important these conservation measures may be, they are not properly a function of the federal government. Congress should get out of the business of funding and micromanaging purely private research and purely local responsibilities. <p>Energy Information, Policy, Regulation, and Departmental Administration<br>Some $400 million of the Department of Energy's $18 billion-per-year budget is dedicated to departmental administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Energy Information Administration, and the Office of Economic Regulation.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency similar to the Federal Communications Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<p>
<li>Close down or privatize the Energy Information Administration.
<p>
<li>Eliminate all funding for non-defense departmental administration while closing down the Department of Energy. 
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In testimony before a congressional subcommittee earlier this year, the General Accounting Office warned that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management of the nuclear weapons complex to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight of contractors, inadequate information systems, and work force weaknesses."<sup>34</sup>  Although the department has reorganized many times over the years to correct these deficiencies, those efforts have failed. The only recourse for Congress is to close the agency.
<p>
To dismantle the Department of Energy, Congress will have to complete various housekeeping duties such as eliminating over $400 million per year in departmental overhead funding and spinning off entities which can stand alone. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is charged with regulating certain interstate aspects of the natural gas, oil pipeline, hydropower, and electric industries, easily could be made an independent agency like the Federal Communications Commission. FERC is basically self-financed by the fees paid by regulated industries. Congress should begin a serious debate, however, over the extent to which the federal government should continue to regulate the private energy sector.
<p>
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is a quasi-independent agency within the Department of Energy intended to collect and disseminate data on petroleum, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, electricity, alternate fuel sources, and energy consumption. All of the activities and functions performed by the EIA are carried out by private firms, newsletters, trade magazines, and industry associations. The EIA should be privatized and all federal funding eliminated.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The proposals by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would close down DOE, not just re-invent or re-organize it. This is important because it would prevent future Congresses from simply re-inflating the department's funding. In contrast, Secretary O'Leary's re-invention plan maintains DOE's inefficient bureaucracy and perpetuates some of the department's most unnecessary functions. And, although O'Leary's plan would "save" a reported $14.1 billion over five years, a significant portion of these savings are from asset sales. Once these sales are complete, the Department of Energy -- re-invented or not -- will continue to exist at little or no savings to taxpayers. The two congressional termination plans, on the other hand, ensure large savings well beyond the next five years.
<p>
Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Energy does not fit this description. There is no role for DOE in energy supply or regulation with the fall of OPEC and a stable international flow of oil. There is no need for massive nuclear weapons production with the end of the Cold War. All that remains of the Department of Energy's core missions are environmental remediation and research and development. The first could be managed more efficiently by the Department of Defense. The second should be the responsibility of private-sector energy providers. Thus, while DOE still performs a few functions that are likely to continue as federal responsibilities, these functions in no way justify continuing the U.S. Department of Energy as an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

<title>Time To Permit Oil Drilling In the Arctic Refuge</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TIME TO PERMIT OIL DRILLING IN THE ARCTIC REFUGE</i></h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 432<br>
October 17, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

	The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska is the subject of heated debate as some Members of Congress, led by Senators Frank Murkowski (R-AK) and Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Representative Don Young (R-AK), attempt to open a small fraction of the area to oil exploration and production. A provision included in the budget reconciliation would open the Coastal Plain area of ANWR. This effort is a sensible approach that could dramatically expand much-needed domestic oil production with negligible impact on the environment.
<p>
	ANWR is an enormous area of land located in the Northeast corner of Alaska within the Arctic Circle. Contrary to the image evoked by opponents of oil production, that ANWR is the last small pristine area left in Alaska, the state has an abundance of hardy ecosystems. In addition to the healthy ecosystems existing on millions of acres of private and state land, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 set aside 100 million acres of land as parks, refuges, and preserves, including 57 million acres of wilderness. ANWR itself covers 19.8 million acres. While eight million acres of ANWR were set aside as wilderness, 1.5 million acres were designated for review by the Department of Interior (DOI) to recommend future management of high potential oil resources. In 1987, DOI recommended that this 1.5 million acres, known as the Coastal Plain, be leased for oil and gas exploration and production in an environmentally sensitive manner.
<p>
	The provision in the budget reconciliation bill would implement DOI's recommendation. But only a tiny fraction -- far less than one percent -- of the Coastal Plain area would be affected. Advancing technology over the last 20 years has reduced the necessary size or "footprint" of drilling operations to less than one-fifth of what was required, say, at Prudhoe Bay. So exploration and production would affect only about 2,000 acres. To put this in perspective, that is an area about one-sixth the size of Dulles Airport near Washington, D.C., and about 0.01 percent of the total area of ANWR. Even in this very limited area, modern sophisticated operations adopt many environmentally sensitive methods which further limit any ecological impact.
<p>
	Expanded oil production is badly needed. The United States currently imports more than half its oil consumption, and reliance on foreign oil is growing. That raises national security concerns and is an unwelcome factor in foreign policy considerations. This reliance caused a $51 billion oil trade deficit last year -- roughly equivalent to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Foreign energy dependence would be eased considerably if the Coastal Plain produced oil. The area potentially could produce 1.5 million barrels of oil per day for at least a quarter of a century, thereby increasing domestic production by almost 25 percent. Allowing limited drilling in ANWR also would reduce the trade deficit by about $14 billion per year. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal revenues from lease sales would be $1.3 billion over the next seven years, helping to trim the budget deficit.
<p>
	Alaska's residents would be big beneficiaries of lease sales. Alaska has agreed to split the estimated $2.6 billion revenue from lease sales evenly with the federal government (rather than take the 90 percent to which the state otherwise would be entitled), so the state still will receive $1.3 billion. This partially explains why three-quarters of Alaskans support the plan.
<p>
	Not only will Alaskans and the federal treasury benefit from increased oil production, but an estimated 222,000-732,000 jobs will be created throughout the country. There will be new hires in the oil industry and manufacturers, suppliers, and transporters of oil-related equipment will increase hiring dramatically, with fully 98 percent of these jobs in the lower 48 states. Based on a mid-range estimate of job creation, this one action would drop the unemployment rate by 0.36 percentage points.1
<p>
	The only potentially legitimate objection to opening the Coastal Plain of ANWR to oil drilling would be on environmental grounds. But these concerns are without merit because of the very limited impact of modern drilling and production techniques. Even the "pro-environment" native Inupiat Eskimos, who live in or near the Coastal Plain and opposed oil drilling in Prudhoe Bay 60 miles away, support onshore oil development in the area. As Inupiat Mayor George Ahmagak of the North Slope Borough wrote last June, "Our whalers and hunters make maximum use of our few resources, always taking care not to harm the land so their grandchildren may in turn carry on their culture.... As Mayor, I can state unequivocally that the people of the North Slope Borough enthusiastically support the presence of the oil industry in our land.... The wisdom of our Elders teaches us the value of hunting where game is most plentiful. Likewise, it makes sense for our nation to seek oil in an area that even [DOI] has identified as the country's best prospect for new petroleum deposits."2
<p>
	Exploration is opposed by the Gwich'in Indians, who live 120 miles south and have strong ties to the environmental lobby. They are concerned about protecting their hunt of 300-350 animals from the 152,000 porcupine caribou. While the herd size has fallen from its high of 180,000 a few years ago, oil drilling is unlikely to have any negative impact. One reason for this confidence is that the Central Arctic caribou herd living in the Prudhoe Bay area already has increased its population over sevenfold since oil production began 20 years ago, despite dire warnings at the time that the herd would decline sharply if oil drilling was permitted. In fact, the second-largest oil field in the U.S. is the favorite place for caribou to give birth. 
<p>
	 The facts are clear. Permitting oil production in ANWR would spur economic growth, cut the trade deficit, and ease national security concerns. Moreover, it poses virtually no threat to the environment. It is time for Congress to give the green light to limited exploration and production.

INTRODUCTION

<P>   After eighteen high-level hearings, and a review of 29,000 pages
of written material and hundreds of proposals, the Energy Department
earlier this year released its National Energy Strategy. Known as the
NES, this is a wide-ranging list of particular recommendations for
every type of energy and just about every energy issue.
<P>   The report comes at a time of much confusion about America's
energy situation and the policies that will best guarantee America's
energy security. For example, figures recently released by the Energy
Department show the country's oil imports dropping by around 1 million
barrels per day or 12 percent of the country's total use. While some
observers might thus assume that there is no energy problem, in the
long term America's energy needs will increase. More energy will have
to be produced domestically or imported from overseas. In addition,
Congress is considering a higher gas tax. Such a tax would increase
costs for consumers and businesses, reducing American competitiveness
and lowering American living standards. At the levels of taxes being
discussed, perhaps ten cents per gallon, oil consumption would not be
significantly reduced. A tax of, say, 50 cents per gallon would reduce
consumption dramatically -- by bringing the American economy to a
halt. This is hardly a result acceptable to most policy makers.

<P> Sound Recommendations. On the whole, the report is well balanced
and its recommendations sound. Its major dual message is the need to
reduce or eliminate government regulations that discourage energy
production and the need to free entrepreneurs to meet America's energy
needs. 

<P> As important as what the NES does, however, is what the NES does
not do. In particular, it avoids many of the disastrous errors of the
1970s, when the federal government believed that it could control
America's energy supply and demand. The results of this are well
known: soaring energy prices, block-long gas lines, and uncertainty
about America's energy and economic future. To be sure, there are
shortcomings. The NES does tend to call for government research in
energy areas that might best be left to the private sector. And in
some cases the report could be more emphatic about the need for market
reforms. But if policy makers do follow the NES roadmap, in general
they will be taking America down the path to energy security.

<P> Among NES topics and recommendations:

<P> Energy Production and Efficiency. To promote both production and
efficiency, the NES suggests more deregulation of local electrical
monopolies, strict market pricing for electricity, and federal
government purchases of natural gas vehicles.

<P> Domestic Oil. To increase the domestic oil supply, the NES
recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer
Continental Shelf to oil exploration.

<P> Western Hemisphere Energy Security. To reduce America's reliance
on oil from the politically unstable Middle East without raising costs
to consumers, the NES emphasizes negotiating freer energy trade and
investment in the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Natural Gas. To make maximum use of this clean energy source,
found in abundance in America, the NES suggests, among other things,
deregulating pipeline construction and pricing and removing
restrictions on imports and exports of natural gas.

<P> Domestic Coal. To make better use of this resource, also found
in abundance in America, the NES recommends a consistent and
predictable, rather than arbitrary, application of environmental laws,
using coal slurry pipelines and preventing the Environmental
Protection Agency from mandating specific technology and production
methods for coal plants.

<P> Nuclear Energy. The NES points out that this is a safe, non-
polluting energy source, and suggests research to develop better
designs for nuclear plants, to reform licensing procedures, and to
increase the potential sites for nuclear waste disposal.

<P> Renewable Energy and Electricity. The NES recommends removing
licensing restrictions on hydroelectric plants and continuing research
into nuclear fusion.
<P> A major NES failing is the scant attention that it gives some
key issues. For one thing, tax policy needs an overhaul. While the NES
suggests modest changes in the tax code, what is needed is a
restoration of all those tax code pressures dealing with the energy
industry that Congress has eliminated since 1969.

<P> For another thing, the NES should be more emphatic about
developing a Western Hemisphere common market for energy to diversify
supplies and reduce dependence on the Middle East. 

<P> These deficiencies, however, are dwarfed by the achievement of
the NES in presenting, for the first time, a comprehensive review of
America's energy situation and in offering many market-oriented
proposals for America's future energy security. 

<P> The NES already is prompting action on Capitol Hill. On June 4
the Senate Energy Committee approved S.1220, the National Energy
Security Act, co-sponsored by Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana
Democrat, and Malcolm Wallop, the Wyoming Republican. Essentially
similar to the Bush Administration's NES, the bill faces an uncertain
fate. Many amendments could be added to it that would make America
less energy secure. The House of Representatives is working on its own
version of a comprehensive energy bill. 

<P> The Free Market Acts. When Saddam Hussein overran Kuwait about a
year ago, crude oil prices shot to record levels. Some lawmakers urged
a return to the interventionist energy policies of the 1970s. The Bush
Administration wisely resisted this. Although the Iraqi crisis reduced
world crude oil production by 4.1 million barrels per day, roughly the
same as the 1973 Arab oil boycott and 1979 Iranian oil embargo, thanks
to the Bush Administration's response, the results were entirely
different. In both 1973 and 1979, emergency government controls
greatly aggravated the effects of the disruption. In 1990, the
Administration allowed the market to operate freely. As a result, the
oil price rise was brief, peaking last October. By this February oil
prices fell to below prewar levels. There were no 1970s-style gas
lines.

<P> History demonstrates that the best government role in the energy
sector is to assure that markets operate without hindrance. Markets,
as even East European leaders now recognize, are the most efficient
means of allocating resources. Yet federal government restrictions
continue to impede the market's function in energy. Removing these
obstacles deserves a high priority if America is to achieve energy
security. 
<P>
AMERICA'S ENERGY SITUATION

<P> The United States is a country rich in energy. Domestic coal,
natural gas, and oil are pillars of America's energy base. Still,
current patterns of production and consumption will have to change in
the future as known resources are exhausted. 

<P> Fossil fuels account for 89.2 percent of all energy used in the
U.S. Oil is America's most important energy source. Last year, oil
accounted for some 40 percent of American energy use. Next came
natural gas, accounting for 24 percent of consumption, followed by
coal at 23.3 percent. Nuclear energy contributed 7 percent of
America's needs, with the rest coming from hydroelectric dams, and
alternative energy sources. 

<P> Even these figures, though, understate the importance of oil.
Some 97 percent of all transportation energy comes from petroleum.
While alternative fuels have made modest inroads in the transportation
market, it will be a decade or more before they can offset oil
consumption significantly.

<P> This May, Americans used an average of 15,844,000 barrels per
day (b/d) of oil, roughly one million less than in 1990. During this
period, America's oil imports fell by 7.2 percent, from 8,649,000 b/d
to 8,027,000 b/d. Still, America relies on foreign oil for more than
half of its needs. More disturbing, America's oil production fell from
around nine million b/d in 1985 to roughly 7.3 million b/d in 1990, a
decline of almost 19 percent. 

<P> Though the Persian Gulf crisis spurred higher American oil
output, the boost was small and as it turns out, temporary. Of more
fundamental importance is the fact that America's "proved reserves" --
essentially the oil that America has on the shelf -- have declined by
over 27 percent since the 1973 Arab oil embargo.

<P> That America imports great quantities of oil is not, in itself,
a problem. The real concern is whether the level of imports leaves
America vulnerable to severe economic dislocation should foreign oil
supplies suddenly be disrupted. This was the case in the 1970s, when
two sudden and sharp price hikes rocked the American economy. When all
factors are taken into account, the combined effects of the 1973 Arab
oil embargo, and 1979 Iranian oil boycott cost America an astounding
$1.5 trillion between 1974 and 1984. 

<P> And the 1970s oil shocks occurred when U.S. oil imports were far
lower than they are today. America now imports over half its oil
compared with 34.8 percent in 1973. Some 27 percent of imports, or
11.8 percent of American consumption, comes from the Persian Gulf,
primarily from Saudi Arabia. The price hike that followed the invasion
of Kuwait cost American consumers nearly $39 billion in higher oil
prices. 

<P> To hedge against abrupt interruptions of oil supplies from
abroad, the U.S. government maintains 587.5 million barrels of crude
oil stored in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). If all imports
from all sources were cut off, the SPR would last about 75 days at
current rates of consumption. Not much more oil could be obtained at
short notice from American sources. The Energy Department estimates
that even under the most favorable circumstances domestic oil
production in the past year could have been increased by only about
100,000 b/d -- and this would have taken about a year. 

<P> Thus security of supply is a fundamental consideration in
American energy policy. This is recognized by NES. Its recommendations
aim at a secure energy future achieved through market-based actions
that improve efficiency, enhance security of supply, assure a clean
environment, and fortify the foundations of America's energy economy. 
<P>
INCREASING ENERGY AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY

<P> The NES devotes 42 of its 189 pages to energy conservation,
attained by boosting energy efficiency. While it is true that the
document does not call for the sorts of mandates, regulations, and
subsidies that were in favor during the 1970s, the dismal failure of
those measures readily justifies their absence. Instead, the NES makes
concrete suggestions for energy efficiency improvements for
electricity generation, residential and commercial buildings use,
industrial use, and transportation.
<P>
** Electricity

<P> Most electricity is generated by utility companies, which are
local monopolies closely regulated by state and federal authorities.
This system stifles competition and is inefficient. The NES addresses
these shortcomings by seeking increased competition within the
electricity market. To do this, the NES proposes amending the 56-year-
old Public Utility Holding Company Act to permit utilities to build,
own, and operate power plants outside their traditional service area.
The NES also would eliminate size restrictions on so-called
Independent Power Producers (IPPs) -- firms that are not part of a
public utility, but that build and operate plants that sell
electricity to utilities. Current size restrictions prevent IPPs from
competing with traditional utilities for the construction of new
generating capacity. 

<P> The NES also supports efforts by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to allow IPPs to use existing electricity
transmission lines owned by local electric utility monopolies.
Currently, local monopolies need not permit IPPs access to such lines.
To expand operations, IPPs must have access to transmission
facilities.

<P> The NES also recommends eliminating subsidies to the federal
Power Marketing Authorities -- or PMAs. Established in 1906 to
distribute the electricity generated by federal water projects, the
PMAs sell power to their customers at prices below market cost; the
taxpayer absorbs the difference. To date, PMAs have cost the Treasury
$4 billion. As a result, PMA customers predictably waste "inexpensive"
electricity. Phasing out the huge subsidies to PMAs would encourage
conservation and promote general economic efficiency, ending the waste
of taxpayer dollars. 
<P>
** Commercial and Residential Energy Efficiency

<P> Residential use accounts for around 20 percent of American
energy consumption. Each year, 90 million American households spend
around $100 billion for heating, lighting, cooking, and other uses.
Commercial buildings account for about 15 percent of total energy
consumption, and about $70 billion in annual outlays.

<P> Residential use of energy dropped by about one-third between
1962 and 1986 because of efficiency improvements in appliances, and
investments by homeowners in energy-saving measures. Yet the use of
the various kinds of fuel consumed to generate power for homeowners
increased as they shifted away from oil and coal for space heating and
water heating. The fastest growing end users of primary energy,
meanwhile, are commercial buildings, as a result of the spread of air-
conditioning and the proliferation of computers, copiers, printers,
and other office equipment.

<P> A main obstacle identified by the NES to improving residential
and commercial energy efficiency are government regulations that
prevent energy prices from reflecting fully the real costs of
generating the energy. Another obstacle is that government-owned
housing is insulated from market forces and public housing authorities
feel no competitive need to increase energy efficiency. 

<P> NES recommendations for commercial and residential energy mainly
aim to spur research and development and education. The NES recognizes
that conservation must be market-driven. One flaw in the NES
recommendation, however, is the call for government efficiency
standards for residences and commercial buildings. Mandating
efficiency in buildings was attempted in the 1970s without success. 
<P>
** Industrial Energy Efficiency

<P> The industrial sector accounts for about one-quarter of American
energy consumption. Industrial energy conservation as a response to
market forces is one of the great success stories of the American
energy economy. Between 1973 and 1989, the value of goods and services
produced in America rose by 50 percent in real terms; the amount of
energy required to produce these actually fell by 6 percent. Private
industry reflexively responded to high energy prices by conserving
energy. 

<P> The NES's primary recommendation to improve industrial energy
efficiency is additional funding for research and development to help
firms find new ways to use waste as a fuel. Yet industries already
spend an estimated $46 billion annually for pollution control. Thus
industry already has a strong financial incentive to find ways to use
waste as a fuel. This is because the process of using waste products
to generate energy consumes many pollutants. NES also recommends
increased use of energy audits by industry. Such audits permit firms
to identify areas in which they can reduce energy consumption and thus
save money with existing technologies. The federal Department of
Energy's help in this is particularly important for small - and
medium-sized firms, which often lack the technical capability to
perform such audits themselves. 
<P>
** Transportation Energy Use

<P> The greatest opportunity for improving American energy
efficiency is in transportation. Last year Americans spent $200
billion on transportation fuels, accounting for two-thirds of
petroleum use and one-fourth of total energy consumption. Since 1976,
the amount of oil consumed by transportation has exceeded American
domestic production. Petroleum use for transportation is expected to
continue growing, rising to more than 42 percent of total energy use
by 2010, and to 66 percent by 2030.

<P> For transportation, the most important NES recommendation
encourages the use of alternative fuels. In principle this is sound.
Yet the NES shies away from evaluating specific alternative fuels. The
only exception is the NES recommendation to extend an already existing
tax credit to oil companies for using ethanol. Because of this tax
break, "gasohol," a blend of 10 percent ethanol/90 percent gasoline,
accounts for about 10 percent of the gasoline supply. This means that
ethanol is replacing about 1 percent of the gasoline, a very tiny
amount. The NES should have evaluated the merits of alternative fuels.
Had it done so, it probably would have concluded that natural gas is
the most promising alternative.
<P>
FLEET CONVERSION TO NATURAL GAS

<P> For America, natural gas is a good substitute for gasoline for
transportation. First, America has an abundance of natural gas. Were
it used in place of oil in all domestic fleet vehicles, current levels
of consumption could be maintained for more than a half-century.
Second, natural gas is clean burning and, as a gasoline substitute,
would reduce air pollution. 

<P> Natural gas would be best suited as a gasoline substitute in
fleet vehicles operated by a single owner such as a taxi company, a
delivery service, or a local government. Although comprising 6.5
percent of the total vehicle population, fleet vehicles consume
approximately 10 percent of all motor fuel. The $2,000 to $3,000 cost
for converting an engine to burn natural gas is currently a deterrent
to fleet use of this fuel. Were there greater demand, however,
vehicles could be equipped at the factory to use natural gas. This
would cut costs from 50 percent to 70 percent. Chrysler Corporation
and General Motors plan to establish experimental production lines for
alternative fueled cars and trucks. United Parcel Service and other
firms are converting part of their fleets. Local governments too may
want to buy natural gas vehicles to help meet air quality regulations.
Even at the current prices, the cost of converting fleets to natural
gas, the amount can be recovered in slightly over three years thanks
to lower fuel and operating costs. 

<P> Fueling Federal Fleets. The NES wisely calls for more public
education on the benefits of alternative fuel vehicles. Better still
is the NES suggestion that the federal government buy natural gas
vehicles for its fleets. The federal government owns more than 200,000
motor vehicles, and in fiscal 1990 alone purchased 49,188 civilian
vehicles. Federal purchases of natural gas vehicles would create
enough demand to justify the mass production lines that significantly
reduce costs. 

<P> This April 17, George Bush issued an Executive Order requiring
federal agencies to purchase as many alternative-fuel vehicles as
possible, and to compute cost/benefit ratios for the purchases on a
"lifecycle costing" basis. This means that the total cost of owning
and operating the vehicle over its useful life, rather than just its
purchase price, will be how a vehicle's cost is reckoned.

<P> Local governments, meanwhile, also could spur use of natural gas
by permitting gas utilities to supply natural gas for the vehicle fuel
market. Such sales would be part of what is termed a utility's "non-
core" business, which is not regulated because it is not part of a
utility's local monopoly. Allowing utilities to sell natural gas for
vehicles would introduce new competition and reduce fuel costs. 

<P> Increased demand for natural gas as a fuel for vehicles will cut
the prices of all aspects of this market. Example: It now costs from
$2,500 to $3,500 to buy a home compressor which can be attached to a
residential natural gas line to fuel a natural gas vehicle. If mass-
produced, the price could drop to under $1,000. A gas utility could
install such a unit and recover its cost over, say, five years through
fuel sales. As the number of natural gas vehicles increased, utilities
could also install natural gas compressors at gasoline filling
stations. Several already exist in the Washington, D.C., area. To do
this, however, utilities must be allowed to sell natural gas fuel as a
non-core business.
<P>
DOMESTIC OIL SECURITY

<P> The principal problems addressed by the NES are the potential
dangers to America's energy supplies. Oil is the most important
component of the U.S. energy mix, accounting for 42 percent of all
energy consumed and more than 97 percent of all transportation fuel.
Last year Americans consumed an average of 17 million b/d. U.S.
domestic production, however, has been falling, from just under 9
million b/d in 1985 to 7.3 million b/d in 1990. This is roughly 19
percent in domestic oil production. As a result, last year Americans
paid some $55 billion for net oil imports. This figure could rise to
$200 billion by 2010 according to Energy Department statistics. In the
first half of the year oil imports actually fell by one million b/d,
or about 12 percent of the total from the previous year. But this was
due to factors other than a change in America's long-term energy
production and consumption trends. First, due to uncertainty over the
situation in the Persian Gulf, American oil companies drew on their
own stored supplies and therefore required less imports. And second,
the recession dampened oil consumption, thereby reducing some of the
need for imported and domestically produced oil. The NES recommends
reducing U.S. vulnerability to oil "shocks" by encouraging increased
domestic oil production.
<P>
** The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

<P> The NES recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
(ANWR) to oil exploration. Originally established in 1980 under
Section 1002 of the Alaskan National Interest Lands Conservation Act,
ANWR covers 19 million acres of Alaska's northernmost territory. About
8 percent of this area holds high promise for petroleum exploration.
According to the Energy Department, it may contain more oil than
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the largest North American oil field discovered
to date. 

<P> Opponents of exploration in ANWR claim that development would
harm wildlife. Yet more than a decade of experience at Prudhoe Bay,
which steadily produces an average of 1.8 million b/d of oil,
demonstrates that oil can be extracted in the Arctic without damaging
the environment. The 1990 Exxon Valdez spill occurred because of
deficiencies in the transportation system, not in drilling. 

<P> Oil output from production in Prudhoe Bay soon will begin
declining. Unless ANWR is developed, output from Alaska will steadily
fall. With ANWR, however, Alaska could keep pumping around 1.8 million
b/d or even more. The NES conservatively estimates ANWR's potential
output at 870,000 b/d by the year 2005. Oil from ANWR also would
extend the life of the Prudhoe Bay field. This is because without
ANWR, the volume of oil from Prudhoe Bay eventually will fall below
the level required to operate the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. 
<P>
** The Outer Continental Shelf

<P> The NES also recommends expanded drilling for new oil on the
Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), a portion of the Continental Plate
extending underneath the ocean's surface. The OCS is believed to
contain 7.5 billion barrels of oil and 9.4 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas; this would be 26 percent of America's undiscovered oil
and natural resources.    The Reagan Administration proposed orderly
development of OCS oil and gas resources in a way that would protect
the environment. This was blocked by a series of lawsuits and
congressional actions. Development of the OCS was further delayed when
the Bush Administration halted leasing in several OCS areas including
the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, the North Atlantic
coast, and a portion of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. This leaves only
portions of the Gulf of Mexico and Mid and South Atlantic available
for development. The freeze on new leases apparently remains in force
for most of these areas until 1996, ostensibly to allow environmental
and economic studies. Some OCS areas off California, however, will not
be available for leasing until the year 2000. 

<P> Environmental concerns obviously are important. But so is
American energy security. The two do not exclude each other.
Technological advances in recent years have reduced significantly the
chances of spills from offshore drilling. In fact, there have been no
major spills at U.S. offshore facilities since 1969 when a well off
the coast of Santa Barbara, California, blew out, fouling miles of
beach. Safety measures developed as a result of this spill make a re-
occurrence unlikely. Today, indeed, there is far less environmental
risk from drilling offshore wells and transporting oil to shore by
pipeline than there is from transporting oil from other nations by
tankers. 

<P> The NES recommends that those areas in which leasing has been
halted be considered for inclusion in a five-year leasing plan being
drafted by the Department of the Interior. The NES also suggests that
Congress ban none of the new areas under consideration for the five-
year leasing plan until a study is completed that weighs resource
potential and environmental effects of energy development.
<P>
** The Tax Problem

<P> For more than two decades, unfavorable tax treatment of the oil
industry has contributed significantly to the decline of American
domestic oil production. Addressing this, the NES recommends some tax
code changes. These would give somewhat more favorable tax treatment
to so-called "marginal oil production." This is the output from wells
that are nearly exhausted. The NES also calls for better tax treatment
for "unconventional" natural gas production, such as that from coal
seams. 

<P> In its proposed tax changes, the NES stops far short of what is
needed to remove the tax code's penalties on domestic oil production.
The oil industry is treated more harshly by the tax code than any
other sector of the economy. Since 1969, for example, most oil
producers have lost what is knowm as "the depletion allowance." This
is the accounting mechanism that recognizes that as oil is extracted
from the ground, the oil company's capital is depleted -- just as a
manufacturing firm's capital would be depleted as machinery
deteriorated. The depletion allowance for mineral development is the
equivalent of depreciation for a manufacturing business. It is an
allowance that is used as a deduction from taxable income. Loss of the
depletion allowance of course drives up the cost of oil production in
America.

<P> Also driving up the cost is the 1976 law, enacted by Congress
and approved by Gerald Ford, that imposes a minimum tax on what it
called "intangible drilling costs." These typically are the costs of
building roads to oil well sites, of the "muds" used to lubricate the
rotating shaft of an oil rig, and of the energy used to operate the
rig. Such costs from 1976 to last year were taxed at 10 percent of
their value. Last year's tax hike package boosted this tax to 24
percent. The tiny tax credit given to the oil industry last year
offers little real relief. Why drilling costs themselves should be
taxed is, of course, the question. In every other industry these would
be treated as normal business expenses to be deducted from revenues.
Yet for oil drillers they are effectively treated as income.

<P> Further adding to the burden on the oil industry is the 1980
special tax on oil companies to finance the Superfund, the federal
program to clean hazardous waste sites. Other taxes harm the oil
industry as well. Taxes on refined petroleum products were increased
several times for such diverse reasons as to fund mass transit and
help reduce the deficit. These taxes are imposed specifically on the
oil industry; other industries do not pay them.    A 1987 Energy
Department report on energy security concludes that American oil
production would be increased were the full depletion allowance
restored. The report also calls for a 5 percent tax credit for oil
exploration and development costs and for the removal of tax penalties
on the industry. Taken together, these changes would add 1,233,000 b/d
to domestic production within a decade. While the 1987 report also
found that these changes would reduce Treasury revenues by $7.622
billion over roughly the same period, it failed to take into account
the new revenues that would be received by the Treasury from wages
paid to workers employed to develop the new oil, and from royalties on
oil and gas produced on federal lands. With these new revenues, the
Treasury would collect an extra $40 billion over the decade.
<P>
WESTERN HEMISPHERIC ENERGY SECURITY

<P> The NES strongly supports developing non-Persian Gulf oil
supplies. The NES specifically targets Eastern Europe and the Western
Hemisphere for development. The NES also urges a review of U.S. laws
to ensure they do not discourage energy development. If production
outside the Persian Gulf is not encouraged, 41 percent of world oil
supplies will come from that region by the year 2010. Known oil
reserves outside the Persian Gulf total about 337 billion barrels;
this is about half the 654 billion barrel reserve in the Persian Gulf.

<P> The greatest opportunity for expanding secure production outside
the Persian Gulf is in the Western Hemisphere. The nations of North
and South America have proved oil reserves of over 156 billion barrels
and natural gas reserves of over 518 trillion cubic feet. The
hemisphere also has 30 percent of the world's coal reserves and 42
percent of its hydroelectric power capacity. 

<P> Latin American countries, of course, generally are more
politically stable and friendlier to the U.S. than are Middle Eastern
countries. 

<P> To increase use of the Western Hemisphere's energy resources,
energy trade should be allowed to flow freely across the borders of
all nations in the Americas through the creation of a common market
for energy. The Western Hemisphere readily could meet its own energy
needs, and even export energy. Latin America could produce as much as
3.5 million more b/d. 

<P> For Latin America, increased energy trade with the U.S. could
help reduce the enormous Latin American foreign debt. For the U.S.,
increased reliance on hemispheric energy sources would improve energy
security. To increase cooperation on energy trade within the
hemisphere, a number of steps must be taken. One of the most important
is the elimination of barriers to foreign investment common in Latin
America. 

<P> The U.S. and Canada made a good start towards a hemispheric
common market in energy with their 1988 Free Trade Area agreement. It
provides for unrestricted oil and electricity trade across borders.
Natural gas so far is not covered by the agreement, since it is highly
regulated in both countries. 

<P> A key element to an energy free trade area would be the
reduction and eventual elimination of laws, especially in Mexico and
the Latin American countries, that prohibit foreign investment in
resource development, or set confiscatory tax rates on profits from
such investments.
<P>
** The Venezuelan Example

<P> A promising development is the proposed Cristobal/Colon joint
venture in Venezuela. The project involves the export of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) from Venezuela to the U.S. The partners include
Exxon Corporation, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mitsubishi Corporation,
and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan National
Oil Company. This is the first time in decades that Venezuela is
permitting foreign participation in an energy project. Venezuela is
expected soon to revise its tax laws to make the Cristobal/Colon
project economically viable. A successful Cristobal/Colon project
could serve as a model for cooperation throughout the Hemisphere. The
government of Argentina, meanwhile, is privatizing its oil industry,
one of the most inefficient in the Hemisphere. This should increase
production and foreign participation and give Argentina an incentive
to seek freer energy trade in the Hemisphere. Though Mexico still
resists privatizing its oil industry or allowing foreign companies to
own equity shares in the industry, this will be addressed in the
current U.S.-Mexico free trade area talks.
<P>
DOMESTIC NATURAL GAS

<P> Natural gas accounts for more than one-fifth of America's
primary energy, and is used to heat nearly half of all homes. The NES
cites natural gas as one of the most promising alternatives to oil,
suggesting that it could replace up to 600,000 b/d of oil use by 1995,
and 1.7 million b/d by 2000. 

<P> Natural gas when burned as fuel produces less air pollution than
oil or coal, and the technology to convert from oil to natural gas is
well established. Most important, America has natural gas in vast
quantities.

<P> Natural gas competes directly with oil in the industrial boiler
fuel market, with natural gas accounting for 37 percent and oil only
36 percent of all industrial energy used in 1989. Coal accounts for
most of the balance. Virtually all of the oil burned in industrial
boilers, or roughly 24.7 percent of total American oil consumption,
could be replaced by natural gas. Many boilers are designed to use
either fuel and can be switched back and forth in response to the
relative price of the two fuels. 
<P>
** Pipeline Construction Barriers

<P> The NES finds that statutory and regulatory impediments are
reducing American natural gas usage by 1 trillion cubic feet per year.
This amount could displace 470,000 b/d of oil. In some cases,
particularly in the Northeast, industrial boilers cannot use natural
gas because there are no pipelines to deliver it. Pipeline
construction often is stymied by a federal regulatory approval process
which can take five times as long as it does for the actual pipeline
to be built. 

<P> The cumbersome regulatory system was designed in the days when
some pipeline firms enjoyed near monopoly power in some regions.
Today, with over 1.3 million miles of pipeline and a choice of routes
available in most cases, monopoly no longer is a problem. Yet the
antiquated approval process remains, hurting rather than protecting
the consumer. Reducing regulations would speed pipeline construction,
significantly lower transportation costs, and make natural gas more
attractive as a fuel.

<P> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the body that
oversees approval of interstate natural gas pipelines and regulates
their rates, recognizes the problem and is trying to reform its
procedures administratively with the support of the Bush White House.
The NES endorses this and suggests clarifying confusing provisions of
the 1938 Natural Gas Policy Act. It recommends that pipeline companies
be allowed to proceed without federal certification if they forego the
right to exercise federal eminent domain in obtaining the private
property needed for the pipeline. Under current regulations, federal
certification of a pipeline entitles the pipeline company to invoke
eminent domain.
<P>
** Natural Gas Pipeline Pricing

<P> The price that natural gas pipelines charge for their services
has been regulated by Washington since the Natural Gas Act of 1938.
The NES calls for a reversal of this and for deregulation of pipeline
prices so long as pipeline customers have access to alternative
sources of energy supplies. Today, pipeline companies can refuse to
transport natural gas for producers not affiliated with them. But
because these companies usually enjoy a monopoly in their service
areas, such refusals restrict competition. Requiring pipeline
companies with local, government-supported monopolies to transport
natural gas for other companies would improve competition.

<P> The NES recommends reforming the pipeline rate structure to
encourage efficient use. Current rules often force pipeline owners to
charge higher prices for their services during periods of low use, to
cover the pipeline costs even though demand is low. Conversely, during
periods of peak use, pipeline owners are forced to underprice their
services to avoid making profits higher than those allowed by the
regulators. The NES suggests that FERC permit pipeline owners to sell
their excess capacity during periods of low use, and to buy additional
capacity from other pipelines during peak periods. This would help
even out the pipeline transportation load and increase efficiency. 
<P>
** Regulation of Gas Imports and Exports

<P> Natural gas imports and exports are regulated by the Department
of Energy. America last year imported about 8 percent of its natural
gas, primarily from Canada. By the year 2000, American natural gas
imports are expected to rise to around 12 percent of natural gas
consumption, and by 2010 to 14 percent. The U.S exports a small amount
of liquefied natural gas to Japan. Vast amounts of Alaskan natural gas
could be sold to Japan were it not for the federal limits on exports.
The NES recommends ending the Energy Department's authority over gas
import and export transactions. 

<P>
DOMESTIC COAL

<P> Coal is America's most abundant fuel, accounting for 90 percent
of American energy resources. Coal use has grown sharply in recent
years. In 1970, for example, the U.S. consumed 523.2 million tons of
coal, in 1980, 702.7 million tons, and in 1990, 894.6 million tons,
accounting for 23 percent of American energy needs. By 2010, American
coal use could rise to 1.6 billion tons. Coal also is a major export,
with more than 100 million tons sold last year. Increased use of coal,
however, could be hindered by the tightened environmental regulations
in the Clean Air Act of 1990. The NES cites the Energy Department's
Clean Coal Technology (CCT) program, initiated in 1986, as a way to
permit increased coal use and still protect the environment. To
accelerate the CCT program, the NES recommends reforming federal coal
leasing policies, reforming regulations concerning coal mining safety
and health, and encouraging greater use of coal slurry pipelines. 
<P>
** Promoting Coal Production

<P> The Clean Coal Technology Program aims at developing new
technologies to burn coal cleaner, with less pollution. For the CCT to
succeed, sufficient quantities of low-sulfur coal must be burned. Much
of this type of coal is on federal land. The NES recommends that the
Department of Interior's Federal Coal Leasing Program insure that
adequate low-sulfur coal areas are offered for lease. At the same
time, NES calls on the Bureau of Mines to continue research and
development on technologies to address environmental concerns about
underground coal mining. It also calls for continued tax credits for
extracting the marketable methane gas found in the underground coal
beds. 
<P>
** Regulatory Reform 

<P> The NES stresses the need to eliminate the uncertainty about the
kind of environmental regulations that are to be imposed under the
1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. This act has been
inconsistently applied. Reform is especially important to low-sulfur
coal production, most of which is extracted from surface mines.

<P> The NES also calls for performance-based standards for mine
safety and health regulations. Adopting performance-based standards,
where results, rather than specific federally-imposed methods, are
used to measure compliance, will permit a more rapid introduction of
technological improvements and improve worker safety.
<P>
** Coal Slurry Pipelines

<P> Coal slurry pipelines, in which pulverized coal mixed with water
is transported as a liquid, reduce coal transportation costs. Since
almost all prospective slurry pipeline routes will cross over or under
highways, rail lines, and other private property, slurry pipelines
require that government exercise the right of eminent domain to obtain
the right-of-way for the pipelines. This is done for right-of-way for
electric wires, roads, and rails. Because slurry pipelines use large
amounts of water, there has been great opposition to granting pipeline
builders eminent domain in Western states where water is scarce. Yet
large deposits of low-sulfur coal are in the West, and rail transport
of the coal to Eastern markets is much more costly than transport by
slurry pipelines. The NES correctly supports granting eminent domain
to slurry pipeline builders once all questions concerning water rights
and usage have been satisfied.
<P>
** Clean Air Act Amendments

<P> The Clean Air Act of 1990 mandates that annual emissions of
sulfur dioxide in the U.S. by the year 2000 will be at least 10
million tons below the 1980 level. The act further decrees that the
emissions level reached in the year 2000 will never be exceeded. The
act requires existing coal-burning electric utility plants to install
expensive devices to control emissions of nitrogen oxides. 

<P> These new requirements could seriously constrain American coal
use. While accepting the clean air goal set by the 1990 act, the NES
stresses that the goal can be met by accelerating the Clean Coal
Technology Program. This would be much less costly to the economy than
the devices called for by the Clean Air Act.
<P>
** The WEPCO Decision

<P> When the first Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, most existing
electrical generating plants were exempted from the new air quality
rules. At the time it was assumed that existing plants soon would be
replaced by new facilities that would be subject to the law. Yet, as
the expense and difficulties associated with building new electrical
generating plants increased, utilities typically decided to refurbish
existing plants rather than build new ones. In 1988, a decision by the
Environmental Protection Agency involving a plant refurbished by the
Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) held that when a utility
makes "non-routine" changes in the operation, repair, or maintenance
of a unit, the plant may become subject to air quality rules. This
meant that the utility was required to install specific pollution
control devices mandated by regulations.

<P> Skyrocketing Cost. The effect of this decision on the WEPCO
plant was enormous. The capital cost for refurbishment jumped from $80
million to $120 million. It became necessary to cut the plant's size
from 400 megawatts to 320 megawatts. As a result, the cost of re-
outfitting the WEPCO plant rose by 87.5 percent overall. Worse still,
the EPA indicated that it will determine what constitutes a "non-
routine" refurbishment case by case. As a result, utilities deciding
how to meet future power requirements must assume that any
refurbishment will fall under the WEPCO precedent. 

<P> The WEPCO decision illustrates the uncertainties that the
inconsistent and unpredictable application of regulations can
introduce into the market. The NES correctly suggests that the Energy
Department work with the EPA to identify the areas of regulation that
create planning uncertainties for electric utilities with older
plants, and strive to make the revisions necessary to clarify them. A
more basic question, however, as with the WEPCO decision, is whether
the EPA will continue to resist performance-based standards for public
utilities. Unlike the more traditional command and control "cookbook"
approach, such standards emphasize results. If EPA resists this
approach, the Administration should take direct action against EPA to
assure the adoption of such sound policy.
<P>
NUCLEAR POWER

<P> Although nuclear plants generate around 20 percent of American
electricity, for all practical purposes American nuclear energy
development is at a standstill. Because of public opposition and
excessive regulation, no new nuclear plants have been ordered in
America since 1978; only three remain scheduled for construction. More
than 100 orders have been cancelled or deferred. 

<P> Still, nuclear energy remains an attractive way to generate
electricity. It is clean and relatively safe. America has huge
deposits of uranium, the source of nuclear fuel. The NES estimates
that America will need from 190 gigawatts to 275 gigawatts of new
electrical generation capacity by the year 2010 (a gigawatt is one
billion watts). Currently it takes two coal-fired plants or one
nuclear plant to produce a gigawatt. Most of America's added energy
will be generated by large, centralized plants, known as "base load
generation." These are best suited to nuclear power.

<P> To give nuclear energy a new chance, the NES addresses several
important issues.
<P>
** Advanced Powerplant Designs

<P> The accidents at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in
Pennsylvania in 1979 and at the Chernobyl facility in Ukraine in 1986
heightened public concern over plant safety. Since 1979, the
Department of Energy has been researching advanced light-water
reactors (ALWRs), which will be safer than current designs. By 1995,
the ALWR design should be complete and a prototype could be operating
by 2000. Other advanced designs are also being developed. Among the
most promising is the Modular High-Temperature Gas Reactor. With it,
if all external power systems were to fail, the reactor would simply
shut itself down. The NES endorses these research and development
efforts.
<P>
** Licensing Reform and Design Standardization

<P> Delays encountered in licensing nuclear power plants long have
been among the nuclear industry's greatest problems. The licensing
process in America can take up to fifteen years compared to less than
five years in Japan or France. Unlike other governments, Washington
reserves key licensing approvals until after a plant is built. As a
result, a utility can have a completed plant costing a billion dollars
sitting idle because of a regulatory delay.

<P> This process is complicated further by the tendency of electric
utilities to order unique designs for each plant. This subjects each
plant to its own exhaustive review process. In France and Japan, by
contrast, it has long been the practice to use standardized models for
nuclear plants. Besides reducing licensing delays, standardization is
believed to improve safety by reducing the number of new and untried
components. The NES agrees that power plant designs should be
standardized so that reviews need take place only once. 
<P>
** Managing High-Level Nuclear Waste

<P> Another major problem facing the nuclear industry is the growing
backlog of undisposed high-level nuclear waste, that is, highly
radioactive byproducts of nuclear power production that require
special disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 directs the
Department of Energy to establish a permanent repository for such
waste, and a monitored retrievable storage facility (MRS) to hold the
waste prior to permanent disposal. Yet just about all localities
strongly oppose being the site of these repositories. As with other
problems facing the nuclear industry, establishing these repositories
is as much a matter of public perception as of technology. Although
the NES suggests that Congress establish disposal sites, the political
battle surrounding such decisions will result in further delays.
<P>
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES

<P> Renewable energy sources are those that are not depleted. The
three principal renewable sources in America are hydroelectric power,
geothermal power, and ethanol, produced from corn, grains, and other
biological material. Solar power is a much less important renewable
source. In 1990, renewable energy supplied 8 percent of American
energy needs. Of this, about 47 percent came from hydroelectric dams.
Solar power of all types accounted for under 6 percent of all
renewable energy and less than one half of one percent of American
energy needs. Renewable energy sources other than hydroelectric power
or wood have grown in importance significantly since 1970, when they
were virtually nonexistent. The NES strongly endorses the use of
renewable energy, and calls for continued research and development in
this area. 
<P>
** Renewable Energy and Electricity

<P> The NES recommends removing from the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) restrictions on the size of renewable
energy plants. These restrictions are a holdover from the Carter
Administration's emphasis on so-called "soft-path" energy schemes,
which emphasized small-scale plants. These provisions made neither
economic nor technological sense.

<P> All hydro-electric plants are licensed by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, and the licenses periodically must be renewed.
The licensing process has become extremely cumbersome. The NES
suggests exempting very small hydro projects from FERC regulation, and
streamlining the licensing process for all other plants.
<P>
** Ethanol

<P> In 1978, Congress allowed a five-cent per gallon exemption from
the federal gasoline tax for motor fuels blended with ethanol. And in
1980, the federal government granted a tax credit for refiners
producing gasoline blended with ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), an
ethanol-based gasoline additive. Because ethanol is more expensive
than gasoline, its advocates believe a tax credit is warranted to
allow ethanol to compete with gasoline. A look at the performance of
ethanol in the market, however, suggests that such a credit is not
needed. With around 10 percent of all gasoline being blended with
ethanol or ETBE the need for the subsidy has passed. Ethanol is well
established in the market and now competes with gasoline additives in
about the same price range, rather than with gasoline. Clean Air Act
of 1990 regulations effectively require many motorists in urban areas
to use gasoline with ethanol, ETBE, or some similar additive. The NES
thus errs in recommending that the ethanol tax credit continue.
Instead, the subsidies for ethanol and ETBE should be eliminated. 
<P>
** Fusion

<P> Fusion long has held out the promise of tapping a virtually
inexhaustible supply of energy without endangering the environment and
without producing hazardous wastes. The NES calls for continued
support of fusion energy research. This is wise, yet too much should
not be expected of fusion soon. Under the most optimistic assessments,
the first practical fusion energy plants will not be available until
the year 2035. 
<P>
IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

<P> The needs to make America more energy secure and to protect the
environment too often have been in conflict. Measures designed to
protect the environment often wasted energy or restricted the use of
such plentiful sources as coal. 

<P> The NES emphasizes the need to clarify uncertainties about some
environmental issues that have impeded energy development. Typical of
these issues are the claims about global climate change. NES stresses
that research on these issues is essential before imposing regulations
that could have disastrous economic consequences for American
industries. The NES does call for measures to reduce the emission of
"greenhouse gases," which may contribute to atmospheric warming, while
the global warming issue is being studied. But NES specifies that
these measures be limited to those justified for reasons other than
potential global climate change.

<P> The NES wisely rejects the notion of a so-called "carbon tax" to
discourage fossil fuel use. Some environmentalists call for a $135-
per-ton tax on the carbon content of fuels. This would damage the
American economy enormously. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P> In the past, talk in Washington of an "energy policy" has meant
cumbersome regulations, expensive new bureaucracies, and costly
"conservation" programs and gas lines. How much energy, if any, is
saved by these measures is debatable. What is not debatable is the
enormous economic pain inflicted on Americans. A sound energy policy
is not built on more regulations. A sound policy rather should remove
impediments to the energy market, eliminate barriers to energy
production, and facilitate innovation. This is what the National
Energy Strategy recommends. America's level of foreign oil imports is
too high -- not because oil imports are "bad" for America but because
dependence on oil from unfriendly and insecure parts of the world
carries the risk of future damaging economic shocks. 

<P> Removing Tax Bias. America can increase domestic energy
production and increase exploration to find new reserves if Congress
and the White house amend the tax code to remove the bias against
firms taking the risks necessary to find new energy supplies, if
Congress and the White House allow exploration in the most promising
areas for new oil discoveries, if Congress and the White House remove
the regulatory impediments now discouraging gas producers and
utilities from fostering greater use of natural gas, and if Congress
and the White House encourage conservation by permitting the market to
reflect the true cost of energy. 

<P> Americans, too, could move closer to secure foreign sources of
supply if the U.S. were to negotiate a common market for energy
throughout the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Core Strategy. Americans enjoy one of the world's highest
standards of living in large part because they have had ready access
to abundant, inexpensive sources of energy. Continued access to
abundant energy is essential to America's economic future, and history
teaches that the best way to achieve this access is to permit markets
to operate. Reliance on markets assures both abundant supplies and
judicious use. As such, above all else, the core of any national
energy strategy must be to permit markets to operate.

<title>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With a National Sales Tax</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<center>
<h3>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With A National Sales Tax</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
This proposal is aimed at addressing the basic problems afflicting the U.S. economy, as well as liberating Americans from the intrusive burden of the income tax.<p>
We cannot raise wages, create new jobs, or eliminate our national debt if the American economydoes not grow.  Nothing short of sustained economic growth will solve these problems and create opportunity for all Americans.<p>
Economists agree on a few things, but the vast majority agree that we will not grow if we do not save more and invest more.  Tinkering wiht the income tax system is not the answer.  Last year's reforms are reversed the following year.  This year's complexity is made more complex next year.  All the while, no significant improvement is achieved in the U.S. savings rate, and Americans struggle on with a needlessly complex and intrusive tax system.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>OUTLINE OF THE LUGAR PLAN</h4>
<br>
<br>
A National Sales Tax (NST) on goods and services would replace the federal personal and corporate income taxes.  The capital gains tax and the estate tax would be eliminated as well.<p>
Economists who have studied the national sales tax estimate that the NST rate of about 17% would replace the revenue generated by our current tax system.  The rate would be somewhat higher or lower depending on exemptions, although exemptions should be minimized.<p>
The federal government should work with the states to collect the national sales tax.  The federal government should ensure that it is done without extra cost to the states.  Most states already have sales tax collection systems in place.<p>
Social Security taxes and payment benefits would not be affected by this proposal, except that no
social security benefits would be taxed.<p>
The IRS would be eliminated.  A vastly smaller office or agency would be required to administer the national slaes tax and the FICA tax.  For most Americans, tax record keeping, audits, and filing of forms would be things of the past.<p>
Legislation to implement a national sales tax would have to reflect choices on a number of issues, including the methods used to prevent regressivity.  Any system of taxation requires such decisions.  Like the income tax, a national sales tax can be designed so that it is not regressive.<p>
As increased savings and investment fuels more economic growth, the sales tax should be lowered.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Advantages of the National Sales Tax</h3>
An NST will leave more money in American paychecks.  Because the government would no longer withold income taxes from paychecks, citizens would decide how much of their total income to save and how much to subject to taxation through purchases. <p> 
The NST would be a powerful incentive for savings in America.  Currently the United States has one of the lowest savings rates of any industiralized country.  According to a study by economist Laurence Kotlikoff, an NST would increase the savings rate from roughly 2% to about 7.6% in the first year.  Increasing the U.S. savings rate is a key to achieving strong economic growth, lower interests rates, improvements in real wages, and the expansion of revenue necessary to balance the budget.<p>
The national sales tax would allow for the dismantling of the current IRS and the intrusive, inefficient and costly enforcement of the current tax code.  Estimates of uncollected income tax range as hight as $150 billion per year.<p>
Businesses and individuals devote billions of man hours each year to comply with the tax code.  Under an NST, that time could be spent more productively on other activities.<p>
The simplicity of the NST and the absence of the IRS would have the effect of discouraging frequent tinkering with the tax code which complicates business activities, leads to loopholes for special interests, abd creates uncertainties for many Americans.  Thirty-one tax reforms have been enacted in the last 41 years.<p>
The NST, unlike the income tax or a value added tax (VAT), is transparent.  Individuals will know what they are paying to the government in taxes.  A transparent tax would contribute greatly to achieving the national political will to curb spending and balance the budget.<p>
Most states already have mechanisms in place to enforce a sales tax, and most taxpayers already understand how sales taxes work.  Therefore the establishment of a national sales tax could be achieved with a minimum of expense and confusion.<p>
American exports would no longer be put at a competitive disadvantage by the income tax.  Under our current system, the costs of corporate income taxes are built into the price of goods.  This raises the price of exports and make them less competitive overseas.  The NST would helpus export, thereby reducing the trade deficit and creating more jobs.  Economists estimate that for every additional $1 billion in exports, 20,000 jobs are created.  Imports, on the other hand, would be taxed at the time of sale, like all other goods.<p>
Under the NST, drug dealers and other criminals who currently escape or evade the income tax would pay the national sales tax like any other consumer.<p>
Because companies will not have to add the costs of the income tax to their products, the underlying price of most goods and services will be lower under and NST.<p>
An NST would end intrusive enforcement of the tax coe , which harms personal privacy.  It also would eliminate the ambiguity of the income tax, which causes many conscientious Americans to live in anxiety over the possibility of mistakes that could lead to penalties or charges.<p>
Although a flat tax would be a step in the right direction, an NST is preferable because the flat tax would retain many of the complexities of the current income tax system.  The IRS income tax collection aparatus would continue to exist.  Furthermore, the flat tax retains the corporate tax and the complexities involved in its calculation.  Also tinkering with the flat tax would be a constant temptation.  Many would seek to amend the tax code to promote special interests or social agendas.  The history of revisions to the 1986 Tax Reform Act demonstrates that the government  will always be tempted to ament the income tax code.<p>

<title>Testimony by Senator Richard Lugar

<center>
<h3>Testimony by Senator Richard Lugar<br>
In Front of the House Ways and Means Committee<br>
 June 8, 1995</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Mister Chairman, I thank you for your strong leadership in the area of tax reform.  Your oft quoted comment that our current tax system should be "pulled out by the roots" has been an inspiration as I have traveled the country advocating the elimination of the federal income tax.<p>
What I have found during my travels is that American families are frustrated, and even angry, with their economic predicament.  They feel like they are running on a treadmill and that treadmill is winning 
The problem is that rnany Americans suspect there is diminishing hope for a better future. 
The economic facts justify these beliefs.  From 1950 through 1973, hourly compensation including both wages and benefits increased an average of 3.0 percent per year.  Since 1973, the average wage mcrease has been less than one half of one percent.  During the past two decades, economic growth has been cut in half averaging only 2.4 percent annually. And if this isn't depressing enough for the average American family, limiting growth to 2.5 percent is the stated economic policy of the Federal Reserve Board.<p>
This we must chance. The American public is demanding it.<p>
The cause of America's economic doldrums is twofold: the huge federal budget deficit that robs us of the capital we need to grow, and a federal tax stystem that not only discourages, but confiscates our savings and investment.<p>
Our net national savings rate has reached alarmingly low levels. After averaging close to 9.0 percent in the 1960's, we recemty saw our nation's savings rate bottom out at 1.1 percent in 1992.  Because of this low rate of savings, capital to fuel our economy has become increasingly scarce. As a result, our annual productivity gain has averaged just 1.1 percent from 1974 to 1994. The Concord Coaltion estimates that had our productivity held its pre 1974 annual rate of 2.9 percent, the median family income would now be $5O,000 a year instead of the current level of  S35,000 a year.<p>
Americans celebrate that both houses of Congress have now passed budget resolutions that will bring us to balance in seven years. We now face the more difficult task of actually implementing this budget guide m our spending measures. We must be resolute m this endeavor and not fall victim to buiness as usual in Washington.<p>
As part of the effort to balance the budget, I support providing the American public with tax relief But I strongly believe it is time to stop working around the edges of the tax code We must transform It completely.<p>
The federal income tax system is inherently flawed. By taxing savings and investment at least twice, it has become the biggest impediment to economic growth in tbe country. It represents the worst form of big govemment intrusion into the lives of all Americans. Each year it costs Americans morr than 5 billion hours of time to comply with it. That is equal to the tolal worker output of my state of Indiana.  It is unfair.  It is riddled with loopholes. It has been changed 31 times in the past 41 years. And finally, it doesn't work.<p>
By its own admission, the Internal Revenue Service fails to collect from nearly 10 million taxpayers, worth an estimated $127 billion in uncollected taxes annually.<p>
Anything this bad, this broken and this ineffective should be ended decisively, and that is what I propose. I want to scrap the income tax completely and replace it with a national sales tax.<p>
Mr. Chairman, you have outlined the criteria for evaluating an effective tax system. It must be: (1) simple, (2) the least intrusive (3) fair, (4) border adustable, and (5) friendly to savings and investment.  I have added that it also must be transparent.  I have studied all the recent tax proposals with these six factors in mind.  Many are better than the current tax systesm.  But f we are going to overhaul our tax system we should choose the one that meets these criteria.  I have concluded that a national sales tax is the best alternative.<p>
The first factor in choosing an effective tax system is its simplicity.  Under a national sales tax, tbe burden of complying with the income tax would be lifted.  There would be no records to keep or audits to fear.  The money a person makes is his or her own. You don't have to report it. You don't have to hide it. You may decide if you want to save it, mvest it, or give it to your children. It is only when you buy something that you pay a tax.  Although I applaud the efforts of  flat tax advocates to simplify tax forms, nothing could be more simple than no forms at all.<p>
The national sales tax is tbe least intrusive of the tax proposals. The IRS would be substantially dismantled under ny proposal.  The IRS would no longer look over the shoulders of every American.  There wil be no audits. Americans would not waste time and effort worrymg about record keeping, deductions or exemptions that are part of the current tax code. Although the flat tax proposals tax consumption, they do so by giving the income tax a facelift and leaving the IRS largely intact You have stated, Mr. Chairman, "If the roots remain, the tree will grow back"<p>
The national sales tax is the fairest. Everyone pays the tax including wealthy individuals, criminals illegal aliens, and others who currently avoid taxation.  Wealthy Americans who consume more would pay higher taxes under the national sales tax.  Individual who save and invest their money will pay less.  Gone are the loopholes and the deductions.<p>
The national sales tax would also tax the underground economy. When criminals and illegal aliens consume the proceeds of their activities, they will pay a tax. Foreign tourists will pay the tax.  Tax systems that rely on reporting will never collect any of this revenue.<p>
Of course, the fairness test must likewise consider those with limited means to pay taxes. An integral part of my plan is protection for Amencans who need it -- senior citzens, the unemployed, and Americans with low paying jobs.<p>
One strategy for addressing this problem would exempt a threshold level of goods and services
consumed from each American from the national slaes tax.  Each citizen who has a social security number will receive this exemption.  For example, if the exemption level were $5000, a family of four would have its first $20,0000 exempt from the sales tax.  This figure is approximately 33 percent above the 1994 poverty threshold for a family of four.<p>
Another strategy might be the exempting of items such as housing and medicine.  This is the method the majority of states have chosen and the one advocated by this committee's chairman.  Americans understand and are comfortable with this practice.  In the end it will be up to this committee and the Finance Committee in the Senate to decide the desirable path.<p>
The national sales tax is the most transparent of the tax reform proposals. A federal tax that is evident to everyone would bolster effiorts in Congress to achieve prudence m federal spending. There should be no hidden corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers or with holding mechanisms that mask the amount we pay in taxes.  Every year the public and Congress should openly debate the tax rate necessary for federal government to meet its obligations.  If average Americans are paying that rate everyday, they will make sure that Congress spends public funds wisely.<p>
American exports would also benefit from the enactment of a national sales tax.  In January, the United States registered one of tbe largest trade deficits in our nation's history. We must adopt a tax system that encourages exports. Most of our trading partners have tax systems that are border adjustable.  They are able to strip out their tax when they are exporting goods. In comparison the  income tax, and for that matter the flat tax, are not border adjustable.   American goods that are sent overseas are taxed twice -- once by the income tax and once when they reach their destination.  In comparison, the national sales tax would not be levied on exports.  It would level the playing field with our trading patners.  And best of all foreign imports would be taxed when they are consumed in the United States.<p>
Mr. Chairman, the last and most imperitive reason for replacing tbe income tax with a national sales tax is that it would liberate our economy by encouraging savings. For the first time in the modern era, the next generation of Americans may be worse off than the previous one.  Despite robust economic growth over the past several years, the average income of families has fallen.  They feel trapped in a box with diminishing hop of escaping.<p>
The bottom line is that as a nation, we do not save enough.  Savings are vital because they are
the source of all investment and productivity gains  -- savings supply the capital for buying anew machine, developing a new product or service, or employing an extra worker.  According to a recent poll, seventy two percent of Americans realize that they are not saving enough for the future.  Our net national savings rate in the 1990's has been 1.8 percent of GDP compared with a rate of 8.1 percent in the 1960's, 7.2 percent in the 1970's, and 3.7 in the 1980's.<p>
The Japanese save at a rate nine times greater than Americans greater than Americans and the Germans save five times as much as we do.  Today, many believe that Americans inherently consume beyond their means and cannot save enough for the future.  Few realize that before WWII, before the income tax reached its present form, Americans saved a larger portion of their earnings than the Japanese.<p>
A national sales tax would reeverse this trend by directly taxing consuption and leaving savings and investment untaxed.  Economists agree that a broad based consumption tax would increase our savings rate substantially.  Economist Laurence Kottlikoff of Boston University estimates that our savings rate would more than triple in the first year.  The implementation of a national sales tax is expected to create one million new jobs over a ten year period and a three percent rise in wages over that same period of time.  Economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard Universityhas concluded that had a consumption tax like the national sales tax been put into place in 1986 instead of the current system, The U.S. would have experienced one trillion dollars in additional economic rowth.  Mr. Chairman, our citizens and our economy cannot afford to wait any longer.<p>
As I have outlined here today, I believe the national sales tax is the best tax system to replace the income tax.  It is simple.  It protects privacy.  It is fair and transparent.  And it promotes economically beneficial behavior.  For these reasons, I encourage it enactment.<p>

<title>"The Flat Tax and Small Business"</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h3>The Flat Tax and Small Business</h3>
Testimony by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist<br>
The Small Business Survival Committee<p>
Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance <br>
Committee on Small Business<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
May 18, 1995<p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

Madam Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the flat income tax and its impact on the small business, entrepreneurial sector of our economy.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small-business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<p>

As you well know, entrepreneurs drive the economy.  By creating and investing in new businesses, ideas, and innovations, the entrepreneur ensures capitalism's constant renewal and growth.  While government can assist this process by protecting life and limb and guaranteeing property rights, government unfortunately more often than not creates obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic growth.  Perhaps the most formidable of the many governmental obstacles thrown in the path of entrepreneurs during this century has been the U.S. federal income tax code.<p>

	As constituted today,  the federal income tax system amounts to a convoluted mess.  It is complicated, inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation.<p>

	To that end, it should come as no surprise that the great debate on overhauling our nation's tax system is welcomed with open arms by our nation's small business owners.  In fact, according to a recent survey by the Small Business Survival Committee and the Luntz Research Companies, the flat tax is resonating very favorably with the small business, entrepreneurial sector.  When given the specifics of Representative Dick Armey's flat tax plan, 56 percent of respondents from a nationwide survey of 500 small businesses supported the flat tax while 36 percent opposed it.  The intensity of the support is interesting as 25 percent "strongly support" the flat tax while 31 percent "somewhat support" it.  In terms of opposition to the flat tax, 15 percent of small business respondents "somewhat oppose," and 21 percent "strongly oppose" it.<p>  

	While the Small Business Survival Committee does not base its policy positions on surveys and polls, I provide you with these numbers to give the Committee a sense of the support for a flat tax in the business community.  We also found interesting trends in our survey based on business size and geographic location.  The larger the business, the greater was the intensity of support.  In terms of geographic location, businesses in the Mid-Atlantic, Southern, and Western states were more favorable to a flat tax, while respondents in New England, the Mid-West, rust-belt, and Pacific Coast states registered a greater intensity of opposition.  Please note, however, that across all categories of business size and location, support was strong for a flat tax.<p>

	Let me add again that we outlined the flat tax proposal for each participant -- specifically mentioning which tax write-offs they would lose, and what would not be taxed 
under the Armey plan.<p>

	In the accompanying Small Business Survival Foundation study (each of you should have a copy), I outlined some basic criteria for a sound tax system.  These are: <p>

<li> <b>Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth</b> -- the lower and more proportional, or flatter, the tax rate system the better.  A flat tax is a fair system, as individuals and businesses pay taxes in proportion to the income they earn.  And more importantly, a low, flat tax rate creates far fewer disincentives for working, investing, and risk taking than does a system of steeply progressive tax rates.<p>

<li><b>No Taxation of Capital </b> -- taxing returns on investment and savings makes absolutely no economic sense. Taxes on savings, dividends and capital gains amount to double taxation and are essentially levies on economic growth.<p>

<li><b>Inflation Factor</b> -- the detrimental effects of inflation should be factored into any tax system's design.<p>

<li><b>Clarity</b> -- the clearer the tax system the better.  It should be apparent how much is owed, who is paying, and when the tax is being paid.<p>

<li><b>Simplicity</b> -- tax payments should be made as easy and as simple as possible for the taxpayer without any loss of clarity.  <p>

<li><b>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness</b> -- the fewer tax collectors and the more limited their powers the better.<p>

<li><b>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance</b> -- taxes should be low enough and easy enough to comply with so as to not provide significant incentives for avoidance.<p>

<li><b>No Additional Boost to Government Spending</b> -- a tax system's design should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures.<p>
</ul>
<p>
Our current income tax system scores miserably according to these criteria:<p>
<ul>
<li>Current tax rates are high and progressive -- punishing work, success and the economy.<p>

<li>Capital is taxed, including interest from savings, dividends, and capital gains.  As you know the top capital gains tax rate for individuals stands at 28 percent, and for corporations at 35 percent.<p>

<li>In terms of the inflation factor, the current system is split.  On the positive side, tax rates are indexed so that merely inflationary increases in income no longer push taxpayers into higher tax brackets.  On the negative side, capital gains are not indexed for inflation.  Under such a regime, the <i>real </i>tax rate on capital gains is much higher than the stated rate of 28 percent.  In fact, investors can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses under the current system.  Since one of the major difficulties facing most small businesses is raising capital, high, real capital gains tax rates are particularly detrimental.<p>

<li>Withholding and corporate taxation make the current system quite murky as to who is paying taxes, when, and how much?<p>

<li>As for simplicity, in the accompanying paper I outline just a handful of our current system's many costs and complexities.  Suffice it to say here that I have never met <i>anyone </i>claiming that our current income tax system was simple.<p>

<li>Few, if anyone, also claim that our system allows for a small tax collection bureaucracy or limited government intrusiveness into the private financial affairs of citizens.<p>

<li>The combination of high tax rates and tax law complexities create significant incentives for tax avoidance and evasion.<p>

<li>Finally, the income tax, especially one with high, progressive tax rates, has always acted as high-octane fuel for government spending.<p>
</ul>
<p>
	To the contrary, a low-rate, flat income tax scores very high according to our criteria for a sound tax system.<p>
<ul>
<li>As currently debated, a flat tax system would impose a rate of about 17 percent on all income above a certain level allowed for exemptions.  A 17 percent top tax rate would be the lowest this nation has witnessed since before World War I.  The rewards for working, risk taking, and succeeding would be greatly enhanced.<p>

<li>Capital would not be taxed.  Interest on savings, dividends, and capital gains would not be taxed -- eliminating current double taxation and providing a huge boost to economic growth.  Obviously, incentives for saving, investment, and entrepreneurship would skyrocket, and trillions of dollars would be freed up and made available for investment in new and expanding businesses.<p>

<li>Under a flat-tax-rate scenario with no taxation of capital gains, government possesses few, if any, tax-related reasons to inflate.<p>

<li>If a flat tax eliminates withholding, as Representative Dick Armey's plan would, the true cost of government will become increasingly clear to the average citizen.  Though, by continuing to tax business income, the system would still lack complete clarity, as corporate taxes would be at least partially hidden in the form of lower profits or higher prices.<p>

<li>A low, flat income tax would be vastly simpler than our current system.  Tax compliance costs would plummet.  Resources would be shifted away from tax-related make-work to productive ventures.<p>

<li>As for bureaucracy, the IRS could be greatly downsized as tax complexities evaporate and both individuals and businesses file returns on small index cards.  The potential dangers of government intrusiveness, however, still exist with such an income tax.  The IRS would continue to poke its nose around in the private financial affairs of citizens, but probably to a lessor extent than today.<p>

<li>The combination of a low tax rate and the elimination of deductions and credits, greatly limits incentives for tax avoidance or evasion.<p>

<li>The flat tax would serve as a great improvement over the current system in terms of its impact on government spending.  How so? First, Congress should not only be looking to shift to a flatter tax rate system, but should be looking to provide overall, much-needed tax reduction.  This would assist in limiting spending increases, lowering government's share of GDP, and boosting economic growth.  Second, by ending withholding, the true cost of government will become clearer to taxpayers as they actually sit down and write out a check to the federal government for their tax bill on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Demands for government to economize should drastically increase under such a reform.  Of course, the downside remains that income taxes have always fueled the growth of government, whether at the national, state or local levels -- and the flat tax is still an income tax.<p>
</ul>

Overall, a low-rate, flat income tax would serve as a boon to entrepreneurs, small business, and the economy.  In the short run, there will be a few adjustment pains for some businesses that grew out of various artificial incentives in our current, complex tax code.  But such woes would soon fade away, to be dwarfed by vastly improved incentives for investment and entrepreneurship.  In terms of expanding the pool of available capital, lowering and flattening income tax rates, and tax simplification, make no mistake about it, small business will thrive under such reforms.<p>  

	I would simply add that the lower you can push tax rates the better.  In fact, a flat tax rate of just 10 percent has a nice ring to it.<p>

	Thank you Madam Chairman and Members of the Committee.  On behalf of our small business members nationwide, we appreciate your efforts to study the important issue of tax overhaul.  Both through private conversations with small business owners and surveys, we find that government taxation -- especially federal taxes -- remains the number one concern of business owners.  The Small Business Survival Committee looks forward to working with you and the Committee as you continue to study and hold hearings on the various tax overhaul proposals.  I look forward to answering any questions you may have about my testimony.<p>

When July comes to mind one conjures up visions of backyard barbecues, sipping iced-tea on the
front porch, long weekends at the beach, or  Independence Day.  Summer is often thought of as a
less strenuous time, a time when "every night is a Saturday night," a time when Americans can
relax and escape from the burdens of everyday life.  Americans work all year so that in the
summer they may enjoy the fruits of their labor.  However, the reality is that this year the average
American had to work past Independence Day to pay their taxes.  Thus, from New years Eve to
July ninth Americans are working for the government -- that is 190 days out of the year.<p> 

There is little disagreement that our current tax system, in which the average American sends
40% of what they earn to the government, is severely flawed and must change. In describing our
current tax system, Grover G. Norquist, President of Americans For Tax Reform wrote that our
current system, "...favors consumption over investment, short term over long term horizons, debt
over equity, and service over manufacturing industry.."  Mr. Norquist continues by pronouncing
that: "The current tax code is a crazy hodge-podge of conflicting features for a single reason:
Once politicians get hold of a tax, they just can't let go.  As a result, minor fixes that could make
the current tax code much less a barrier to long-term growth just don't get made."  The numbers
back-up Mr. Norquist's claims.  A report on the IRS shows that over the past 10 years some 2000
tax code provisions have been released and the agency has doubled in size.<p> 

 Fortunately, the November elections have brought the tax debate to the forefront of political
discourse for the first time in thirty years.  Today, most politicians agree that the tax code is very
much in need of reform.  However, there is enormous disagreement on how this change should
be orchestrated.  Whether a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat, chances are you have a
plan to reform the tax code.<p>

From House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt who has attempted to bring the Democrats into
the great tax debate with his 10% progressive tax plan to House majority leader Dick Armey who
has spearheaded the tax debate by giving life to what has been dubbed the "Flat Tax," the
leadership of  both parties in the House are responding to the cries of the American people who
are demanding a fairer tax code.  Presidential hopeful Richard Lugar has also joined the debate,
coming out in support of House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer's National Sales Tax
proposal.  Whatever the plan may be one thing Washington can certainly agree on, whether for
philosophical or political reasons, is that Americans are demanding a new tax code, one that
allows them to work most of the year for themselves and their families.<p>  

Here are three of the most talked about plans.  Judge for yourself, the merits, (or lack- there-of)
for each, and then go to the Cyber Personality Forum to let people know what you think.  We
promise it won't be too "taxing."<p>

<TITLE>MAKING THE HOME OFFICE TAX DEDUCTION MORE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS</TITLE>

<H2>MAKING THE HOME OFFICE <BR>
TAX DEDUCTION MORE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS </H2>

<P>
People who do paid work from home so that they can care for their
children are presently in most cases denied any meaningful deduction
for their legitimate home-office expenses under the Internal Revenue
Code. Not only is this result inequitable for these taxpayers,
but it also puts them at a competitive disadvantage with their
colleagues who rent or own workspace away from home. Furthermore,
it discourages people who want to spend more time with their children
from establishing home-based businesses or from making a home-based
work arrangement with their employer.
<P>
Taxpayers who conduct a home business while caring for dependents,
particularly small children, often fail to qualify for the home-office
deduction under Section 280A of the Code, because it requires
that the space used for a home business to be used exclusively
for such purpose. The home-based businesswoman needing to keep
an eye on small children or struggling with one income needs to
be physically proximate to her children and may not be able to
afford a separate room or space used for no other purpose. In
either instance, no deduction is allowed for depreciation, rent
(if the taxpayer doesn't own his or her home), maintenance, utilities
and insurance expenses allocable to the home office space if,
for instance, the work room is used also as a family room or guest
bedroom.
<P>
In another related development, the IRS has taken the position
that day care providers (presently, the only home-based businesses
that are not required to satisfy the &quot;exclusive use&quot;
rule) must keep elaborate records on the time any room is used
for personal and business purposes. This recordkeeping requirement
would presumably apply to any future exceptions to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule such as taxpayers who operate home businesses while
caring for dependents. It imposes an unworkable burden on the
home-based business not required of their non home-based competitors.
<P>
Moreover, the value of a new exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule would be minimal unless the existing rule for allocating
time of use was amended.  Applying the existing allocation rule to a home-based business
where there is mixed use of space, even if the business were operating a full
40 hours per week, results in a deduction worth only 25 percent
of the amount a competitor in an office receives for the same
expenses.
<P>
Finally, employees who are &quot;telecommuters&quot; and who would
otherwise qualify for the deduction for home-office expenses under Section 280A's
&quot;exclusive use&quot; test, are often denied the deduction under Section 67
enacted in 1986. Section 67 disallows home-office expenses of
an employee to the extent that such expenses along with other
certain &quot;miscellaneous itemized deductions&quot; do not,
in the aggregate, exceed two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted
gross income. Such other deductions are defined sufficiently broadly
that it would be the rare case where the two percent floor was
exceeded, and then, only the excess of expenses above the floor
is deductible.
<P>
<B>Suggested Solutions</B>:
<P>
Consequently, in order to provide the growing number of home-based
employees and business owners proper tax treatment that recognizes
legitimate business expenses in a way that is comparable to their
competitors and colleagues who are not home-based, the following
amendments to the Internal Revenue Code are needed:
<UL>
(1) Amend Section 280A(c)(1) to allow an exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule permitting mixed use of space for business and
personal purposes in the case of taxpayers who conduct home-based
businesses while caring for dependents. Dependents should be defined
to include not only children, but also elderly parents or a sick
spouse.
<P>
(2) Amend Section 280A(c)(4)(C) to revise the allocation rule
for mixed uses to only compare only the amount of time a room
is in fact used for a business or personal purpose and not count
the time a room is used for no purpose at all (e.g., nighttime).
This would eliminate the reduction in the deductions for business
use for the time the mixed use room is used for no purpose and
put home-based taxpayers on a par with non-home-based taxpayers
who do not suffer a loss in deductions for their office space
when the office is closed.
<P>
(3) Provide some statutory &quot;safe harbors&quot; in Section
280A(c)(4) on calculating the mixed use of space for home day
care providers and, if the amendment suggested in (1) above is
enacted, for taxpayers with home-based businesses caring for dependents
to eliminate, in most cases, a burdensome recordkeeping requirement.
<P>
(4) Amend Section 67 to exclude home-office expenses of employees
from the miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the two
percent floor.

<title>Income Tax vs. Sales Tax -- PFF</title>

<h2>Income Tax vs. Sales Tax</h2>
<P>
By Grover G. Norquist
</center>
<P>
<p>
<p>
 The political class is approaching a consensus long held by the
American people: The federal income tax system is economically
destructive, overly intrusive, unfair and far too complicated.
<P>
 Historians will marvel at how quickly Members of Congress shifted
from Bill Clinton's view, as expressed in his $200 billion dollar
tax hike in the summer of 1993, that the only problem with the
income tax was that it did not tax successful wealth creation
at high enough rates.  We now confront the present debate between
moving to a flat rate "consumed income tax" or scrapping
the income tax completely and replacing it with a national sales
tax.
<P>
 Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader and a former economics
professor, has been the leading proponent of moving to a flat
tax that would tax all income once at a flat rate of 17 percent
after a personal exemption for a married couple of $23,000 and
of $36,000 for a family of four.  Should an American save and
invest any portion of his income during the year that money saved
would be exempt from tax. In effect, every American would have
an Individual Retirement Account with no limit on how much one
can save, no requirement that the money stay in the IRA until
retirement and no tax upon withdrawal. In effect this creates
a super turbo- charged Individual Retirement Account.
<P>
 Congressman Bill Archer and Senator Dick Lugar have proposed
replacing the present income tax with a consumption tax or a national
retail sales tax respectively.
<P>
 Michael Rothschild has criticized Mr. Armey and all advocates
of the flat tax for missing what he sees as a golden political
opportunity and advocating reforming the present system rather
than uprooting the IRS and moving to a national sales tax.
<P>
 Rothschild is correct in his criticisms of the present income
tax system, although he could have gone further.   But is he correct
that the sales tax would be a long-term improvement over Armey's
flat tax?  For political as well as economic reasons the answer
is no.
<P>
 The great strength of the flat tax is that it treats all American
citizens equally. This is a central tenet of American civilization.
Dividing citizens by income class is a European affliction that
Americans have rejected in most areas of civic life.  We are outraged
by the implication that a persons income would affect his standing
in court. We would not permit wealth or income to determine whether
one could vote, serve on a jury, attend public school, or engage
in freedom of speech and religion.
<P>
 The demagogic politicians who would exploit class divisions in
America are of a cloth with those who would divide Americans by
race for their own political gain.  It is not by accident that
the move towards a flat tax comes at the same time as the nation
is rejecting affirmative action, quotas and racial preferences
of all kinds.  We are Americans and we cannot allow the politicians
to continue to divide us against each other.
<P>
 For this same reason the flat tax is difficult to increase. 
In 1993, Bill Clinton told Americans to pay no attention to  his
1993 tax-and-spend budget increase as only "the rich"
would pay more.  Then, when the tax hike on "the rich"
was locked in, he moved to then tax only "social security
recipients" and only "small businesses that file as
subchapter S corporations" and then "only" those
who buy gasoline for their cars.  In Massachusetts the pro spending
interests --government workers unions -- have tried five times
through the initiative and referendum process to change the state's
present constitutional requirement for a flat tax to allow graduated
rates. Five times voters have publicly rejected this "populist"
measure despite assurances that "only the rich" would
be targeted. Voters recognized that once income groups were divided
they would be attacked one by one and divided against each other
until they fell.
<P>
 It is important to Americans that they have the same relationship
to the state as all other Americans. Equality before the law is
central to American life. It is also the best protection against
attempts to raise taxes.  An increase in a flat tax is opposed
by all taxpayers. A cut in a flat tax benefits all taxpayers.
 What a change that would make in the dynamics of the politics
of taxes.
<P>
 Mr. Rothschild overstates the virtues and understates the sad
history of national sales taxes in other nations.  First, sales
taxes are shot full of loopholes and gradations around the world
and in the 50 states.  Every year lobbyists swarm state capitols
asking that their product be exempt from sales taxes as a necessity.
California just went through the debate about the snack tax, which
included defining what a snack is.
<P>
 But a sales tax to replace the income tax -- and the social security
tax and inheritance tax and gift taxes if we are to be rid of
the Internal revenue service that enforces all these taxes --
is not a real option.  As economist Bruce Bartlett has calculated,
any sales tax would have to be 13.3 percent  to replace the income
tax, another 13.6 percent to replace the social security tax,
and another 3.3 percent to replace the corporate income tax. A
sales tax this high would be forced to be collected as a Value
Added Tax or VAT at every level of production.  No one would buy
retail. As in every European nation the sales tax would almost
immediately become a Value Added Tax which taxes goods and services
at every level of production. VAT's like income taxes are very,
very intrusive in the lives of businessmen and women, just like
the hated income tax.
<P>
 Worse, advocating a sales tax to replace the income tax could
well lead to the imposition of a sales tax/VAT in addition to
the present income taxes.  Every nation in Europe that has a VAT
also has a personal income tax and a corporate income tax as well
as wage taxes like social security.
<P>
 Americans of good will should work together to support the present
strategy of the House Republican leadership; to match spending
reduction with tax cuts that move us toward a flat tax.  The tax
cuts passed by the House include moving toward eliminating all
taxes on savings and investment and toward a larger personal and
dependent exemption.  Tax cuts alongside spending reductions makes
it clear that the purpose of reducing federal spending is not
simply to get Washington's sorry budget in order, but to protect
the American family's budget which has the first claim to money
it earns.
<P>
 And while it is important to move to a flat tax  on consumed
income to simplify the code, reduce the destruction American savings
and investment and treat all citizens equally -- without risking
burdening the people with an additional sales tax -- the true
challenge for Americans is to reduce the total size, scope and
power of the central government. Ultimately there is no nice,
pleasant, non destructive way to wrest 20 to 25 percent of the
total economy away from those who create wealth and distribute
it to the political class.  The total tax burden must be reduced
while we work to minimize the costs of the tax system upon our
freedoms, our families and our civil society. 
<P>

<title>Clinton Fails to Make Case for American Troops -- Heritage</title>

<h3>CLINTON FAILS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR AMERICAN TROOPS IN BOSNIA</h3>

By John Hillen<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 437<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>

	The Clinton Administration's plan to use 25,000 American troops to implement a Bosnian peace accord is being exposed as a haphazard and risky enterprise.  In hearings on Capitol Hill last week, members of the Senate and House questioned the political and military rationale behind the Bosnia peace plan deployment.  These questions focused on the mission's political goals, its military objectives, the probability of success, the risks entailed, and the support of the American people.  Robert McNamara recently noted in his memoirs that the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations failed to address these fundamental issues in the early debates over Vietnam.  It appears that the Clinton Administration is ready to fall into the same trap.
<p>
	The Clinton plan puts the cart before the horse.  Instead of making a troop commitment that is tailored to support a specific and workable peace accord, President Clinton made a commitment for 25,000 U.S. ground troops before he knew what the peace accord would entail -- an arbitrary pledge over two years ago. This backwards strategy forces a political plan onto an abstract military force requirement.  Members of Congress were correct to question why the Administration is attempting to force 25,000 U.S. ground troops onto a plan that does not yet exist.  In addition, the congressional hearings last week made it clear that the Clinton troop request is a mission looking for a purpose.  These hearings raised many prescient questions and issues that remain neither answered nor resolved:
<p>
	<b>1)  What are the objectives, and how does America know when they have been achieved?</b>  The American "Implementation Force" has no clearly defined and attainable military goals and no specific criteria by which the U.S. commanders can measure their success.  The Clinton plan fails to address military objectives and commits American forces to static picket duty in an interpositional buffer zone.  The American forces are supposed to sit there and "monitor" infractions of the peace accord.  General Lewis MacKenzie, a Canadian who commanded the first United Nations troops in Sarajevo, told Members of Congress last week that, of all the various national contingents, U.S. troops would be the primary targets for disgruntled belligerents.  He also told the House National Security Committee that while the Administration may try to portray the Implementation Force as a neutral "peacekeeping" presence, the United States will be perceived as the enemy by one side in the conflict.  He re-emphasized the danger to U.S. forces by adding that if he were an American military officer, he "wouldn't touch this mission with a ten-foot pole." 
<p>	<b>2) There is no exit strategy.</b>  Precisely because American forces do not have well-defined and achievable military goals, "mission creep" is inherent in the Clinton peace plan.  With the Administration under enormous pressure to succeed after deploying 25,000 troops, President Clinton will be sorely tempted to escalate American military efforts when faced with the inevitable resistance of the warring factions. To forestall this, the Administration plan calls for a time-driven scenario in which the American forces will be pulled out in twelve months.  Almost all the Members of Congress recognized that this is a purely political decision and were extremely skeptical when General John Shalikashvili defended this timetable for unexplained "operational reasons."  This is shameless political grandstanding on the part of President Clinton, and Congress rightly called his bluff.  As former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle testified, "An exit date is not an exit strategy."
<P>	<b>3) The Clinton team has anticipated and planned for a best-case scenario.</b>  Military planning, down to the lowest levels, always takes into account worst-case scenarios.  Military leaders must plan for what to do when anything and everything goes wrong.  Because this plan represents an ill-defined mission taking place in the volatile Balkans, there is every reason to believe that unexpected events will be a fixture. Senators were rightly astounded when Secretary of Defense William Perry stated that he "could not conceive of circumstances where troops would stay longer" than the one-year target date. This comment exposed the political and military naiveté that permeates the Clinton Administration. There are no contingency plans to address a scenario other than the fanciful best-case scenario anticipated by the Administration.  Should there be anything less than cooperation by the Bosnian parties, America would be forced either to cut and run or to reinforce troops in Bosnia and escalate military efforts to make the peace plan succeed.  The testimony of General MacKenzie made it clear that, despite Secretary Perry's optimism, American troops will have a rough time of it in Bosnia.
<p>	The Administration plan to deploy American ground forces has much to answer for, especially in regard to the fundamental questions that policymakers must address when contemplating the deployment of American combat troops into dangerous environments.  The Clinton team did not provide satisfactory answers to Congress, either on these fundamental issues or on a host of other questions about the mission.  The Administration has not clearly articulated its political and military goals in Bosnia. As Secretary of State Warren Christopher himself admitted after the hearings, "No, we haven't yet made the case." Most important, the Administration has not explained why the U.S. needs to send 25,000 ground troops to Bosnia and how a 12-month deployment can make a decisive contribution to a lasting peace in Bosnia.

<title>Conditions for Sending U.S. Troops to Bosnia -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><i><h3>CONDITIONS FOR SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO BOSNIA</h3></i>

By John Hillen, Policy Analyst <br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 66<br>
October 11, 1995<br></center>
<p>

	The President has promised to send 25,000 U.S. troops to Bosnia to police a peace settlement. He should not do so without the approval of Congress. Any operation as risky and potentially long-reaching as this one demands the full participation and approval of the House and Senate, and Congress should ensure that certain conditions are met before American troops are sent to Bosnia. While affirming the principle that all American forces, including ground troops, can be used in lesser regional conflicts and peacekeeping operations in Europe, Congress also should note the special risks and dangers associated with the Bosnian peace plan and ensure that specific criteria are met before American troops are deployed.
<p>
	As Congress debates whether U.S. troops should be committed in Bosnia, it should remember that:
<p><ul>
<li>America must lead in NATO, but sound leadership demands that the U.S. question a mission with ambiguous goals and ill-defined objectives. Washington should commit to NATO operations in principle but should not support losing propositions.
<p>
<li>The promised 25,000 American troops would cost two to three times more than the $1 billion - $2 billion estimated by the Clinton Administration.
<p>
<li>The Administration has not spelled out a coherent military plan that specifies the exact mission of the troops, the criteria to determine the success of that mission, timetables, rules of engagement, or command and control arrangements (especially concerning Russian participation).
<p>
<li>The plan to send 50,000 - 70,000 heavily armed NATO troops is clear evidence that this mission is an exercise in peace-enforcement, not peacekeeping, as the Administration claims. NATO troops will be authorized to undertake limited offensive operations against warring factions that violate the conditions of the peace accord. 
<p>
<li>Because of this, "mission creep," the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into this plan. As in Somalia, there will be pressure to increase operations and reinforce troops in order to "succeed."
<p>
<li>U.S. forces will not be accepted as impartial peacekeepers. The U.S. recently launched a comprehensive air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs and announced plans to train the Bosnian Muslim Army during the Bosnian deployment. The U.S. is no longer neutral in this conflict. This phenomenon also occurred in Lebanon in 1983 and Somalia in 1993, where the lives of American Marines and soldiers were needlessly lost because America failed to appreciate that belligerents viewed the U.S. as a combatant.</ul><p>

<b>THE ROLE OF CONGRESS</b>
<p>
The Congress should:<p><ul>

<li>Insist on full congressional approval for any deployment of U.S. troops to Bosnia;
<p>
<li>Hold hearings to determine the feasibility of U.S. participation in a Bosnian peace force; and
<p>
<li>Insist that the President meet the following conditions prior to any deployment of U.S. forces:
<p>
<li>Establish that U.S. national interests are threatened in Bosnia-Herzegovina;
<p>
<li>Publicize exactly what military commitments the Administration has made to both NATO and the Bosnian government;
<p>
<li>Establish that the peace accord is not merely another transient cease-fire, but a politically sustainable agreement;
<p>
<li>Confirm that all parties have withdrawn to clearly recognizable lines of demarcation that can be policed efficiently by a NATO force;
<p>
<li>State strategic and operational objectives for the U.S. force that are clearly defined, attainable, and sustainable; 
<p>
<li>Describe the exit strategy and clear criteria for determining mission success, including an "escape clause" in case the peace accord proves ephemeral;
<p>
<li>State the deployment, rotation, and redeployment timetables, as well as whether they are event-driven or time-driven;
<p>
<li>State clearly the mission cost and the effect on U.S. strategic readiness posture;
<p>
<li>Present a well-defined command and control structure that clearly addresses the role of Russian forces;
<p>
<li>Ensure that there is no overlap of responsibility and authority with the United Nations Protection Force, which should be entirely separate from the NATO chain of command;
<p>
<li>Present contingency plans for various scenarios that realistically address additional resources, cost, and operational feasibility;
<p>
<li>Submit a multinational force structure and command and control plan that ensures unity of command and effort among the many nations taking part; 
<p>
<li>Demonstrate that there are clear rules of engagement that are compatible with U.S. training and doctrine, with American forces not to be given static and passive missions that allow them only to react to initiatives of the warring belligerents;
<p>
<li>Ensure that U.S. troops will be deployed in sufficient strength to guarantee force protection and fully supported operations (no "token" force should be deployed in a dangerous theater); and
<p>
<li>Explain how past U.S. actions in Bosnia are consistent with a "peacekeeping" role.	   
</ul><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
There is clear evidence that American ground troops could imperil a Bosnian peace force by discrediting its impartial standing. Instead of committing large numbers of ground forces, the U.S. should play to its strengths by supporting this mission with capabilities that only the U.S. can contribute. These include strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and combat air support if necessary. American ground troops offer no tactical or operational advantage to a Bosnian peace force. They offer only political advantage for reluctant European allies.
<p>
	The U.S. should agree, in principle, to deploy its military forces (including ground troops) to assist in peacekeeping operations in Europe. But the Bosnian peace plan is not peacekeeping; it is peace enforcement. As yet, there is no reliable or sustainable peace settlement in Bosnia. When there is, the U.S. should consider sending in any forces necessary, but only if the foregoing conditions are met.

<title>The Risks of Clinton's Bosnia Peace Plan -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<i><h3>THE RISKS OF CLINTON'S BOSNIA PEACE PLAN</h3></i>
By John Hillen, Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 262<br>
October 10, 1995<br>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder Update</i> No. 250, "Clinton's Bosnia Folly," June 2, 1995, and <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1012, "Don't Let Bosnia Destroy NATO," December 28, 1994.)
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
	The impending diplomatic breakthrough in the Balkans has raised the prospect of a substantial American and allied military operation to police a Bosnian peace accord. Such an operation undoubtedly would entail an exercise in "peace-enforcement," with United States and allied troops using limited and selective enforcement measures to ensure the compliance of warring factions. 
<p>
	Knowing that this will not present U.S. forces either with a clearly defined, attainable military mission or with a decisive political objective, the Clinton Administration will try to sell the plan as a temporary and innocuous "peacekeeping" operation. The Administration maintains that this would involve only the limited deployment of approximately 25,000 American troops at a cost of $1 billion. But some experts have concluded that the operation would cost two or three times this much and that it probably would involve more than 25,000 American troops over a period of several years. 
<p>
	In much the same way, the Bush Administration tried to sell the Somalia operation as a limited humanitarian enterprise. In fact, the Administration's initial pronouncements even suggested that the troops would be home in seven weeks, by Inauguration Day. But American troops did not leave Somalia until some 16 months later, their good work obscured by the Ranger debacle in Mogadishu, the incoherence of a United Nations-managed peace-enforcement operation, and the renewal of clan warfare in Somalia. The Clinton Administration's planned deployment of American troops to Bosnia is fraught with much greater danger than was faced in Somalia and raises several strategic dilemmas. Some of these, concerning mission objectives, timetables, command and control, and rules of engagement, have been raised by GOP leaders in Congress. Others still need to be addressed:
<p>
<b>NATO Involvement.</b> Because of a rash promise by President Clinton, the U.S. is committed to a major role in implementing a Bosnian peace plan. This in itself should spark a major debate. How did NATO, America's principal security alliance, become a back-door conduit for heavy ground involvement in a conflict of marginal interest to U.S. security concerns? 
<p>
	In 1992, the world heard that this was the "hour of Europe"; in 1995, the U.S. hears once again that its European allies are leery of decisive commitments in the absence of American leadership. The U.S. obviously must lead NATO, but saying no to an ill-conceived peace-enforcement mission with vague and undefined objectives is clearer evidence of leadership than throwing troops into a losing cause. Significant U.S. participation in any NATO enterprise should be contingent on two things:  a clear and present danger to the security and stability of Europe, and a mission with clearly defined political and military goals.
<p>
	Is NATO the proper vehicle for a Bosnian peace force?  Should an alliance starved of credibility and uncertain of its future structure tackle internecine, ethnic conflict in Bosnia?  A NATO Balkan peace-enforcement force could have several unfortunate consequences. For example, it could unleash dissension at the very time NATO is trying to expand. Much as Somalia split the U.N. coalition, the ups and downs of the Bosnian mission could split the European alliance. Faced with the demonstrated intransigence of the belligerents, NATO could experience a resumption of the divergent approaches and internal squabbling that plagued its response to Bosnia in 1993-1994. A Bosnian peace force, under current circumstances, has precious little to offer NATO during a critical phase in its evolution. NATO should not allow a poorly crafted, self-fulfilling prophesy to lure it into accepting this mission.  
<p>
<b>U.S. Troops as "Peacekeepers."</b>  Peacekeeping is an exercise in which the peacekeepers are accepted as honest brokers, neutral and impartial. Because peacekeepers are deployed after an accord has been reached, they operate only in a supervisory role and are forced to rely on the good will and cooperation of the belligerents. President Clinton claims that the U.S. force would be structured for a "peaceful" and "uneventful" mission. 
<p>
	But as currently planned, this would not be a classic peacekeeping operation. So far in Bosnia there is no peace to keep. If U.S. ground troops are sent into Bosnia without a firm peace settlement, they will not be going in as neutrals. The United States, for better or for worse, has just completed a sustained air offensive against one side in the Bosnian conflict. While America may see itself as the impartial hand that "leveled the playing field," the Bosnian Serbs most certainly do not. They were on the receiving end of hundreds of airstrikes from NATO aircraft and American cruise missiles. In addition, the Clinton Administration plans to train the Bosnian Muslim forces while simultaneously acting as peacekeepers. Does the Administration really think the Serbs will accept American ground troops as impartial and neutral peacekeepers? 
<p>
	The U.S. has made this hazardous assumption twice before in recent years:  In Lebanon, in 1983, U.S. air and naval forces attacked Druze and Shiite militia positions while maintaining a "neutral" peacekeeping force in Beirut. Within days of the strikes, over 240 U.S. Marines were dead after a terrorist suicide strike against their barracks. 
<p>
	In Somalia, the U.S. also chose to attack one belligerent party while professing neutrality. The actions against Mohammed Aideed's party drew American troops into the conflict as if they were yet another local faction -- the only one without the political will to slug it out in the bloody back streets of Mogadishu.
<p>
<b>"Mission Creep."</b> Mission creep, the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into the Clinton plan for a Bosnian peace force. A force of 25,000 American soldiers is the absolute minimum needed to give the U.S. the security it needs to operate in Bosnia. A smaller force would be hopelessly exposed and unable to accomplish much of anything.  
<p>
	Since 25,000 troops are the minimum for protection alone, the question becomes how a peace plan will be imposed on the belligerents. The answer could be:  Call for more troops. This is exactly what happened in Somalia after the street battles of October 3, 1993. Within weeks, Clinton was forced to deploy an additional 15,000 troops to Somalia to ensure the security of a few thousand American soldiers operating with the U.N. mission. A force of 25,000 American troops for Bosnia anticipates a best-case scenario. Any deterioration of this scenario must lead to greater American participation. 
<p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The President's idea of peacekeeping in Bosnia would not be peacekeeping at all.  As yet, there is no peace to keep. The Clinton plan amounts to peace-enforcement in a dangerous and hostile environment. This is why NATO is planning for 50,000-70,000 heavily armed combat troops and not the lightly armed observers more common to peacekeeping missions. 
<p>
	Should a truly conclusive peace settlement be reached in Bosnia, and peacekeeping become possible, America should support a NATO peace force with strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and -- in the case of extreme emergency -- combat air support and possibly some ground troops. There is nothing to gain, either for America or for the peacekeeping force, by deploying substantial American ground forces in this risky adventure. American ground troops offer no operational advantage to the force. They are merely a political backstop for reluctant European allies. Based upon America's experiences in Lebanon and Somalia, it is obvious that participation by American ground troops could damage mission credibility and undermine the peace America and its allies are attempting to preserve. 
<p>
	While the U.S. should agree in principle to support NATO peace-enforcement operations when they make sense -- in other words, when the mission and political objectives are clear -- it should not commit itself to a deal that is bound to fail. In order to honor U.S. security commitments, America should be willing to deploy troops for lesser regional conflicts, and even for peacekeeping. However, it should do so only in cases where the benefits of success outweigh the risks of failure. The Clinton "peacekeeping" plan is not one of those cases.

<title>Heritage Exclusive -- Fall Agenda of 104th Congress</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Heritage Exclusive</i> -- The Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress -- House of Representatives</h3>
By <a href="mailto:griffinc@heritage.org">Charles P. Griffin</a><br>
Congressional Relations<br> <a href="/heritage/welcome.html">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 5, 1995<br></center>
<p>
The House of Representatives returns to Washington on Wednesday, September 6 to face two grueling months of budget debate.  The public attention has been focused on Medicare, but there are also 13 appropriations bills, reconciliation, and the debt ceiling that all must be dealt with during this time period.  It is not at all certain how the debate will turn out, but it is safe to assume that everyone will be happy to put these months behind them.
<p>
<b>Medicare:</b>
<p>
The trustees of the Medicare Trust Fund -- including three members of President Clinton's Cabinet -- have predicted the imminent bankruptcy of this health care safety net for the elderly.  Despite this, many politicians and special interest groups have been fighting the efforts to keep Medicare solvent.  Among the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip4.html">special interests</a> that have fought reform are several that feed at the public trough.  The House will have to cut through the scare tactics, roll up their sleeves, and find real solutions to the Medicare crisis.  The Heritage Foundation has contributed <a href="/heritage/library/index/i2.html">several useful studies</a> for Congress to consider in the debate.
<p>
<b>The Federal Budget:</b>
<p>
There is much speculation in Washington as to what will occur with the 13 spending bills that Congress must pass -- in theory -- before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1.  The President has issued several veto threats for some of the appropriations bills, and it is anticipated that there will be significant disagreements between the Congress and the President over what the nation's <a href="/heritage/library/index/a2.html">spending priorities</a> should be.  If a new law funding a particular agency is not in place by October 1, Congress must either pass a "continuing resolution" to permit it to remain open, or all but essential activities must be closed down.  It is likely that the Congress will send 13 bills to the President by the deadline, but delays in the bill becoming law may occur due to the give-and-take between the two branches of government.
<p>
<b>Reconciliation:</b>
<p>
"Reconciliation," although it is a fancy word, essentially describes the process by which Congress etches all aspects of the budget -- including taxes, appropriations, and entitlements -- in concrete.  It is through this process that the Congress hopes to reduce the tax burden on Americans, control entitlement spending, and enact a budget that will achieve balance by 2002.  The reconciliation process likely will not be completed until sometime in mid-October.
<p>
<b>Debt Ceiling:</b>
<p>
Since the federal government has repeatedly run up large deficits over the past 30 years, the Treasury Department must borrow money -- through bonds -- to finance the government's activities.  The government is limited by law as to how much money can be borrowed at any time.  A good way to think of this is like the credit limit on your credit cards.  This credit limit will be reached by the Treasury Department in October or November, so a new law must be enacted to permit further borrowing.  The key question in this debate will be how much to raise the limit by.  In the past, Congress has passed both long-term and short-term increases.  A number of freshman representatives have been quoted publicly as opposing any increase in the debt and this could be a significant factor in the debate.

<title>Heritage Exclusive -- Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Heritage Exclusive</i> -- The Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress -- Senate</h3>
By <a href="mailto:rennej@heritage.org">Jim Renne</a><br>
Congressional Relations<br> <a href="/heritage/welcome.html">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 5, 1995<br>
</center>
<p>
	Hello everyone!  Welcome to the Heritage Foundation on Town Hall.  This is a first for me.  I've never "surfed the Net" before, let alone go on-line with a U.S. Senate update.  But, there's a first for everything including my Internet Inaugural Exclusive.
<P>
	The last few months of this year's Congressional session will be one of the busiest times in Congressional history.  Not only will a balanced budget be passed for the first time since Nixon's first term, but major reform legislation such as welfare and Medicare will be stacked end to end waiting for consideration on the ever-deliberative Senate floor.
<P>
	As you may be aware, the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, has a general rule: If a Senator wants to "debate" an issue, he can debate until the cows come home.  There is no limit on the amount of time a Member of the Senate can talk once he's been recognized, except maybe the call of nature.  This can result in delays of days, weeks, even years.  This is known as a filibuster.
<P>
	I don't know how familiar you are with Parliamentary Procedure, so I thought I'd briefly explain key  parliamentary differences between the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate; and explain why it's more difficult for the Majority Party in the Senate to get things through.  
<P>
	One of the major differences is that in the House, rules governing time-limit and number of amendments on a particular bill are put up for a vote for each separate bill.  That means a simple majority of House Members can control and set limits to debate. This allows the Majority Party to dictate the timeframe and subject matter of any given issue allowing the Speaker of the House to ram through legislation.
<P>
	In the Senate, floor action is controlled by Unanimous Consent ("UC") -- meaning technically, one Senator can bring crucial legislation to a stand still at any time.  Sometimes even a threat of a filibuster is enough to kill a bill depending on whether the Majority leader can afford the time and effort required to beat one back. On the overwhelming majority of legislation, however, the majority and minority leaders agree on the terms of debate and pass a UC decree in which every Senator agrees on the terms.  
<P>
	But in the case where one Senator objects to the UC, a bill can be delayed indefinitely with a filibuster.  In this case, the only safeguard against a total shut down is a Cloture Petition.  Passing a Cloture Petition requires a vote of 3/5th of the Senate or 60 out of 100.  If Cloture is invoked, debate is automatically limited to 30 additional hours whereupon the bill will be immediately moved to a final vote. Thus, after Cloture has been invoked, a bill can pass with only 51 or a simple majority, where it took 60 to force the final vote.  Given the number of controversial bills coming before the Senate over these next few months, look for most if not all of the major issues to require 60 out of 100 votes instead of the usual simple majority of 51.  
<P>
	Having explained a little parliamentary procedure, I'll give a brief run down on what to expect in the Senate for the next few months.  
<P>
	The Senate reconvenes Tuesday, September 5, 1995, to begin the final lap of this marathon legislative session.  Look for the following issues to become prominent during the remainder of the session.<p>

<b>Welfare:</b><p>
The Senate has been the center of intrigue and Presidential politics over the last few months when it comes to welfare reform.  GOP Presidential candidates Bob Dole and Phil Gramm have been battling over whose welfare provisions will reign supreme.  Heritage's welfare expert <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> has written extensively on the subject and has been called upon to provide technical assistance to a powerful group of conservative Senators seeking to turn the tepid approach coming out of the Senate Finance Committee into bold, sweeping reform.  Heritage's <a href="/heritage/library/index/i5.html">reform proposals</a> will go a long way in addressing the critical ailments of the current system.  Already, the initial Senate version of the welfare reform bill has been strengthened by the inclusion of key Heritage proposals.  Some of Heritage's key provisions include measures to strengthen work requirements for recipients, reduce and discourage <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cbrief18.html">illegitimacy</a>, and stop welfare abuse by illegal immigrants.  Look for a welfare reform showdown between Congress' real reforms and the Clinton Administration's status-quo approach.
<p>
<b>Medicare:</b>
<P>
Medicare reform legislation is another highly contentious issue making its way through the halls of Congress.  Again, Heritage Foundation proposals to save billions of tax-payer dollars while providing fair, more efficient medical service are at the center of the debate.  Domestic Policy Studies Director <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Dr. Stuart Butler</a> and Health Care Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a> have written several papers providing a <a href="/heritage/library/index/i2.html">blueprint</a> on how to save billions while giving recipients increased options and  more control over their benefits.  At the same time, these reforms will drastically reduce government bureaucracy.  The sweeping proposal is based on a novel idea: allowing beneficiaries to take advantage of the best health care system in the entire world -- the American private sector health industry.  Liberals are sure to shamelessly demagogue the issue, but a reform package will be passed.  The system is too close to bankruptcy to continue along its current path.
<p>
<b>Budget Reconciliation:</b>
<p>
By far the most tangible and contentious legislative confrontation to come will be the massive budget-balancing proposal known as the budget reconciliation process.  Budget reconciliation is an extremely complex process by which the House and Senate enact into law major budgetary reform legislation giving the U.S. Treasury authority to spend your tax money.  The usual formula by which Congress approves its yearly budgets includes two main components, Authorization and Appropriations.  Without both, taxpayer dollars cannot be spent.  However, when Congress finds itself deep in the red as it finds itself this year after forty years of liberal control, it must quickly and efficiently pass legislation to exact meaningful spending cuts.  The normal process is too convoluted to handle such sweeping change. Thus, Congress has created a hybrid process known as reconciliation as a way to exact savings out entitlement and other programs.  Since these programs are highly contentious and difficult for the authorizers to reconcile, Congress created a process by which the deficit hawks on the Budget Committee would provide authorizers with spending limits which can't be exceeded.  Then it's up to the numerous committees of jurisdiction to make the necessary changes to meet the numbers.  The reconciliation process also provides the added advantage of putting the budget balancing bill on a fast track for floor consideration.  This avoids potential filibuster delays and a host of other hurdles.  
<p>
This year's budget process is even more contentious than most.  Holdover liberals from the big-taxing, big-spending Congresses of old are teaming up with the decidedly leftist Clinton Administration in a bitter fight to preserve the gargantuan welfare state.  And, for the first time in decades, a newly elected conservative Congress will actually vote on a monumental bill which will wipe out the entire federal deficit by the year 2002.  Because such a goal is so novel in Congress -- an encouraging sign of the newly elected conservative majority's will to lead -- budget reconciliation is taking on a truly revolutionary aura.  Look for a major confrontation between Congress and the Clinton Administration and a temporary shut down of non-essential government services during October, maybe even lasting into November.  Also, expect to see the welfare and Medicare bills pushed into the Reconciliation process because of gridlock in the normal authorization process.
<P>
<b>Debt Limit:</b>
<P>
Probably the most crucial issue to come before the Congress prior to the end of this session will be the annual debt ceiling bill.  For decades, the liberals in Congress nonchalantly raised the credit limit on America's national credit card by billions of dollars without as much as a blink of an eye.  The debt limit is the ultimate hammer on deficit spending.  If it is not raised, all government spending is immediately halted.  This would be a calamity beyond compare for both Congress and the President.  Thus, the new conservative leadership plans to attach sweeping spending cuts to this bill in order to force the big spending Clinton Administration to change its ways and make real cuts.  Look for the White House to seek a compromise early by accepting many of the spending cuts (and trying to take credit for them, too) in exchange for a debt limit increase.
<P>
I hope this information is interesting and informative to you all.  Please <a href="mailto:rennej@heritage.org">contact me</a> if you have any questions or comments.  Enjoy the rest of this Congressional Session!!

<center><h3>HOW OUR LAWS ARE MADE</h3></center><p>

I. <a name="introduction"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a><p>

This handbook is intended to provide a readable and 
nontechnical outline of the background and the numerous steps 
of our Federal lawmaking process from the origin of an idea 
for a legislative proposal through its publication as a 
statute. This is a matter about which every citizen should be 
well informed so as to be able to understand the everyday 
news reports and discussions concerning the work of Congress.<p>

 It is hoped that this handbook will enable every citizen to 
gain a greater understanding of the Federal legislative 
process and its role as one of the bulwarks of our 
representative system. One of the most practical safeguards 
of the American democratic way of life is this legislative 
process that, with its emphasis on the protection of the 
minority, gives ample opportunity to all sides to be heard 
and make their views known. The fact that a proposal cannot 
become a law without consideration and approval by both 
Houses of Congress is an outstanding virtue of our 
legislative system. Open and full discussion provided for 
under our Con stitution frequently results in the notable 
improvement of a bill by amendment before it becomes law, or 
the defeat of a bad  proposal.<p>

 Because the large majority of laws originate in the House of 
Representatives, this discussion will be directed principally 
to the procedure in that body.<p>

 
 II. <a name="congress"> <b>THE CONGRESS</b></a><p>

Article I, Section 1, of the United States Constitution, 
provides that--<p>

 All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a 
Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a 
Senate and House of Representatives.

 The Senate is composed of 100 Members--2 from each State, 
irrespective of population or area--elected by the people in 
conformity with the provisions of the 17th Amendment to the 
Constitution. That amendment changed the former 
Constitutional method under which Senators were chosen by the 
respective State legislatures. A Senator must be at least 30 
years of age, have been a citizen of the United States for 9 
years, and, when elected, be a resident of the State for 
which the Senator is chosen. The term of office is 6 years 
and one-third of the total membership of the Senate is 
elected every second year. The terms of both Senators from a 
particular State are so arranged that they do not terminate 
at the same time. Of the 2 Senators from a State serving at 
the same time the one who was elected first--or if both were 
elected at the same time, the one elected for a full term--is 
referred to as the "senior" Senator from that State. The 
other is referred to as the "junior" Senator. If a Senator 
dies or resigns during the term, the governor of the State 
must call a special election unless the State legislature has 
authorized the governor to appoint a successor until the next 
election, at which time a successor is elected for the 
balance of the term. Most of the State legislatures have 
granted their governors the power of appointment.<p>

Each Senator has one vote.<p>

 As constituted in 1989--the 101st Congress--the House of 
Representatives is composed of 435 Members elected every 2 
years from among the 50 States, apportioned to their total 
populations. The permanent number of 435 was established 
following the Thirteenth Decennial Census in 1910, as 
directed in Article I, Section 2, of the Constitution, and 
was increased temporarily to 437 for the 87th Congress, to 
provide for one Representative each for Alaska and Hawaii. It 
seems undesirable to make a considerable increase in the 
number of Members, because a larger body, similar to the 
British House of Commons, consisting of 650 members, would be 
too unwieldy. The Constitution limits the number of 
Representatives to not more than one for every 30,000 of 
population, and, under a former apportionment in one State a 
particular Representative represented more than 900,000 
constituents, while another in the same State was elected 
from a district having a population of only 175,000. The 
Supreme Court * has since held unconstitutional a Missouri 
statute permitting a maximum population variance of 3.1 
percent from mathematical equality. The Court said that the 
variances among the districts were not unavoidable and, 
therefore, were invalid. This is an interpretation of the 
Court's earlier decision that "as nearly as is practicable 
one man's vote in a Congressional election is to be worth as 
much as another's".<p>

 * Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526 (1969).<p>

 A law enacted in 1967 abolished all "at-large" elections 
(that is, Representatives elected by the voters of the entire 
State rather than in a Congressional district within the 
State) except, of course, in States entitled to only one 
Representative.<p>

 A Representative must be at least 25 years of age, have been 
a citizen of the United States for 7 years, and, when 
elected, be a resident of the State in which the 
Representative is chosen. If a Representative dies or resigns 
during the term, the governor of the State must call a 
special election for the choosing of a successor to serve for 
the unexpired portion of the term.<p>

Each Representative has one vote.<p>

In addition to the Representatives from each of the States, 
there is a Resident Commissioner from the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico and Delegates from the District of Columbia, 
American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. The Resident 
Commissioner and the Delegates have most of the prerogatives 
of Representatives, with the important exception of the right 
to vote on matters before the House.<p>

Under the provisions of Section 2 of the 20th Amendment to 
the Constitution, Congress must assemble at least once every 
year, at noon on the 3d day of January, unless by law they 
appoint a different day.<p>

 A Congress lasts for 2 years, commencing in January of the 
year following the biennial election of Members, and is 
divided into 2 sessions.<p>

 Unlike some other parliamentary bodies, both the Senate and 
the House of Representatives have equal legislative functions 
and powers (except that only the House of Representatives may 
initiate revenue bills), and the designation of one as the 
"upper" House and the other as the "lower" House is not 
appropriate.<p>

 The Constitution authorizes each House to determine the 
rules of its proceedings. Pursuant to that authority the 
House of Representatives adopts its rules on the opening day 
of each Congress. The Senate, which considers itself a 
continuing body, operates under standing rules that it amends 
from time to time.<p>

 The chief function of Congress is the making of laws. In 
addition, the Senate has the function of advising and 
consenting to treaties and to certain nominations by the 
President. In the matter of impeachments, the House of 
Representatives presents the charges--a function similar to 
that of a grand jury--and the Senate sits as a court to try 
the impeachment. Both Houses meet in joint session on the 6th 
day of January, following a presidential election, to count 
the electoral votes. If no candidate receives a majority of 
the total electoral votes, the House of Representatives 
chooses the President from among the 3 candidates having the 
largest number of votes, and the Senate chooses the Vice 
President from the 2 candidates having the largest number of 
votes for that office.<p>

 
 III. <a name="legislation"><b>SOURCES OF LEGISLATION</b></a><p>

 Sources of ideas for legislation are unlimited, and 
proposed drafts of bills originate in many diverse quarters. 
First of these is, of course, the idea and draft conceived by 
a Member. This may emanate from the election campaign during 
which the Member had promised to introduce legislation on a 
particular subject, if elected. The entire campaign may have 
been based upon one or more such proposals. Or, through 
experience after taking office the Member may have become 
aware of the need for amendment or repeal of existing laws or 
the enactment of a statute in an entirely new field.<p>

 In addition, the Member's constituents--either as 
individuals or by corporate activity such as citizen groups 
or associations, bar associations, labor unions, 
manufacturers' associations, and chambers of commerce--may 
avail themselves of the right to petition, which is 
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, and 
transmit their proposals to the Member. Many excellent laws 
have originated in this way inasmuch as some of those 
organizations, because of their vital concern with various 
areas of legislation, have considerable knowledge regarding 
the laws affecting their interests and have the services of 
expert legislative draftsmen at their disposal for this 
purpose. If favorably impressed by the idea, the Member may 
introduce the proposal in the form in which it has been 
submitted or may first redraft it. In all events, the Member 
may consult with the Legislative Counsel of the House or the 
Senate, as the case may be, to frame the ideas in suitable 
legislative language and form for introduction.<p>

 In modern times the "executive communication" has become a 
prolific source of legislative proposals. This is usually in 
the form of a letter from a member of the President's Cabinet 
or the head of an independent agency--or even from the 
President--transmitting a draft of a proposed bill to the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of 
the Senate. Despite the system of separation of powers, 
Article II, Section 3, of the Constitution imposes an 
obligation on the President to report to Congress from time 
to time on the "State of the Union" and to recommend for 
consideration such measures as the President considers 
necessary and expedient. Many of these executive 
communications follow on the President's message to Congress 
on the State of the Union. The communication is then referred 
to the standing committee having jurisdiction of the subject 
matter embraced in the proposal because a bill may be 
introduced only by a Member of Congress. The Chairman of that 
committee usually introduces the bill promptly either in the 
form in which it was received or with changes the Chairman 
considers necessary or desirable. This practice prevails even 
when the majority of the House and the President are not of 
the same political party, although there is no constitutional 
or statutory requirement that a bill be introduced to 
effectuate the recommendations. Otherwise, the message may be 
considered by the committee or one of its subcommittees to 
determine whether a bill should be introduced. The most 
important of the regular executive communications is the 
annual message from the President transmitting the proposed 
budget to Congress. This, together with testimony by 
officials of the various branches of the Government before 
the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate, is the 
basis of the several appropriation bills that are drafted by 
the Committee on Appropriations of the House.<p>

 Several of the executive departments and independent 
agencies have staffs of trained legislative counsels whose 
functions include the drafting of bills to be forwarded to 
Congress with a request for their enactment.<p>

 The drafting of statutes is an art that requires great 
skill, knowledge, and experience. In some instances a draft 
is the result of a study covering a period of a year or more 
by a commission or committee designated by the President or 
one of the Cabinet officers. The Administrative Procedure Act 
and the Uniform Code of Military Justice are only 2 of many 
examples of enactments resulting from such studies. In 
addition, Congressional committees sometimes draft bills 
after studies and hearings covering periods of a year or 
more. Bills to codify the laws relating to crimes and 
criminal procedure, the judiciary and judicial procedure, the 
armed forces, and other subjects, have each required several 
years of preparation.<p>

 
 IV. <a name="Action"><b> FORMS OF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</b></a><p>

The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a 
proposal in one of 4 principal forms. These are: the bill, 
the joint resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the 
simple resolution. By far the most customary form used in 
both Houses is the bill. During the 100th Congress (1987 
-1988), there were introduced in both Houses, 8,515 bills and 
1,073 joint resolutions. Of this number 5,585 bills and 678 
joint resolutions originated in the House of Representatives.<p>

 For the sake of simplicity this discussion will be confined 
generally to the procedure on a House of Representatives 
bill, but a brief comment will be made about each of the 
forms.<p>

<b> BILLS</b><p>

 A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether 
permanent or temporary, general or special, public or 
private.<p>

 The form of a House bill is as follows:<p>
<center>
                    A BILL<br
<br>
<br
 For the establishment, etc. 
            [as the title may be].<p>
</center>
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, 
etc.<p>

 The enacting clause was prescribed by law in 1871 and is 
identical in all bills, whether they originate in the House 
of Representatives or in the Senate.<p>

 Bills may originate in either the House of Representatives 
or the Senate, with one notable exception provided for by the 
Constitution. Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution, 
provides that all bills for raising revenue shall originate 
in the House of Representatives but the Senate may propose or 
concur with amendments, as on other bills. General 
appropriation bills also originate in the House of 
Representatives.<p>

 There are 2 types of bills--public and private. A public 
bill is one that affects the public generally. A bill of a 
private character, that is, a bill that affects an individual 
rather than the population at large, is called a private 
bill. A private bill is used for relief in matters such as 
immigration and naturalization and claims by or against the 
United States.<p>

 Article I, Section 8, prescribes the matters concerning 
which Congress may legislate, while Section 9 of the same 
Article places certain limitations on Congressional action.<p>

 A bill originating in the House of Representatives is 
designated by the letters "H.R." followed by a number that it 
retains throughout all its parliamentary stages. The letters 
signify "House of Representatives" and not, as is sometimes 
supposed, "House resolution". A Senate bill is designated by 
the letter "S." followed by its number. The term "companion 
bill" is used to describe a bill introduced in one House of 
Congress that is similar or identical to a bill introduced in 
the other House of Congress. <p>

 A bill that has been agreed to in identical form by both 
bodies becomes the law of the land only after--<p>

 (1) Presidential approval; or<p>

 (2) failure by the President to return it with objections to 
the House in which it originated within 10 days while 
Congress is in session; or<p>

 (3) the overriding of a Presidential veto by a two-thirds 
vote in each House.<p>

 It does not become law without the President's signature if 
Congress by their adjournment prevent its return with 
objections. This is known as a "pocket veto".<p>

<b> JOINT RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of 
Representatives or in the Senate--not, as may be supposed, 
jointly in both Houses. There is little practical difference 
between a bill and a joint resolution and, although the 
latter are not as numerous as bills, the 2 forms are often 
used indiscriminately. Statutes that have been initiated as 
bills have later been amended by a joint resolution, and vice 
versa. Both are subject to the same procedure--with the 
exception of a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the 
Constitution. When a joint resolution amending the 
Constitution is approved by two-thirds of both Houses, it is 
sent directly to the Archivist of the United States for 
submission to the several States for ratification. It is not 
presented to the President for approval.<p>

 The form of a House joint resolution is as follows:<p>
<center>
                 JOINT RESOLUTION<br>
<br>
<br
Authorizing, etc. [as the title may be].<p>
</center>

   Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
   of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
   That all, etc.<p>

 The resolving clause is identical in both House and Senate 
joint resolutions, having been prescribed by statute in 1871. 
It is frequently preceded by one or more "whereas" clauses 
indicating the necessity for or the desirability of the joint 
resolution.<p>

 The term "joint" does not signify simultaneous introduction 
and consideration in both Houses.<p>

 A joint resolution originating in the House of 
Representatives is designated "H.J. Res." followed by its 
individual number which it retains throughout all its 
parliamentary stages. One originating in the Senate is 
designated "S.J. Res." followed by its number.<p>

 Joint resolutions become law in the same manner as bills.<p>

<b> CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 Matters affecting the operations of both Houses are usually 
initiated by means of concurrent resolutions. In modern 
practice, these normally are not legislative in character but 
are used merely for expressing facts, principles, opinions, 
and purposes of the 2 Houses. They are not equivalent to a 
bill and their use is narrowly limited within these bounds.<p>

 The term "concurrent" does not signify simultaneous 
introduction and consideration in both Houses.<p>

 A concurrent resolution originating in the House of 
Representatives is designated "H. Con. Res." followed by its 
individual number, while a Senate concurrent resolution is 
designated "S. Con. Res." together with its number. On 
approval by both Houses, they are signed by the Clerk of the 
House and the Secretary of the Senate and transmitted to the 
Archivist of the United States for publication in a special 
part of the Statutes at Large volume covering that session of 
Congress. They are not presented to the President for action 
as in the cases of bills and joint resolutions unless they 
contain a proposition of legislation, and that, of course, is 
not within their scope in their modern form.<p>

<b> SIMPLE RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 A matter concerning the operation of either House alone is 
initiated by a simple resolution. A resolution affecting the 
House of Representatives is designated "H. Res." followed by 
its number, while a Senate resolution is designated "S. Res." 
together with its number. They are considered only by the 
body in which they were introduced and on adoption are 
attested to by the Clerk of the House of Representatives or 
the Secretary of the Senate, as the case may be, and are 
published in the Congressional Record.<p>

 
 V. <a name="reference"><b>INTRODUCTION AND REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE</b></a><p>

  Any Member, the Resident Commissioner, and the Delegates in 
the House of Representatives may introduce a bill at any time 
while the House is actually sitting by simply placing it in 
the "hopper" provided for the purpose at the side of the 
Clerk's desk in the House Chamber. Permission is not required 
to introduce the measure or to make a statement at the time 
of introduction. Printed blank forms for use in typing the 
original bill are supplied through the Clerk's office. The 
name of the sponsor is endorsed on the bill. A public bill 
may be sponsored by an unlimited number of Members. On 
request, a Member may be added as a sponsor no later than the 
day the bill is reported to the House. (For a discussion of 
"Reported bills", see Part VII.) In addition, a Member listed 
as a sponsor (other than the first sponsor) may have the 
Member's name deleted as a sponsor no later than the day the 
bill is reported to the House. To forestall the possibility 
that a bill might be introduced in the House on behalf of a 
Member without that Member's prior approval, the sponsoring 
Member's signature must appear on the bill before it is 
accepted for introduction. When there are multiple sponsors 
of a bill, the signature must be that of the Member first 
named thereon. In the Senate, unlimited multiple sponsorship 
of a bill also is permitted. Occasionally, a Member may 
insert the words "by request" after the Member's name to 
indicate that the introduction of the measure is in 
compliance with the suggestion of some other person.<p>

 In the Senate, a Senator usually introduces a bill or 
resolution by presenting it to one of the clerks at the 
Presiding Officer's desk, without commenting on it from the 
floor of the Senate. However, a Senator may use a more formal 
procedure by rising and introducing the bill or resolution 
from the floor. A Senator usually makes a statement about the 
measure when introducing it on the floor. Frequently, 
Senators obtain consent to have the bill or resolution 
printed in the body of the Congressional Record, following 
their formal statement.<p>

 If any Senator objects to the introduction of a bill or 
resolution, the introduction of the bill or resolution is 
postponed until the next day. If there is no objection, the 
bill is read by title and referred to the appropriate 
committee.<p>

 In the House of Representatives it is no longer the custom 
to read bills--even by title--at the time of introduction. 
The title is entered in the Journal and printed in the 
Congressional Record, thus preserving the purpose of the old 
rule. The bill is assigned its legislative number by the 
Clerk and referred to the appropriate committees by the 
Speaker (the Member elected to be the Presiding Officer of 
the House) with the assistance of the Parliamentarian. These 
details appear in the daily issue of the Congressional 
Record. It is then sent to the Government Printing Office 
where it is printed in its introduced form, and printed 
copies are available shortly thereafter in the document rooms 
of both Houses. <p>

 One copy is sent to the office of the Chairman of the 
committee to which it has been referred, for action by that 
committee. The clerk of the committee enters it on the 
committee's Legislative Calendar.<p>

 Perhaps the most important phase of the Congressional 
process is the action by committees. That is where the most 
intensive consideration is given to the proposed measures and 
where the people are given their opportunity to be heard. 
Nevertheless, this phase where such a tremendous volume of 
hard work is done by the Members is sometimes overlooked by 
the public, particularly when complaining about delays in 
enacting laws. There are, at present, 22 standing committees 
in the House and 16 in the Senate, as well as several select 
committees. In addition, there are several standing joint 
committees of the 2 Houses.<p>

 Each committee has jurisdiction over certain subject matters 
of legislation and all measures affecting a particular area 
of the law are referred to that committee that has 
jurisdiction over it. For example, the Committee on the 
Judiciary has jurisdiction over measures relating to judicial 
proceedings (civil and criminal) generally, and 18 other 
categories, of which Constitutional amendments, immigration 
and naturalization, bankruptcy, revision and codification of 
statutes, civil liberties, antitrust, patents, copyrights and 
trademarks, are but a few. In all, the rules of the House and 
of the Senate each provide for approximately 200 different 
classifications of measures that are to be referred to 
committees.<p>

 Membership on the various committees is divided between the 
2 major political parties. The proportion of the Members of 
the minority party to the Members of the majority party is 
determined by the majority party, except that one-half of the 
Members on the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct are 
from the majority party and one-half from the minority party. 
The respective party caucuses nominate Members of the caucus 
to be elected to each standing committee at the beginning of 
each Congress. Membership on a standing committee during the 
course of a Congress is contingent on continuing membership 
in the caucus that nominated the Member for election to the 
committee. If the Member ceases to be a Member of the caucus, 
the Member automatically ceases to be a Member of the 
standing committee.<p>

 A Member may serve on more than one committee. However, the 
rules of the caucus of the majority party in the House 
provide that the Chairmen of certain committees may not serve 
on another committee and that a Member may be Chairman of 
only one subcommittee of a committee or select committee with 
legislative jurisdiction, excepting certain committees 
performing housekeeping functions and joint committees.<p>

 A Member usually seeks election to the committee that has 
jurisdiction over a field in which the Member is most 
qualified and interested. For example, the Committee on the 
Judiciary traditionally is composed entirely of lawyers. Many 
Members are nationally recognized experts in the specialty of 
their particular committee or subcommittee.<p>

 Members rank in seniority in accordance with the order of 
their appointment to the committee, and usually the ranking 
majority Member is elected Chairman. The rules of the House 
require that committee Chairmen be elected from nominations 
submitted by the majority party caucus at the commencement of 
each Congress.<p>

 Most committees have 2 or more subcommittees that, in 
addition to having general jurisdiction, specialize in the 
consideration of particular classifications of bills. Each 
standing committee of the House, except the Committee on the 
Budget, that has more than 20 Members must establish at least 
4 subcommittees.<p>

 Each committee is provided with a professional and clerical 
staff to assist it in the innumerable administrative details 
and other problems involved in the consideration of bills. 
For the standing committees, the professional staff 
(consisting of not more than 18, 6 of whom may be selected by 
the minority) is appointed on a permanent basis solely on the 
basis of fitness to perform the duties of their respective 
positions. The clerical staff (consisting of not more than 
12, 4 of whom may be selected by the minority) is appointed 
to handle correspondence and stenographic work for the 
committee staff and the Chairman and ranking minority Member 
on matters related to committee work. All staff appointments 
are made by a majority vote of the committee without regard 
to race, creed, sex, or age. The minority staff provisions do 
not apply to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct 
because of its bipartisan nature. The Committee on 
Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget have special 
authority under the rules of the House for appointment of 
staff and assistants for the minority.<p>

 Under certain conditions, a standing committee may appoint 
consultants on a temporary or intermittent basis and also may 
provide financial assistance to members of its professional 
staff for the purpose of acquiring specialized training, 
whenever the committee determines that such training will aid 
the committee in the discharge of its responsibilities.<p>

 
 VI. <a name="committee"><b> CONSIDERATION BY COMMITTEE</b></a><p>

The rules adopted by the caucus of the majority party in 
the House provide that the Chairman of the committee to which 
a bill has been referred must refer the bill to the 
appropriate subcommittee within 2 weeks, unless a majority of 
the Members of the majority party on the committee vote to 
have the bill considered by the full committee. One of the 
first actions taken is the transmittal of copies of the bill 
to the departments and agencies concerned with the subject 
matter and frequently to the General Accounting Office with a 
request for an official report of views on the necessity or 
desirability of enacting the bill into law. Ample time is 
given for the submission of the reports and when received 
they are accorded serious consideration but are not binding 
on the committee in determining whether or not to act 
favorably on the bill. Reports of the departments and 
agencies in the executive branch are submitted first to the 
Office of Management and Budget to determine whether they are 
consistent with the program of the President.<p>

 <b>COMMITTEE MEETINGS</b><p>

 Standing committees are required to have regular meeting 
days at least once a month, but the Chairman may call and 
convene additional meetings. Three or more Members of a 
standing committee may file with the committee a written 
request that the Chairman call a special meeting. The request 
must specify the measure or matter to be considered. If the 
Chairman fails, within 3 calendar days after the filing of 
the request, to call the requested special meeting, to be 
held within 7 calendar days after the filing of the request, 
a majority of the Members of the committee may call the 
special meeting by filing with the committee written notice 
specifying the time and date of the meeting and the measure 
or matter to be considered.<p>

 With the exception of the Committees on Appropriations, on 
the Budget, on Rules, on Standards of Official Conduct, on 
Ways and Means, and on House Administration, committees may 
not, without special permission, meet while the House is 
reading a measure for amendment under the "five-minute rule". 
(See first paragraph under heading "Second Reading" in Part 
XI.) Special permission to meet will be given unless 10 or 
more Members object. The rules of the House also provide that 
House committees may not meet during a joint session of the 
House and Senate or during a recess when a joint meeting of 
the House and Senate is in progress. Committees may meet at 
other times during a recess up to the expiration of the 
constitutional term.<p>

 <b>PUBLIC HEARINGS</b><p>

 If the bill is of sufficient importance, and particularly if 
it is controversial, the committee will usually set a date 
for public hearings. Each committee (except the Committee on 
Rules) is required to make public announcement of the date, 
place, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted by 
the committee on any measure or matter at least one week 
before the commencement of that hearing, unless the committee 
determines that there is good cause to begin the hearing at 
an earlier date. If the committee makes that determination, 
it must make a public announcement to that effect at the 
earliest possible date. Public announcements are published in 
the Daily Digest portion of the Congressional Record as soon 
as possible after the announcement is made by the committee, 
and are often noted in news papers and periodicals. Personal 
notice, usually in the form of a letter, but possibly in the 
form of a subpena, is sent frequently to individuals, 
organizations, and Government departments and agencies that 
are known to be interested.<p>

 Each hearing by a committee and subcommittee is required to 
be open to the public except when the committee or 
subcommittee, in open session and with a majority present, 
determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the remainder 
of the hearing on that day shall be closed to the public 
because disclosure of testimony, evidence, or other matters 
to be considered would endanger the national security or 
would violate a law or a rule of the House. The committee or 
subcommittee by the same procedure may vote to close one 
subsequent day of hearing, except that the Committees on 
Appropriations and on Armed Services and the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, and subcommittees of those 
committees, by the same procedure may vote to close up to 5 
additional consecutive days of hearings. When a quorum for 
taking testimony is present, a majority of the Members 
present may close a hearing to discuss whether the evidence 
or testimony to be received would endanger national security 
or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person.<p>

 Hearings on the budget are required to be held by the 
Committee on Appropriations in open session within 30 days 
after its transmittal to Congress, except when the Committee, 
in open session and with a quorum present, determines by 
rollcall vote that the testimony to be taken at that hearing 
on that day may be related to a matter of national security. 
The Committee may by the same procedure close one subsequent 
day of hearing.<p>

 On the day set for the public hearing an official reporter 
is present to record the testimony in favor of and against 
the bill. The bill may be read in full at the opening of the 
hearings and a copy is inserted in the record. After a brief 
introductory statement by the Chairman and often by the 
ranking minority Member or other committee Member, the first 
witness is called. Members or Senators who wish to be heard 
are given preference out of courtesy and because of the 
limitations on their time. Cabinet officers and high-ranking 
civil and military officials of the Government, as well as 
interested private individuals, testify either voluntarily or 
at the request or summons of the committee.<p>

 Committees require, so far as practicable, that witnesses 
who appear before it file with the committee, in advance of 
their appearance, a written statement of their proposed 
testimony and limit their oral presentations to a brief 
summary of their arguments.<p>

 Minority party Members of the committee are entitled to call 
witnesses of their own to testify on a measure during at 
least one day of the hearing.<p>

 All committee rules in the House must provide that each 
Member shall have only 5 minutes in the interrogation of 
witnesses until each Member of the committee who desires to 
question a witness has had an opportunity to do so.<p>

 A typewritten transcript of the testimony taken at a public 
hearing is made available for inspection in the office of the 
clerk of the committee and frequently the complete transcript 
is printed and distributed widely by the committee.<p>

<b> BUSINESS MEETINGS</b><p>

 After hearings are completed, the subcommittee usually will 
consider the bill in a session that is popularly known as the 
"markup" session. The views of both sides are studied in 
detail and at the conclusion of deliberation a vote is taken 
to determine the action of the subcommittee. It may decide to 
report the bill favorably to the full committee, with or 
without amendment, or unfavorably, or suggest that the 
committee "table" it, that is, postpone action indefinitely. 
Each Member of the subcommittee, regardless of party 
affiliation, has one vote.<p>

 All meetings for the transaction of business, including the 
markup of legislation, of standing committees or 
subcommittees must be open to the public except when the 
committee or subcommittee, in open session with a majority 
present, determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the 
remainder of the meeting on that day shall be closed to the 
public. This requirement does not apply to any meeting that 
relates solely to internal budget or personnel matters. 
Members of the committee may authorize congressional staff 
and departmental representatives to be present at any 
business or markup session that has been closed to the 
public.<p>

<b> COMMITTEE ACTION</b><p>

 At committee meetings reports on bills may be made by 
subcommittees. Reports are fully discussed and amendments may 
be offered. Committee amendments are only proposals to change 
the bill as introduced and are subject to acceptance or 
rejection by the House itself. A vote of committee Members is 
taken to determine whether the full committee will report 
favorably or "table" the bill. If the committee votes to 
report the bill favorably to the House, it may report the 
bill with or without amendments or report a "clean bill". If 
the committee has approved extensive amendments, the 
committee may decide to report a new bill incorporating those 
amendments, commonly known as a "clean bill". The new bill is 
introduced (usually by the Chairman of the committee), and, 
after referral back to the committee, is reported favorably 
to the House by the committee. Because tabling a bill 
normally is effective in preventing action on it, adverse 
reports to the House by the full committee ordinarily are not 
made. On rare occasions, a committee may report a bill 
without recommendation or unfavorably.<p>

 Generally, a majority of the committee constitutes a quorum, 
the number of Members who must be present in order for the 
committee to act. This ensures adequate participation by both 
sides in the action taken. However, a committee may vary the 
number of Members necessary for a quorum for certain actions. 
For example, a committee may fix the number of its Members, 
but not less than 2, necessary for a quorum for taking 
testimony and receiving evidence. Except for the Committees 
on Appropriations, on the Budget, and on Ways and Means, a 
committee may fix the number of its Members, but not less 
than one-third, necessary for a quorum for taking certain 
other actions. The absence of a quorum is the subject of a 
point of order--that is, an objection that the proceedings 
are out of order--that is, that the required number of 
Members is not present.<p>

<b> PUBLIC INSPECTION OF RESULTS OF ROLLCALL VOTE IN COMMITTEE</b><p>

 The result of each rollcall vote in any meeting of a 
committee must be made available by that committee for 
inspection by the public at reasonable times in the offices 
of that committee. Information available for public 
inspection includes (1) a description of each amendment, 
motion, order, or other proposition, (2) the name of each 
Member voting for and each Member voting against the 
amendment, motion, order, or proposition, and whether by 
proxy or in person, and (3) the names of those Members 
present but not voting.<p>

 With respect to each rollcall vote by a committee on a 
motion to report a bill or resolution of a public character, 
the total number of votes cast for, and the total number of 
votes cast against, the reporting of the bill or resolution 
must be included in the committee report.<p>

<b> PROXY VOTING</b><p>
 A vote by a Member of a committee with respect to a measure 
or other matter may not be cast by proxy unless that 
committee adopts a written rule that permits voting by proxy 
and requires that the proxy authorization (1) be in writing, 
(2) assert that the Member is absent on official business or 
is otherwise unable to be present at the meeting of the 
committee, (3) designate the person who is to execute the 
proxy authorization, and (4) be limited to a specific measure 
or matter and any amendments or motions pertaining to the 
measure or matter. A Member may authorize a general proxy 
only for motions to recess, adjourn or other procedural 
matters. A proxy must be signed by the Member and must 
contain the date and time of day that it is signed. A proxy 
may not be counted for a quorum.<p>

 <b>POINTS OF ORDER WITH RESPECT TO COMMITTEE PROCEDURE</b><p>

 A point of order does not lie with respect to a measure 
reported by a committee on the ground that hearings on the 
measure were not conducted in accordance with required 
committee procedure. However, certain points of order may be 
made by a Member of the committee which reported the measure 
if, in the committee, that point of order was (1) timely made 
and (2) improperly overruled or not properly considered.<p>

<b> BROADCASTING COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND MEETINGS</b><p>

 It is permissible to cover open committee hearings and 
meetings in the House by television, radio, and still 
photography. This permission is granted under well defined 
conditions as provided in the rules of the House. Similarly, 
the rules of the Senate permit broadcasting of open hearings 
of a Senate committee under such rules as the committee may 
adopt.<p>

 
 VII. <a name="reported bills"><b>REPORTED BILLS</b></a><p>

  If the committee votes to report the bill favorably to the 
House, one of the Members is designated to write the 
committee report. The report describes the purpose and scope 
of the bill and the reasons for its recommended approval. 
Generally, a section-by-section analysis is set forth in 
detail explaining precisely what each section is intended to 
accomplish. All changes in existing law must be indicated in 
the report and the text of laws being repealed must be set 
out. This requirement is known as the "Ramseyer" rule; a 
similar rule in the Senate is known as the "Cordon" rule. 
Committee amendments also must be set out at the beginning of 
the report and explanations of them are included. Executive 
communications regarding the bill usually are quoted in full.<p>

 If at the time of approval of a bill by a committee (except 
the Committee on Rules) a Member of the committee gives 
notice of an intention to file supplemental, minority, or 
additional views, that Member is entitled to not less than 3 
calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) in which to file those views with the clerk of the 
committee and they must be included in the report on the 
bill. Committee reports, with certain exceptions, must be 
filed while the House actually is sitting unless unanimous 
consent is obtained from the House to file at a later time.<p>

 The report is assigned a report number when it is filed, and 
it is delivered to the Government Printing Office for 
printing during that night. Beginning with the 91st Congress, 
in 1969, the report number contains a prefix-designator which 
indicates the number of the Congress. For example, the first 
House report in 1969 was numbered 91-1.<p>

 The bill is reprinted when reported and committee amendments 
are indicated by showing new matter in italics and deleted 
matter in line-through type. The report number is printed on 
the bill and the calendar number is shown on both the first 
and back pages of the bill. However, in the case of a bill 
that was referred to 2 or more committees for consideration 
in sequence, the calendar number is printed only on the bill 
as reported by the last committee to consider it. See Part 
IX, "Calendars".<p>

 Committee reports are perhaps the most valuable single 
element of the legislative history of a law. They are used by 
courts, executive departments and agencies, and the public 
generally, as a source of information regarding the purpose 
and meaning of the law.<p>

<b> CONTENTS OF REPORTS</b><p>

 The report of a committee on a measure that has been 
approved by the committee must include (1) the committee's 
oversight findings and recommendations, (2) the statement 
required by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, if the 
measure provides new budget authority (other than continuing 
appropriations), certain new spending authority, new credit 
authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax 
expenditures, (3) the cost estimate and comparison prepared 
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office whenever 
the Director has submitted that estimate and comparison to 
the committee prior to the filing of the report, and (4) a 
summary of the oversight findings and recommendations made by 
the Committee on Government Operations whenever they have 
been submitted to the legislative committee in a timely 
fashion to allow an opportunity to consider the findings and 
recommendations during the committee's deliberations on the 
measure. Each of these items are set out separately and 
clearly identified in the report. For a discussion of the 
Congressional budget process, see Part XII.<p>

<b> INFLATIONARY IMPACT AND COST ESTIMATES IN REPORTS</b><p>

 In addition, each report of a committee on a bill or joint 
resolution of a public character reported by the committee 
must contain a detailed analytical statement as to whether 
the enactment of the bill or joint resolution into law may 
have an inflationary impact on prices and costs in the 
operation of the national  economy.<p>

 Each report also must contain an estimate, made by the 
committee, of the costs which would be incurred in carrying 
out that bill or joint resolution in the fiscal year reported 
and in each of the 5 fiscal years thereafter or for the 
duration of the program authorized if less than 5 years. In 
the case of a measure involving revenues, the report need 
contain only an estimate of the gain or loss in revenues for 
a one-year period. The report must include a comparison of 
the estimates of those costs with the estimate made by any 
Government agency and submitted to that committee. The 
Committees on Appropriations, on House Administration, on 
Rules, and on Standards of Official Conduct are not required 
to include cost estimates in their reports. In addition, the 
cost estimates are not required to be included in reports 
when a cost estimate and comparison prepared by the Director 
of the Congressional Budget Office has been submitted prior 
to the filing of the report and included in the report.<p>

 <b>FILING OF REPORTS</b><p>

 Measures approved by a committee must be reported promptly 
after approval. A majority of the Members of the committee 
may file a written request with the clerk of the committee 
for the reporting of the measure. When the request is filed, 
the clerk immediately must notify the Chairman of the 
committee of the filing of the request, and the report on the 
measure must be filed within 7 days (excluding days on which 
the House is not in session) after the day on which the 
request is filed. This does not apply to a report of the 
Committee on Rules with respect to the rules, joint rules, or 
order of business of the House or to the reporting of a 
resolution of inquiry addressed to the head of an executive 
department.<p>

<b> AVAILABILITY OF REPORTS AND HEARINGS</b><p>

 With certain exceptions (relating to emergency situations, 
such as a measure declaring war or other national emergency 
and Government agency decisions, determinations, and actions 
that are effective unless disapproved or otherwise 
invalidated by one or both Houses of Congress), a measure or 
matter reported by a committee (except the Committee on Rules 
in the case of a resolution making in order the consideration 
of a bill, resolution, or other order of business) may not be 
considered in the House until the third calendar day 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) on which 
the report of that committee on that measure has been 
available to the Members of the House. In addition, the 
measure or matter may not be considered unless copies of the 
report and the reported measure or matter have been available 
to the Members for at least 3 calendar days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays during which the House 
is not in session) before the beginning of consideration. 
However, it is always in order to consider a report from the 
Committee on Rules specifically providing for the 
consideration of a reported measure or matter notwithstanding 
this restriction. If hearings were held on a measure or 
matter so reported, the committee is required to make every 
reasonable effort to have those hearings printed and 
available for distribution to the Members of the House prior 
to the consideration of the measure in the House. General 
appropriation bills may not be considered until printed 
committee hearings and a committee report thereon have been 
available to the Members of the House for at least 3 calendar 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays).<p>

 
 VIII. <a name="legislative"><b>LEGISLATIVE REVIEW BY STANDING COMMITTEES</b></a><p>

  Each standing committee (other than the Committees on 
Appropriations and on the Budget) is required to review and 
study, on a continuing basis, the application, 
administration, execution, and effectiveness of the laws 
dealing with the subject matter over which the committee has 
jurisdiction and the organization and operation of Federal 
agencies and entities having responsibility for the 
administration and evaluation of those laws.<p>

 The purpose of the review and study is to determine whether 
laws and the programs created by Congress are being 
implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of 
Congress and whether those programs should be continued, 
curtailed, or eliminated. In addition, each committee having 
oversight responsibility is required to review and study any 
conditions or circumstances that may indicate the necessity 
or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation 
within the jurisdiction of that committee, and must 
undertake, on a continuing basis, futures research and 
forecasting on matters within the jurisdiction of that 
committee. Each standing committee also has the function of 
reviewing and studying, on a continuing basis, the impact or 
probable impact of tax policies on subjects within its 
jurisdiction.<p>

 In addition, several of the standing committees have special 
oversight responsibilities, the details of which are 
contained in the rules of the House.
<p>
 
 IX. <a name="calendar"><b>CALENDARS</b><p></a>

  The House of Representatives has 5 calendars of business: 
the Union Calendar, the House Calendar, the Private Calendar, 
the Consent Calendar, and the Calendar of Motions to 
Discharge Committees. The calendars, together with a listing 
of all bills introduced and a history of all bills reported 
out of committee in the current Congress, are printed each 
day the House is in session to provide information on the 
status of pending legislation.<p>

 As soon as a public bill is favorably reported, it is 
assigned a calendar number on either the Union Calendar or 
the House Calendar, the 2 principal calendars of business. 
The calendar number is printed on the first page of the bill 
and, in certain instances, is printed also on the back page. 
In the case of a bill that was referred to 2 or more 
committees for consideration in sequence, the calendar number 
is printed only on the bill as reported by the last committee 
to consider it.<p>

<b> UNION CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules of the House provide that there shall be:<p>

 First. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House on the 
state of the Union, to which shall be referred bills raising 
revenue, general appropriation bills, and bills of a public 
character directly or indirectly appropriating money or 
property.<p>

 
 This is commonly known as the Union Calendar and the large 
majority of public bills and resolutions are placed on it on 
being reported to the House. For a discussion of the 
Committee of the Whole House, see Part XI.<p>

 <b>HOUSE CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules further provide that there shall be:<p>

 Second. A House Calendar, to which shall be referred all 
bills of a public character not raising revenue nor directly 
or indirectly appropriating money or property.<p>

 
 The public bills and resolutions that are not placed on the 
Union Calendar are referred to the House Calendar.<p>

<b> PRIVATE CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules also provide that there shall be:<p>

 Third. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House, to 
which shall be referred all bills of a private character.<p>

 
 This is commonly known as the Private Calendar and all 
private bills are placed on it on being reported to the 
House. The Private Calendar is called on the first and third 
Tuesdays of each month.  If objection is made by 2 or more 
Members to the consideration of any measure called, it is 
recommitted to the committee that reported it. As in the case 
of the Consent Calendar (see below) there are 6 official 
objectors, 3 on the majority side and 3 on the minority side, 
who make a careful study of each bill or resolution on the 
Private Calendar and who will object to a measure that does 
not conform to the requirements for that calendar, thereby 
preventing the passage without debate of nonmeritorious bills 
and resolutions.<p>

<b>CONSENT CALENDAR</b><p>

 If a measure pending on either the House or Union Calendar 
is of a noncontroversial nature, it may be placed on the 
Consent Calendar. After a bill has been favorably reported 
and is on either the House or Union Calendar, any Member may 
file with the Clerk a notice that the Member desires the bill 
placed on the Consent Calendar. On the first and third 
Mondays of each month immediately after the reading of the 
Journal, the Speaker directs the Clerk to call the bills in 
numerical order (that is, in the order of their appearance on 
that calendar) that have been on the Consent Calendar for 3 
legislative days. If objection is made to the consideration 
of any bill so called, it is carried over on the calendar 
without prejudice to the next day when the Consent Calendar 
is again called, and if then objected to by 3 or more Members 
it is immediately stricken from the calendar and may not be 
placed on the Consent Calendar again during that session of 
Congress. If objection is not made and if the bill is not 
"passed over" by request, it is passed by unanimous consent 
without debate. Ordinarily, the only amendments considered 
are those sponsored by the committee that reported the bill.<p>

 To avoid the passage without debate of measures that may be 
controversial or are sufficiently important or complex to 
require full discussion, there are 6 official objectors--3 on 
the majority side and 3 on the minority side--who make a 
careful study of bills on the Consent Calendar. If a bill 
involves the expenditure of more than a fixed maximum amount 
of money or if it changes national policy or has other 
aspects that any of the objectors believes demand explanation 
and extended debate, it will be objected to and will not be 
passed by unanimous consent. That action does not necessarily 
mean the final defeat of the bill because it may then be 
brought up for consideration in the same way as any other 
bill on the House or Union Calendars.<p>

<b> CALENDAR OF MOTIONS TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEES</b><p>
 When a majority of the Members of the House sign a motion to 
discharge a committee from consideration of a public bill or 
resolution, that motion is referred to the Calendar of 
Motions to Discharge Committees. For a further discussion of 
Motions to Discharge, see "Motion to Discharge Committee" in 
Part X.<p>

 X. <a name="measures"><b> OBTAINING CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES</b></a><p>

  Obviously certain measures pending on the House and Union 
Calendars are more important and urgent than others and it is 
necessary to have a system permitting their consideration 
ahead of those that do not require immediate action. Because 
all measures are placed on those calendars in the order in 
which they are reported to the House, the latest bill 
reported would be the last to be taken up if the calendar 
number alone were the determining factor.<p>

 <b>SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 To avoid delays and to provide some degree of selectivity in 
the consideration of measures, it is possible to have them 
taken up out of order by obtaining from the Committee on 
Rules a special resolution or "rule" for their consideration. 
That Committee, which is composed of majority and minority 
Members but with a larger proportion of majority Members than 
other committees, is specifically granted jurisdiction over 
resolutions relating to the order of business of the House. 
Usually the Chairman of the committee that has favorably 
reported the bill appears before the Committee on Rules 
accompanied by the sponsor of the measure and one or more 
Members of the Chariman's committee in support of the request 
for a resolution providing for its immediate consideration. 
If the Committee on Rules is satisfied that the measure 
should be taken up it will report a resolution reading 
substantially as follows with respect to a bill on the Union 
Calendar:<p>

 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall 
be in order to move that the House resolve itself into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for 
the consideration of the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., and 
the first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. After 
general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall 
continue not to exceed __ hours, to be equally divided and 
controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on ___, the bill shall be read for amendment under 
the five-minute rule. At the conclusion of the consideration 
of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and 
report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have 
been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered 
as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final 
passage without intervening motion except one motion to 
recommit.<p>

 
 If the measure is on the House Calendar the resolution reads 
substantially as follows:<p>

 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall 
be in order to consider the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., 
in the House.<p>

 
 The resolution may waive points of order against the bill. 
When it limits or prevents floor amendments, it is popularly 
known as a "closed rule".<p>

<b> CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES MADE IN ORDER BY PREVIOUS 
RESOLUTION</b><p>

 When a "rule" has been reported to the House, and is not 
considered immediately, it is referred to the calendar and, 
if not called up for consideration by the Member making the 
report within 7 legislative days thereafter, any Member of 
the Committee on Rules may call it up as a question of 
privilege (after having given one calendar day notice of the 
Member's intention to do so) and the Speaker will recognize 
any Member of the Committee seeking recognition for that 
purpose. For a discussion of privileged questions, see the 
matter under the heading "Privileged Matters" at the end of 
this part.<p>

 If, within 7 calendar days after a measure has, by 
resolution, been made in order for consideration by the 
House, a motion has not been offered for its consideration, 
the Speaker may recognize a Member of the committee that 
reported the measure to offer a motion that the House 
consider it, if the Member has been duly authorized by that 
committee to offer the motion.<p>

 There are several other methods of obtaining consideration 
of bills that either have not been reported by a committee 
or, if reported, for which a special resolution or "rule" has 
not been obtained. Two of those methods, a motion to 
discharge a committee and a motion to suspend the rules, are 
discussed below.<p>

<b> MOTION TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEE</b><p>

 A Member may present to the Clerk a motion in writing to 
discharge a committee from the consideration of a public bill 
or resolution that has been referred to it 30 days prior 
thereto. A Member also may file a motion to discharge the 
Committee on Rules from further consideration of a resolution 
providing either a special order of business, or a special 
rule for the consideration of a public bill or resolution 
favorably reported by a standing committee, or a special rule 
for the consideration of a public bill or resolution that has 
remained in a standing committee 30 days or more without 
action. This motion may be made only when the resolution, 
from which it is moved to discharge the Committee on Rules, 
has been referred to that committee at least 7 days prior to 
the filing of the motion to discharge. The motion is placed 
in the custody of the Clerk, who arranges some convenient 
place for the signature of Members. When a majority of the 
total membership of the House have signed the motion, it is 
entered on the Journal, printed with the signatures thereto 
in the Congressional Record, and referred to the Calendar of 
Motions to Discharge Committees.<p>

 On the second and fourth Mondays of each month, except 
during the last 6 days of a session, a Member who has signed 
a motion to discharge, that has been on the calendar at least 
7 days, may seek recognition and be recognized for the 
purpose of calling up the motion. The bill or resolution is 
then read by title only. After 20 minutes' debate, one-half 
in favor of the proposition and one-half in opposition, the 
House proceeds to vote on the motion to discharge.<p>

 If the motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from a 
resolution pending before the Committee prevails, the House 
immediately votes on the adoption of that resolution.<p>

 If the motion to discharge one of the standing committees of 
the House from a public bill or resolution pending before the 
committee prevails, a Member who signed the motion may move 
that the House proceed to the immediate consideration of the 
bill or resolution. If the motion is agreed to, the bill or 
resolution is considered immediately under the general rules 
of the House. If the House votes against the motion for 
immediate consideration, the bill or resolution is referred 
to its proper calendar with the same rights and privileges it 
would have had if reported favorably by the standing 
committee.<p>

<b> MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES</b><p>

 On Monday and Tuesday of each week and during the last 6 
days of a session, the Speaker may entertain a motion to 
suspend the rules of the House and pass a bill or resolution. 
Arrangement must be made in advance with the Speaker to 
recognize the Member who wishes to offer the motion. Before 
being considered by the House, the motion must be seconded by 
a majority of the Members present, by teller vote, if 
demanded. However, a second is not required on a motion to 
suspend the rules when printed copies of the proposed bill or 
resolution have been available for one legislative day before 
the motion is considered. The motion to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill is then debated for 40 minutes, one-half by 
those in favor of the proposition and one-half by those 
opposed. The motion may not be amended and if amendments to 
the bill are proposed they must be included in the motion 
when it is made. The rules may be suspended and the bill 
passed only by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members 
voting, a quorum being present.<p>

 The Speaker may postpone all recorded and yea-nay votes on 
motions to suspend the rules and pass bills and resolutions 
until the end of that legislative day or the next 2 
legislative days. At that time the House disposes of the 
deferred votes consecutively without further debate. After 
the first deferred vote is taken, the Speaker may reduce to 
not less than 5 minutes the time period for subsequent 
deferred votes. If the House adjourns before completing 
action on one or more deferred votes, these must be the first 
order of business on the next legislative day. By eliminating 
intermittent recorded votes on suspensions, this procedure 
reduces interruptions of committee meetings and also reduces 
the time Members spend on suspension days going back and 
forth between the floor and their committee rooms or offices.<p>

<b> CALENDAR WEDNESDAY</b><p>

 On Wednesday of each week, unless dispensed with by 
unanimous consent or by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the 
Members voting, a quorum being present, the standing 
committees are called in alphabetical order. A committee when 
named may call up for consideration any bill reported by it 
on a previous day and pending on either the House or Union 
Calendar. Not more than 2 hours of general debate is 
permitted on any measure called up on Calendar Wednesday and 
all debate must be confined to the subject matter of the 
measure, the time being equally divided between those for and 
those against it. The affirmative vote of a simple majority 
of the Members present is sufficient to pass the measure.<p>

 <b>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BUSINESS</b><p>

 The second and fourth Mondays in each month, after the 
disposition of motions to discharge committees and after the 
disposal of business on the Speaker's table requiring only 
referral to committee, are set aside, when claimed by the 
Committee on the District of Columbia, for the consideration 
of any business that is presented by that Committee.<p>

<b> PRIVILEGED MATTERS</b><p>

 Under the rules of the House certain matters are regarded as 
privileged matters and may interrupt the order of business, 
for example, reports from the Committee on Rules and reports 
from the Committee on Appropriations on the general 
appropriation bills.<p>

 At any time after the reading of the Journal, a Member, by 
direction of the appropriate committee, may move that the 
House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on 
the State of the Union for the purpose of considering bills 
raising revenues, or general appropriation bills. General 
appropriation bills may not be considered in the House until 
3 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) after printed committee reports and hearings on 
them have been available to the Members. The limit on general 
debate is generally fixed by unanimous consent.<p>

 Other examples of privileged matters are conference reports, 
certain amendments to measures by the Senate, veto messages 
from the President of the United States, and resolutions 
privileged pursuant to statute. The Member in charge of such 
a matter may call it up at practically any time for immediate 
consideration. Usually, this is done after consultation with 
both the majority and minority floor leaders so that the 
Members of both parties will have advance notice and will not 
be taken by surprise.<p>

 
 XI. <a name="consideration"><b>CONSIDERATION</b></a><p>

  Our democratic tradition demands that bills be given 
consideration by the entire membership with adequate 
opportunity for debate and the proposing of amendments.<p>

<b> COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE</b><p>

 In order to expedite the consideration of bills and 
resolutions, the rules of the House provide for a 
parliamentary usage that enables the House to act with a 
quorum of less than the requisite majority of 218. The House 
resolves itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the 
State of the Union (a quorum of which consists of 100 
Members) to consider a measure. All measures on the Union 
Calendar--involving a tax, making appropriations, or 
authorizing payments out of appropriations already made--must 
be first considered in the Committee of the Whole.<p>

 The Committee on Rules reports a special resolution or 
"rule" allowing for immediate consideration of a measure by 
the Committee of the Whole. After adoption of the resolution 
by the House, the House votes on a motion to resolve itself 
into the Committee of the Whole or, in certain situations, 
the Speaker declares the House resolved into the Committee of 
the Whole without intervening motion. When the House resolves 
into the Committee of the Whole, the Speaker leaves the chair 
after appointing a Chairman to preside.<p>

 The special resolution or "rule" referred to in the 
preceding paragraph also fixes the length of the debate in 
the Committee of the Whole. This may vary according to the 
importance and controversial nature of the measure. As 
provided in the resolution, the control of the time is 
divided equally--usually between the Chairman and the ranking 
minority Member of the committee that reported the measure. 
Members seeking to speak for or against the measure usually 
arrange in advance with the Member in control of the time on 
their respective side to be allowed a certain amount of time 
in the debate. Others may ask the Member speaking at the time 
to yield to them for a question or a brief statement. A 
transcript of the proceedings and debate in the House and the 
Senate is printed daily in the Congressional Record. 
Frequently permission is granted a Member by unanimous 
consent to extend the Member's remarks in the Congressional 
Record if sufficient time to make a lengthy oral statement is 
not available during actual debate.<p>

 The conduct of the debate is governed principally by the 
rules of the House that are adopted at the opening of each 
Congress. Another recognized authority is Jefferson's Manual 
that was prepared by Thomas Jefferson for his own guidance as 
President of the Senate from 1797 to 1801. The House, in 
1837, adopted a rule that still stands, providing that the 
provisions of Jefferson's Manual should govern the House in 
all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are 
not inconsistent with the rules and orders of the House. In 
addition, there is a most valuable compilation of precedents 
up to the year 1935 set out in Hinds' Precedents and Cannon's 
Precedents of the House of Representatives, consisting of 11 
volumes, to guide the action of the House. A later 
compilation, Deschler's Precedents of the House of 
Representatives, covers years 1936 to date. Summaries of the 
House precedents prior to 1959 can be found in a single 
volume entitled Cannon's Procedure in the House of 
Representatives. A later volume, Procedure in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, fourth edition, as supplemented, is a 
compilation of the parliamentary precedents of the House, in 
summary form, together with other useful related material, 
from 1959 to date. Also, various rulings of the Speaker since 
1931 are set out as notes to the current House Rules and 
Manual. Most parliamentary questions arising during the 
course of debate are susceptible of ruling backed up by a 
precedent of action in a similar situation. The 
Parliamentarian of the House is present in the House Chamber 
in order to assist the Chairman or the Speaker in making a 
correct ruling on parliamentary questions.<p>

<b> SECOND READING</b><p>

 During the general debate an accurate account is kept of the 
time used on both sides and when all the time allowed under 
the rule has been consumed the Chairman terminates the 
debate. Then begins the "second reading of the bill", section 
by section, at which time amendments may be offered to a 
section when it is read. A Member is permitted 5 minutes to 
explain the proposed amendment, after which the Member who is 
first recognized by the Chair is allowed to speak for 5 
minutes in opposition to it; there is no further debate on 
that amendment, thereby effectively preventing any attempt at 
filibuster tactics. This is known as the "five-minute rule". 
There is, how ever, a device whereby a Member may offer a pro 
forma amendment--"to strike out the last word"--without 
intending any change in the language, and be allowed 5 
minutes for debate, thus permitting a somewhat more 
comprehensive debate. Each amendment is put to the Committee 
of the Whole for adoption. Generally, a pro forma amendment 
is withdrawn. However, in the absence of being withdrawn, it 
must be voted on.<p>

 At any time after a debate is begun under the five-minute 
rule, on proposed amendments to a section or paragraph of a 
bill, the Committee of the Whole may by majority vote of the 
Members present, close debate on the section or paragraph. 
However, if debate is closed on a section or paragraph before 
there has been debate on any amendment that a Member has 
caused to be printed in the Congressional Record after the 
reporting of the bill by the committee but at least one day 
prior to floor consideration of the amendment, the Member who 
caused the amendment to be printed in the Record is given 5 
minutes in which to explain the amendment, after which the 
first person to obtain the floor has 5 minutes to speak in 
opposition to it, and there is no further debate on that 
proposed amendment. However, time for debate is not allowed 
when the offering of the amendment is dilatory. Material 
placed in the Congressional Record must indicate the full 
text of the proposed amendment, the name of the proponent 
Member, the number of the bill to which it will be offered 
and the point in the bill or amendment thereto where the 
amendment is intended to be offered, and must appear in a 
portion of the Record designated for that purpose.<p>

 When an amendment is offered, while the House is meeting in 
the Committee of the Whole, the Clerk is required to transmit 
5 copies of the amendment to the majority committee table, 5 
copies to the minority committee table, and at least one copy 
each to the majority and minority cloak rooms.<p>

<b>THE COMMITTEE "RISES"</b><p>

 At the conclusion of the consideration of a bill for 
amendment, the Committee of the Whole "rises" and reports the 
bill to the House with the amendments that have been adopted. 
In rising the Committee of the Whole reverts back to the 
House and the Chairman of the Committee is replaced in the 
chair by the Speaker of the House. The House then acts on the 
bill and any amendments adopted by the Committee of the 
Whole.<p>

<b> HOUSE ACTION</b><p>

 Debate is cut off by moving "the previous question". If this 
motion is carried by a majority of the Members voting, a 
quorum being present, all debate is cut off on the bill on 
which the previous question has been ordered. The Speaker 
then puts the question: "Shall the bill be engrossed and read 
a third time?" If this question is decided in the 
affirmative, the bill is read a third time by title only and 
voted on for passage.<p>

 If the previous question has been ordered by the terms of 
the special resolution or "rule" on a bill reported by the 
Committee of the Whole, the House immediately votes on 
whatever amendments have been reported by the Committee in 
the sequence in which they were reported. After completion of 
voting on the amendments, the House immediately votes on the 
passage of the bill with the amendments it has adopted.<p>

 In those cases where the previous question has not been 
ordered, the House may engage in debate lasting one hour, at 
the conclusion of which the previous question is ordered and 
the House votes on the passage of the bill. During the debate 
it is in order to offer amendments to the bill or to the 
Committee amendments.<p>

 The Speaker may postpone a vote on final passage of a bill 
or resolution or agreement to a conference report. A vote may 
be postponed for up to 2 legislative days.<p>

 Measures that do not have to be considered in the Committee 
of the Whole are considered in the House in the first 
instance under the hour rule or in accordance with the terms 
of the special resolution limiting debate on the measure.<p>

 After passage of the bill by the House, a pro forma motion 
to reconsider it is automatically made and laid on the table-
-that is, action is postponed indefinitely--to forestall this 
motion at a later date, because the vote of the House on a 
proposition is not final and conclusive on the House until 
there has been an opportunity to reconsider it.<p>

<b> MOTIONS TO RECOMMIT</b><p>

 After the previous question has been ordered on the passage 
of a bill or joint resolution, it is in order to make one 
motion to recommit the bill or joint resolution to a 
committee and the Speaker is required to give preference in 
recognition for that purpose to a Member who is opposed to 
the bill or joint resolution. This motion is normally not 
subject to debate. However, with respect to a motion to 
recommit with instructions after the previous question has 
been ordered, it is in order to debate the motion for 10 
minutes before the vote is taken, except that the majority 
floor manager may demand that the debate be extended to one 
hour. Whatever time is allotted for debate is divided equally 
between the proponents and opponents of the motion.<p>

<b> QUORUM CALLS AND ROLLCALLS</b><p>

 In order to speed up and expedite quorum calls and 
rollcalls, the rules of the House provide alternative methods 
for pursuing these procedures.<p>

 In the absence of a quorum, 15 Members, including the 
Speaker, if there is one, are authorized to compel the 
attendance of absent Members. Such a call of the House is 
ordered by a majority vote, and a minority of 15 or more 
favoring a call is not sufficient. A call of the House is 
then ordered, and the Speaker is required to have the call 
taken by electronic device. However, the Speaker instead may 
name one or more clerks "to tell" the Members who are 
present. In that case the names of those present are recorded 
by the clerks, and entered in the Journal of the House and 
absent Members have not less than 15 minutes from the 
ordering of the call of the House to have their presence 
recorded. If sufficient excuse is not offered for their 
absence, by order of a majority of those present, they may be 
sent for by officers appointed by the Sergeant-at-Arms for 
that purpose, and their attendance secured and retained. The 
House then determines the conditions on which they may be 
discharged. Members who voluntarily appear are, unless the 
House otherwise directs, immediately admitted to the Hall of 
the House and they must report their names to the Clerk to be 
entered on the Journal as present. However, the former 
practice of presenting Members at the Bar of the House, 
during a call, is now obsolete, and Members now report to the 
Clerk and are recorded without being formally excused unless 
brought in under compulsion.<p>

 Whenever a quorum fails to vote on any question, and a 
quorum is not present and objection is made for that reason, 
there is a call of the House unless the House adjourns. The 
call is taken by electronic device unless the Speaker orders 
the call in the manner described in the preceding paragraph, 
and the Sergeant-at-Arms proceeds to bring in absent Members. 
The yeas and nays on the pending question are at the same 
time considered as ordered and an automatic rollcall vote is 
taken. The Clerk calls the roll and each Member who is 
present may vote on the pending question as the Member 
answers the roll. After the rollcall is completed, each 
Member, whose attendance was secured, is brought before the 
House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, where the Member's presence is 
noted. The Member then is given an opportunity to vote. If 
those voting on the question and those who are present and 
decline to vote together make a majority of the House, the 
Speaker declares that a quorum is constituted, and the 
pending question is decided according to the will of the 
majority of those voting. Further proceedings under the call 
are considered as dispensed with. At any time after the 
rollcall has been completed, the Speaker may entertain a 
motion to adjourn, if seconded by a majority of those present 
as ascertained by actual count by the Speaker; and if the 
House adjourns, all quorum call proceedings are vacated.<p>

 The rules prohibit points of no quorum (1) before or during 
the daily prayer, (2) during administration of the oath of 
office to the Speaker or any Member, (3) during the reception 
of messages from the President or the Senate, (4) in 
connection with motions incidental to a call of the House, 
and (5) against a vote in which the Committee of the Whole 
agrees to rise (but an appropriate point of no quorum would 
be permitted against a vote defeating a motion to rise). If 
the presence of a quorum has been established at least once 
on any day, further points of no quorum are prohibited (1) 
during the reading of the Journal, (2) between the time a 
Committee of the Whole rises and its Chairman reports, and 
(3) during the period on any legislative day when Members are 
addressing the House under special orders. The language 
prohibiting quorum calls "during any period" when Members are 
speaking under special orders includes the time between 
addresses delivered during this period as well as the 
addresses themselves. Furthermore, a quorum call is not in 
order when no business has intervened since the previous 
call. For the purposes of this provision, all the situations 
described above are not to be considered as "business".<p>

 The rules prohibit points of no quorum when a motion or 
proposition is pending in the House unless the Speaker has 
put the motion or proposition to a vote. However, the Speaker 
has the discretion to recognize a Member of the Speaker's 
choice to move a call of the House.<p>

 The first time the Committee of the Whole finds itself 
without a quorum during any day the Chairman is required to 
order the roll to be called by electronic device, unless the 
Chairman orders a call by naming clerks "to tell" the Members 
as described above. However, the Chairman may refuse to 
entertain a point of order that a quorum is not present 
during general debate. If on a call a quorum appears, the 
Committee continues its business. If a quorum does not 
appear, the Committee rises and the Chairman reports the 
names of the absentees to the House. The rules provide for 
the expeditious conduct of quorum calls in the Committee of 
the Whole. The Chairman may suspend a quorum call after 
determining that a bare or minimum quorum has been reached, 
that is, 100 or more Members. Under such a short quorum call 
the Committee will not rise, and therefore Members' names 
will not be published. Once the presence of a quorum of the 
Committee of the Whole has been established for the day, 
quorum calls in the Committee are only in order when the 
Committee is operating under the five-minute rule and the 
Chairman has put the pending motion or proposition to a vote.<p>

<b> VOTING</b><p>

 There are 4 methods of voting in the Committee of the Whole, 
that are also employed, together with an additional method, 
in the House. These are the voice vote (viva voce), the 
division, the teller vote, the recorded vote, and the yea-
and-nay vote that is used only in the House. If a Member 
objects to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not 
present in the House, there may be an automatic rollcall 
vote.<p>

 To obtain a voice vote the Chair states "As many as are in 
favor (as the question may be) say `Aye'." "As many as are 
opposed, say `No'.". The Chair determines the result on the 
basis of the volume of ayes and noes. This is the form in 
which the vote is ordinarily taken in the first instance.<p>

 If it is difficult to determine the result of a voice vote, 
a division may be demanded. The Chair then states that a 
division has been demanded and says "As many as are in favor 
will rise and stand until counted." After counting those in 
favor he calls on those opposed to stand and be counted, 
thereby determining the number in favor of and those opposed 
to the question.<p>

 If a demand for a teller vote is supported by one-fifth of a 
quorum (20 in the Committee of the Whole, and 44 in the 
House), the Chair appoints one or more tellers from each side 
and directs the Members in favor of the proposition to pass 
between the tellers and be counted. After counting, a teller 
announces the number in the affirmative, and the Chair then 
directs the Members opposed to pass between the tellers and 
be counted. When the count is stated by a teller, the Chair 
announces the result.<p>

 If any Member requests a recorded vote and that request is 
supported by at least one-fifth of a quorum of the House, or 
25 Members in the Committee of the Whole, the vote is taken 
by electronic device, unless the Speaker orders clerks "to 
tell", that is, record the names of those voting on each side 
of the question. After the recorded vote is concluded, the 
names of those voting together with those not voting are 
entered in the Journal. Members usually have 15 minutes to be 
counted from the time the recorded vote is ordered or the 
ordering of the clerks "to tell" the vote. The Speaker may 
reduce the period for voting to 5 minutes in certain 
situations.<p>

 In addition to the foregoing methods of voting, in the 
House, if the yeas and nays are demanded, the Speaker directs 
those in favor of taking the vote by that method to stand and 
be counted. The assent of one-fifth of the Members present 
(as distinguished from one-fifth of a quorum in the case of a 
demand for tellers) is necessary for ordering the yeas and 
nays. When the yeas and nays are ordered (or a point of order 
is made that a quorum is not present) the Speaker directs 
that as many as are in favor of the proposition will, as 
their names are called, answer "Aye"; as many as are opposed 
will answer "No". The Clerk calls the roll and reports the 
result to the Speaker who announces it to the House. The 
Speaker is not required to vote unless the Speaker's vote 
would be decisive.<p>

 The rules prohibit a Member from (1) casting another 
Member's vote or recording another Member's presence in the 
House or the Committee of the Whole or (2) authorizing 
another individual to cast a vote or record the Member's 
presence in the House or the Committee of the Whole.<p>

<b> ELECTRONIC VOTING</b><p>

 Recorded and rollcall votes are usually taken by electronic 
device, except when the Speaker orders the vote to be 
recorded by other methods prescribed by the rules of the 
House, and in emergency situations, such as, the failure of 
the electronic device to function. In addition, quorum calls 
are generally taken by electronic device. Essentially the 
system works as follows: A number of vote stations are 
attached to selected chairs in the Chamber. Each station is 
equipped with a vote card slot and 4 indicators, marked 
"yea", "nay", "present", and "open". The "open" indicator is 
used only when a vote period is in progress and the system is 
ready to accept votes. Each Member is provided with a 
personalized Vote 09ID Card. A Member votes by inserting the 
voting card into any one of the vote stations and depressing 
the appropriate push button to indicate the Member's choice. 
The machine records the votes and reports the result when the 
vote is completed. In the event the Member is without a Vote 
09ID Card, the Member may still vote by handing a paper 
ballot to the Tally Clerk, who may then record the vote 
electronically according to the indicated preference of the 
Member. The paper ballots are green for "yea", red for "nay", 
and amber for "present".<p>

<b> PAIRING OF MEMBERS</b><p>

 When a Member anticipates being unavoidably absent at the 
time a vote is to be taken, the Member may arrange in advance 
to be recorded as being either in favor of, or opposed to, 
the question by being "paired" with a Member who will also be 
absent and who holds contrary views on the question. A 
specific pair of this kind shows how the Member would have 
voted if present. Occasionally, a Member who has arranged in 
advance to be paired, actually is present at the time of 
voting. The Member then votes as if not paired, and 
subsequently withdraws that vote and asks to be marked 
"present" to protect the other Member. This is known as a 
"live pair". If the absence is to continue for several days 
during which a number of different questions are to be voted 
upon the Member may arrange a "general pair". A general pair 
does not indicate how the Member would have voted on the 
question, but merely that the paired Members would not have 
been on the same side of the question.<p>

 Pairs are not counted in determining the vote on the 
question, but, rather, provide an opportunity for absent 
Members to express formally how they would have voted had 
they been present. Pairs are announced by the Clerk of the 
House and are listed in the Congressional Record immediately 
after the names of those Members not voting on the question.<p>

 <b>SYSTEM OF LIGHTS AND BELLS</b><p>

 Because of the large number and the diversity of daily tasks 
that they have to perform it is not practicable for Members 
to be present in the House (or Senate) Chamber at every 
minute that the body is actually sitting. Furthermore, many 
of the routine matters do not require the personal attendance 
of all the Members. A legislative call system (consisting of 
electric lights and bells or buzzers located in various parts 
of the Capitol Building and of the House and Senate Office 
Buildings) alerts Members to certain occurrences in the House 
and Senate Chambers.<p>

 In the House, the Speaker has ordered that the bells and 
lights comprising the system be utilized as follows:<p>

 1 ring and 1 light on the left--Teller vote.<p>

 1 long ring followed by a pause and then 3 rings and 3 
lights on the left--Start or continuation of a notice or 
short quorum call in the Committee of the Whole that will be 
vacated if and when 100 Members appear on the floor. Bells 
are repeated every 5 minutes unless the call is vacated or 
the call is converted into a regular quorum call.<p>

 1 long ring and extinguishing of 3 lights on the left--Short 
or notice quorum call vacated.<p>

 2 rings and 2 lights on the left--Recorded vote, yea-and-nay 
vote or automatic rollcall vote by electronic device or by 
tellers with ballot cards. The bells are repeated 5 minutes 
after the first ring.<p>

 2 rings and 2 lights on the left followed by a pause and 
then 2 more rings--Automatic rollcall vote or yea-and-nay 
vote taken by a call of the roll in the House. The bells are 
repeated when the clerk reaches the R's in the first call of 
the roll.<p>

 2 rings followed by a pause and then 5 rings--First vote 
under Suspension of the Rules or on clustered votes. 2 bells 
are repeated 5 minutes after the first ring. The first vote 
will take 15 minutes with successive votes at intervals of 
not less than 5 minutes. Each successive vote is signaled by 
5 rings.<p>

 3 rings and 3 lights on the left--Regular quorum call in 
either the House or in the Committee of the Whole by 
electronic device or by clerks. The bells are repeated 5 
minutes after the first ring.<p>

 3 rings followed by a pause and then 3 more rings--Regular 
quorum call by a call of the roll. The bells are repeated 
when the Clerk reaches the R's in the first call of the roll.<p>

 3 rings followed by a pause and then 5 more rings--Quorum 
call in the Committee of the Whole that may be followed 
immediately by a five-minute recorded vote.<p>

 4 rings and 4 lights on the left--Adjournment of the House.<p>

 5 rings and 5 lights on the left--Any five-minute vote.<p>

 6 rings and 6 lights on the left--Recess of the House.<p>

 12 rings at 2-second intervals with 6 lights on the left--
Civil Defense Warning.<p>

 The 7th light indicates that the House is in session.<p>

<b> BROADCASTING LIVE COVERAGE OF FLOOR PROCEEDINGS</b><p>

 The rules of the House provide for unedited radio and 
television broadcasting and recording of proceedings on the 
floor of the House. However, the rules prohibit the use of 
these broadcasts and recordings for any political purpose or 
in any commercial advertisement. Likewise, the rules of the 
Senate provide for broadcasting and recording of proceedings 
in the Senate Chamber with similar restrictions.<p>

 
 XII. <a name="budget"><b>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET PROCESS</b></a><p>

  The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
l974 provides Congress with a procedure for establishing 
appropriate budget and revenue levels for each year. 
Essentially, the Congressional budget process involves 
"concurrent resolutions on the budget" that are passed each 
year.  These resolutions are designed to coordinate the 
revenue and spending decisions that the various legislative 
committees of Congress make in acting on measures within 
their respective jusrisdictions in order to provide fiscal 
discipline for Congress.<p>

 Congress must complete action on a concurrent resolution on 
the budget for the next fiscal year by April 15. This 
resolution sets levels of new budget authority and spending, 
revenue, and debt levels. However, Congress may adopt a later 
budget resolution that revises or reaffirms the most recently 
adopted budget resolution.<p>

 One of the mechanisms Congress uses to enforce projected 
budget authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels is 
called the reconciliation process. Under reconciliation, 
Congress in a budget resolution directs one or more of the 
legislative committees to determine and recommend changes in 
laws or bills that will achieve the levels set by the budget 
resolution. The directions to the committees specify the 
total amounts that must be changed but leaves to the 
discretion of the committees the changes that must be made to 
achieve the required levels.<p>

 If only one committee has been directed to recommend 
changes, that committee reports its reconciliation 
legislation directly to the floor for consideration by the 
whole House. How ever, if more than one committee has been 
directed to make changes, the committees report the 
recommended changes to the Committee on the Budget. The 
Committee then reports an omnibus reconciliation bill to the 
floor for consideration by the whole House. The Committee may 
not change the reconciliation legislation substantively.<p>

 When changes are to be made in legislation that already has 
been enacted or enrolled (for an explanation of enrollment, 
see Part XVII), the vehicle used is a reconciliation bill 
that is enacted in the same manner as any other bill. 
However, if changes are to be made in bills or resolutions 
that have not been enrolled yet, Congress enacts the changes 
in a concurrent resolution not requiring approval of the 
President. The concurrent resolution directs the Clerk of the 
House or the Secretary of the Senate to make the necessary 
changes in the bill or resolution as directed by the 
reconciliation resolution. Congress must complete action on a 
reconciliation bill or resolution by June 15 of each year.<p>

 Generally, after Congress has completed action on a 
concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, it is 
not in order to consider legislation that does not conform to 
the budget authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels 
set for that fiscal year.<p>

 In 1985, Congress enacted legislation establishing a 
procedure to gradually reduce the Federal deficit to zero. 
The current target date for a zero deficit is 1993. Under the 
new procedure, if the estimated deficit for a fiscal year 
exceeds the statutory level for that year, across-the-board 
cuts in the Federal budget (with certain exceptions) would go 
into effect automatically pursuant to order of the President.<p>

 
 XIII.<a name="message"><b> ENGROSSMENT AND MESSAGE TO SENATE</b></a><p>

  The preparation of a copy of the bill in the form in which 
it has passed the House is sometimes a detailed and 
complicated process because of the large number and 
complexity of amendments to some bills adopted by the House. 
Frequently these amendments are offered during a spirited 
debate with little or no prior formal preparation. The 
amendment may be for the purpose of inserting new language, 
substituting different words for those set out in the bill, 
or deleting portions of the bill. It is not unusual to have 
more than 100 amendments, including those proposed by the 
committee at the time the bill is reported and those offered 
from the floor during the consideration of the bill in the 
Chamber. Some of the amendments offered from the floor are 
written in longhand and others are typewritten. Each 
amendment must be inserted in precisely the proper place in 
the bill, with the spelling and punctuation exactly the same 
as it was adopted by the House. Obviously, it is extremely 
important that the Senate receive a copy of the bill in the 
precise form in which it has passed the House. The 
preparation of such a copy is the function of the enrolling 
clerk.<p>

 There is an enrolling clerk in each House. In the House, the 
enrolling clerk is under the Clerk of the House. In the 
Senate, the enrolling clerk is under the Secretary of the 
Senate. The enrolling clerk receives all the papers relating 
to the bill, including the official Clerk's copy of the bill 
as reported by the standing committee and each amendment 
adopted by the House. From this material the enrolling clerk 
prepares the engrossed copy of the bill as passed, containing 
all the amendments agreed to by the House. At this point, the 
measureceases technically to be called a bill and is termed 
"an act signifying that it is the act of one body of the 
Congress, although it is still popularly referred to as a 
bill. The engrossed bill is printed on blue paper and a 
certificate that it passed the House of Representatives is 
signed by the Clerk of the House. The engrossed bill is 
delivered by a reading clerk to the Senate, while that body 
is actually sitting, in a rather formal ceremonious manner 
befitting the dignity of both Houses. The reading clerk is 
escorted into the Chamber by the Secretary or another officer 
of the Senate and on being recognized by the Presiding 
Officer of the Senate states that the House has passed the 
bill, giving its number and title, and requests the 
concurrence of the Senate.<p>

 
 XIV. <a name="senate"><b>SENATE ACTION</b></a><p>

  The Presiding Officer of the Senate refers the engrossed 
bill to the appropriate standing committee of the Senate in 
conformity with the rules of the Senate. The bill is 
reprinted immediately and copies are made available in the 
document rooms of both Houses. This printing is known as the 
"Act print" or the "Senate referred print".<p>

 <b>COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION</b><p>

 Senate committees give the bill the same kind of detailed 
consideration as it received in the House, and may report it 
with or without amendment or "table" it. A committee Member 
who wishes to express an individual view, or a group of 
Members who wish to file a minority report, may do so, by 
giving notice, at the time of the approval of the measure, of 
an intention to file supplemental, minority or additional 
views, in which event those views may be filed within 3 days 
with the clerk of the committee and they become a part of the 
report.<p>

 When a committee reports a bill, it is reprinted with the 
committee amendments indicated by showing new matter in 
italics and deleted matter in line-through type. The calendar 
number and report number are indicated on the first and back 
pages, together with the name of the Senator making the 
report. The committee report and any minority or individual 
views accompanying the bill also are printed at the same 
time. Any Senator may enter a motion to discharge a committee 
from further consideration of a bill that it has failed to 
report after what is deemed to be a reasonable time. If the 
motion is agreed to by a majority vote, the committee is 
discharged and the bill is placed on the Calendar of Business 
under the rules of the Senate.<p>

 All committee meetings, including those to conduct hearings, 
must be open to the public. However, a majority of the 
Members of a committee or subcommittee may, after discussion 
in closed session, vote in open session to close a meeting or 
series of meetings on the same subject for no longer than 14 
days if it is determined that the matters to be discussed or 
testimony to be taken will disclose matters necessary to be 
kept secret in the interests of national defense or the 
confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the United 
States; will relate solely to internal committee staff 
management or procedure; will tend to charge an individual 
with a crime or misconduct, to disgrace or injure the 
professional standing of an individual, or otherwise to 
expose an individual to public contempt, or will represent a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual; 
will disclose law enforcement information that is required to 
be kept secret; will disclose certain information regarding 
certain trade secrets; or may disclose matters required to be 
kept confidential under other provisions of law or Government 
regulation.<p>

 <b>CHAMBER PROCEDURE</b><p>

 The rules of procedure in the Senate differ to a large 
extent from those in the House. The Senate relies heavily on 
the practice of obtaining unanimous consent for actions to be 
taken. For example, at the time that a bill is reported, the 
Senator who is making the report may ask unanimous consent 
for the immediate consideration of the bill. If the bill is 
of a noncontroversial nature and there is no objection, the 
Senate may pass the bill with little or no debate and with 
only a brief explanation of its purpose and effect. Even in 
this instance the bill is subject to amendment by any 
Senator. A simple majority vote is necessary to carry an 
amendment as well as to pass the bill. If there is any 
objection, the report must lie over one day and the bill is 
placed on the calendar.<p>

 Measures reported by standing committees of the Senate may 
not be considered unless the report of that committee has 
been available to Senate Members for at least 2 days 
(excluding Sundays and legal holidays) prior to consideration 
of the measure in the Senate. This requirement, however, may 
be waived by agreement of the majority and minority leaders 
and does not apply in certain emergency situations.<p>

 In the Senate, measures are brought up for consideration by 
a simple unanimous consent request, by a complex unanimous 
consent agreement, by a motion to proceed to the 
consideration of a measure, or by a motion to consider a 
measure on the calendar. A unanimous consent agreement, 
sometimes referred to as a "time agreement", makes the 
consideration of a measure in order and often limits the 
amount of debate that will take place on the measure and 
lists the amendments that will be considered. The offering of 
a unanimous consent request to consider a measure or the 
offering of a motion to proceed to the consideration of a 
measure is reserved, by tradition, to the majority leader.<p>

 Usually a motion to consider a measure on the calendar is 
made only when unanimous consent to consider the measure 
cannot be obtained. There is only one Calendar of Business in 
the Senate, there being no differentiation, as there is in 
the House, between (1) bills raising revenue, general 
appropriation bills, and bills of a public character 
appropriating money or property, and (2) other bills of a 
public character not appropriating money or property.<p>

 The rules of the Senate provide that at the conclusion of 
the morning business for each "legislative day" the Senate 
proceeds to the consideration of the calendar. In the Senate, 
the term "legislative day" means the period of time from when 
the Senate adjourns until the next time the Senate adjourns. 
Because the Senate often "recesses" rather than "adjourns" at 
the end of a daily session, the "legislative day" usually 
does not correspond to the 24-hour period comprising a 
calendar day. Thus, a "legislative day" may cover a long 
period of time--from days to weeks, or even months. Because 
of this and the modern practice of waiving the call of the 
calendar by unanimous consent at the start of a new 
"legislative day", it is rare to have a call of the calendar. 
When the calendar is called, bills that are not objected to 
are taken up in their order, and each Senator is entitled to 
speak once and for 5 minutes only on any question. Objection 
may be interposed at any stage of the proceedings, but on 
motion the Senate may continue consideration after the call 
of the calendar is completed, and the limitations on debate 
then do not apply.<p>

 On any day (other than a Monday that begins a new 
"legislative day"), following the announcement of the close 
of morning business, any Senator obtaining recognition may 
move to take up any bill out of its regular order on the 
calendar. Usually, this is the majority leader. The five-
minute limitation on debate does not apply to the 
consideration of a bill taken up in this manner, and debate 
may continue until the hour when the Presiding Officer of the 
Senate "lays down" the un finished business of the day. At 
that point consideration of the bill is discontinued and the 
measure reverts back to the Calendar of Business and may 
again be called up at another time under the same conditions.<p>

 When a bill has been objected to and passed over on the call 
of the calendar it is not necessarily lost. The majority 
leader, after consulting the majority policy committee of the 
Senate and the minority leadership, determines the time at 
which the bill will be called up for debate. At that time, a 
motion is made to consider the bill. The motion is debatable 
if made after the morning hour.<p>

 Once a Senator is recognized by the Presiding Officer, the 
Senator may speak for as long as the Senator wishes and loses 
the floor only when the Senator yields it or takes certain 
parliamentary actions that forfeit the Senator's right to the 
floor. How ever, a Senator may not speak more than twice on 
any one question in debate on the same legislative day 
without leave of the Senate. Debate ends when a Senator 
yields the floor and no other Senator seeks recognition, or 
when a unanimous consent agreement limiting the time of 
debate is operating.<p>

 On occasion, Senators opposed to a measure may extend debate 
by making lengthy speeches intended to prevent or defeat 
action on the measure. This is the tactic known as 
"filibustering". Debate, however, may be closed if 16 
Senators sign a motion to that effect and the motion is 
carried by three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and 
sworn. Such a motion is voted on without debate on the second 
day after the day it is filed. This procedure is called 
"invoking cloture". In 1986, the Senate amended its rules to 
limit "post-cloture" debate to 30 hours. A Senator may speak 
for not more than one hour and may yield all or a part of 
that time to the majority or minority floor managers of the 
bill under consideration or to the majority or minority 
leader. The Senate may increase the time for "post-cloture" 
debate by a vote of three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen 
and sworn. After the time for debate has expired, the Senate 
may consider certain amendments before voting on the bill.<p>

 While a measure is being considered it is subject to 
amendment and each amendment, including those proposed by the 
committee that reported the bill, is considered separately. 
Generally, there is no requirement that proposed amendments 
be germane to the subject matter of the bill except in the 
case of general appropriation bills. Under the rules, a 
"rider" (an amendment proposing substantive legislation to an 
appropriation bill) is prohibited, but this prohibition may 
be suspended by two-thirds vote on a motion to permit 
consideration of such an amendment on one day's notice in 
writing. Debate on the measure must be germane during the 
first 3 hours after the morning hour unless determined to the 
contrary by unanimous consent or on motion without debate. 
After final action on the amendments the bill is ready for 
engrossment and the third reading, which is usually by title 
only, although if demanded, it must be read in full. The 
Presiding Officer then puts the question on the passage and a 
voice vote (viva voce) is usually taken although a yea-and-
nay vote is in order if demanded by one-fifth of the Senators 
present. A simple majority is necessary for passage. Before 
an amended measure is cleared for its return to the House of 
Representatives (or an unamended measure is cleared for 
enrollment), a Senator who voted with the prevailing side, or 
who abstained from voting, may make a motion within the next 
2 days to reconsider the action. If the measure was passed 
without a recorded vote, any Senator may make the motion to 
reconsider. That motion is usually tabled and its tabling 
constitutes a final determination. If, however, the motion is 
granted, the Senate, by majority vote, may either affirm its 
action, which then becomes final, or reverse it.<p>

 The original engrossed House bill, together with the 
engrossed Senate amendments, if any, is then returned to the 
House with a message stating the action taken by the Senate. 
Where amendments have been made by the Senate the message 
requests that the House concur in them.<p>

Senate Document No. 97-20 of the 97th Congress, second 
session, Enactment of a Law, by Robert B. Dove, then 
Parliamentarian of the Senate.<p>

 
 XV. <a name="final"><b> FINAL ACTION ON AMENDED BILLS</b></a><p>

  On their return to the House the official papers relating 
to the amended measure are placed on the Speaker's table to 
await House action on the Senate amendments. If the 
amendments are of a minor or noncontroversial nature the 
Chairman of the committee that originally reported the bill--
or any Member--may, at the direction of the committee, ask 
unanimous consent to take the bill with the amendments from 
the Speaker's table and agree to the Senate amendments. At 
this point the Clerk reads the title of the bill and the 
Senate amendments. If there is no objection, the amendments 
are then declared to be agreed to, and the bill is ready to 
be enrolled for presentation to the President. Lacking 
unanimous consent, bills that do not require consideration in 
the Committee of the Whole are privileged and may be called 
up from the Speaker's table by motion for immediate 
consideration of the amendments. A simple majority is 
necessary to carry the motion and thereby complete floor 
action on the measure. A Senate amendment to a House bill is 
subject to a point of order that it must first be considered 
in the Committee of the Whole, if, originating in the House, 
it would be subject to that point.<p>

<b> REQUEST FOR A CONFERENCE</b><p>

 If, however, the amendments are substantial or controversial 
the Member may request unanimous consent to take the bill 
with the Senate amendments from the Speaker's table, disagree 
to the amendments and request a conference with the Senate to 
resolve the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses. If there is 
objection it becomes necessary to obtain a special resolution 
from the Committee on Rules. However, the Speaker may 
recognize a Member for a motion, authorized by the committee 
having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, to 
disagree to the amendments and ask for a conference. If there 
is no objection to the request, or if the motion is carried, 
the Speaker then appoints the managers (as the conferees are 
called) on the part of the House and a message is sent to the 
Senate advising it of the House action. A majority of the 
Members appointed to be managers must have been supporters of 
the House position, as determined by the Speaker. The Speaker 
must name Members primarily responsible for the legislation 
and must include, to the fullest extent feasible, the 
principal proponents of the major provisions of the bill as 
it passed the House. The Speaker usually follows the 
suggestions of the Chairman of the committee in charge of the 
bill in designating the managers on the part of the House 
from among the Members of the committee. The number is fixed 
by the Speaker and majority party representation generally 
reflects the ratio for the full House committee, but may be 
greater on important bills. Representation of both major 
parties is an important attribute of all our parliamentary 
procedures but, in the case of conference committees, it is 
important that the views of the House on the House measure be 
fully repre sented.<p>

 If the Senate agrees to the request for a conference, a 
similar committee is appointed by unanimous consent by the 
Presiding Officer of the Senate. Both political parties may 
be represented on the Senate conference committee also. The 
Senate and House committees need not be the same size.<p>

 The conference committee is sometimes popularly referred to 
as the "Third House of Congress".<p>

 The request for a conference can be made only by the body in 
possession of the official papers. Occasionally the Senate, 
anticipating that the House will not concur in its 
amendments, votes to insist on its amendments and requests a 
conference on passage of the bill prior to returning the bill 
to the House. This practice serves to expedite the matter 
because several days' time may be saved by the designation of 
the Senate conferees before returning the bill to the House. 
The matter of which body requests the conference is not 
without significance because the one asking for the 
conference acts last on the report to be submitted by the  
conferees.<p>

<b> AUTHORITY OF CONFEREES</b><p>

 Although the managers on the part of each House meet 
together as one committee they are in effect 2 separate 
committees, each of which votes separately and acts by a 
majority vote. For this reason the number of managers from 
each House is largely immaterial.<p>

 The conferees are strictly limited in their consideration to 
matters in disagreement between the 2 Houses. Consequently, 
they may not strike out or amend any portion of the bill that 
was not amended by the Senate. Furthermore, they may not 
insert new matter that is not germane to the differences 
between the 2 Houses. Where the Senate amendment revises a 
figure or an amount contained in the bill, the conferees are 
limited to the difference between the 2 numbers and may not 
increase the greater nor decrease the smaller figure. Neither 
House may alone, by instructions, empower its managers to 
make a change in the text to which both Houses have agreed, 
but the managers for both bodies may be given that authority 
by a concurrent resolution adopted by a majority of each 
House.<p>

 When a disagreement to an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute is committed to a conference committee it is in 
order for the managers on the part of the House to propose a 
substitute which is a germane modification of the matter in 
disagreement, but the introduction of language in that 
substitute presenting a specific additional topic, question, 
issue, or proposition not committed to the conference 
committee by either House does not constitute a germane 
modification of the matter in disagreement. Moreover, their 
report may not include matter not committed to the conference 
committee by either House, nor may their report include a 
modification of any specific topic, question, issue, or 
proposition committed to the conference committee by either 
or both Houses if that modification is beyond the scope of 
that specific topic, question, issue, or proposition as 
committed to the conference committee.<p>

 An amendment by the Senate to a general appropriation bill 
which would be in violation of the rules of the House, if the 
amendment had originated in the House, or an amendment by the 
Senate providing for an appropriation on a bill other than a 
general appropriation bill, may not be agreed to by the 
managers on the part of the House, unless a specific 
authority to agree to such an amendment is given first by the 
House by a separate vote on each specific amendment.<p>

<b> MEETINGS AND ACTION OF CONFEREES</b><p>

 The rules of the House require that conference meetings be 
open, unless the House, in open session, determines by a 
rollcall vote of a majority of those Members voting that all 
or part of the meeting will be closed to the public. When the 
report of the conference committee is read in the House, a 
point of order may be made that the conferees failed to 
comply with the House rule referred to in the preceding 
sentence. If the point of order is sustained, the conference 
report is considered rejected by the House and a new 
conference is  requested.<p>

 There are generally 4 forms of recommendations available to 
the conferees when reporting back to their bodies:<p>

 (1) The Senate recede from all (or certain of) its 
amendments.<p>

 (2) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or 
certain of) the Senate amendments and agree thereto.<p>

 (3) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or 
certain of) the Senate amendments and agree thereto with 
amendments.<p>

 (4) The House recede from all (or certain of) its amendments 
to the Senate amendments.<p>

 In many instances the result of the conference is a 
compromise growing out of the third type of recommendation 
available to the conferees. The complete report may, of 
course, be comprised of any one or more of these 
recommendations with respect to the various amendments. 
Occasionally, the conferees find themselves unable to reach 
an agreement with respect to one or more amendments and 
report back a statement of their inability to agree on those 
particular amendments. These may then be acted upon 
separately. This partial disagreement is, of course, not 
practicable where the Senate strikes out all after the 
enacting clause and substitutes its own bill which must be 
considered as a single amendment.<p>

 If they are unable to reach any agreement whatsoever, the 
conferees report that fact to their respective bodies and the 
amendments are in the position they were before the 
conference was requested. New conferees may be appointed in 
either or both Houses. In addition, the Houses may instruct 
the conferees as to the position they are to take.<p>

 After House conferees on any bill or resolution in 
conference between the 2 bodies have been appointed for 20 
calendar days and have failed to make a report, the rules of 
the House provide for a motion of the highest privilege to 
instruct the House conferees or discharge them and appoint 
new conferees. Further, during the last 6 days of a session 
it is a privileged motion to move to discharge, appoint, or 
instruct House conferees after House conferees have been 
appointed 36 hours without having made a report.<p>

<b>CONFERENCE REPORTS</b><p>

 When the conferees, by majority vote of each group, have 
reached complete agreement (or find that they are able to 
agree with respect to some but not all amendments) they make 
their recommendations in a report made in duplicate that must 
be signed by a majority of the conferees appointed by each 
body. The minority portion of the managers have no authority 
to file a statement of minority views in connection with the 
report. The report is required to be printed in both Houses 
and must be accompanied by an explanatory statement prepared 
jointly by the conferees on the part of the House and the 
conferees on the part of the Senate. The statement must be 
sufficiently detailed and explicit to inform Congress as to 
the effect that the amendments or propositions contained in 
the report will have on the measure to which those amendments 
or propositions relate. The engrossed bill and amendments and 
one copy of the report are delivered to the body that is to 
act first on the report; namely, the body that had agreed to 
the conference requested by the other.<p>

 In the Senate, the presentation of the report always is in 
order except when the Journal is being read or a point of 
order or motion to adjourn is pending, or while the Senate is 
voting or ascertaining the presence of a quorum. When the 
report is received, the question of proceeding to the 
consideration of the report, if raised, is immediately voted 
on without debate. The report is not subject to amendment in 
either body and must be accepted or rejected as an entirety. 
If the time for debate on the adoption of the report is 
limited, the time allotted must be equally divided between 
the majority and minority party. If the Senate, acting first, 
does not agree to the report it may by majority vote order it 
recommitted to the conferees. When the Senate agrees to the 
report, its managers are thereby discharged and it then 
delivers the original papers to the House with a message 
advising that body of its action.<p>

 A report that contains any recommendations which go beyond 
the differences between the 2 Houses is subject to a point of 
order in its entirety. Any change in the text as agreed to by 
both Houses renders the report subject to the point of order 
and the matter is before the House de novo.<p>

 The presentation of the report in the House always is in 
order, except when the Journal is being read, while the roll 
is being called, or the House is dividing on any proposition. 
The report is considered in the House and may not be sent to 
the Committee of the Whole on the suggestion that it contains 
matters ordinarily requiring consideration in that Committee. 
The report may not be received by the House if the required 
statement does not accompany it.<p>

 It is, however, not in order to consider either (1) a 
conference report or (2) an amendment (including an amendment 
in the nature of a substitute) proposed by the Senate to a 
measure reported in disagreement between the 2 Houses, by a 
conference report, that the conferees have been unable to 
agree, until the third calendar day (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal holidays) after the report and 
accompanying statement have been filed in the House, and 
consideration then is in order only if the report and 
accompanying statement have been printed in the edition of 
the Congressional Record for the day on which the report and 
statement have been filed. However, these provisions do not 
apply during the last 6 days of the session. Nor is it in 
order to consider a conference report or such an amendment 
unless copies of the report and accompanying statement, 
together with the text of the amendment, have been available 
to Members for at least 2 hours before the beginning of 
consideration. However, it is always in order to call up for 
consideration a report from the Committee on Rules only 
making in order the consideration of a conference report or 
such an amendment notwithstanding the requirement that the 
report and text of the amendment be available for at least 2 
hours before the beginning of consideration. The time 
allotted for debate on a conference report or such an 
amendment is divided equally between the majority party and 
the minority party. However, if the majority and minority 
floor managers both are supporters of the conference report, 
one-third of the debate time must be allotted to a Member who 
is opposed to the conference report. If the House does not 
agree to a conference report that the Senate has already 
agreed to, the report may not be recommitted to conference 
because the Senate conferees are discharged when the Senate 
agrees to the report.<p>

 When a conference report is called up before the House 
containing matter which would be in violation of the rules of 
the House with respect to germaneness if the matter had been 
offered as an amendment in the House, and which is contained 
either (1) in a Senate amendment to that measure (including a 
Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute for the text 
of that measure as passed by the House) and accepted by the 
House conferees or agreed to by the conference committee with 
modification or (2) in a substitute agreed to by the 
conference committee, it is in order, at any time after the 
reading of the report is completed or dispensed with and 
before the reading of the statement, to make a point of order 
that nongermane matter, which must be specified in the point 
of order, is contained in the report. It is also in order to 
make a point of order to nongermane Senate matter in the 
conference report that originally appeared in the Senate bill 
but was not included in the House-passed version. If the 
point of order is sustained, it is then in order for the 
Chair to entertain a motion, that is of high privilege, that 
the House reject the nongermane matter covered by the point 
of order. It is in order to debate the motion for 40 minutes, 
one-half of the time to be given to debate in favor of, and 
one-half in opposition to, the motion. Notwithstanding the 
final disposition of a point of order made with respect to 
the report, or of a motion to reject nongermane matter, 
further points of order may be made with respect to the 
report, and further motions may be made to reject other 
nongermane matter in the conference report not covered by any 
previous point of order which has been sustained. If a motion 
to reject has been adopted, after final disposition of all 
points of order and motions to reject, the conference report 
is considered as rejected and the question then pending 
before the House is whether (1) to recede and concur with an 
amendment that consists of that portion of the conference 
report not rejected or (2) to insist on the House amendment 
with respect to nongermane Senate matter that originally 
appeared in the Senate bill but was not included in the 
House-passed version. If all motions to reject are defeated, 
then, after the allocation of time for debate on the 
conference report, it is in order to move the previous 
question on the adoption of the conference report.<p>

 Similar procedures are available in the House when the 
Senate proposes an amendment to a measure that would be in 
violation of the rule against nongermane amendments, and 
thereafter it is (1) reported in disagreement by a committee 
of conference or (2) before the House and the stage of 
disagreement is reached.<p>

 The amendments of the Senate in disagreement may be voted on 
separately and may be adopted by a majority vote after the 
adoption of the conference report itself as though no 
conference had been had with respect to those amendments. The 
Senate may recede from all amendments, or from certain of its 
amendments, insisting on the others with or without a request 
for a conference with respect to them. If the House does not 
accept the amendments insisted on by the Senate the entire 
conference process begins again with respect to them.<p>

<b> CUSTODY OF PAPERS</b><p>

 The custody of the original official papers is important in 
conference procedure because either body may act only when in 
possession of the papers. As indicated above the request for 
a conference may be made only by the body in possession. The 
papers are then transmitted to the body agreeing to the 
conference and by it to the managers of the House that asked 
for the conference. The latter in turn carry the papers with 
them to the conference and at its conclusion turn them over 
to the managers of the House that agreed to the conference. 
The latter deliver them to their own House, that acts first 
on the report and then delivers the papers to the other House 
for final action on the report.<p>

 Each group of conferees, at the conclusion of the 
conference, retains one copy of the report that has been made 
in duplicate, and signed by a majority of the managers of 
each body--the House copy signed first by the House managers 
and the Senate copy signed first by its managers.<p>

 Obviously a bill cannot become a law of the land until it 
has been approved in identical terms by both Houses of the 
Congress. When the bill has finally been approved by both 
Houses all the original papers are transmitted to the 
enrolling clerk of the body in which the bill originated.<p>

 
 XVI. <a name="bill"><b> BILL ORIGINATING IN SENATE</b></a><p>

  The preceding discussion has described the legislative 
process for bills originating in the House. When a bill 
originates in the Senate, this process is reversed. When the 
Senate passes a bill that originated in the Senate, it is 
sent to the House for consideration. The bill is referred to 
the appropriate House committee for consideration. If the 
committee reports the bill to the full House and if the bill 
is passed by the House without amendment, it is ready for 
enrollment. (See Part XVII.) If the House passes an amended 
version of the Senate bill, the bill is returned to the 
Senate for action on the House amendments. The Senate may 
agree to the amendments or request a conference to resolve 
the disagreement over the House amendments.<p>

 
 XVII. <a name="enrollment"><b>ENROLLMENT</b></a><p>

  When the bill has been agreed to in identical form by both 
bodies--either without amendment by the Senate, or by House 
concurrence in the Senate amendments, or by agreement in both 
bodies to the conference report--a copy of the bill is 
enrolled for presentation to the President.<p>

 The preparation of the enrolled bill is a painstaking and 
important task because it must reflect precisely the effect 
of all amendments, either by way of deletion, substitution, 
or addition, agreed to by both bodies. The enrolling clerk of 
the House (with respect to bills originating in the House) 
receives the original engrossed bill, the engrossed Senate 
amendments, the signed conference report, the several 
messages from the Senate, and a notation of the final action 
by the House, for the purpose of preparing the enrolled copy. 
From these the enrolling clerk must prepare meticulously the 
final form of the bill, as it was agreed to by both Houses, 
for presentation to the President. On occasion there have 
been upward of 500 amendments, particularly after a 
conference, each of which must be set out in the enrollment 
exactly as agreed to, and all punctuation must be in accord 
with the action taken.<p>

 The enrolled bill is printed on parchment paper, with a 
certificate on the reverse side of the last page, to be 
signed by the Clerk of the House stating that the bill 
originated in the House of Representatives (or by the 
Secretary of the Senate when the bill has originated in that 
body). It is examined for accuracy by the Committee on House 
Administration (or by the Secretary of the Senate when the 
bill originated in that body). When the Committee is 
satisfied with the accuracy of the bill the Chairman of the 
Committee attaches a slip stating that it finds the bill 
truly enrolled and sends it to the Speaker of the House for 
signature. All bills, regardless of the body in which they 
originated, are signed first by the Speaker and then by the 
Vice President of the United States, who, under the 
Constitution, serves as the President of the Senate. The 
Speaker of the House may sign enrolled bills whether or not 
the House is in session. The President of the Senate may sign 
bills only while the Senate is actually sitting unless 
advance permission is granted to sign during a recess or 
after adjournment. If the Speaker or the President of the 
Senate is unable to sign the bill, it may be signed by the 
authorized presiding officer of the respective House. After 
both signatures are affixed the bill is returned to the 
Committee for the purpose of being presented to the President 
for action under the Constitution.<p>

 
 XVIII. <a name="presidential"><b> PRESIDENTIAL ACTION</b></a><p>

  Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution provides in part 
that--<p>

 Every Bill which shall have passed the House of 
Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a 
Law, be presented to the President of the United States.<p>

 
 In actual practice a clerk of the Committee on House 
Administration (or the Secretary of the Senate when the bill 
originated in that body) delivers the original enrolled bill 
to an employee at the White House and obtains a receipt, and 
the fact of the delivery is then reported to the House by the 
Chairman of the Committee. Delivery to a White House employee 
has customarily been regarded as presentation to the 
President and as commencing the 10-day Constitutional period 
for Presidential action.<p>

 Copies of the enrolled bill usually are transmitted by the 
White House to the various departments interested in the 
subject matter so that they may advise the President who, of 
course, cannot be personally familiar with every item in 
every bill.<p>

 If the President approves the bill, he signs it and usually 
writes the word "approved" and the date, although the 
Constitution requires only that the President sign it.<p>

 The Supreme Court has stated that undoubtedly the President 
when approving bills may be said to participate in the 
enactment of laws, which the Constitution requires the 
President to execute.<p>

 The bill may become law without the President's signature by 
virtue of the Constitutional provision that if the President 
does not return a bill with objections within 10 days 
(excluding Sundays) after it has been presented to the 
President, it shall be a law in like manner as if the 
President had signed it. However, if Congress by their 
adjournment prevent its return, it does not become law. The 
latter event is what is known as a "pocket veto", that is, 
the bill does not become law even though the President has 
not sent his objections to the Congress.<p>

 Notice of the signing of a bill by the President is sent 
usually by message to the House in which it originated and 
that House informs the other, although this action is not 
necessary to the validity of the act. The action is also 
noted in the Congressional Record.<p>

 A bill becomes law on the date of approval (or passage over 
the President's veto), unless it expressly provides a 
different effective date.<p>

<b> VETO MESSAGE</b><p>

 By the terms of the Constitution, if the President does not 
approve the bill "he shall return it, with his Objections to 
that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter 
the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to 
reconsider it". It is the usual but not invariable rule that 
a bill returned with the President's objections, must be 
voted on at once and when laid before the House the question 
on the passage is considered as pending. A vetoed bill is 
always privileged, and a motion to take it from the table is 
in order at any time.<p>

 The Member in charge moves the previous question which is 
put by the Speaker, as follows: "The question is, Will the 
House on reconsideration agree to pass the bill, the 
objections of the President to the contrary 
notwithstanding?". The Clerk calls the roll and those in 
favor of passing the bill answer "Aye", and those opposed 
"No". If fewer than two-thirds of the Members present 
(constituting a quorum) vote in the affirmative the bill is 
killed, and a message is usually sent to the Senate advising 
that body of the decision that the bill shall not pass. If, 
however, two-thirds vote in the affirmative, the bill is sent 
with the President's objections to the Senate together with a 
message advising it of the action in the House.<p>

 There is a similar procedure in the Senate where again a 
two-thirds affirmative vote is necessary to pass the bill 
over the President's objections. If then passed by the Senate 
the measure becomes the law of the land notwithstanding the 
objections of the President, and it is ready for publication 
as a binding statute.<p>

 
 XIX. <a name="publication"><b> PUBLICATION</b></a><p>

  One of the important steps in the enactment of a valid law 
is the requirement that it shall be made known to the people 
who are to be bound by it. Obviously, there would be no 
justice if the state were to hold its people responsible for 
their conduct before it made known to them the unlawfulness 
of such behavior. That idea is implicit in the Constitutional 
prohibition against enacting ex post facto laws. In practice, 
our laws are published immediately upon their enactment so 
that they may be known to the people.<p>

 If the President approves a bill, or allows it to become law 
without signing it, the original enrolled bill is sent from 
the White House to the Archivist of the United States for 
publication. If a bill is passed by both Houses over the 
objections of the President the body that last overrides the 
veto likewise transmits it. There it is assigned a public law 
number, and paginated for the Statutes at Large volume 
covering that session of Congress. The public and private law 
numbers run in sequence starting anew at the beginning of 
each Congress, and since 1957 are prefixed for ready 
identification by the number of the Congress--that is, the 
first public law of the 101st Congress is designated Public 
Law 101-1 and the first private law of the 101st Congress is 
designated Private Law 101-1. Subsequent laws of this 
Congress also will contain the same prefix designator.<p>

 <b>SLIP LAWS</b><p>

 The first official publication of the statute is in the form 
generally known as the "slip law". In this form, each law is 
published separately as an unbound pamphlet. The heading 
indicates the public or private law number, the date of 
approval, and the bill number. The heading of a slip law for 
a public law also indicates the United States Statutes at 
Large citation. If the statute has been passed over the veto 
of the President, or has become law without the President's 
signature because he did not return it with objections, an 
appropriate statement is inserted in lieu of the usual 
notation of approval.<p>

 The Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, which prepares the slip laws, 
provides marginal editorial notes giving the citations to 
laws mentioned in the text and other explanatory details. The 
marginal notes also give the United States Code 
classifications, thus enabling the reader immediately to 
determine where the statute will appear in the Code. Each 
slip law also includes an informative guide to the 
legislative history of the law consisting of the committee 
report number, the name of the committee in each House, as 
well as the date of consideration and passage in each House, 
with a reference to the Congressional Record by volume, year, 
and date. A reference to Presidential statements--relating to 
the approval of a bill (or the veto of a bill when the veto 
was overridden and the bill becomes law)--is included in the 
legislative history in the form of a citation to the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents.<p>

 Copies of the slip laws are delivered to the document rooms 
of both Houses where they become available to officials and 
the public. They may also be obtained by annual subscription 
or individual purchase from the Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing Office.<p>

 Section 113 of title 1 of the United States Code provides 
that slip laws are competent evidence in all the courts, 
tribunals and public offices of the United States, and of the 
several States.<p>

 <b>STATUTES AT LARGE</b><p>

 For the purpose of providing a permanent collection of the 
laws of each session of Congress, the bound volumes (which 
are called the United States Statutes at Large) are prepared 
by the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration. When the latest volume containing the 
laws of the first session of the 101st Congress becomes 
available it will be No. 103 in the series. Each volume 
contains a complete index and a table of contents. From 1956 
through 1976, each volume contained a table of earlier laws 
affected. These tables were cumulated for 1956-1970 and 
supplemented for 1971-1975 in pamphlet form, and discontinued 
in 1976. From 1963 through 1974, each volume also contained a 
most useful table showing the legislative history of each law 
in the volume. This latter table was not included in 
subsequent volumes because, beginning in 1975, the 
legislative histories have appeared at the end of each law. 
There are also extensive marginal notes referring to laws in 
earlier volumes and to earlier and later matters in the same 
volume.<p>

 Under the provisions of a statute originally enacted in 
1895, these volumes are legal evidence of the laws contained 
in them and will be accepted as proof of those laws in any 
court in the United States.<p>

 The Statutes at Large are a chronological arrangement of the 
laws exactly as they have been enacted. There is no attempt 
to arrange the laws according to their subject matter or to 
show the present status of an earlier law that has been 
amended on one or more occasions. That is the function of a 
code of laws.<p>

<b> UNITED STATES CODE</b><p>

 The United States Code contains a consolidation and 
codification of the general and permanent laws of the United 
States arranged according to subject matter under 50 title 
headings, in alphabetical order to a large degree. It sets 
out the current status of the laws, as amended, without 
repeating all the language of the amendatory acts except 
where necessary for that purpose and is declared to be prima 
facie evidence of those laws. Its purpose is to present the 
laws in a concise and usable form without requiring recourse 
to the many volumes of the Statutes at Large containing the 
individual amendments.<p>

 The Code is prepared by the Law Revision Counsel of the 
House of Representatives. New editions are published every 6 
years and cumulative supplements are published after the 
conclusion of each regular session of the Congress.<p>

 Twenty-two of the 50 titles have been revised and enacted 
into positive law, and 2 have been eliminated by 
consolidation with other titles. Titles that have been 
revised and enacted into positive law are legal evidence of 
the law and the courts will receive them as proof of those 
laws. Eventually all the titles will be revised and enacted 
into positive law, and thereafter they will be kept up to 
date by direct amendment.<p>

<H1>The U.S. House of Representatives<BR>
The Legislative Process - Tying it All Together</H1>
<br>
<I>Prepared by U.S. House of Representatives Information Systems.</I>
<HR>
<DL> 
<DD>  "All Legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a
  Senate and House of Representatives."<BR>
  (Article I, Section 1, of the <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html">United States Constitution</A>)
</DL>
<P>
The chief function of Congress is the making of laws.  The legislative process comprises a number of steps, and much
information is available from this page concerning the legislation introduced and considered in the 104th Congress.  To
help you understand the information and how it interrelates, a very brief overview of the legislative process within the
House of Representatives is presented below.  There are many aspects and variations of the process which are not
addressed here.  A much more in-depth discussion and presentation of the overall process is available in <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.  Most of the information presented below was excerpted from that Congressional document.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Forms of Congressional Action</H3>
<P>
The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a proposal in one of four principal forms: the bill, the joint
resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the simple resolution.
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DT><B>Bills</B>
<DD>  A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether permanent or temporary, general or special, public or
     private.  A bill originating in the House of Representatives is designated by the letters "H.R.",  signifying
     "House of Representatives", followed by a number that it retains throughout all its parliamentary stages.  Bills
     are presented to the President for action when approved in identical form by both the House of Representatives
     and the  Senate.
<DT><B>Joint Resolutions</B>
<DD>   Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate.  There is little practical
     difference between a bill and a joint resolution.  Both are subject to the same procedure, except for  a joint
     resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution.  On approval of such a resolution by two-thirds of both
     the House and Senate, it is sent directly to the Administrator of General Services for submission to the
     individual states for ratification.  It is not presented to the President for approval.  A joint resolution originating
     in the House of Representatives is designated "H.J.Res." followed by  its individual number.  Joint resolutions
     become law in the same manner as bills.
<DT><B>Concurrent Resolutions</B>
<DD> Matters affecting the operations of both the House of Representatives and Senate are usually initiated by means
     of concurrent resolutions.  A concurrent resolution originating in the House of Representatives is designated
     "H.Con.Res." followed by its individual number.  On approval by both the House of Representatives and
     Senate, they are signed by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate.  They are not presented to the
     President for action.
<DT><B>Simple Resolutions</B>
<DD> A matter concerning the operation of either the House of Representatives or Senate alone is initiated by a
     simple resolution.  A resolution affecting the House of Representatives is designated "H.Res." followed by its
     number. They are not presented to the President for action.
<P>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Introduction and Referral to Committee</H3>
<P>
Any Member in the House of Representatives may  introduce a bill at any time while the House is in session  by simply
placing it in the "hopper" provided for the purpose at the side of the Clerk's desk in the House Chamber.  The  sponsor's
signature must appear on the bill.  A public bill may have an unlimited number of co-sponsoring Members.  The bill is
assigned its legislative number by the Clerk and referred to the appropriate committee by the Speaker, with the
assistance of the Parliamentarian.  The bill is then printed in its introduced form, which you can  read in <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_103rd">Bill Text</A> (
See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bill_text_help_104.html">Help</A> for searching examples).  If a
bill was introduced today, summary  information about it can be found in <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_bill_status_today">Bill Status Today</A> (
See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bills_status_today_help.html">Help</A> for searching examples).
<P>
An important phase of the legislative process is the action taken by committees.  It is during committee action that the
most intense consideration is given to the proposed measures; this is also the time when the people are given their
opportunity to be heard.   Each piece of legislation is referred to the committee that has <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">jurisdiction</A> over the area
affected by the measure.
<P>
For more information on this step of the legislative process see <A HREF = "gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A218%3AE.%20Intro%20and%20Reference%20to%20Cmte">Introduction and Reference to Committee</A> of <A HREF="HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Consideration by Committee</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
  <DT><B>Public Hearings and Markup Sessions</B>
  <DD>Usually the first step in this process is a public hearing, where the committee members hear witnesses representing various viewpoints on the measure.
    Each committee makes public the date, place and subject of
     any hearing it conducts.  The <A HREF="gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A942%3ACommittee%20Schedules">Committee Meetings</A> scheduled for today are available along with other <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/Schedule.html">House Schedules </A>.
       Public announcements are also published in the Daily Digest portion of the 
       <A HREF = "gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_cong_record_103-2">Congressional Record</A>.
<P>
     A <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">transcript</A> of the testimony taken at a hearing is made available for inspection in the committee office, and
     frequently the complete transcript is printed and distributed by the committee.
<P>
     After hearings are completed, the bill is considered in a session that is popularly known as the "mark-up"
     session.  Members of the committee study the viewpoints presented in detail.  Amendments may be offered to
     the bill, and the committee members vote to accept or reject these changes.
<P>
     This process can take place at either the subcommittee level or the full committee level, or at both.  Hearings
     and markup sessions are status steps noted in the Legislative Action portion of <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_bill_status_104th">Bill Status</A>. (
     See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bill_status_help.html">Help</A> for searching examples).
<P>
  <DT><B>Committee Action</B>
  <DD>At the conclusion of deliberation, a vote of committee or subcommittee Members is taken to determine what
     action to take on the measure.  It can be reported, with or without amendment, or tabled, which means no
     further action on it will occur.  If the committee has approved extensive amendments, they may decide to report
     a new bill incorporating all the amendments.  This is known as a "clean bill," which will have a new number. 
     Votes in committee can be found in <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">Committee Votes</A>.
<P>
     If the committee votes to report a bill, the <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">Committee Report</A> is written.  This report describes the purpose and
     scope of the measure and the reasons for recommended approval.  House Report numbers are prefixed with
     "H.Rpt." and then a number indicating the Congress (currently 104). 
<P>
</DL></DL>
For more  information on bills and resolutions see <A HREF = "gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/1D-1%3A231%3AF.%20Consideration%20by%20Committee">Consideration by Committee</A> in <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.
<P>
<BR>

<H3>House Floor Consideration</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>Consideration of a measure by the full House can be a simple or very complex operation.   In general a measure
     is ready for consideration by the full House after it has been reported by a committee.  Under certain
     circumstances, it may be brought to the Floor directly.
<P>
   <DD>The consideration of a measure may be governed by a "rule."  A rule is itself a simple resolution, which must
     be passed by the House, that sets out the particulars of debate for a specific bill -- how much time will allowed
     for debate, whether amendments can be offered, and other matters. 
<P>
   <DD>Debate time for a measure is normally divided between proponents and opponents.  Each side yields time to
     those Members who wish to speak on the bill.  When amendments are offered, these are also debated and voted upon.  If the House is in session today, you can see a summary of <A HREF="gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A947%3ACurrent%20Floor%20Proceedings">Current House Floor Proceedings </A>.
<P>
   <DD>After all debate is concluded and amendments decided upon, the House is ready to vote on final passage.  In
     some cases, a vote to "recommit" the bill to committee is requested.  This is usually an effort by opponents to
     change some portion or table the measure.  If the attempt to recommit fails, a vote on final passage is ordered.
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
<H3>Resolving Differences</H3>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>After a measure passes in the House, it goes to the Senate for consideration.  A bill must pass both bodies in
     the same form before it can be presented to the President for signature into law.
<P>
   <DD>If the Senate changes the language of the measure, it must return to the House for concurrence or additional
     changes.  This back-and-forth negotiation may occur on the House floor, with the House accepting or rejecting
     Senate amendments or complete Senate text.  Often a conference committee will be appointed with both House
     and Senate members.  This group will resolve the differences in committee and report the identical measure
     back to both  bodies for a vote.  Conference committees also issue reports outlining the final version of the bill.
<P>
<BR>
</DL>
</DL>

<H3>Final Step</H3>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>Votes on final passage, as well as all other votes in the House, may be taken by the electronic voting system
     which registers each individual Member's response.  These votes are referred to as Yea/Nay votes or recorded
     votes, and are available in <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">House Votes</A> by Bill number, roll call vote number or words describing the reason
     for the vote.
<P>
   <DD>Votes in the House may also be by voice vote, and no record of individual responses is available.
<P>
   <DD>After a measure has been passed in identical form by both the House and Senate, it is considered "enrolled."  It
     is sent to the President who may sign the measure into law, veto it and return it to Congress, let it become law
     without signature, or at the end of a session, pocket-veto it.

               CODE OF ETHICS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE</h2></center>

<P>    Resolved by the House of Representatives {the Senate
       concurring}, That it is the sense of the Congress that the
       following Code of Ethics should be adhered to by all Government
       employees, including officeholders:

                  <h2><center>CODE OF ETHICS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE</h2></center>

<P>    <b> Any person in Government service should:

<P>    </b><b>1.</b> Put loyalty to the highest moral principals and to
country above loyalty to Government persons, party, or department.

<P>     <b>2.</b> Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of
the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to
their evasion.

<P>     <b>3.</b> Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving to
the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.

<P>     <b>4.</b> Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical
ways of getting tasks accomplished.

<P>     <b>5.</b> Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special
favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and
never accept for himself or his family, favors or benefits under
circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as
influencing the performance of his governmental duties.

<P>     <b>6.</b> Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the
duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which
can be binding on public duty.

<P>     <b>7.</b> Engage in no business with the Government, either
directly or indirectly which is inconsistent with the conscientious
performance of his governmental duties.

<P>     <b>8.</b> Never use any information coming to him confidentially
in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private
profit.

<P>     <b>9.</b> Expose corruption wherever discovered.

<P>    <b>10.</b> Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public
office is a public trust.

<P>    (Passed July 11, 1958.)

<P>
	Title I.  CONTRACT WITH AMERICA: A BILL OF ACCOUNTABILITY<P>
<P>
[Note: Each section below in Title I would be under a separate introductory paragraph adopting House Rules from the 103rd Congress as the Rules of the 104th Congress with the additional amendment(s) in the section, thereby permitting a division of the question and separate debate and vote on each of the 8 Contract items.  The 23 items in Title II, on the other hand, would be subject to a single vote.]<P>
<P>
	Sec. 101.  Committee, Subcommittee and Staff Reforms:  Committee staff in the 104th Congress is reduced by at least one-third from comparable levels in the 103rd Congress.

Statutory and investigative staff salary authorization levels would be consolidated in a single, 2-year committee expense resolution (except for the Committee on Appropriations).  The distinction between professional and clerical staff would be eliminated while retaining the overall core staff of 30 for each committee (20-majority, 10-minority, or a one-third guarantee to the minority if less than 30).  Committee chairmen would be required to ensure that sufficient staff is made available to each subcommittee to exercise its responsibilities under committee rules, including fair treatment to the minority in subcommittee staffing.  Interim funding authority for House committees, consistent with planned staff reductions, would be provided pending the adoption of the primary expense resolution for 1995-96.<P>

<P>
	Sec. 105.  Committee Sunshine Rules:  Committee meetings, which can now be closed for any reason, could only be closed by majority rollcall vote if disclosure would endanger national security, compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person. Broadcast coverage of any committee or subcommittee meeting or hearing open to the public would be a right (not requiring a vote of approval as at present).<P>
<P>
	Sec. 106.  Limitations on Tax Increases: (a)  No bill, joint resolution, amendment or conference report carrying an income tax rate increase, could be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined by a vote of at least three-fifths of the House.

Non-emergency items could not be reported or offered as amendments to emergency spending bills (except to rescind budget authority or reduce direct spending to pay for the emergency benefits).  Off-setting, deficit neutral amendments could be offered en bloc to any appropriations measure.

Member terms would be increased from three to four and the chairman and ranking minority member could serve a fifth term if they held those positions for only one Congress.  The Speaker (currently the majority leader) and minority leader would serve as ex officio, non-voting members, and may designate a member of their leadership staff to assist them and have access to committee proceedings and materials, as if committee staff, subject to the same security clearance and confidentiality requirements as committee staff.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER>F<B>or more than a century, science attempted to explain all
human behaviour as the subrational product of unbending chemical, genetic,
or environmental forces. The spiritual side of human nature was ignored,
if not denied outright. <BR>
<BR>
This rigid scientific materialism infected all other areas of human knowledge,
laying the foundations for much of modern psychology, sociology, economics,
and political science. Yet today new developments in biology, physics, and
artificial intelligence are raising serious doubts about scientific materialism
and re-opening the case for the supernatural. <BR>
<BR>
What do these exciting developments mean for the social sciences that were
built upon the foundation of materialism? This project brings together leading
scholars from the natural sciences and those from the humanities and social
sciences in order to explore what the demise of materialism means for reviving
the various disciplines</B></CENTER>

<title>What A Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean for Family College Costs -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3><i>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #3:  
WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS 
WOULD MEAN FOR FAMILY COLLEGE COSTS</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 77<br>
December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
Congress's balanced budget with tax relief legislation will allow families with children to save more money for higher education. A balanced budget with tax cuts also will lead to lower interest rates which will benefit students by lowering the cost of student loans. Both of these consequences of balancing the budget over seven years with tax relief mean more highly skilled Americans for future workforces. These are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
According to this statistical analysis, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress would mean: 
<p><ul>
<li> American families, over time, could save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax credit. This would cover the full tuition costs at a typical public university today.
<p>
<li> An average student could save more than $414 over the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest rates.
</ul><p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting firm.<sup>1</sup>  The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office.<sup>2</sup><p><b>INCREASED FAMILY SAVINGS FROM $500-PER-CHILD TAX CREDIT</b><p>The high cost of a college education prices many families out of the higher education market or forces students and parents to incur large amounts of debt to cover the costs of college.<p>The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would benefit more than 28 million families raising some 51 million children and could allow many families to save enough money to send their children to college. A family that chooses to dedicate the entire $500-per-child tax credit to savings for higher education would accumulate about $14,066 in today's dollars over 18 years for each child's education. Thus, a family with two children would be able to save an additional $28,132 for college expenses. In today's dollars, an additional $14,066 per child in family savings for education amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li> Five full years' tuition and fees at an average public university; 
<p>
<li> One full year's tuition and fees at an average private university; or
<p>
<li> More than the difference between the four-year cost of an average public university and the two-year cost of an average public community college.
</ul>
<p>
<b>LOWER STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES</b>
<p>
The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses would face lower interest rates under the congressional balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget and tax policy. Lower interest rates also would benefit students with student loans. A student beginning his or her education in 1996 would face interest rates that averaged half a percentage point below what is expected under current law:  a savings of $414 over the life of an average ten-year student loan.<sup>3</sup>  More young Americans will be able to afford a college education as a result of these savings. In addition, some students who otherwise would have to defer their education plans could enter college earlier, thus increasing their lifetime earnings.
<p>
Alternatively, lower interest rates would allow students to borrow more money for education at the same effective cost. In essence, students would be able to purchase more education for the same price. The additional $414 might be used for such things as:
<p>
<ul>
<li> One full year of books and supplies;

<li> Two additional courses at an average public university; or

<li> About one-third the cost of a personal computer. 
</ul><p>

<b>TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS</b>
<p>
For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. Beach and John S. Barry, "What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
For purposes of calculating the amount of savings from a $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the money was placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning a real rate of return of 5 percent per year.
<p>
The initial rate of interest charged for a student loan was assumed to be 8.25 percent. The 0.5 percent figure is an average decrease below baseline for the life of a ten-year student loan. This 0.5 percent decrease was projected in the above-cited econometric simulation.
<p>

<p><ol>
<li> William W. Beach and John S. Barry, "What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
<li>Laurence H. Meyer & Associates long has earned top honors for forecasting accuracy when compared against similar firms. In 1993, it won the "Blue Chip" forecasting award for the years 1989-1992. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates was ineligible for the award in 1994, but again was rated the most accurate forecasting firm in the United States.
<p>
<li>This is based on a student loan of $13,044, the average cost of a public university, at an initial interest rate of 8.25 percent. The Heritage Foundation econometric analysis assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of monetary reserves. This assumption means a relatively smaller decrease in interest rates. Thus, the 0.5 percent decrease can be viewed as a conservative estimate of the potential savings to a student from lower interest rates.

<b>"I think I raised [your taxes] too much, too."</b><p>
<blockquote>		--President Clinton, October 17, 1995</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1: Tax Cut Only One-Third of Combined 1990 and 1993 Tax Increases</a><br>
<a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2: Government Will Still Get Too Much Revenue After Tax Cut</a><br>
<p>
President Clinton claims that the $245 billion seven-year tax cut supported by Congress is excessive. But it actually does not come close to eliminating the huge tax increase levied by the last Congress and is dwarfed by the level of tax hikes approved since Ronald Reagan left office. (See <a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1</a>) Consider:
<p><ul>
<li> The increased tax burden caused by the 1990 and 1993 tax bills totals three times more than this year's proposed tax cut. Taxpayers will still be worse off compared with their tax burden in 1989. <p>

<li> This year's tax cut will reduce federal tax collections by less than 2.2 cents on the dollar. And that is the "worst-case" estimate that assumes no revenue feedback from higher growth stimulated by such things as the proposed capital gains tax cut.
<p>
<li> Even with the tax cut, tax revenues are projected to rise from $1.357 trillion this year to $1.820 trillion in 2002, an increase of $463 billion (an average of $66 billion per year).
</ul><p>
	By any objective measure, the Administration's claim that the tax cut is too big cannot be justified. Set in proper context, these figures instead make a persuasive case that this year's tax cut should be considered a first step. Indeed, when lawmakers next year begin considering a flat tax, they should take whatever steps are needed -- including further limits on the growth of federal spending -- to ensure that tax reform is accompanied by tax reduction.
<p>
	<b>Undoing Damage from 1990 and 1993 Tax Hikes.</b> According to Congressional Budget Office figures, the 1990 tax increase was projected to increase revenues by 0.54 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The 1993 tax hike, America's biggest, was projected to raise revenues by a further 0.73 percent of GDP. The tax cut now being discussed, by contrast, is estimated to reduce tax collections by a scant 0.4 percent of GDP. Thus, CBO projections suggest that this comparatively modest tax cut at best will reverse only one-third of the damage inflicted by higher taxes in 1990 and 1993.<P>

	<b>No Revenue Shortfall.</b> As <a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates, the CBO projects that federal tax collections will expand by more than $460 billion if the tax cuts are enacted. These estimates, incidentally, assume that there is no positive effect on the economy from lowering the tax burden. Needless to say, several measures in the proposal, such as reductions in the tax on capital gains, expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts, and partial relief for those subject to the alternative minimum tax, will boost incentives to save and invest and therefore trigger higher wages for American workers. This increase in taxable income will offset some of the projected $245 billion tax cut.
<p>
	Even with the implausible assumption that the economy receives no benefit from lower taxes, the proposed tax cut will have only a tiny effect on revenues. Tax revenues still are projected by the CBO to rise by an average of $66 billion annually between 1995 and 2002. And of the $11.373 trillion in tax revenue the government is projected to collect over that period, the $245 billion tax cut will reduce that amount by less than 2.2 cents for every dollar.
<P>
	<b>The High-Tax Approach Has Failed.</b> The White House claims that lower taxes will be counterproductive. Before criticizing tax cuts, however, the Administration would be well advised to see how the redistributionist goal of higher taxes has backfired.
Tax rates on the "rich" were raised in 1990 and 1993. The result:  As opponents warned, upper-income taxpayers reduced the amount of income they reported.
<P><ul>
<li> The higher taxes from the "rich" from increased income tax rates in 1990 and 1993 were supposed to help boost total income taxes as a proportion of GDP. The result:  Income tax collections actually have fallen from 8.6 percent of GDP in 1989 to 8.2 percent of GDP in 1994.
<p>
<li> Revenues grew by an average of 6.6 percent annually in the "tax-cutting" Reagan years, a rate of growth one-fourth higher than the 5.3 percent annual revenue increases under Presidents Bush and Clinton.
<p>
<li> The budget deficit was less than $155 billion in 1989 and was projected by the Congressional Budget Office in January 1989 to fall every year into the future if Reagan's policies were left untouched. Lawmakers instead imposed large tax hikes in 1990 and 1993. The result:  The deficit this year is $161 billion and now projected by the CBO to rise in future years.
<p>
<li> The tax increases in 1990 and 1993 were intended to spur the economy. The result:  A recession in 1990-1991 was followed by recovery and expansion well below historical averages for job creation and economic growth.
</ul><p>
	In the last five years, taxpayers have been burdened by two major tax increases. These tax hikes have failed to achieve their economic and income redistribution objectives. The result has been lackluster economic growth and persistent budget deficits. To help reverse this failed approach, Congress is preparing what is, in reality, a modest tax cut. The tax relief is only a fraction of the 1990 and 1993 tax increases, and taxpayers will see their tax bills decline by less than 2.2 percent compared to current law. But the proposed changes are at least a welcome step in the right direction of a tax code that would stimulate the economy.

<title>How to Close Down the Department of Labor -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR</i></h3>

Backgrounder No. 1058<br>
October 19, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor (DoL) has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government. Created in 1913, DoL is currently responsible for the administration and enforcement of over 180 federal statutes. This proliferating body of legislation and regulation covers a wide range of workplace activities for nearly 10 million employers and well over 100 million workers, presenting a barrier to the formation of firms and their ability to create jobs.1<p>The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. If implemented, such reforms could save America's taxpayers $10.5 billion from 1996 to the year 2000 alone. The primary objectives of this effort should be to: 
<p><ul>
<li> Reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety; 
<p>
<li> Improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
</ul><p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing this Cabinet-level department and moving certain of its key national functions into sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
The Department of Labor's programs are organized into seven main functional areas: <p>
1) Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Employment Services (ES),
<p>
2) Job Training Programs,
<p>
3) Workplace Health and Safety,
<p>
4) Private Pension Protection,
<p>
5) Employment Standards,
<p>
6) Economic Statistics, and
<p>
7) Labor Union Oversight. 
<p>
UI and ES form the largest functional area, accounting for around 75 percent of DoL's budget (set at $25.5 billion for FY 1995). The next largest budget function, Job Training Programs, accounts for around 20 percent. 
<p>
Examining these seven areas reveals that the administration and enforcement of American labor laws can and should be reformed, both to achieve the department's underlying objectives of workforce protection, including workplace health and safety, and to reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations. To do this, Congress should take the following steps:
<p><ul>
<li> <b>Devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services to the states.</b> This would enable states to decrease the duration of unemployment, reduce payroll taxes, and increase jobs. Devolution should include the Veterans Employment Service, labor market information projects, the one-stop career system concept, and the administration of unemployment insurance. Congress also should repeal the Federal Extended Benefit program and provide incentives for states to overhaul and integrate their employment services with a view to reducing the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance. Any remaining federal administrative functions should be transferred to the Treasury Department. 
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant.</b> Congress should combine these programs, including the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, Indian and Native American Employment and Training, and Youth Fair Chance, into a block grant attached to the new welfare block grant recently passed by Congress. This would eliminate a maze of categorical programs and provide states the flexibility they need to develop programs that effectively reduce welfare dependency. States should be required only to focus these resources on means-tested job placement assistance and conduct control group evaluations of their effectiveness. Federal target and categorical requirements should be removed. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant.</b> This new block grant for job placement assistance and training would include such things as dislocated worker programs, School-to-Work programs, and Adult Technology Learning programs. Even the Department of Labor recognizes that a block grant would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars.2  The determination of target groups should be left to the discretion of the states. Because the effectiveness of today's training programs is questionable,3 total funding for this block grant should be cut by 50 percent and frozen until scientific studies can prove they are effective. In carrying out these studies, states should be required to have at least one ongoing control group evaluation on programs funded from the block grant. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).</b> This reform is needed to "refocus the [federal] responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."4  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending.5  Businesses already have much stronger financial incentives than OSHA penalties, such as the costs of lost productivity, workers' compensation, and liability claims,6 to maintain and continually improve workplace safety. Thus, the role of the federal government should be redefined from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner. Congress also should spin off the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined by a department subject to political influence.  
<p>
<li><b> Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration.</b> Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across three departments.7  Combining the agencies responsible for this oversight would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. In addition, Congress should spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, fund the PBGC separately, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.8 <p><li><b>Repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations.</b> Congress should streamline labor regulation by eliminating the heavy burden of outdated or restrictive rules. This means, for example, nullifying Executive Order 11246 and related affirmative action regulations affecting federal contractors and subcontractors; eliminating the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP); repealing the Davis-Bacon Act and Service Contract Act, as well as Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964; reforming the Fair Labor Standards Act; and strengthening the Portal to Portal Act of 1947. Congress then should transfer all remaining functions of the Wage and Hour Division to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li><b> Combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau within a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics.</b> A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. It also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Statistical functions of other departments also should be housed within the new bureau to ensure that the government's data collection efforts are insulated from politics.
<p>
<li><b> Close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (Striker Replacement).</b> Government promotion of high-performance workplaces actually serves only as corporate welfare and a training subsidy for unions. These activities already are conducted in the private sector through business associations and unions. Congress should transfer labor union oversight and investigative functions, including those in the Office of the Inspector General, to the Justice Department. 
</ul><p>
The 104th Congress has held a number of hearings and introduced a variety of bills to reform and update America's labor laws, and it continues to reassess dozens of labor policy issues that have been neglected for years.9  This year's budget process also has provided Congress with a vehicle for reform. Aside from reforming and consolidating job training programs, the Administration's proposed budget did little to "reinvent" DoL. President Clinton proposed to raise the department's budget authority by over 14 percent and its full-time staff by 304.10  Congress appropriately rejected the President's budget and is proceeding with its own plan to reform the administration of federal labor policy through the budget process. <p>The House recently voted to reduce FY 1996 DoL discretionary spending by 13.8 percent. It also instituted several important reforms. For example, the House budget prohibits funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, prohibits the issuance of two unnecessarily burdensome OSHA regulations on ergonomics and fall protection, and bars DoL from promoting "economically targeted investments" (ETIs) by private pension plans. The House also is planning to repeal the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
The Senate Appropriations Committee recently voted to reduce DoL discretionary spending for FY 1996 by 12.6 percent. Although the Senate's DoL budget prohibits implementation of the striker replacement executive order, it does not contain the House's OSHA regulatory provisions or the prohibition on promoting ETIs. Differences between the House and Senate versions will have to be worked out in conference committee.
<p>
As the following study demonstrates, the U.S. Department of Labor has gone far beyond its original mandate to become a burdensome and feared regulatory agency that presents significant barriers to creating jobs and increasing real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and workplace requirements makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers. Overzealous enforcement has made DoL the enemy of American business. Congress should do what the Clinton Administration promised but failed to do -- reform this overgrown and intrusive bureaucracy. 
<p>

<b>HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS GROWN</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor was created by Congress in 1913 in response to pressure from organized labor. Its goals, according to the statute, were to "foster, promote and develop the welfare of wage-earners, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."  Initially, DoL consisted of four bureaus transferred from the old Department of Commerce and Labor:  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (formerly the Bureau of Labor), the Bureau of Immigration, the Bureau of Naturalization, and the Children's Bureau. These bureaus reflected the department's original focus:  collecting information and publishing reports on employment, wages, and working conditions; reviewing the effects of immigration on the job market; and monitoring the use of child labor.
<p>
In 1918, during World War I, Congress established the War Labor Administration (WLA) to insure adequate industrial production and foster labor peace in defense production industries. The WLA set policies on wages, hours, and working conditions. It recruited women and minorities to work in defense industries. It also sought to encourage better workplace race relations, promote worker safety and health, and address other employment-related problems that might hinder war production. Although Congress moved quickly after the Armistice to end its activities, the WLA's initiatives embodied ideas of the Progressive movement that later would spawn the New Deal, Fair Deal, New Frontier, and War on Poverty. 
<p>
What began as primarily an advocacy, educational, and administrative department over time became a regulatory and enforcement agency. Since 1918 Congress has expanded DoL's regulatory functions considerably, often because of political pressure from social reform movements or organized labor. For instance: 
<p><blockquote>
	During the 1920s, in response to the women's suffrage movement, the Women's Bureau was added to promote the status of and job opportunities for women. DoL also implemented the Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 that ended U.S. free immigration policy by imposing a quota system. 
<p>
	Confronted with the depression of the 1930s, Congress passed several laws to protect workers from economic change. The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted explicitly to protect white unionized workers on federal construction sites from competition by low-skilled nonunion workers, chiefly blacks and Hispanics. The Wagner-Peyser Act established the U.S. Employment Service, and the Social Security Act established the Unemployment Insurance system. The Fair Labor Standards Act mandated a minimum wage, overtime requirements, and child labor restrictions.
<p>
	In the late 1940s, DoL underwent many organizational changes. Its immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the postwar years, the failure of DoL to mediate a wave of strikes prompted Congress to transfer the department's labor conciliation functions to the independent Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and veterans' reemployment rights became DoL's responsibility as the Defense Department was scaled back. In 1959, concern over the influence of organized crime and other union abuses led Congress to pass the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to oversee the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions.
<p>
	In the early 1960s, unfounded concern about the impact of technology on the labor force, combined with the War on Poverty, resulted in passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962. Ten years later, spending on federal job training programs was increased significantly by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 reduced the enormous cost of CETA but did not improve the effectiveness of federal job training programs. 
<p>
	Since the 1960s, pressure from the civil rights movement has led to a variety of equal employment opportunity laws and redundant presidential executive orders to protect certain groups of individuals -- women, minorities, the disabled, the elderly -- such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Executive Order 11246 as amended.11<p>	In the 1970s, DoL's regulatory and enforcement role expanded dramatically with passage of the landmark Occupational Health and Safety Act and again when responsibility for mine safety and health was transferred from the Department of the Interior. 
<p>
	Concern over the negative impact of federal trade policies on workers prompted Congress to pass the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act in 1974. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act was enacted in 1988 to provide advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs to workers and their communities. 
<p>
	During the 1980s and 1990s, Congress has enacted various employee benefits and protections, such as the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. 
</blockquote><p>
Since 1960, the expansion of federally mandated benefits and worker protections has begun to take its toll on business formation and job creation.12  In 1994, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, legally required benefits accounted for 32 percent of all benefits paid to workers on an hourly basis.13  Studies also show that changes in legally mandated benefits are shifted largely to workers in the form of lower real wages.14  Further, the increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to businesses of complying with workplace safety and health regulations.15  Although well intentioned, these requirements add to the cost of hiring and managing workers and directly affect an employer's decisions about whether and when to hire a worker, which worker to hire, and how long to retain that worker. The rise in nonwage labor costs is important because it is one of the forces leading employers to lay off workers, as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor.16<p>Ironically, organized labor has been so successful in persuading Congress to legislate matters that once were the province of collective bargaining that they have nearly driven themselves out of business. And with each Congress, Washington has placed more and more requirements and restrictions on employers and the labor market.17  This growing regulatory burden has made DoL inspectors as feared as IRS auditors and most small businesses very cautious about hiring additional workers.<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><p>Today's labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed since most of America's major labor laws were passed. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. Only a fundamental rethinking of DoL and its functions can lead to the formulation of a proper and truly effective federal labor policy. The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
<p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by eliminating the DoL as a Cabinet department. Certain key national functions should be carried out by sub-Cabinet agencies or transferred to other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
<b>I. REFORM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE.</b><p>
Over two-thirds of DoL's budget is consumed by the Unemployment Compensation (UC) Program.18  This program has two main objectives:  to provide temporary and partial wage replacement to recently unemployed workers, and help stabilize the economy during recessions. The UC program is financed by a Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) of 0.8 percent19 of the first $7,000 in wages and state unemployment insurance taxes that average 0.9 percent of total wages. The revenue raised by FUTA is used to administer Unemployment Insurance (UI) and maintain a system of Employment Service (ES) offices. Portions of FUTA revenues also fund the federal half of the Extended Benefits Program and federal loans to depleted state accounts. State UI tax revenues fund state UI benefit payments and the state half of the Extended Benefits Program. At the end of fiscal 1995, state accounts in the UI Trust Fund had a balance of $35.6 billion. Like the Social Security Trust Fund, any positive balance in the UI Trust Fund is used to fund other federal programs. General revenues are used to fund federal unemployment benefit programs and allowances such as Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance. 
<p>
When the UC program was enacted in 1935, Congress intended that it be a federal-state partnership. The federal government was to set broad parameters, provide adequate and equitable funding for state administration, and oversee state law and operations to ensure compliance and conformity. The states were to be responsible for carrying out the program while complying with all federal laws and regulations, as well as their own state requirements. However, the federal government has used the state conformity process to convert the basic program philosophy into a more acceptable ideology and frequently upsets the balance of administrative funding and workloads by dictating that states absorb the costs of administering additional programs.20<p>Over the past decade, federal budget constraints have had a detrimental effect on services provided to unemployed workers by the state UI system and ES offices. Even though FUTA revenues collected for UI and ES administration have been more than sufficient, Congress continues to extend the 0.2 percent FUTA surtax on jobs and limit UI and ES administration appropriations.21  This masks the true size of the federal deficit. The federal government actually uses the UI system to fund programs that lead to longer periods of unemployment for workers22 and unnecessarily high payroll taxes. This is contrary to the primary purpose of the UI system23and reduces real wages.24<p>The UC program should be reformed to limit the federal role, as Congress originally intended, and to restore responsibility and accountability to the states. Studies show that states can decrease the duration of unemployment and thereby reduce payroll taxes and increase jobs.25 <p>What Congress Should Do:<p><b>Devolve financing and funding for the UI system and Employment Service to the states. </b><p>Congress should repeal the temporary 0.2 percent FUTA surtax and increase the FUTA offset26 from the current 90 percent to 100 percent if a state conforms with federal law. States should be allowed to collect one UI tax for administration and benefits. Each state would be responsible, and accountable, to employers for UI payroll tax dollars and for the administration and effectiveness of the UI/ES system. Receipts from the single state UI tax should be deposited into each state's UI account, maintained by the Department of the Treasury. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Wagner-Peyser Act and amend FUTA to require states to establish public employment offices in labor market areas designated by state legislatures. </b>
<p>
Each state should have the flexibility to deliver job placement assistance in ways that meet the needs of its employers and job seekers. However, states should be required to ensure reasonable access to services for workers and to register for work all eligible claimants who are not temporarily laid off. Reform must provide incentives for states to explore ways to integrate employment services and reduce the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. These incentives should include opening up the job placement assistance offered through the state ES offices to private competition and other UI experiments.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the federal extended benefit program and the federal extended unemployment compensation account (EUCA). </b>
<p>
Funds in the EUCA should be transferred to state UI accounts based upon each state's relative share of covered employment. The 1992 amendments that made it easier for states to trigger extended benefits (EB)27 should be repealed. The 1992 change made it easier for states to qualify for extended benefits and encouraged individuals to stay on unemployment benefits even when jobs were available. By basing the trigger for extended benefits on a state's total unemployment rate rather than its insured unemployment rate, Congress also broadened considerably the number of those who can qualify for extended benefits. Those who argued for this change claimed that basing benefits on the insured rate meant that many of the unemployed were not receiving benefits and that the program therefore was not working as intended. But, as pointed out at the time by Labor Department officials, this gap between the number of people who were unemployed and the number collecting benefits is normal and is an intended purpose of the program.28<p><b>Eliminate the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA), which is used to loan money to insolvent state UI accounts. </b>
<p>
 Funds in the FUA come from a portion of the FUTA payroll tax on jobs.29  The federal government uses the FUA to provide loans to states that have depleted their UI accounts during severe recessions. When the FUA is not being used for state loans, the surplus that builds up is used to fund other government programs and amounts to a tax on jobs to reduce the deficit. At the end of September 1995, there will be a $7.4 billion surplus in the FUA. The FUA should be eliminated and its funds transferred to state UI accounts. States that deplete their UI accounts should be able to borrow directly from the U.S. Treasury rather than from a surplus account maintained to offset the federal deficit.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program and the Local Veteran Employment Representative Program and amend FUTA to incorporate the veteran preferences already in Title 38 of the U.S. Code (Veterans Benefits). </b>
<p>
The administrative efficiency of ES offices could be improved significantly by repealing barriers to the integration of veterans' services with other employment services. As the Vice President's National Performance Review noted in calling for the removal of barriers,30 DoL's Veterans' Employment and Training Service provides for state-employed, federally funded employment specialists to serve veterans in local state employment service offices. However, staff are legally prohibited from helping non-veterans. "So, if a local office is crowded with non-veterans," points out the NPR, "these specialists cannot help out -- even if they have no veterans to serve."  Employment Service staff would be used more efficiently and the public better served by eliminating this requirement.
<p>
<b>Eliminate Trade Adjustment Assistance. </b>
<p>
This program funds payments for unemployment benefits, allowances, and training costs to workers affected by foreign trade imports under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act (TAA). In addition, the TAA provides for payment of similar benefits to workers adversely affected by NAFTA. As well intentioned as this may be, workers who can prove they lost their jobs because of foreign competition or NAFTA should not receive government benefits that exceed the assistance available to those laid off due to domestic competition.31  In any case, the department's own auditors have concluded that the TAA has not worked as intended, and the new NAFTA-TAA program likely will meet the same outcome:  Instead of providing retraining help, the TAA program has turned into a compensation program.32  Funding for these ineffective programs should be eliminated.<p><b>Permit state legislators to determine ES administrative budgets, payroll taxes, and UI benefits under limited federal guidelines. </b><p> The UI system is an experience-rated and employer-paid payroll tax. It was set up with specific objectives and a designated tax as its funding source. Federal proposals to combine the funding sources for the ES program and job training programs are unwise. Job placement services have different goals, populations, and outcomes from those of training programs. ES offices are supposed to get unemployment claimants back to work quickly, thereby ensuring that employer taxes are as low as possible. Job training programs often do not share that objective. Suggesting that FUTA payroll tax funds be used for anything other than paying unemployment benefits and funding state job placement assistance is merely a backdoor way to introduce a payroll tax for training. Devolving ES funding removes the potential for Congress to dilute the mission of the system and divert funding for other purposes.
The limited federal guidelines should include the following:
<p><ul>
<li>	The single state UI tax for both administration and benefits should be experience rated.
<p>
<li>	Funds should be used only for program administration and weekly benefits and should be capped at levels necessary for proper and efficient administration during periods of high unemployment.
<p>
<li>States should be required to continue cooperative and financial contracts to administer the interstate benefit program.
<p>
<li>	Federal funding for the administration and payment of federal employee UI benefits, military separations, and disaster unemployment programs should be deposited in state UI accounts as needed.
<p>
<li> Federal oversight should be limited to determining whether state laws conform with federal requirements.
</ul><p>
<b>II. CONSOLIDATE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS INTO BLOCK GRANTS.</b><p>
The current maze of discretionary job training programs accounts for another substantial portion of DoL's budget. Many DoL programs overlap programs in other departments. The General Accounting Office has identified 163 employment training assistance programs across the federal government, spending about $20 billion per year.33  Moreover, "this fragmented system wastes resources and confuses and frustrates clients, employers, and administrators."  For FY 1995, thirty of these programs, totaling $5.8 billion, were funded through DoL.34  The Employment and Training Administration, the primary DoL agency responsible for job training programs, is run by 1,529 employees and accounts for 50 percent of DoL's discretionary budget.35<p>President Clinton, as part of his "Middle Class Bill of Rights" initiative, has proposed significant funding increases in his FY 1996 budget.36  For example, DoL proposed to increase funding for the School-to-Work program by 63 percent and funding for the One-Stop Career Center program by 100 percent. But the Clinton Administration also agrees that federal job training programs are fragmented, overlapping, and lack accountability. Part of the President's initiative is to consolidate and reform 70 job training programs. 
<P>
Because statistics indicate that more education leads to better paying jobs, Congress and others assume that job training programs work. Unfortunately they don't. Rather than focusing on who should have responsibility for job training programs, Congress must first ask itself a fundamental question:  Why should we continue to spend taxpayer money on programs that don't work?37 <p>Job training programs, although well intentioned, have not raised the long-term hourly earnings of participants. They do not achieve this primary goal because there is little, if anything, the government can do to alter what happens when individuals neglect their first 12 years of primary education.38  The billions of dollars spent on government job training and public assistance programs are too much too late. What is needed are more fundamental changes aimed at improving basic education through school choice, strengthening curricula, and completing high school. Reform that focuses on these goals will reduce the demand for government job training programs that do not work.
<p>
Bills have been introduced in both the House and the Senate to reform federal job training programs. The House recently passed the Consolidated and Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act (H.R. 1617), introduced by Representative Howard McKeon (R-CA). The Senate also recently passed the Workforce Development Act of 1995 (S. 143), introduced by Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS). Although both bills improve current law by consolidating some of the federal job training programs into state block grants and increasing accountability, major changes need to be made in conference.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Consolidate more programs into the block grants.</b>
<p>
S. 143 consolidates only around 80 of the 163 federal employment and training programs and reduces spending by 15 percent. H.R. 1617 consolidates even fewer programs. H.R. 1617 does not include Job Corps, the most expensive federal job training program, or vocational rehabilitation programs. S. 143 marginally reforms Job Corps, but does not consolidate it in the state block grant. However, S. 143 does include vocational rehabilitation programs. 
<p>
 Congress can improve both bills by consolidating the Job Corps, vocational rehabilitation, and the Senior Community Service Employment program into the state block grant.
<p>
<b>Provide maximum flexibility to the states in designing their programs. </b><p>
Overly prescriptive federal requirements should be removed. State and local elected officials are in the best position to allocate block grant funds. There is tremendous diversity among and within the states. What Washington prescribes as the solution for problems in urban areas often does not fit well in places like Utah or Vermont. Prescriptive solutions and fixed allocations of funds will work in some places, but will also be the worst possible solution in many others.39  State and local workforce development boards should be optional, not mandatory. Continuing School-to-Work activities also should be optional and not mandatory.<p>Further, states should have the discretion to transfer funds between the welfare and job training block grants for the purpose of implementing work requirements and job placement assistance programs. This would provide additional flexibility to states and eliminate micromanagement by the federal government. 
<p>
<b>Strengthen accountability with control group evaluations.</b>
<p>
Each state should have at least one control group evaluation of its job training programs ongoing at any given time. Such scientific evaluation should be conducted by using experimental and control groups chosen by scientific random assignment and, at a minimum, should determine whether job training and job placement programs effectively raise the hourly wage rates of individuals receiving training through such programs. Each state should report annually on the status and results of its control group evaluations.
<p>
The addition of state control group evaluations would quickly build a body of evidence on the true effectiveness of job training programs. Few job training programs have ever been subject to rigorous evaluation.40  As a report from the Secretary of Labor points out, "there are many areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is available."41  The few solid studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant increase in the hourly earnings of participants directly related to job training. Historically, performance measures and benchmarks have been the more common but unsatisfactory means of determining whether or not these programs work. The findings from performance measure methods, particularly the negative ones, have been easily manipulated and explained way. Without a requirement for rigorous, control group studies, American taxpayers will never know whether they are funding effective programs or just throwing good money after bad. 
<p>
<b>Scale back the labor market information system.</b>
<p>
Initial labor market information system (LMIS) activities should be restricted to conducting a feasibility study, developing LMIS options, and estimating the cost of those options. The current LMIS provisions in both H.R. 1617 and S. 143 immediately plunge the federal and state governments down an untested and expensive path that may not be feasible. Further, mandating states to create a LMIS at the substate level for which no data current exist will be extremely expensive. The initial information for the labor market information system should be restricted to data readily available from the Census Bureau and other federal and state agencies.
<p>
Further, employers should not be mandated to provide any information. All employer provided information on job openings, application procedures, employment requirements, wages, benefits, and hiring patterns should be strictly voluntary. Any information supplied by either individuals or employers should also be immune from the legal process and should not, without the consent of the individual or employer, be used for any judicial or administrative proceeding. 
<p>
<b>III. REFORM AND RESTRUCTURE WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY.</b>42<p>Although Congress intended that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) assure all workers safe and healthy working conditions, the effectiveness of these agencies in carrying out their missions is questionable. From rulemaking to enforcement, the regulatory nightmare that businesses face has made OSHA inspectors as feared as IRS auditors.43  Although most employers maintain relatively safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA maintains an adversarial approach to setting and enforcing standards.44  Significant reform is required to redefine the federal government's role in workplace safety and health and "refocus the responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."45  Vice President Gore's National Performance Review correctly recognized that an army of OSHA inspectors is neither necessary nor likely, given the federal budget situation. A new approach is required to increase workplace health and safety and balance the budget. Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending. 
<p>
A number of bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to reform workplace health and safety programs. The leading bill in the House is H.R. 1834, the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, introduced by Representative Cass Ballenger (R-NC). In the Senate, Judd Gregg (R-NH) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Amendments of 1995 (S. 526), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act of 1995 (S. 592). Of these three bills, H.R. 1834 represents the most comprehensive OSHA reform. It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative overhead and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA.
<p>
Legislative changes are necessary to enable MSHA to allocate resources more efficiently and OSHA to work cooperatively with businesses -- for example, by making compliance assistance a permanent, central part of its program and mission. Efforts to reprioritize agency spending or administratively reinvent the agencies would change their bureaucratic culture only marginally and do little to consolidate administrative overhead and eliminate duplicative activities. President Clinton offered to reinvent OSHA after the 104th Congress announced its intention to create a more effective and efficient OSHA.46  In addition, President Clinton's proposed FY 1996 budget increased funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 23 percent while increasing overall OSHA and MSHA spending by 8.9 percent. The House recently voted to increase funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 19.2 percent while reducing overall OSHA and MSHA spending for FY 1996 by 12.5 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 5.0 percent funding decrease for OSHA compliance assistance and a 3.1 percent overall reduction. However, Congress can accomplish much more by fundamentally redefining the role of the federal government so that it recognizes and more effectively uses the incentives businesses already have to improve workplace health and safety.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Significantly reform OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although executive branch initiatives to reinvent workplace health and safety are welcome, statutory changes are required to redefine the federal government's role and ensure that congressional intent is implemented. Specifically,
<p><ul>
<li>Reform OSHA's regulatory process. <br>
Because OSHA's bureaucratic culture and lawyers have put the search for completely risk-free workplaces and ease of prosecution above common sense, it can take ten or more years to complete a rule.47  OSHA's regulatory process would be more timely and less burdensome if focused initially on hazards that pose the greatest risk to the most workers. Development of compliance directives should be made part of the rulemaking process and tied directly to economic analysis. Far too often, compliance directives are more burdensome than the rules themselves. OSHA also should be required to reassess the actual costs and benefits of its regulations after five years.
<p>
<li>Enhance and expand compliance assistance.<br>
Translating OSHA's confusing jumble of regulations into safer workplaces is difficult at best. Most employers want safe and healthy workplaces, but the Department of Labor is more concerned with prosecuting employers than with providing accurate, reliable compliance information. Explicitly redefining OSHA's mission towards compliance assistance will leverage employers' desire for safety and dramatically improve workplace safety and health. 
<p>
<li> Give first instance warnings for hazards that do not pose an imminent danger.<br>
OSHA continues its adversarial approach to standard setting and enforcement. Many employers are reluctant to call OSHA for assistance in making their workplaces safer for fear of triggering punitive inspections. First instance warnings will remove a major barrier to voluntary compliance.
<p>
<li>Require OSHA inspectors to have some expertise in the industry they are inspecting.<br>
OSHA inspectors are called upon to inspect a variety of workplaces, many of which, like mining, involve complex operations.48  Employers and employees deserve to have their workplaces inspected by qualified persons. 
<p></ul>
<b>Merge the Mine Safety and Health Administration with a reformed OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although OSHA and the MSHA were created separately, workplace injury and illness data no longer justify maintaining these agencies as separate entities with practically the same level of resources.49  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA and reallocating federal resources will accomplish two important objectives:  It will eliminate administrative overhead and duplicative costs and increase workplace health and safety in all industries.
<p><ul>
<li> Reforming the Mine Act to require only one inspection per year will enable MSHA to shift its inspection resources from mine operators with exemplary safety records to operators with poor safety records. By focusing on the "bad players," OSHA's new Mine Office will improve mine safety where it is needed most. Mine operators with good safety records will continue to have incentives to remain safe, in addition to fewer inspections and lower workers' compensation costs, and the new Mine Office will be able to use its resources more efficiently to focus on the "bad players."  Further, merging the two agencies will settle jurisdictional questions about enforcement and eliminate the memoranda of understanding that currently exist between OSHA and MSHA. Mine workers and taxpayers will get more mine safety for their hard-earned dollars.
<P>
<li> The Heritage Foundation estimates that consolidating MSHA and OSHA could save up to $510 million over five years.50  Merging MSHA and OSHA would eliminate the need to write two separate health regulations for the same workplace hazard, one for mining and one for everybody else. For example, there is no reason to have two separate Hazard Communication Standards, and noise protection for miners is no different from noise protection for other workers. Regional and administrative offices would be combined, and MSHA's Office of Information and Public Affairs could be eliminated.
<p></ul>
Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA will not reduce workplace health and safety. No MSHA safety or health regulations would be abolished.51  Each underground mine will be inspected thoroughly at least once a year by qualified inspectors, and all workers will be able to request federal inspections if employers ignore their concerns about unsafe conditions. MSHA's imminent danger closure rule will be maintained, and mine workers finally will be covered by OSHA's health regulations. Focusing resources on compliance assistance will improve the ability of "good players" to translate OSHA and MSHA regulations into safer workplaces. Most important, by requiring only one mandatory inspection per year instead of four, a new OSHA/MSHA will be able to reallocate its resources to focus on improving the "bad players" instead of inspecting mines with good safety records.
<p>

<b>Establish the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency that functions as a national safety and health standard-setting agency. </b>
<p>
Establishing health and safety compliance programs can be extremely costly and complicated. For employers operating in multiple states, where requirements vary from state to state, developing compliance programs can be almost impossible. There is no justification for different requirements in different states. The risk posed by certain hazards may vary from industry to industry and workplace to workplace, but not from state to state. Therefore, different states do not need different requirements. National workplace health and safety standards should be developed exclusively at the federal level.
<p>
National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined in a department that has been, and continues too be, subject to political influence. Independence and objectivity are crucial. The potential costs and benefits are too high for politics to play any role. The "new" OSHA should be a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. Its members would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for staggered six-year terms. The board would be responsible for standards promulgation, oversight of a peer-review process, and issuance of compliance directives. It also would report its activities to Congress twice a year and be subject to congressional oversight hearings.
<p>
<b>IV. REFORM PRIVATE PENSION PROTECTION.</b>
<p>
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was enacted in 1974 to protect the assets in employee pension plans that provide workers with retirement benefits promised by their employers. The Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA) is the DoL agency that administers and enforces ERISA. ERISA protects the integrity of assets by requiring administrators of private pension and welfare plans52 to comply with strict fiduciary responsibility standards.53  It also requires administrators to provide participants with easily understood summaries of their plans, to file those summaries with PWBA, and to report annually on the financial operation of plans and the bonding of persons charged with handling funds and assets. Jurisdiction is shared by the PWBA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Generally, PWBA has authority over Title I of ERISA,54 the IRS has authority over Title II,55and PBGC has authority over Title IV.56
<p>
PWBA is responsible for overseeing 720,000 pension plans and 4.5 million health and welfare plans in the private sector. ERISA-covered private pension plans cover over 88 million working Americans and their dependents and hold approximately $2 trillion in assets. Over 100 million workers are covered by employer-sponsored health and welfare plans. Three-quarters of PWBA's $65 million budget and 582 FTEs (full-time equivalent employees) is dedicated to enforcement focused on compliance with fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA. PWBA audits plans and conducts criminal and civil investigations. In 1993, the government carried out 6,033 investigations. 
<p>
President Clinton proposed to increase PWBA's budget by 17.1 percent. The House recently voted to reduce PWBA's FY 1996 spending by 7.5 percent and the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a 5.2 percent reduction. The House budget bill also prohibits the Department of Labor from promoting economically targeted investments with respect to private pension plans covered by ERISA. It specifically prohibits both the implementation of last year's PWBA Interpretive Bulletin and the funding of any Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse. The Senate Appropriations Committee deleted this House provision.
<p>
The primary focus of ERISA legislation this year is health insurance reform. In the House, Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) has introduced the ERISA Targeted Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 995), which would provide for health insurance portability, increased participation, improved plan solvency, and other consumer protections for workers. Senator Kassebaum has introduced the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028), the provisions of which are a subset of H.R. 995. S. 1028 was approved by the Senate Labor Committee.
<p>
A few bills reforming ERISA's pension provisions have been introduced in Congress. The most comprehensive bill, the Pension Simplification Act of 1995 (H.R. 2037 and S. 1006), has been introduced by Representative Rob Portman (R-OH) and Senator David Pryor (D-AR). These identical bills would create alternative methods for satisfying nondiscrimination provisions, repeal the family aggregation provision, repeal 5-year income averaging for lump-sum distributions, repeal the $5,000 exclusion of employees' death benefits, simplify the method for taxing annuity distributions under certain employer plans, and target access to pension plans for small employers.
<p>
The House has passed H.R. 1594, introduced by Representative John Saxton (R-NJ), to place restrictions on the promotion of economically targeted investments in connection with employee benefit plans by the Department of Labor and other federal agencies. A similar bill (S. 774) has been introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL).
<p><blockquote>
	Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. Transferring PWBA to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. Combining PWBA with HHS also would be a good first step toward privatizing Social Security.57
</blockquote><P>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Abolish the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse.</b>
<p>
In 1994, DoL established the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse (ETIC) to provide information on investment opportunities to pension plan managers. This program is DoL's way of encouraging pension plans to invest in areas of the economy that bureaucrats and politicians feel are underfinanced by private capital markets. It is misguided and jeopardizes the safety of pension plan assets.58  Tax dollars should not be used as another form of corporate welfare to market public investment choices to pension plan managers. If an investment, public or private, provides a good opportunity to pension plan managers, they will allocate plan funds accordingly. 
<p>
<b> Eliminate the Office of Inspector General's independent investigative authority.</b>
<p>
The experience and expertise for investigating fraud and abuse involving employee benefit plans reside in the PWBA. The existence of competing enforcement authorities within the DoL creates confusion and leads to duplication of effort. In recent years, PWBA has increased its efforts to bring criminal cases. As a result, PWBA investigators not only have expertise regarding how plans operate, but also know how to work criminal cases.
<p>
<b>Remove ESOPs from Title I (fiduciary standards) of ERISA.</b>
<p>
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are hybrid benefit plans with two often competing goals. They are designed to increase employee ownership in companies and thereby improve productivity. They also are treated as retirement plans, with participants allowed to defer taxes on the value of their stock until it is withdrawn at retirement. Although ESOPs are governed by ERISA's fiduciary rules, several tax code sections give them special treatment not available to other retirement plans. Because the nature and financing of ESOPs are not always compatible with ERISA's rules, PWBA has struggled to accommodate ESOPs under the rules without damaging the fiduciary requirements that generally work well for other retirement plans. The result has been confusing and complicated rulings and legal standards. Congressional intent clearly has been to foster employee ownership. Trying to incorporate ESOPs into an Act designed to protect retirement income will only undermine this goal.
<p>
<b>Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration to the Social Security Administration, spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance. </b>
<p>
This would combine the agencies responsible for oversight of public and private retirement programs and result in more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a semi-independent, wholly owned government corporation modeled after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and guided by a board of directors. Congress should fund the PBGC separately and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.59 
<p>

<b> V. ELIMINATE OBSOLETE WORKPLACE STANDARDS.</b>
<p>
The Employment Standards Administration (ESA) administers and directs programs under a variety of federal labor laws and executive orders. The Wage and Hour Division: <p><ul>
<li>Administers and enforces federal minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act; 
<p>
<li>Determines prevailing wage rates for federal contracts subject to the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts;
<p>
<li>Registers farm labor contractors and enforces worker protections of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act; and
<p>
<li> Enforces provisions and restrictions of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act. </ul>
<p>
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs administers and enforces Executive Order 11246, as amended, which requires federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in hiring. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers the three basic federal workers' compensation laws:  the Federal Employees Compensation Act, Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and Black Lung Benefits Act.
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's major labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but America's labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. The heavy burden of outdated and restrictive workplace rules reduces job opportunities and real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and requirements now makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers and is one of the forces leading employers to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor. 
<p>
The House of Representatives recently voted to reduce ESA's FY 1996 spending by 12.2 percent.60  The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a 9.9 percent reduction. Both bills prohibit funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, and the House plans to repeal both the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
A number of bills to reform America's labor laws also have been introduced in Congress.61  The House recently passed the Teamwork for Employees and Management Act (H.R. 743) to allow employers to create employee involvement committees. A similar bill (S. 295) has been introduced in the Senate by Nancy Kassebaum.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Nullify Executive Order 11246, as amended, and all affirmative action provisions in federal law.</b>
<p>
Executive Order 11246, as amended,62 and its implementing regulations prohibit federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and requires them to take affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity for protected groups. Contractors must develop a written plan covering each of their establishments that includes remedial steps to correct underutilization of available women and minorities.
<p>
Federal contractors and subcontractors already must comply with existing civil rights laws without the executive order. Laws requiring non-discrimination in employment are enforced through agencies at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice. There are other, more equitable ways to expand employment opportunities for all Americans without requiring preferential hiring simply because individuals belong to certain groups. In addition, the regulations to implement Executive Order 11246 impose 20.4 million hours of paperwork (9,795 full-time, year-round workers) on federal contractors and subcontractors, the single largest DoL paperwork requirement.
<p>
A recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action concluded that "the federal government can no longer make decisions based on the race of the individual except when there is a compelling governmental interest."63  Concurring, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, "In my view, government can never have a 'compelling interest' in discriminating on the basis of race in order to 'make up' for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction."  Further, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, "Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That these programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race."
<P>
<b>Repeal the Davis-Bacon and related Acts and the Service Contract Act.</b>
<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion workers -- chiefly blacks and Hispanics -- from competing for federally funded construction jobs.64  Unfortunately for these workers, it has succeeded. This year's budget process may be the only real opportunity to put an end to this Depression-era law that contributes to racial discrimination, needlessly costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special interests. If only the facts were at issue, there would be no need for debate -- the Davis-Bacon Act would be repealed. However, repeal is threatened once again by intense pressure from special interests seeking to preserve their generous subsidies. Congress must withstand this pressure, act in the interests of all American workers, and repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. 
<p>
The Service Contract Act (SCA) artificially inflates the cost of federal service contracts by as much as $500 million per year and, like Davis-Bacon, creates an unfair barrier for many unskilled entry-level workers, who tend to be poor and minorities. DoL has long been criticized for the way it operates under this law. Despite two amendments,65 the SCA continues to suffer from statutory ambiguity, administrative problems, arbitrary requirements, and capricious enforcement.66  The General Accounting Office has recommended repealing the SCA because of DoL's "inability to administer the act efficiently and effectively" and because "it is impractical, in our opinion, to make 'prevailing wage' determinations under the act in a consistently equitable manner."67  Outdated by extensions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to service workers, the SCA has become an unnecessary and costly bureaucratic burden that should be repealed.
<p>
<b>Reform the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options.</b>
<p>
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted to protect unskilled, low-pay workers. However, in today's economy where both parents likely are working, its rigid and inflexible provisions hurt more than help. The FLSA deprives workers of the right to order their daily lives on and off the job to meet the responsibilities of work and home. For example, under the FLSA a worker who wants to work 35 hours one week  in order to attend a child's parent-teacher conference, in exchange for working 45 hours the following week, either must forgo five hours of pay or have an employer willing to pay overtime the second week. Congress should extend to private workers the same freedom that federal employees have -- flextime -- and enable employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options to their workers.68  
<p>
<b>Reform the National Labor Relations Act to remove restrictions on the ability for employers to create employee involvement structures.</b>
<p>
Employee involvement (EI) structures are a way to involve workers in business operations to improve productivity, safety, and customer service. Under current law, however, the only discussions of workplace issues that are clearly legal between employers and employees are those that occur in traditional collective bargaining arrangements. Employers can listen to their nonunion employees but cannot respond to their views without risking litigation and significant legal costs. Further, the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations noted that the most legally vulnerable EI structures are "those that take a broader, more systemic approach to participation that the evidence suggests have the greatest long-term, positive effects on economic performance."69  Congress should reform the National Labor Relations Act to exempt EI structures formed to address issues of quality, productivity, safety, and customer service.

<b>Transfer immigrant worker oversight and enforcement functions to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</b>
<p>
In the late 1940s, DoL's immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Since then, the federal government has shifted some of its immigration responsibilities to employers70 and added new DoL enforcement requirements.71  Responsibility for immigration policy once again is fragmented. Transferring DoL's immigration functions to the INS would combine the responsibility for federal immigration programs in one agency and facilitate more efficient immigration policy coordination.
<p>
<b>Transfer any remaining ESA programs to more appropriate departments or sub-Cabinet agencies.</b>
<p>
Legal enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act should be transferred to the Justice Department. Responsibility for federal workers' compensation laws and black lung benefits -- both primarily health-related income assistance programs -- should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. Responsibility for all employment discrimination complaints should be consolidated in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
<b>VI. GIVE GREATER INDEPENDENCE TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.</b><p>
The American statistical system is one of the most decentralized data-producing systems in the world. Eleven specifically statistical federal agencies spend more that $1 billion annually. Further, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has found more than 70 individual agencies spending more than $500,000 a year for statistical activities and estimates that the federal government spent at almost $2.7 billion in FY 1994 for statistical operations.72
<p>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the primary federal data-gathering agency in the broad field of labor economics and prices. It has no enforcement or regulatory functions and operates somewhat independently from DoL. The BLS collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates data relating to employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the labor market. It also publishes data on consumer and producer prices and workplace health and safety. Most of the data are collected by voluntary surveys conducted by the BLS and the Bureau of the Census, or on a cooperative basis with state agencies.
<p>
Change is needed. The current structure of the federal statistical system is inefficient and ineffective.73  The problems with the U.S. statistical system result directly or indirectly from fragmentation across the federal government. The system has neither the advantages that come from centralization nor the efficiency that comes from strong coordination of a decentralized system. As currently organized, it will be hard-pressed to meet the data demands of a technologically advanced and increasingly global economy.
<p>
The House recently voted to reduce BLS spending for fiscal year 1996 by 1.3 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 6.1 percent reduction. Both bills double the amount appropriated for revising the consumer price index (CPI).
<p>


What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Transfer the BLS into a new sub-Cabinet Bureau of National Statistics along with the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</b>
<p>
Consolidating the Census Bureau, the BLS, and the BEA in a centralized system is "the most effective solution to the problems of the federal statistical system."74  A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. The BNS also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Incorporating the Bureau of Economic Analysis into the BNS is essential if the new bureau is to influence priorities for the broad array of statistical information required for the national income and product accounts. Reforming the system will assure a much better use of the tax dollars currently being spent on statistics.
<p>
Three major concerns need to be addressed. 
<p>
1) The BNS should be run by an independent Board of Directors, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for a fixed term similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
<p>
2) To ensure that the public's response to voluntary surveys is not jeopardized, the BNS should be given complete legal confidentiality for all information collection activity. Data sharing arrangements with other agencies, for statistical purposes only, could be maintained under carefully controlled procedures approved and administered by the BNS Board.
<p>
3) Any administrative savings should stay within the agency to improve the quality and quantity of the nation's statistical information. Providing accurate information to the public and their state and local representatives is an important function of the federal government. 
<p>
<b> VII. ELIMINATE THE OFFICE OF THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE.</b><p>
The Office of the American Workplace (OAW), created in 1993 by Secretarial Order, is responsible for administering and directing discretionary workplace programs that encourage the development of "high performance" workplaces.75  OAW also is responsible for administering statutory programs to certify employee protections of various federally sponsored transportation programs, overseeing the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions, and assisting unions in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently has assigned OAW the task of implementing President Clinton's executive order prohibiting the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors. 
<p>
OAW carries out these functions through two offices:  the Office of Workplace Programs (OWP) and the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS). In FY 1995, of OAW's total budget authority of $31.4 million and 400 employees, $7.4 million went to OWP and $24.0 million to OLMS. For FY 1996, the President requested $41.8 million, or 33 percent more. Both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees have voted to eliminate OWP and transfer OLMS to DoL's Employment Standards Administration. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Workplace Programs. </b>
<P>
In addition to setting up a clearinghouse for information on high performance workplaces, OWP provides funds to unions to train labor leaders on what constitutes a high performance workplace. However well intentioned this may be, the federal government should not subsidize businesses and unions to teach them about the concept of "high performance" workplaces. This is more appropriately a function of business associations, chambers of commerce, and labor unions themselves. It is corporate and union welfare and should be eliminated.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Labor-Management Standards.</b>
<p>
Nor should American tax dollars subsidize unions to "assist" them in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. These functions should be eliminated, the number of full-time equivalent positions in OLMS should be reduced significantly, and OLMS field offices should be eliminated. The investigative and union oversight functions of the office should be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the Department of Justice.76
<p>
<b>Repeal Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. </b>
<p>
Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration Act of 1964 gives public transit the most restrictive labor environment in America. To receive federal funds, local public transit agencies must pay employees up to six years of severance pay if their jobs are eliminated as a result of efficiency improvements. No other workers enjoy such special privilege. Should public transit agencies pursue service improvements that lead to fewer workers, their mandated 13(c) liability can surpass the federal funds they receive.77  Although many local governments are trying to improve their public transportation systems through competitive contracting and allowing private sector suppliers to operate, Section 13(c) discourages or blocks these efforts. 
<p>
Section 13(c) also adds to public transit costs and discourages efficiency by giving labor unions special privileges. Before a public transit agency can receive a federal grant, DoL must certify that special protective arrangements for local transit workers have been made. DoL generally interprets this to require negotiation of special labor agreements between the public transit agency and its union.
<p>
Public transit agencies want desperately to improve service and lower costs. At the same time, however, unnecessarily high labor costs make them unable to withstand a long period without federal funding. Section 13(c) has created this "Catch 22" for most public transit authorities and should be repealed. 
<p>
<b> VIII. STREAMLINE DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT.</b><P>
The Departmental Management (DM) appropriation provides funding for a number of different programs that manage, set policy, and oversee its implementation at DoL. This includes the Office of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, the Solicitor's office, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, the Civil Rights office, and the Women's Bureau.
<P>
In FY 1995, DM's total budget authority was about $155 million and 2,548 employees. Over half the budget, $82 million, went to legal services and adjudication, and $26 million went to executive direction. For FY 1996, the President requested $173.1 million, or almost 12 percent more. The House recently voted to reduce DM spending for FY 1996 by 13.2 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 7.6 percent reduction. The House substantially downsized the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, noting in its report that the bureau's activities are primarily discretionary and could be carried out by the Office of the Trade Representative or the State Department. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), the Women's Bureau, the Civil Rights office, and the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee. </b>
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs, Women's Bureau, Civil Rights office, and National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee either duplicate existing federal functions or perform unneeded functions. 
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs coordinates the Department's international responsibilities, including relations with international organizations, estimating the impact of trade proposals, and ensuring compliance with worker rights provisions in U.S. trade law. These functions duplicate those carried out by the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of State.
<p>
The purpose of the Women's Bureau is to promote "the welfare of wage earning women and [seek] to improve their working conditions, to increase their efficiency and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."78  The mission of the Department of Labor, including the Secretary, is to promote the employment opportunities of all Americans. There is no need for a separate bureau devoted to women, just as there are none devoted to other minorities, such as African Americans, Native Americans, or Asian Americans. 
<p>
The Civil Rights office ensures compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as other regulatory nondiscrimination provisions in programs receiving financial assistance from DoL, and promotes equal opportunity in these programs and activities. It also makes sure that all Department of Labor employees and applicants are treated equally. There should not be a separate appropriation for this activity within the department. All agencies within DoL should ensure that their programs are carried out in a nondiscriminatory manner. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against by the department can file complaints under existing laws enforced by the Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
Despite what federal officials may think, the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee is not a necessary federal function. After funding for job training is consolidated into state block grants, the states should be given the option of setting up their own committees, in the event they decide that such committees would be useful, and funding them out of their block grants.

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but U.S. labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. Further, proliferating workplace legislation and DoL regulations to enforce them present a significant barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs, as well as to increases in real wages. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws, and this means a fundamental rethinking of both the Department of Labor and federal labor policy. 
<p>
The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department. If the recommendations in this study are implemented, $10.5 billion can be saved for the taxpayer from 1996 to 2000.
<p>
	Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Labor does not fit this description. Administering unemployment insurance, three-quarters of DoL's budget, is a state function and should be devolved to the states as a first step toward privatization. Ineffective federal job training programs should be consolidated into state block grants and rigorously studied. OSHA should be significantly reformed, combined with MSHA, and set up as an independent sub-Cabinet agency free from political influence. America's statistics would be improved by combining the BLS with the Bureau of the Census as another sub-Cabinet agency. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down. What remains of the Department of Labor, less than 2 percent of its budget, then could be transferred to more appropriate Cabinet-level agencies like HHS, Treasury, and Justice. There is no reason for these remaining functions to be conducted by an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

<li>    The current 0.8 percent FUTA tax rate has two components:  a permanent tax rate of 0.6 percent and a temporary surtax of 0.2 percent. The surtax was passed in 1976 to restore depleted state UI accounts and was supposed to expire in 1987. The surtax has been extended four times, primarily to fund extended benefit programs, since 1987 and now is supposed to expire in 1998.<p>

<li>    The balance in the Employment Security Administration Account will be $2.4 billion in September 1995. This is $1.01 billion more than the statutory limit. There is also a $7.4 billion balance in the Federal Unemployment Account that has been built up using surplus FUTA payroll taxes.<p>

Meyer, "The Impact of the Potential Duration of Unemployment Benefits on the Duration of Unemployment," National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 2741, October 1988. This study concluded that extending the duration of UI benefits from six months to one year will increase the mean duration of unemployment by four to five weeks. Examples of federal programs that increase the duration of UI benefits are the Extended Benefits Program and Trade Adjustment Assistance.<p>
<li>    In today's economy, the primary purpose of the UI/ES system is to move workers whose jobs are permanently lost into new ones as quickly as possible.<p>
 <li>   Daniel S. Hamermesh, "New Estimates of the Incidence of Payroll Tax," <i>Southern Economic Journal</i>, Winter 1979. Research on the incidence of taxation generally has concluded that payroll taxes are borne predominantly, if not completely, by labor in the long run through lower real wages.<p>
<li>    Bruce D. Meyer, " Policy Lessons from the U.S. Unemployment Insurance Experiments," National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 4197, October 1992. The willingness and ability of states to explore innovative ways to reduce UI duration is evident from the number of state UI experiments that have been wholly state funded. <p>
<li>   The actual gross FUTA tax rate is 6.2 percent. However, employers in states with federally approved UI programs (all 50 states) may credit 5.4 percent (90 percent FUTA offset) against the 6.2 percent tax rate, making the net FUTA tax rate 0.8 percent.<p>
 <li>   The 1992 amendment allowed states to trigger EB based on a certain percentage of total unemployment rate (TUR) instead of an adjusted insured unemployment rate (IUR). The IUR is computed by dividing the number of people claiming UI benefits by the number in jobs covered by UI. The TUR is the ratio of all unemployed workers to all workers in the labor force in that state. Eight states (Alaska, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) have approved the use of TUR triggers.<p>
<li>    Benefits generally are paid to workers with substantial labor force attachment who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own -- not to workers who quit their jobs voluntarily, who were fired for cause, or who have had no recent employment, such as those who are entering or reentering the labor force. Some of the difference between the insured unemployment rate and the total employment rate is due also to the exclusion of self-employed, certain agricultural labor and domestic service workers, railroad workers, and certain seasonal camp workers from collecting UI benefits.<p>
<li>    FUTA funds are deposited indirectly in the FUA when the EUCA and Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA) have reached their statutory limits. The ESAA is used to finance the administrative costs of the employment security program and should be phased out. Funds in the ESAA should be allocated to state UI accounts for the administration of state UI programs.<p>
<li>    <i>From Red Tape to Results</i>, p. 80.<p>
<li>   The TAA provides benefits to workers for 78 weeks, while the vast majority of other laid-off Americans, who qualify only for unemployment insurance, receive just 26 weeks of benefits.<p>
<li>    In its 1993 semiannual report to Congress, the Department of Labor Inspector General (OIG) discovered in a nine-state audit of the program that "After 19 years of operation, neither ETA nor the states know whether the TAA program is effective" in achieving its original goals of helping workers find suitable employment. The OIG found that only one in ten former participants "found new training-related employment that paid or had the potential to pay suitable wages."  Although the Act requires that participants enroll in approved training courses, " participants who did not wish to attend training were almost always granted waivers without losing entitlement allowance." <p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.2<p>	Despite its name, however, the Corporation does not use its budget (currently $400 million) to provide direct legal services to the poor. Rather, it distributes federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country. These grantees also receive another $255 million from lawyer groups, local and state governments, interest on lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA), and private sources.3<p>	Unfortunately, taxpayer-funded legal groups, under LSC, engage in political, lobbyist, and cause-advocacy activities, often at the expense of providing real legal services needed by poor people.
<p>
	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias. Attorneys have promoted racial preferences and illegal immigration, and grantees are sufficiently politicized to become involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning on ballot referendum questions. For the past 30 years, the LSC has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation, advocacy, and lobbying, it has caused an increase in local, state, and federal welfare spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and has effected the addition of millions of people to the welfare rolls.4  It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in other states. It even has engaged in actions -- litigating to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for example -- that harm the poor.<p>	During the 1980s, even though its budget was cut by Congress, the program survived an attempt by the Reagan Administration to eliminate it. Now, however, just as welfare itself is being debated in Congress, so is the LSC's future. Like the War on Poverty itself, the Legal Services Corporation has failed. It should be abolished.
<p>

<b>LEGAL SERVICES AS POLITICAL MOVEMENT</b>
<p>
	Legal Services sees itself as a "movement."5<p>	  According to its founders, its primary mission is not to meet the needs of individual poor people, but to achieve broader social change through "law reform."6<p>	  The Legal Services agenda is grounded in the belief that the "system" creates poverty; therefore, it is the system -- America's economic, political, and cultural institutions -- that must be altered. To this end, the LSC:
<p>
Attempts to effect a redistribution of income by litigating increases in transfer payments through class action suits against local, state, and federal governments;
<p>
Is at the forefront of the so-called rights revolution, litigating to promote "children's rights,"7 to protect aggressive panhandling,8 and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets;9 and
<p>
Engages in lobbying and political advocacy. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers," national in scope and organized around specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food,10 function as the legal arm of a host of social and political causes.<p>	The LSC says grantees handled 1.6 million matters last year. Supporters say allegations of ideological bias are without merit and that, due to sheer volume, it is inevitable that the program will become involved in some controversial cases. But a review of thousands of cases and news articles11clearly indicates that the LSC has never filed a major case opposed to the goals of the homosexual, feminist, or environmental movements or designed to help poor clients preserve the right to home schooling, defend the right to own firearms, stop the establishment of substance abuse facilities in their neighborhoods, or challenge any type of gender or ethnic quota.<p><b>AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY</b><p>	The Legal Services Corporation cannot be reformed because it was designed to avoid external controls. In affect, it takes public funds and transforms them into private funds, immune from the safeguards that govern other federal spending.
<P>
	The LSC's unique structure, established by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (drafted in part by Alan Houseman, a legal services movement theoretician) guarantees a lack of accountability. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation which makes grants to separately incorporated, private, nonprofit grantees, some of which make subgrants to other groups and to each other. An eleven-member board is appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation,12 but has little actual influence over grantees and how they spend their grant money. Presidents Ronald Reagan and (to a lesser extent) George Bush appointed LSC critics to the board, but they were unable to effect any real reform. Moreover, by law, the LSC's budget is submitted directly to Congress. All the Office of Management and Budget can do is review it.13<p>	The LSC's status as a private corporation also exempts it from many provisions of the federal criminal code, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act, that apply to government officials. While it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act declares that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought to exercise oversight. They have been all but ignored. Since most grantees receive at least some funding from IOLTA funds and from state and local governments, they can claim that any restricted activities are not supported by LSC funds. The result:  Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy are ignored or circumvented.
<p>
	There is no way to confirm resource allocation claims because LSC attorneys do not keep time sheets. Attorney time is the most valuable asset in any law office, and timekeeping is absolutely <i>de riguer</i> at any private firm. Lack of timekeeping prevents oversight by eliminating the only real way to track the activities of Legal Services lawyers.
<p>
	LSC lawyers do not report their cases to anyone outside their offices, and all client and case records are closed. This secrecy, based on invocation of attorney-client privilege, makes it impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of Legal Services attorneys. Moreover, there are no provisions for the waiving of this privilege for purposes of oversight, even though tax funds pay for the services rendered.
<p>
	Because of these built-in problems, there is little information on expenditures, either per case or per type of case. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, Legal Services continues to ask for government funding without offering any detailed evidence of how it has used money already received.
<p>
	At present, the only way the LSC can track how grants are used is through a monitoring program involving on-site visits to programs by Washington-based staff. During the Bush Administration, about 125 visits took place annually, so the average program could expect a visit only once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, this largely ineffective program has been weakened to the point where only six monitoring visits took place last year.
<P>
	It makes little difference who sits in the White House, in Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as they flow through the LSC to its 323 grantees, public funds will be spent to further a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman wrote in a 1984 history of the LSC, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."14<p><b>POLITICS AND SURVIVAL</b><p>	After the election of Ronald Reagan, even though the LSC supposedly is restricted in its ability to lobby Congress,15 officials directed a "survival campaign"16 that cost millions of dollars and mobilized thousands of Legal Services lawyers. This effort included such activities as training activists to lobby;17 transferring hundreds of thousands of LSC dollars to sympathetic outside organizations;18 orchestrating positive media coverage; and generating thousands of phone calls, letters, and visits to Congress.19  Some LSC offices were advised to have receptionists respond to potential clients by saying:  "I'm sorry but at this time we are unable to handle this kind of case. Due to the recent proposed federal cutbacks, we have had to reduce our caseload drastically. It would be unethical for us to take any cases.... "20<p>	An LSC grantee, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA) became the "corporation in exile."  Having received no more than $72,900 annually in LSC support before 1981, NLADA received $2.2 million in late 1981. Staff members responsible for awarding the grants went on the NLADA payroll after leaving the LSC.21  This effort was known as "saving the rubies," a reference to the action of Czar Nicholas in sending the Russian Crown Jewels to Switzerland for safekeeping during the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.<p>	In 1983, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee conducted oversight hearings on the survival campaign. Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) concluded that "The political abuses by LSC and many of its gr
ant recipients were not simply isolated anomalies. They were the business of Legal Services. They were committed on a national scale and were planned by key members of the LSC's national leadership."
<p>
	Also in 1983, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that the LSC survival campaign had violated the law.22  This prompted a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. In July 1984, Assistant Attorney General Stephen S. Trott asserted that "the unauthorized activities of the Corporation, and many people associated with it, are uniquely reprehensible and beyond the scope of LSC's original mission" but that "notwithstanding these inappropriate, misguided, and abusive activities, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1913 as well as the federal theft and fraud laws -- for technical reasons -- were not violated by the lobbying activities involved here."23  Among these "technical reasons," of course, was the fact that LSC employees are not subject to laws that apply to federal employees.<p>	LSC grantees have sought to affect the composition of Congress through redistricting litigation. In 1989, the LSC board banned grantees from participating in redistricting cases, only to be sued by Texas Rural Legal Aid, California Rural Legal Assistance, and North Mississippi Rural Legal Services. A U.S. Appeals Court upheld the prohibition, "particularly in light of the Act's mandate to LSC to ensure that the legal services program remain free from partisan political involvement.... " According to Judge (now former White House Counsel) Abner Mikva, "we cannot conclude that LSC has no right to prohibit its grantees from engaging in partisan activities."24<p>	In addition to grants, the legal services infrastructure benefits from money litigated away from taxpayers. The National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas in 1993 to expand its child welfare system and won $314,107 in legal fees.25  Kansas Legal Services has charged clients up to $100 per hour for filing Social Security disability insurance cases, collecting almost $2 million in fees from money awarded in these actions.26<p><b>PROMOTING WELFARE DEPENDENCY</b>
<p>
	LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions in expanded welfare, AFDC,27 Medicaid, and food stamp benefits. Legal Services also has expanded welfare by seeking to nullify any "moral" conditions connected to its provision, such as a requirement for identifying the fathers of illegitimate children;28 by attacking citizenship29 and residency requirements;30 and by signing up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security disability insurance benefits.31  Western Massachusetts Legal Services (WMLS) has published a brochure advising lottery winners that they can stay on welfare by such devices as prepaying rent, buying a special gift, or taking a vacation.32  In 1994, WMLS filed suit to get Arthur Cooney back on welfare after he admittedly had spent the $75,000 he won in a 1992 lottery on drugs and gambling.33<p>	While the exact amount cannot be calculated, government spending for LSC litigation, advocacy, and lobbying has contributed significantly to the national debt. In 1973, former OEO Legal Services Director Earl Johnson, Jr., wrote that "A bare handful of lawyers, scarcely a footnote in the federal budget, has produced massive transfers of goods and services to the poor -- some from the private sector and some from the public treasury."34  Johnson pointed to the initial period between 1965 and 1972, when federal legal services cost the taxpayer a total of $290 million:<p><blockquote>	     [T]he welfare residency decision already has produced between $300 and $600 million added income for the poor, the 1968 man-in-house decision $400-$800 million, the 1969 and 1970 food stamp cases have thus far produced over $450 million in additional food stamp allotments, the prior hearing case over $200-$300 million. The California Medicaid suit saved $200 million in health services, the New York Medicaid case thus far has saved $367 million, and other actions undoubtedly have generated several million in additional income. Thus a total dividend in excess of $2 billion actually has been received by th
e poor since the beginning of the federal investment in legal services to the poor.35 </blockquote><p>		 Asserting that the program's "benefits" outweighed its "cost" by a ratio of 7 to 1, Johnson further calculated that since benefits were won in the form of entitlements, and therefore would continue many years into the future, the actual ratio was closer to 34 to 1.36<p>	Legal Services now seeks to protect earlier gains. To this end, LSC lawyers have responded to the 1988 Family Support Act, which allowed states to seek waivers from the federal government to experiment with welfare, by suing to obstruct or stop virtually every reform that has been attempted.
<p>
	In 1993, for example, Legal Services of New Jersey sued both the state and federal governments to prevent implementation of a cap on AFDC benefits designed to discourage illegitimacy.37<p>	In 1995, the Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI) filed a class action suit challenging Governor Evan Bayh's welfare reform plan, which includes a work requirement and benefit reduction for families that fail to get their children immunized or to send them to school.38  An LSOI-employed lobbyist organized opposition to the plan when it was before the Indiana legislature.39<p>	Legal Services also has sued to block welfare reform in California, New York, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Should Congress enact a serious overhaul of the welfare system, it is safe to assume that LSC lawyers will fight its implementation in the courts as well.<p><b>HELPING TO DESTROY PUBLIC HOUSING</b>
<p>
	One of the major problems in public housing today is drug-related crime. In Georgia, according to John Hiscox, Executive Director of the Macon Housing Authority (MHA), "One of the most difficult and persistent obstacles to removing drug-related, criminal activity from public housing has been Georgia Legal Services."  While it has never won a case, GLS routinely demands costly jury trials. The result:  The MHA's average legal cost for an eviction went from a few hundred dollars in 1987 to $8,000 in 1990. During the same period, its annual legal bill increased from $10,000 to $90,000.
<p>
	In 1989, Georgia Legal Services tried to prevent the eviction of Tina Burke, whose apartment was surrounded by gangs of young men and lookouts. During surveillance, police witnessed her presence during drug transactions in her apartment. But GLS maintained that she lacked knowledge of such transactions. In 1994, tenant Shon Scott was arrested after leaving a crack house two blocks from his residence. Along with a firearm and a beeper, he possessed 33 pieces of crack cocaine. He pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute. GLS fought Scott's eviction on the basis that his crimes did not take place on public housing property.40<p>	In New York City, the Legal Aid Society of New York went to court in 1994 to challenge the New York Housing Authority's plan to make it easier to evict drug dealers by cutting the process (which now can take as long as three years) to only three to four months. The Interim Council of Presidents, the organization representing public housing tenant groups, filed a brief in support of faster evictions. Tenants say they cannot sit out at night, let their children play after dark, or even visit others in their own buildings.41<p>	In Pennsylvania, when the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) attempted to evict a woman who allegedly was dealing drugs, loan sharking, and extorting money from other tenants, an LSC grantee filed a federal civil rights suit on her behalf and won on the grounds that the PHA had not given her adequate notice of the charges. Legal Services lawyers obtained $5,500 in legal fees. In 1993, another tenant set fire to her unit and the PHA won her eviction in state court. Legal Services filed a federal civil rights case and won a stay of the eviction. As of June 15, 1995, the case was still pending.42<p>	In Pittsburgh, Neighborhood Legal Services (NLS) has sued Northside Tenants Reorganization (NTR) repeatedly to prevent evictions of tenants responsible for drug dealing, violence, and vandalism. NTR is a tenant group which manages and owns its own low-incom
e housing. NTR Executive Director Harriet Henson and a building manager say they saw a tenant's boyfriend complete a heroin deal. "It took us two years to evict because NLS took us to appeal and appeal and appeal."43<p><b>UNDERMINING THE FAMILY</b><p>	Some Legal Services cases undermine the rights of parents. In 1994, notwithstanding a congressional ban on involvement in abortion litigation, the National Center for Youth Law (NCYL), co-counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, succeeded in overturning a 1987 California law requiring a teenager to seek the approval of a parent or juvenile court judge before getting an abortion. NCYL sought legal fees for 681 hours at $300 per hour from the state. It was awarded two-thirds of the amount it sought, pending eventual success before the California Supreme Court.44<p>	In another area, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law in April 1995 admonished Idaho parents about inviting police into their homes to search for drugs they suspected their children of using. The innovative Canyon County, Idaho, program is completely voluntary, and police make no arrests unless the drugs they find are especially dangerous or in large quantities.45<p>	Other cases also carry serious implications for adoptive parents. In 1993, for example, the Idaho Legal Aid Society (ILAS) sued to take a four-year-old child away from his legal parents. Karla and Leland Swenson had adopted a half-Sioux boy in 1989 when he was one-day old and were raising him on their dairy farm. ILAS claimed the boy should live with Indian relatives even though neither of his natural parents had sought custody. Representing the natural father's Indian sister, ILAS argued that a tribe's efforts to preserve its cultural integrity took precedence over the best interests of the child. The Swensons sold their home to raise funds to continue the legal fight.46<p>	In New Jersey, Somerset-Sussex Legal Services is seeking to take a one-year-old boy away from his adoptive parents because his natural
 father wants him back. Reverend Paul Rack and his wife adopted the baby in February 1994 when he was three weeks old. According to a letter circulated by community leaders in support of the Racks, the natural father is unemployed, has a criminal record, and already cannot support several other children.47<p>	In a third case, however, Legal Services fortunately did not fare well. Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley Legal Services sued to get parental rights for the 16-year-old father of a child conceived by his rape of a 13-year-old. The rapist has a long criminal record and two other illegitimate children. In March 1995, the judge ruled against LVLS and criticized "misguided adults" for bringing the case.48<p>	Several LSC actions advance goals of homosexual activists. In 1993, James Cox and his male "partner" attempted to adopt a child. The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services denied their application because Florida law prohibits homosexual adoption. The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation successfully sued, the state appealed, and the statute in question was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court on April 27, 1995.49  Legal Services of Greater Miami filed a brief in support of the ACLU Foundation's position in this case.<p>	In a similar 1994 case, Brooklyn Law School's Family Law Clinic, another LSC grantee, successfully represented a lesbian seeking to adopt her female "partner's" child. A Family Court ruled that a same-sex partner had the same rights as a stepparent for purposes of the adoption statute.50  In a 1989 case also attempting to equate homosexual relationships with the traditional family, the Legal Aid Society of New York and Community Action for Legal Services, Inc., filed amicus curiae briefs in state courts arguing that a "gay life partner" should have the same right as a spouse to remain in a rent-controlled apartment after the tenant's death. The New York Supreme Court agreed.51<p>	LSC lawyers even have attempted to secure legal recognition of a right to public housi
ng for minors. In a 1993 case, a U.S. Court of Appeals upheld federal requirements that public housing be leased to tenants at least 18 years old, and in 1991, Central Pennsylvania Legal Services sued the Reading, Pennsylvania, Housing Authority for refusing to lease a unit to an unemancipated and unmarried 16-year-old girl.52<p><b>PROMOTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION</b><p>	The Legal Services apparatus has been equally active on issues pertaining to illegal immigration. When the voters of California passed Proposition 187 in 1994 to deny public benefits to illegal aliens, California Rural Legal Assistance, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other groups filed suit to stop its implementation.53  Prior to election day, LSC grantees campaigned against the measure. Claudia Smith, a lawyer with California Rural Legal Assistance, told the media that "It's just a question of whether we have the time or the resources to lay Prop 187 bare."54<p>	The National Immigration Law Center (NILC), a Legal Services support center, sued the state of California over a 1992 law requiring those seeking emergency health services under Medi-Cal to disclose their immigration status. Legal Services attorneys contended that the law should be struck down because it would deter undocumented immigrants from seeking emergency services. The California Supreme Court rejected this argument in December 1994.55  The NILC also condemned Congress's insertion of a stipulation into the $9 billion earthquake relief bill last year prohibiting non-emergency aid to illegal aliens. The amendment denied illegal aliens access to home repair loans, disaster grants, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing assistance, although it did allow them to collect emergency food and clothing.56<p>	The National Immigration Law Center also sued to force the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to stop asking resident aliens to pay $70 to renew green cards issued before 1978. The replacement program was part of an INS effort 
to end widespread document fraud. Legal Services claimed the $70 fee was excessive. A federal judge in Sacramento, however, disagreed and upheld the fee in November 1993.57<p>	This Legal Services activity extends even to the deportation of criminals. In Georgia, for example, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society attempted to halt the deportation of Cuban nationals convicted of committing serious crimes, including attempted murder and drug trafficking. Arriving in 1980 via the Mariel Boatlift, the Cubans committed these crimes while on immigration parole. After their release from prison, their immigration parole was revoked, and authorities subsequently placed them in detention to await return to Cuba. Atlanta Legal Aid lawyers said their detention violated their constitutional rights and international law. In 1993, a U.S. Appeals Court rejected the petition.58<p>	In Massachusetts, Greater Boston Legal Services sued to stop the deportation of an alien resident who had been convicted of serious drug offenses. A Dominican woman was tried, convicted, and sentenced on four drug offenses that took place in 1982, including possession of and intent to distribute cocaine. Twelve years later, in 1994, a U.S. Court of Appeals let the deportation order stand.59  Another case involved the ability of the INS, under the 1986 Immigration Control Act, to deny residency to immigrants with one felony or three misdemeanors. In 1992, California Rural Legal Assistance sued the INS to stop the denial of temporary residency to immigrant agricultural workers with criminal records, arguing that this practice violated both the workers' Fifth Amendment rights and the Administrative Rules Procedure Act. In 1994, a U.S. Appeals Court rejected the Fifth Amendment claims but upheld Legal Services' challenge on administrative grounds.60<p>	Two LSC grantees sued California's Department of Motor Vehicles for refusing to issue drivers' licenses to illegal aliens. As required by law, the DMV requires that all applicants provide proof of legal reside
ncy to obtain licenses. The National Immigration Law Center and California Rural Legal Assistance sued the DMV on behalf of several illegal aliens whose applications had been rejected. A state appeals court ruled that the "DMV is not only authorized but obligated" to deny licenses to illegal aliens.61<p>	In yet another California Rural Legal Assistance case, the organization in 1982 sued U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello for investigating allegations that unqualified aliens had been registered to vote. The purpose of this investigation was not to prosecute improperly registered voters, but to find out whether someone was deliberately signing up unqualified residents. CRLA sued Russoniello on the grounds that his investigation of Spanish-speaking residents was "invidious discrimination."  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument.62<p>	The extremes to which such litigation can be pushed may be indicated in a 1991 case. Two LSC grantees, Texas Rural Legal Aid and the Los Angeles-based National Health Law Program, filed a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services asking it to sue the McAllen, Texas, Medical Center because its security guards wore uniforms allegedly resembling those of Border Patrol agents. Legal Services said this discriminated against illegal aliens because it discouraged them from seeking care.63<p><b>PROMOTING RACIAL PREFERENCES</b><P>	The Legal Services apparatus certainly is no stranger to litigation that promotes racial preference. In 1978, LSC filed an <i>amicus</i> brief supporting the University of California's minority set-aside program in the famous <i>Bakke</i> case. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, declared the UC-Davis set-aside unconstitutional because it reserved places for minorities exclusively because of their race.64<p>	In a 1992 case, the outcome was somewhat different. The Cincinnati, Ohio, quota system, adopted in the 1970s, required that at least 18 percent of all fire personnel be minorities. To achieve this numerical goal, the fi
re division made it a practice to insure that at least 40 percent of all new recruits were minorities. White applicants who scored higher than minority applicants on the civil service exam but were rejected sued the city for reverse discrimination. A U.S. Court of Appeals agreed with the Legal Aid Society of Cincinnati's position and ruled that the white applicants' constitutional rights were not violated.65<p><b>HELPING CRIMINALS</b>
<P>
	In addition to litigating in behalf of criminals the government is seeking to deport, Legal Services lawyers have been active in behalf of domestic criminals. Starting in 1991, for example, Georgia Legal Services has filed petitions for the release of David Nagel from a maximum security mental hospital. Nagel was imprisoned for murdering both his grandparents by slitting their throats in 1981 when they refused to give him the car keys.66<p>	In Florida, Greater Orlando Area Legal Services in 1989 successfully sued the Orange County Jail to stop segregation of HIV-positive inmates. Infected inmates now are placed in the general prison population without notification to other inmates in order to insure their "privacy."  The suit was filed on behalf of 18 former inmates, most of whom were deceased when the case was settled in 1994. After four and a half years of litigation, a federal judge ordered Orange County to pay Greater Orlando Area Legal Services $81,500 in legal fees.67<p><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
	The Legal Services Corporation cannot be reformed. Because money is fungible in the hands of private groups with more than one funding source, no new restrictions can insure the accountability of taxpayer funds. Most legal problems faced by the poor fall into several basic categories:  family, including divorce, custody, guardianship and child support; housing, including landlord/tenant controversies; financial, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and inability to pay bills; consumer; employment; and public benefits. While taxpayer funds are provided to Legal Services for the handling of individual cases, too great a portion of such funds are used to pursue class action suits and ideologically important test cases.
<p>
	Legal Services has helped to destroy the independence and dignity of poor people and to create a permanent underclass. Its activities undermine both the family and the larger community. For the sake of the American taxpayer -- and for the sake of America's poor -- it is time to abolish the Legal Services Corporation.

Real World Investment Pros Scoff <br>
at Treasury Secretary Rubin's "Train Wreck" Scenario</h2>
<i>November 3, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) -785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Several leading investment experts, members of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 member nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy organization -- predict that a failure to pass tax cuts and a balanced budget will do much more harm to financial markets than failing to pay interest and/or principle on U.S. Treasury securities.  In response to Treasury Secretary Rubin's debt limit "crisis," and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta's remarks that Republicans will cause an earthquake in the financial markets due to the possibility of delay in raising the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling, SBSC experts comment:
<P>
"In our opinion, the financial markets are up strong since last November because they are correctly anticipating less government and lower taxes...If the markets were concerned, particularly the bond market, interest rates would have moved up long before now...Long term, the financial markets care much more about tax policy (by a wide margin) than any other single issue...Lower taxes means lower interest rates, stronger economic growth, and higher stock prices...Now, if Congress fails to pass a significant tax cut, then we would be worried."
<i>Mark J. Deschaine, Investment Counselors Incorporated, St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<BR><P>
"During meetings with clients in Boston last week, several portfolio managers, each investing literally billions of dollars of other people's money, all told me the same thing regarding the budget/tax debate in Washington.  They said they would be incredibly bearish if there is any hint of a "sellout" on real deficit reduction to get a deal and would be much more worried about the future of the markets, stocks and bonds, if that happens than if any so-called train wreck scenario unfolds on a short term basis."
<BR><i>James H. Slagter, The Research Network, Wayne, New Jersey</i>
<P>
"The world's financial markets have made clear their strong disapproval of congressional spending through a clear inverse correlation between Congressional spending (or proposing to spend) and the value of the dollar -- a proxy for the U.S. credit rating.  With each new spending bill, such as the crime bill or the failed Balanced Budget Amendment, the dollar tanks...If Congress truly wants to prevent a "train wreck" they had better pursue this balanced budget proposal -- full steam ahead."
<BR><I>James C. Kennedy, Kennedy Capital Management, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<P>
"Worries over a significant backlash in financial markets due to a so-called budget 'train wreck' are grossly overblown.  If some kind of temporary default on federal government securities actually occurred -- though quite doubtful -- the impact on the bond market would likely be small and shortlived.  Indeed, a real threat to U.S. financial markets looms if capital gains tax reduction, including indexation for inflation, were to somehow fall by the wayside.  Since the Republican congressional victories in November 1994, equity markets have been robust, especially small-cap, high-tech stocks.  Markets have been counting on a significant capital gains tax cut; if this fails to materialize then we should be worried."

<h2>REFORMING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN EMPLOYMENT: <br>
HOW TO RESTORE THE LAW OF EQUAL TREATMENT</h2>
<h3>By Nelson Lund</h3><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Committee Brief No. 17<br>
August 2, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center>
<P>
Nelson Lund is Associate Professor of Law at the George Mason
University School of Law. From 1989 to 1992, Professor Lund served
as Associate Counsel to President George Bush. Before that, he
served as law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
and Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department
of Justice.
<P>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<P>
 In his recent speech on affirmative action programs, President
Clinton strongly reaffirmed the federal government's long-standing,
and thoroughly discredited, approach to this subject. That approach
is easy to sum up: Proclaim a fervid opposition to discrimination,
but practice a policy of discriminatory preferences and favoritism
for selected groups. The euphemisms and Orwellian doublespeak
by now are quite familiar:
<P>
President Clinton's embrace of the discriminatory status quo puts
the burden on Congress to initiate meaningful reform. Such reform
must address three principal areas in which the federal government
practices or fosters discriminatory preferences: contract set-asides,
education, and employment. Congress in all likelihood will consider
the following three options.
<P>
<B>OPTION 1: Put the federal government's own house in order.</B>
This approach, which has been embraced by Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole (R-KS) and Representative Charles Canady (R-FL), would
dismantle the notorious system of minority and sex-based quotas
for federal contracts and forbid the federal government from discriminating
in hiring and promotions. Federal contract set-asides increase
the cost of government procurement by preventing agencies from
accepting the low bids on many contracts, and they discriminate
against low-bidding firms that are owned by people of the wrong
color or sex. Abolishing this practice would be a significant
step in the right direction by establishing a level playing field
for the more than $161 billion in federal contracts awarded annually. (1) 
Abolishing discriminatory practices in federal hiring and promotions,
moreover, would substitute individual merit for group status and
give equal legal rights to more than 2.8 million federal employees.

<P>
  The limits of this approach, however, are evident from Chart
1, which shows that the federal government employs only 3.1 percent
of the workers now protected by the principal anti-discrimination
statute. Federal contractors, moreover, would still be allowed
to use discriminatory preferences, and Labor Department bureaucrats
could still bring pressure for "better numbers," so
long as they avoided the imposition of formal goals and timetables.
And discriminatory preferences in college admissions would be
virtually untouched. 
<P>
<B> OPTION 2: Outlaw discriminatory preferences imposed not only
by the federal government, but also by federal contractors and
subcontractors, and by state and local level governments and other
recipients of federal grants.</B> Although this is not a complete
solution, it would extend the principle of equal treatment to
an additional 26.5 million employees of firms that do business
with the federal government and the approximately 16 million Americans
who work for state and local governments. (2) And it would cover practically
all colleges and universities. This approach adopts the well-accepted
principle that the federal government should neither engage in
discrimination nor finance discriminatory conduct by others. That
principle has been applied for many years to protect women and
certain minorities from discrimination by those who do business
with the federal government or who accept federal financial assistance.
<P>
 But, again, this approach leaves something to be desired. Under
this approach, it would still be legal to discriminate against
half of those Americans currently covered by the federal civil
rights law.
<P>
<B> OPTION 3: Require equal treatment for 100 percent of the population
that is now covered by federal civil rights law.</B> The most
complete solution is also the simplest. The Civil Rights Act of
1964 clearly forbade employment discrimination against either
sex and against any racial or ethnic group. Although federal agencies
and the courts have refused to implement Congress's straightforward
mandate, the Congress can now insist that its original intent
be honored. This would extend the principle of equal treatment
to the more than 94 million American employees now covered by
the 1964 Act. Similarly, racial discrimination by federal grantees
 -- which includes almost all colleges and universities  --  has
been formally forbidden for thirty years. Congress need only insist
that this law be enforced as written.
<P>
 This study explains in some detail why Congress should opt for
a comprehensive approach to the problem of discriminatory preferences
in employment. After exploring the illegitimate origins of the
current system, it discusses the nature of the current problem
and explains why partial solutions are unsatisfactory. It also
unmasks the myths behind "voluntary" affirmative action
and the "disparate impact" theory of discrimination.
Finally, it offers an outline of the legislation Congress ought
to consider if it wants to restore the ideal of equal treatment
under the law. 
<P>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<P>
 The Congress of the United States has never sanctioned the discriminatory
conduct that now occurs routinely in the American workplace under
the rubric of "affirmative action." To the contrary,
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination
in employment against any individual "because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Senator
Hubert H. Humphrey (D-MN), who was the Democratic floor manager
for the 1964 Act, assured the Senate that "nothing in the
bill would permit any official or court to require any employer
or labor union to give preferential treatment to any minority
group." (3) Even more dramatically, Humphrey challenged one skeptical
colleague by saying:
<P>
<blockquote> If the Senator can find in title VII... any language which provides
that an employer will have to hire on the basis of percentage
or quota related to color... I will start eating the pages one
after another, because it is not in there. (4)</blockquote>
<P>
 Technically, Senator Humphrey was right. But federal judges and
bureaucrats soon proved him wrong by using Title VII to create
the elaborate system of quotas and preferences that we see all
around us today. This transformation was accomplished through
a series of Orwellian distortions of the law, none of which has
ever been ratified by Congress.
<P>
 Congress can solve all the important problems arising from affirmative
action in the workplace by emphatically reaffirming the law it
enacted in 1964. This would have the effect of repealing the complicated
system of racial and sex-based preferences that have proliferated
thanks to rogue judges and regulators. Congress must understand
that these problems cannot be solved simply by getting the federal
government itself out of the business of discrimination. The most
serious effects of the federal government's twisted interpretation
of Title VII are occurring in the private sector and in state
and local government. Unless Congress addresses those effects,
any claim of leadership will ring hollow indeed.
<P>
<h4>UNDERSTANDING AFFIRMATIVE DISCRIMINATION</h4>
<P>
 Group-based employment preferences are incompatible with the
ideal of equal opportunity that every federal employment statute
has claimed to advance. They are also incompatible with the views
of the overwhelming majority of Americans. (5) For the same reasons
that Congress has quietly accepted the insidious spread of such
preferences, however, it will be reluctant to abolish them. Powerful
special interests, ranging from civil rights lobbyists and labor
unions to significant elements of the business world, will ferociously
defend the discriminatory status quo. Legislators who make their
stand on the principles articulated by Hubert Humphrey and Martin
Luther King, Jr., will be accused of racism, insensitivity, and
political expediency. As a consequence, true expediency may tempt
them to soften the rougher edges in the current system through
cosmetic reforms and empty symbolism, leaving the underlying problem
unresolved.
<P>
 One common perception about affirmative action is that it began
as a benign effort to combat discrimination and has evolved gradually
into the current system of quotas and preferences. Affirmative
action, according to this view, simply requires employers to "cast
a wider net" so that members of historically neglected groups
can enjoy the opportunity to compete on an equal footing for jobs
and promotions. While there is some truth in this view, there
also are indications that it was no accident that "affirmative
action" became a device for smuggling legalized preferences
into the fabric of American life.
<P>
 In September 1965, for example, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued
an executive order requiring federal contractors to agree that
they would take "affirmative action to ensure that applicants
are employed, and that employees are treated during employment,
without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin." (6) 
This sounds perfectly innocuous. Only a few months earlier, however,
Johnson had said that "equality of opportunity is essential,
but not enough." What was really required, according to Johnson,
was a transition to "the next and the more profound stage
of the battle for civil rights.... We seek not just legal equity
but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but
equality as a fact <I>and equality as a result.</I>" (7) 
<P>
 Whatever the original vision of affirmative action may have been,
it soon became a tool for imposing equality of results rather
than equality of opportunity. While federal law on its face forbids
discrimination against members of any racial group or either sex,
this apparently simple principle has been obscured and twisted
by a complex web of lies, censorship, doublespeak, and code words.
Those whom the law now disfavors can be denied a job or promotion
because of their skin color or their sex without being victims
of "discrimination" in its new legal meaning. This miracle
is accomplished by calling the denial either (a) affirmative action
taken to <I>prevent</I> discrimination; (b) an unfortunate side
effect of an attempt to cure "historic injustices";
(c) a prerequisite to achieving "diversity in the workplace";
or (d) the result of a presumption of "social disadvantage"
for everyone in the preferred racial group. 
<P>
  The dizzying and ever-changing array of intellectual rationales
for discrimination has been accompanied by an elaborate code of
misleading language. Quotas become "measurable goals and
specific timetables." When a job applicant is rejected because
of race, it was not really because of his race: it was just that
the favored person had <I>his</I> race counted as a "plus
factor." Or discrimination isn't really bad unless it is
also "stigmatizing" (an effect that apparently can be
experienced only by certain legally favored groups). All of this
evasive rhetoric has arisen because the underlying practices are
so difficult to defend. And because of that difficulty, they are
rarely defended. Instead, they often are just carried out covertly.
But the discriminatory nature of affirmative action cannot be
concealed entirely. 
<P>
 Example: A 1989 poll of <I>Fortune</I> 500 executives indicated
that only 14 percent of these firms even claimed to eschew discriminatory
preferences in favor of merit-based hiring decisions. A majority
of the firms claimed to employ "affirmative action goals,"
and a full 18 percent acknowledged that they have adopted specific
quotas. (8)
<P>
Example: In 1990, Max Frankel, who was then executive editor of
<I>The New York Times</I>, acknowledged that the standard of excellence
that his organization applied to employees depended upon the individual's
skin color:
<P>
 <blockquote>We've reached a critical mass with women. I know that when a
woman screws up it is not a political act for me to go fire them.
I cannot (easily) say that with some of our blacks. They're still
precious, they're still hothouse in management, and if they are
less than good, I would probably stay my hand at removing them
too quickly. It's still a political act and it would hurt the
organization in a larger sense, so you tolerate a little more
in the short term. (9)</blockquote>

Example: The state of California enacted a law setting a goal
that "by fiscal year 1992-93, 30 percent of all new hires
in the California Community Colleges as a system will be ethnic
minorities." (10)

Example: After the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer </I>was criticized
for an editorial advocating that poor black women be encouraged
to use the contraceptive Norplant, the paper's editor announced
a quota of 50 percent minorities and 50 percent women for all
newsroom hires during the succeeding five years. (11)
<P>
Example: The Xerox Corporation has adopted a kind of "hidden
hand" alternative to quotas: Annual bonuses are based in
part on a manager's success in promoting blacks and women. (12)

has announced that no white males will be hired "until we
[do] more for minorities and women." (13)

of its workforce by hiring more women, the U.S. Forest Service's
Pacific Southwest Region created "upward mobility positions"
limited to "applicants who do not meet the [Office of Personnel
Management] qualifications requirements." A Forest Service
spokesman defended its amazing search for <I>unqualified</I> workers
with the following revealing comment: "On its face, this
seems bizarre. However, the intent  if not the choice of language
 was appropriate to the circumstances.... " (14)
<P>
Example: On January 20, 1995, Oklahoma City decided to withdraw
from the U.S. Department of Justice's Police Hiring Supplement
Grant program, under which it had been authorized to hire 25 officers.
Police Chief Sam Gonzales objected to a Justice Department letter
that demanded an "underutilization analysis" for women
and minorities and an affirmative action plan including specific
steps to achieve "goals" for correcting the underutilization
that the Justice Department <I>assumed must exist</I>. Justice
Department officials also demanded that the city develop a specific
plan for the "equal employment of women and minorities within
the Police Department's sworn personnel." Chief Gonzales
commented: "I believe this particular language to be very
significant in that it states `equal employment' of women and
minorities rather than `equal employment opportunity.'" (15)
<P>
<h4>B>THE ILLEGITIMATE SOURCES OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</h4>
<P>
 The main goal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to dismantle
the Jim Crow system, under which black Americans were pervasively,
overtly, and legally discriminated against in substantial portions
of the nation. The prohibition against employment discrimination
in Title VII of that statute was meant to enhance the economic
well-being of this oppressed minority by requiring employers to
give blacks the same opportunities available to whites. That goal
was achieved: Jim Crow was destroyed, and economic progress among
southern blacks increased dramatically during the decade following
the enactment of Title VII. (16)
<P>
 Although the motivating force for the Civil Rights Act was opposition
to the legalized oppression of Jim Crow, Congress did not stop
there. Following a long American tradition, exemplified by the
Fourteenth Amendment itself, the legislature established universal
legal rights that apply everywhere in the country. Significantly,
Title VII contains no special provisions for blacks, and no special
provisions for the South. The concept of "protected groups"
is alien to the fundamental principles of Title VII, which establishes
individual rights belonging to every employee and applicant for
employment. (17)
<P>
 Although it rested on universal principles, Title VII originally
included exemptions for certain entities, most notably small employers
and government agencies. The original statute also provided exceptions
for certain kinds of traditional practices, such as treating men
and women differently where sex is a "bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation"
of a business. (18) Subsequent acts of Congress expanded the reach
of the statute to cover state and federal agencies (19), as well as
some small employers exempted in the original Act and certain
forms of unintentional discrimination. The law has also been amended
to increase the powers of the principal enforcement agency (the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) and to enlarge the monetary
relief that victims can recover from defendants.
<P>
 Not once, however, has Congress created any "affirmative
action" exception to Title VII's prohibition against discrimination. (20)
The exceptions that have arisen are entirely the product of executive
and judicial action.
<P>
<h4>QUOTAS BY EXECUTIVE ORDER</h4>
<P>
Pursuant to executive orders issued by Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, the Department of Labor undertook the most important
early initiatives promoting illegitimate forms of affirmative
action. These initiatives were not dictated by the executive orders
themselves, which required only that federal contractors "take
affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and
that employees are treated during employment, without regard to
their race, creed, color, or national origin." (21) In light of
the long-standing patterns of racial discrimination that existed
at the time, especially in the South and in certain unionized
industries, this language implied no more than that firms wishing
to do business with the federal government should resist the strong
inertial forces supporting those odious practices. But this unexceptionable
goal was soon left behind.
<P>
 Early in the Nixon Administration, the Labor Department quietly
promulgated an order requiring that "the rate of minority
applicants recruited should approximate or equal the ratio of
minorities to the applicant population in each location." (22) 
After an outcry against this proportional representation scheme,
the order was replaced with a more subtly worded set of rules
that nonetheless had the effect of requiring racial quotas and
preferences. Under the current version of these rules, federal
contractors must establish numerical "goals and timetables"
(one of many popular euphemisms for quotas) whenever minorities
are "underutilized" according to arbitrary standards
that do not measure actual discrimination. (23) Enforced by the Office
of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) in the Labor Department,
these rules give OFCCP the power to issue debarment orders forbidding
federal agencies from doing business with firms that show insufficient
zeal in meeting their quotas. Needless to say, the threat of debarment
has powerful <I>in terrorem</I> effects.
<P>
<h4>JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION OF QUOTAS</h4>
<P>
Had the federal courts enforced the plain meaning and intent of
Title VII, the arbitrary quota policies promoted by the Nixon
Administration and its successors might have withered on the vine.
In <I>United Steelworkers v. Weber</I> (24), however, the Supreme Court
held that racial quotas are permissible under Title VII. The case
arose when Kaiser Aluminum and the United Steelworkers adopted
a collective bargaining agreement establishing a training program
that would qualify unskilled Kaiser workers for jobs in various
skilled trades. Eligibility for the program was determined by
seniority, but Kaiser succumbed to pressure from the Labor Department
and imposed a 50 percent quota for black applicants. (25) While acknowledging
in his majority opinion that the language of Title VII's prohibition
against discrimination "because of race" plainly forbade
this affirmative action program, Justice Brennan nevertheless
pretended that Congress intended something other than what the
statute says. He was unable, however, to find a single shred of
evidence to support this position. Justice Rehnquist's dissenting
opinion, by way of contrast, assembled a massive array of evidence
conclusively refuting Brennan's audacious misinterpretation.
<P>
 In <I>Johnson v. Transportation Agency</I> (26), the Supreme Court
affirmed and expanded the affirmative action exception to Title
VII. Employers in both the public and the private sectors now
face pressure to grant discriminatory preferences when there is
a "manifest imbalance" of minorities or women in "traditionally
segregated job categories." Despite what one might think
from reading this language, however, affirmative action is not
limited to rectifying segregationist practices by discriminatory
employers. Rather, discrimination is legitimized whenever women
or minorities are "underrepresented" in some job. The
standards for determining "underrepresentation" are
extremely loose, and have been met even when it has been caused
by some vague and unspecified form of "societal discrimination." (27)
<P>
 With perfect circular reasoning, "discrimination" is
presumed to exist when "underrepresentation" in particular
jobs is found.
<P>
<h4>INNOCENT VICTIMS OF QUOTA POLICIES</h4>
<P>
The Supreme Court has also stated that legitimate affirmative
action plans must not "unnecessarily trammel the interests
of the [disfavored] employees." (28) Here again, however, the
Court permits employers to impose explicit racial quotas even
when those quotas offer no relief to victims of proven discrimination. (29)
<P>
 Quotas and preferences, moreover, are legal even when they deny
employment opportunities to individuals who have never benefited
from an employer's prior discrimination.
<P>
 The <I>Weber</I> decision is once again illustrative. The white
plaintiff in that case, an unskilled laborer, had never belonged
to one of the unions whose racist policies had presumably excluded
blacks from the skilled trades. Yet the Court upheld a discriminatory
quota that deprived this plaintiff of an opportunity that would
have been open to him but for the color of his skin. While in
theory there are limits to how far employers can go in trammeling
the interests of people in disfavored groups, (30) in practice, the
Supreme Court has never held that an affirmative action plan violates
Title VII. In fact, the Court has created a legal rule that presumes
the validity of discriminatory affirmative action plans, thus
requiring victims to assume the heavy burden of <I>disproving</I>
the validity of such plans. (31)
<P>
 With the law stacked so heavily against them, victims of affirmative
action policies seldom seek legal redress. The reported decisions
therefore do not present anything like a true picture of the underlying
problem. It is completely absurd to argue, as one Clinton Administration
consultant has contended, that the paucity of reported judicial
decisions means that "the problem of 'reverse discrimination'
is not widespread; and that where it exists, the courts have given
relief." (32) One might as well argue that the paucity of litigation
about employment discrimination in the 1950s meant that discrimination
against blacks was a rarity. (33)
<P>
 Although reported cases are not especially numerous, a few examples
offer some insight into the sort of policies that courts find
acceptable.
<P>
Example: A county agency, which had never discriminated against
women, adopted an affirmative action plan with a "goal"
of 36.4 percent women (corresponding to the proportion of women
in the county's workforce) on highway maintenance crews. Despite
the utterly obvious fact that women are less likely than men to
seek jobs involving heavy physical labor, the Supreme Court labeled
this a "traditionally segregated job category." The
Court approved the county's decision to deny a promotion to a
male applicant in favor of a less qualified woman. (34)
<P>
Example: After receiving the highest score on a competitive examination,
a white firefighter was denied a promotion to engineer in favor
of a black firefighter with a lower score. Without discussing
the percentage of blacks in the fire department or in the engineer
position, and without making any comparisons with the available
labor force, the federal courts discovered a "manifest imbalance"
in a traditionally segregated job category. In upholding the fire
department's racial discrimination, the appellate court commented,
in words that could have been applied as easily to Jim Crow itself,
that the affirmative action plan "minimizes the disruption
of employees' expectations by providing clear guidelines for when
race may be taken into account." (35)
<P>
Example: In approving a plan to increase the number of women in
a university sociology department by discriminating against male
applicants, a federal court held, apparently with a straight face,
that "[w]hen approximately fifty percent of the nation's
population is women and only thirty-four percent of the recipients
of Ph.D.'s in sociology are women, sociology must be considered
to be a traditionally segregated field." (36)
<P>
Example: A county school board approved a policy involving race-based
involuntary transfers of teachers among schools. The courts acknowledged
that the challenged policy "does classify and burden individual
teachers on the basis of race." Although the policy had been
adopted in connection with a desegregation case, there were no
vestiges of discrimination in faculty assignments. The courts
nonetheless upheld the discriminatory policy "because the
goal of providing to schoolchildren a racially diverse learning
environment is clearly a legitimate one under Title VII." (37)
<P>
Example: A court approved a university's decision to raise the
salaries of women faculty members by amounts ranging from 1 percent
to 40 percent. The school's decision was based on a statistical
study showing that women were paid less than "comparable"
men. The comparability study, however, took no account of variables
such as "research productivity and quality, teaching quality
and load, publication quantity and community service" because
such variables generally "are not available and/or not suitable
for statistical analysis compared to the relatively straightforward
coding of other factors such as rank or tenure status." Thus,
nondiscriminatory factors that could obviously create salary disparities
were ignored because the court did not have any numbers handy
with which to measure them. (38)
<P>
<h4>THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION</h4></B>
<P>
 Any honest discussion about the prevalence of employment discrimination
must begin with two propositions. First, no one knows or can know
how much discrimination against any group actually occurs. Second,
no law can eliminate such discrimination completely.
<P>
 There simply have been no reliable studies measuring either how
much discrimination American employers actually engage in or against
whom they discriminate the most. We can be sure of one thing,
however: discrimination against virtually all groups does occur,
and will continue to occur. If the laws against murder, a crime
that is easily detected and severely punished, have never come
close to eliminating it, (39) our anti-discrimination laws will not
eliminate discrimination. Thus, the claim that discriminatory
affirmative action policies must be maintained until we achieve
a "color-blind" society is simply a ruse that will guarantee
eternal life to those policies.
<P>
 Although anti-discrimination laws will never produce a color-blind
society, policymakers can certainly craft a color-blind law. That
is exactly what Congress set out to do when it passed the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, and the legislature was perfectly correct
in expecting that law to reduce the incidence of discrimination.
To the extent that Title VII raises the cost of discriminating
against those protected by the statute, it is simply inevitable
that less discrimination will occur. (40 It emphatically does not
follow, however, that the goal of reducing discrimination against
groups that have historically been the victims of prejudice requires
the use of preferences in their favor.
<P>
 The upside-down notion of using discrimination against some groups
to combat discrimination against other groups begins with the
false premise that any statistical "imbalance" in the
workforce must be the result of discrimination against the underrepresented
group. This premise is not only false; it is preposterous. (41) No
society has ever existed in which human beings sort themselves
into jobs and occupations according to the mathematical laws of
chance:
<P>
<blockquote> The even distribution or proportional representation of groups
in occupations or institutions remains an intellectual construct
defied by reality in society after society. Nor can all this be
attributed to exclusions or discrimination, for often some powerless
or persecuted minorities predominate in prosperous occupations. (42)</blockquote>
<P>
 Attributing every "imbalance" to employer discrimination
assumes away the manifest effects of differences in educational
achievement, family upbringing and cultural traditions, marital
patterns, and even the physical differences between the sexes.
When one begins indulging assumptions like that, one has left
reason behind and entered the realm of mysticism.
<P>
 What discriminatory affirmative action policies certainly can
do is increase the number of minorities and women holding desirable
jobs. That is the basis of their political appeal, just as the
artificial allocation of desirable jobs to whites was a critical
contributor to the political durability of the Jim Crow system.
Reserving certain jobs for certain groups, or giving preferences
to members of those groups, obviously serves the narrow self-interest
of those who enjoy the preferences. These beneficiaries inevitably,
and ironically, are drawn from the most elite and <I>least</I>
disadvantaged segments of the preferred groups. As one shrewd
observer has pointed out, "race-based set-asides have amounted
to no more than a cruel bait-and-switch game in which conditions
of poor Blacks were used to garner preferences that ultimately
benefited upper-income Blacks and White corporations." (43) In
effect, the current preference system creates a labor cartel,
allowing the legally privileged groups to command above-market
wages or (what amounts to the same thing economically) to depress
the demand for their competitors' services. This is wonderful
for the cartel's members, but everyone else pays the price.
<P>
 Apart from the economic inefficiencies imposed on society in
general, the costs of affirmative action are borne largely by
two groups:
<P>
<B> Whites, Men, and Other Unfashionable Groups.</B> The most
obvious victims of legalized discrimination are those individuals,
"predominantly unknown, unaffluent, unorganized," (44) who
are excluded by preferential policies from positions they otherwise
would have obtained. These victims of affirmative action are neither
the CEOs of major corporations nor their highly paid Washington
lobbyists. Nor are they neurotics who deserve to be subjected
to President Clinton's condescending pop psychology. (45) On the contrary,
they are mainly ordinary working people who suffer the same losses
experienced by other victims of discrimination. They are easy
to ignore or make fun of inside the Beltway, but that says more
about the climate in Washington than it does about those who must
live with the decisions that are made there.
<P>
<B> Minority Victims.</B> A less obvious group of victims comprises
those minority individuals and women who would have succeeded
without preferential policies, but whose achievements become clouded
by the suspicion and resentment of others. The fact that resentment
against these individuals is actually unjustified will not prevent
it from occurring. (46)
<P>
<h4>THE OPPOSITION TO REFORM</h4>
<P>
 Perhaps the best evidence that discriminatory preferences are
a serious and widespread phenomenon is the ferocity of the opposition
to abolishing them. (47) For every beneficiary, there is a corresponding
victim. Thus, if the beneficiaries of this discrimination believe
they stand to lose a great deal if it ends, that suggests that
reform of the status quo is an urgent matter. (48) Accordingly, it
is imperative that Congress enact the simple reforms that are
needed to remove the stamp of legal approval from the discrimination
that the law now promotes. But that will not be easy. Besides
the direct beneficiaries of quotas and preferences (including
those who are paid to administer or advocate preferential policies),
politically significant business interests have incentives to
preserve the current legal regime.
<P>
 First, inefficient quota requirements -- whether imposed directly
or indirectly 
<P>
 -- confer advantages on large, established business enterprises
vis-&agrave;-vis their smaller competitors. This effect, which
is a matter of simple economics, is especially powerful when the
regulatory regime involves massive paperwork and reporting requirements
like those imposed by the EEOC and OFCCP.
<P>
 Second, after decades of government pressure to get their numbers
right, a great many large companies have institutionalized affirmative
action as a significant element in their corporate cultures. These
firms thus have large and powerful <I>internal</I> constituencies
for such programs. Those internal constituencies will fight to
protect their interests and will help shape the public posture
of the firm on issues that affect those interests.
<P>
 The incentives that exist for business interests to support the
status quo will not necessarily produce aggressive <I>public</I>
support for policies that favor discrimination. Indeed, business
leaders often adopt an anti-regulatory rhetorical posture even
when they are actively seeking anti-competitive government regulations.
With affirmative action, there are especially strong reasons to
avoid getting caught up directly in the public controversy: For
most big firms, almost any position they adopt on the public policy
question is bound to offend a significant portion of their employees
and customers. (49) But these considerations need not prevent business
interests from taking quiet and indirect steps to protect their
interests. The dubious arguments that support those interests
therefore need to be confronted.
<P>
<h4>THE MYTH OF "VOLUNTARY" AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</h4>
<P>
One of the most enduring myths about affirmative action is that
it reflects voluntary efforts by American employers to comply
with Title VII's spirit of equal opportunity. An especially dangerous
corollary of this myth is that Congress should merely forbid the
federal government from engaging directly in discrimination, leaving
the private sector to continue behaving as it has in the past.
In order to appreciate why both the myth and the corollary are
fallacious, a very rudimentary introduction to the economics of
discrimination will be helpful.
<P>
 There is a respectable, though hardly unimpeachable, economic
argument for repealing the legal constraints on discrimination
by private employers. (50) According to this argument, ordinary market
forces will minimize employer discrimination that is based on
such arbitrary factors as a personal distaste for members of certain
groups. The market, however, would still reward economically efficient
forms of discrimination. This can occur when race or sex is correlated
with desirable characteristics that are costly to identify directly.
Thus, for example, if very few women possess the physical strength
to perform a certain job, it may be cheaper for an employer to
exclude women from consideration than to administer strength tests
to all applicants. Such discrimination, according to the economic
argument, should be tolerated because the efficiencies it creates
benefit <I>all</I> groups over the long run, even if some individuals
are denied jobs for which they are the best qualified. (51)
<P>
 Business interests sometimes use variations on this economic
argument to defend discriminatory affirmative action programs.
They argue, for example, that a diverse workforce is an essential
business imperative because firms need to respond to a racially
and ethnically diverse consumer population. (52) When used to defend
discriminatory policies, these arguments rest on the assumption
that members of certain racial groups are more likely to understand
what consumers in their own group will find appealing, or on the
assumption that customers are more likely to patronize firms that
give a prominent role to employees of their own race. For example:
<P>
<blockquote> Given the national demography and the fact that much of our domestic
business is with city and state governments, walking in with an
all-white male team is a tie-breaker negative, said one chief
executive who was quoted anonymously in the [Glass Ceiling] report.
"If I go to Washington, I need black representatives to interact
with the people who can give me contracts." (53)</blockquote>
<P>
 Assuming that such assumptions are correct, they do not answer
the moral and political question: Should private firms be allowed
to enhance their efficiency by engaging in racial discrimination
or pandering to the racial preferences of their customers? And
even if one believes that private firms should be allowed to do
this for the sake of efficiency, the economic argument cannot
justify forbidding firms to discriminate against some groups but
not others. Efficiency is efficiency, whether it leads firms to
appeal to the preferences of black consumers or white consumers.
Thus, if the economic argument justifies allowing firms to engage
in discriminatory affirmative action, it must also justify allowing
firms to resume old-fashioned patterns of discrimination <I>against</I>
women and minorities.
<P>
 For moral and political reasons, Congress is not likely to give
serious consideration to "deregulating" the market by
repealing Title VII. Some in Congress, however, may be tempted
to believe that leaving private-sector affirmative action programs
alone is an economically benign form of "partial deregulation."
This temptation must be resisted, for the theory on which it rests
is entirely false.
<P>
<h4>INADEQUACY OF LIMITING REFORM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</B>
</h4>
Some opponents of racial preferences support a legislative strategy
that focuses primarily on the most notorious forms of direct discrimination
by the federal government, such as contract set-asides. There
certainly are plenty of deserving candidates for extinction among
these programs. Most of them, however, should be doomed in any
event by the Supreme Court's recent decision in <I>Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pe&ntilde;a</I> (54), which held that racial classifications
by the federal government are unconstitutional unless they are
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. Congress
can and should prevent the Clinton Administration from wasting
society's resources by engaging in protracted litigation in defense
of programs that are legally dubious and morally wrong. But genuine
leadership requires more than staying half a step ahead of the
courts. In any case, this alone would barely touch the most significant
problems that federal law has created. To suppose that the federal
government can get its own house in order merely by ceasing to
practice direct discrimination ignores the pervasive effects that
its laws have on the rest of society.
<P>
 First, even from a strictly economic or libertarian perspective,
reforms that are limited to the federal government would be grossly
inadequate. Such reforms would allow discrimination to continue
in important economic sectors that are not subject to the full
discipline of market forces. This includes state and local governments,
as well as firms that are otherwise insulated from competitive
forces, such as those in the nonprofit sector and in some heavily
regulated industries. No "reform" that leaves these
institutions free to discriminate can be defended on the basis
of free-market principles.
<P>
 Second, the federal government does not merely permit private
firms to engage in discriminatory affirmative action. On the contrary,
it actively <I>pressures</I> them to discriminate through compliance
reviews of federal contractors by the Labor Department and through
the litigation policies of the EEOC. Just as the supposedly "voluntary"
racial quotas at issue in <I>Weber</I> actually were adopted in
the face of Labor Department pressure, much of the current culture
of affirmative action has developed in an effort to satisfy the
demand of federal bureaucrats for the "right numbers."
<P>
 Third, and perhaps most important, the current legal doctrines
on affirmative action <I>inherently</I> promote discrimination
by private firms because of the asymmetrical treatment of different
groups. Even if federal agencies were to get completely out of
the business of promoting discrimination, the law itself would
continue to promote discrimination through the incentives it creates
for private employers. Consider the choice confronting an employer
who has two candidates, one minority and one white, for a promotion
to a managerial position. If both candidates possess the minimal
qualifications for the position, the employer faces a substantial
risk of litigation if the white is promoted, even if the white
candidate has better qualifications. If the employer denies the
promotion to the better-qualified white candidate under an affirmative
action plan, however, the risk of liability is near zero. Faced
with these asymmetrical incentives, rational employers inevitably
and systematically will discriminate against legally disfavored
groups, especially whites and men. Allowing this to continue is
not a benign form of "partial deregulation," but a powerful
engine of government-sponsored favoritism. Until these incentives
are removed, market forces will continue to <I>foster</I> discrimination
rather than discourage it.
<P>
<h4>THE EXAGGERATED THREAT OF DISPARATE IMPACT LITIGATION</h4>
<P>
Because the economic, or "free market," rationale for
allowing minority preferences is untenable, business lobbyists
may claim that they must engage in this form of discrimination
in order to protect themselves from litigation based on statistical
underrepresentation. This argument has some merit in theory, but
its practical significance can easily be overstated. To the extent
that the argument is valid, moreover, it suggests the need for
reform of the rules governing statistics-based litigation, <I>not</I>
for the preservation of rules permitting employers to engage in
discriminatory affirmative action. To understand why the threat
of litigation over "bad numbers" is less than pressing,
though still worth solving, a brief discussion of the law's evolution
is required.
<P>
 In a 1971 decision, <I>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</I> (55), the Supreme
Court accepted the Nixon Administration's contention that employment
criteria that lead to "underrepresentation" of minorities
in a company's workforce can be unlawful even if the employer
has not intentionally discriminated against anyone. This theory,
which goes by the name of "disparate impact analysis,"
had no basis in the law and in fact was incompatible with the
statute. Chief Justice Burger's opinion flouted the text of Title
VII, distorted and misrepresented the legislative history, and
even went so far as to misstate the factual findings of the district
court in the <I>Griggs</I> case itself. (56) Apart from being a legislative
rather than a judicial exercise, the legislative draftsmanship
in the <I>Griggs</I> opinion was utterly incompetent. Burger declared
that statistical disparities could lead to liability, but he offered
no intelligible test either for deciding what statistical comparisons
should be used or for deciding how large the disparities must
be.
<P>
 Burger's opinion also created a legal defense that employers
could use to justify disparities that otherwise would produce
liability, but he offered no fewer than eight different and conflicting
formulations of the standard that such employment criteria must
meet. The hopeless ambiguities and vagueness of <I>Griggs</I>,
and the impossibility of seeking guidance from the statute that
<I>Griggs</I> had recklessly amended, set the Court on a long
and difficult search for a manageable set of legal standards.
During the early years of this process, many lower courts made
it relatively easy for plaintiffs to establish a statistical case
against an employer, and employers often were held to absurdly
high standards of "business necessity" in defending
employment criteria that failed to generate "enough"
minorities and women in certain jobs.
<P>
 Employers that used race-neutral hiring criteria (as Kaiser Aluminum
had been doing before the Labor Department pressured it to adopt
the racial quota that was challenged in <I>Weber</I>) thereby
exposed themselves to liability if such criteria had a disparate
impact on minorities. Unless employers were allowed to get their
numbers "right" by discriminating against whites, they
would be placed in a Catch-22: vulnerable to Labor Department
sanctions and/or lawsuits by minorities if race-neutral criteria
led to disparate effects and liable to whites if they sought to
avoid such suits by instituting preferential policies. By permitting
employers to engage in preferential treatment of minorities, the
Court offered them a comparatively cheap way of escaping this
Catch-22.
<P>
 Employers will oppose any legal regime that forces them to make
decisions that expose them to liability no matter what they do.
They can hardly be blamed for this, and the law certainly should
not create Catch-22s for anyone. In 1989,however, the Supreme
Court articulated standards of proof for disparate impact cases
that were much more favorable to employers than the rules that
had taken root in the lower courts. (57) Under these standards, plaintiffs
were required to show that the employer's conduct actually caused
substantial underrepresentation. The Court also concluded that
defendants could escape liability simply by producing evidence
that their employment criteria were based on legitimate business
reasons. This ruling greatly reduced the threat of disparate impact
liability for all but the most inexplicably arbitrary employment
practices, and thus greatly reduced the pressure on employers
to adopt preferential policies designed to produce statistically
balanced workforces.
<P>
 In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress codified the theory
of disparate impact, thus ratifying a previously illegitimate
doctrine. In doing so, however, the legislation preserved almost
all of the safeguards for employers that the Supreme Court had
established in its 1989 decision. More important, perhaps, the
1991 statute created a new remedial scheme authorizing compensatory
and punitive damages in cases involving intentional discrimination,
but <I>not</I> in cases arising under the disparate impact theory. (58) 
This new rule creates tremendously powerful incentives for plaintiffs
and their attorneys to forego disparate impact litigation in favor
of claims based on the standard theory of intentional discrimination. (59)
<P>
 These incentives, together with the relatively circumscribed
disparate impact standards codified in the 1991 statute, have
caused the virtual disappearance of serious disparate impact litigation. (60) 
For that reason, business interests no longer can legitimately
maintain that the restoration of a color-blind legal rule will
create the Catch-22 described above.
<P>
 Business lobbyists nonetheless might argue that courts and enforcement
agencies may revive disparate impact litigation at some future
time. This possibility cannot be ruled out completely. The most
likely way for this to happen would involve an aggressive disparate
impact campaign by the EEOC and the Justice Department, combined
with judicial misinterpretation of ambiguous language in the 1991
statute. Because EEOC and Justice are public agencies, they are
less subject than the private plaintiffs' bar to the financial
disincentives that the 1991 Act created for disparate impact litigation.
And the courts, as we have seen so often in the past, are perfectly
capable of seizing on any real or imagined ambiguity in the civil
rights statutes when they want to expand the reach of those statutes
beyond what Congress has authorized.
<P>
 This possibility -- that federal agencies and the courts again
will cause disparate impact litigation to become a serious problem
-- does not seem likely to materialize in the foreseeable future.
The EEOC's workload has gone up dramatically in recent years,
largely because of an increase in intentional discrimination claims
under Title VII (especially claims involving sexual harassment)
and under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. The agency's
budget, however, has not seen commensurate increases, and the
agency would therefore have difficulty in diverting significant
resources to disparate impact litigation. Similarly, while the
courts certainly have the power to interpret the 1991 statute
in a way that would greatly facilitate abuses of the disparate
impact theory, recent judicial trends do not suggest that this
is likely to happen.
<P>
<h4>RESTORE THE COLOR-BLIND LAW THAT CONGRESS ENACTED</B>
</h4>
Congress is not to blame for the misinterpretations to which Title
VII has been subjected. Writing in 1979, then-Justice Rehnquist
noted: 
<P>
 <blockquote>Were Congress to act today specifically to prohibit the type
of racial discrimination suffered by [the plaintiff in <I>Weber</I>],
it would be hard pressed to draft language better tailored to
the task than that found in [sections 703(a) and (d)] of Title VII.  (61)</blockquote>

<P>
 Rehnquist's comment remains equally valid today, and there is
little reason to tamper with the operative language of the statute.
Rather, what is needed is an amendment requiring the courts and
executive agencies to begin obeying the law that Congress framed
three decades ago.
<P>
 In fact, Congress foresaw in 1964 that its clear language might
be misconstrued and included in the statute a provision specifically
foreclosing any interpretation requiring the correction of statistical
imbalances in an employer's workforce. (62) Had the <I>Weber</I> majority
not been driven by an Orwellian contempt for the meaning of words, (63) 
this precautionary provision would have accomplished its purpose. (64)

<P>
 A more comprehensive and carefully drafted statement of congressional
insistence that Title VII means what it says, however, can now
accomplish what Congress sought to achieve in 1964. While there
can be no absolute assurance against the flouting of legislative
commands, the courts have become less reckless in recent years.
They are unlikely to defy Congress on this issue, and enactment
of legislation embodying the principles summarized below should
assure that the principle of equal opportunity finally is accepted
into the law.
<P>
<B>Legislative Solutions</B>
<P>
 The key provisions of such a legislative approach are as follows:
<P>
Ban quotas and preferences. Congress should forbid courts and
enforcement agencies from interpreting Title VII to authorize,
permit, or encourage the use of quotas or preferences relating
to race or sex. 
<P>
<B>Permit legitimate affirmative action.</B> Congress should state
that employers may adopt <I>legitimate</I> affirmative action
policies that promote equal opportunity without using or encouraging
the use of quotas or preferences. This proviso would allow employers
to ensure that minorities and women are not excluded from employment
opportunities by managers' prejudices, stereotypes, or inappropriate
recruiting habits. (65)
<P>
<B>End backdoor quotas.</B> Employers should be prohibited from
engaging in indirect forms of discrimination through euphemisms
like "diversity," "inclusiveness," or developing
a "multicultural workforce." The existing cast of bureaucrats
and corporate affirmative action officers also should be forbidden
from repackaging the same old surreptitious racial quotas under
some new rubric like "socially disadvantaged background." (66)
<P>
 The promoters of preferences repeatedly have shifted their language
and invented new excuses for continuing the discriminatory policies
of the past. In order to deprive them of the legalistic arguments
at which they have proven so adept, any legislation adopted by
Congress must contain airtight legislative language that closes
the door to the use of new euphemisms and new rationales for discrimination.

<P>
 This, in brief, is the appropriate way to restore the ideal of
equal treatment under the law to which Title VII originally was
dedicated. There is neither any need nor any justification for
compromises, incremental changes, or further temporizing.<p>

<li>Section 703(i) specifically authorizes one very limited form
of discriminatory preference for a "protected group":
 "Nothing contained in [Title VII] shall apply to any business
or enterprise on or near an Indian reservation with respect to
any publicly announced employment practice of such business or
enterprise under which a preferential treatment is given to any
individual because he is an Indian living on or near a reservation."
 42 U.S.C.  2000e2.  By specifically including this exception
to the basic rule of Title VII, the statute clearly implies that
similar preferences for other groups are <I>not</I> authorized.

<li>703(e), 42 U.S.C.  2000e2(e).  This exception from the basic
prohibition against discrimination applies with respect to religion
and national origin, as well as sex.  Reflecting Congress's special
concern with racial discrimination, the statute makes no provision
for treating race or color as a bona fide occupational qualification.

<li>An important exception exists for the uniformed military services.
 See, <I>e.g.</I>, <I>Roper v.  Department of the Army</I>, 832
F.2d 247 (2d Cir.  1987).

<li>Section 107(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 added a provision
to Title VII that, by its terms, would seem specifically to prohibit
typical forms of discriminatory affirmative action:  "Except
as otherwise provided in this title, an unlawful employment practice
is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor
for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated
the practice."  Civil Rights Act of 1991,  107(a), 42 U.S.C.
 2000e2(m).  Section 116 of the 1991 statute, however, also provided
that "[n]othing in the amendments made by this title shall
be construed to affect courtordered remedies, affirmative action,
or conciliation agreements, that are in accordance with the law."
 Civil Rights Act of 1991, 116, 42 U.S.C.  1981 note.  If affirmative
action policies that were permitted under pre1991 judicial precedents
are assumed to be "in accordance with the law" within
the meaning of Section 116, then Section 107(a) can be interpreted
to allow their continuation.  Because the legislative history
of the 1991 Act does not evince an intent to overrule those judicial
precedents, the Supreme Court is unlikely to hold that Section
107(a) outlawed previously permissible affirmative action policies.

979 F.2d 721 (9th Cir.  1992), cert.  denied, 113 S.  Ct.  1645
(1993).  By the same token, however, the legislative history of
the 1991 statute does not manifest congressional intent to codify
the judicial decisions that permit discriminatory affirmative
action.  For further detail, see Nelson Lund, "Lawyers and
the Defense of the Presidency," <I>Brigham Young University

<li>Federal regulations, for example, require that every "utilization
analysis" consider the minority population of the surrounding
labor area, the size of the minority unemployment force, and the
percentage of the minority workforce compared with the total workforce.
 In addition to such factors, which ignore qualifications entirely,
the regulations also require the consideration of factors that
do not take account of the relative qualifications among individuals,
such as the availability of "promotable and transferable
minorities" within the contractor's organization.  See 41
C.F.R.  602.11(b)(1).  Contractors must take "special corrective
action" when there is an "underutilization" of
minorities, or when other phenomena occur, as when a lower percentage
of minority than nonminority applicants meets the firm's employment
criteria, or minorities meet the firm's promotion criteria at
a lower rate than nonminorities.  <I>Id.</I>  602.23.  These phenomena,
obviously, are not necessarily caused by discrimination, and "special
corrective action" often will entail discrimination against
better qualified individuals.

<li>This applies, obviously, only to the sector of the economy in
which an antidiscrimination law is enforced.  Because Title VII
contains an exemption for firms with fewer than 15 employees,
its actual effect could consist largely in shifting minorities
and women from smaller firms to larger firms.  Such an effect
is magnified when pressure is exerted on larger firms to discriminate
in favor of minorities and women.  There is some empirical evidence
suggesting that exactly this has occurred.  See, <I>e.g.</I>,
Ferrell Bloch, "Affirmative Action Hasn't Helped Blacks,"
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, March 1, 1995, p.  A14:  "While
black unemployment rates have remained twice those of whites,
the proportion of blacks working for firms with 100 or more employees
(who must file annual EEO1 reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission), federal contractors (who are subject to Labor Department
affirmative action requirements), and local, state and federal
government has grown dramatically.  For example, in 1966, black
female managers were 40% less likely than white male managers
to work in firms with 100 or more employees.  But by 1980, black
female managers were 50% more likely than their white male counterparts
to work in these larger companies."

<li>A recent <I>USA Today</I>/CNN/Gallup Poll found that 19 percent
of black women and 28 percent of black men believe that their
colleagues "privately questioned your abilities or qualifications
because of affirmative action."  The same survey found that
32 percent of whites thought that "a racial minority where
you worked got an undeserved job or promotion as a result of affirmative
action programs."  "Affirmative Action:  The Public

<li>The mere possibility of a voter initiative to curtail affirmative
action in California has generated threats of an economic boycott
against that state.  And those threats apparently are meant to
have a wider effect:  "This [boycott threat] is also directed
at two Washington players:  Congress and the White House,"
said one civil rights leader, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
 "Both have to be reminded that there is going to be a major
effort to bring political costs into this debate and balance the
scales of consideration.  Right now the debate is tilted in favor
of accommodating the political views of white males."  Steven
A.  Holmes, "Government Acts to Set its Policy on Race Programs,"
<I>The New York Times</I>, June 24, 1995, p.  1.  The Clinton
Administration obviously will not challenge the civil rights establishment.
 Unfortunately, the urge to temporize in the face of intimidating
tactics undoubtedly remains strong even among conservatives. 
One prominent Republican, for example, recently made the amazing
pronouncement that "we as a party need to work hard to earn
the right to deal with this issue and to deal with it in a sensitive
way."  See Nancy E.  Roman, "GOP Panel To Go Slow on
Affirmative Action:  Leaders Don't Want to Alienate Blacks,"
<I>The Washington Times</I>, June 7, 1995, p.  A12.  Because it
is obvious that no one has to "earn" the right to do
the right thing, statements like this inevitably give off an aroma
of cynical political calculation.

<li>On the other hand, if the beneficiaries (and thus the victims)
of preferential policies are actually the rare exception in the
American workplace, what harm could there be in restoring the
law of equal treatment?

<li><I>Cf., e.g.</I>, Judith H.  Dobrzynski, "Some Action, Little
Talk," <I>The New York Times</I>, April 20, 1995, p.  D1:
 "[W]hile many of the more than two dozen company and industry
association executives contacted spoke privately about affirmative
action, almost none would comment for the record."

<li>This argument is developed at length in Richard A.  Epstein, <I>Forbidden
Grounds:  The Case Against Employment Discrimination Laws</I>
(Cambridge, Mass.:  Harvard University Press, 1992).

<li>In addition, there are substantial costs involved in administering
and enforcing the antidiscrimination laws.  If those costs were
eliminated, some of the savings would be used to increase wages
and/or create more jobs.

<li>See, <I>e.g.</I>, Jonathan Kaufman, "Management:  How Workplaces
May Look Without Affirmative Action," <I>The Wall Street
Journal</I>, March 20, 1995, p.  B1:  "Eastman Kodak Co.
 maintains it is committed to diversity because the composition
of the American work force is changing and so is its customer
base. ' If affirmative action wasn't legislated, we'd still continue
with our goal of building a diverse work force,' says Patricia
Fleming, Kodak's director of affirmative action.  Kodak won't
specify how many women or blacks it has in top positions, but
it recently tied a portion of management compensation to recruitment
and promotion of minorities and women."

<li>In a disparate impact case, remedies are confined largely to injunctive
relief, limited back pay, and attorney's fees.  These limitations
applied to all Title VII cases prior to 1991.  The new statute
caps compensatory and punitive damages for intentional discrimination
at different levels according to the size of the defendant.  For
the large firms that offer the most attractive targets for disparate
impact and class action lawsuits, the cap is set at $300,000 per
claim.

<li>I have been able to find only one reported case in which a private
firm was held liable under the disparate impact provisions of
the 1991 Act.  In <I>Bradley v.  Pizzaco of Nebraska, Inc.</I>,
7 F.3d 795 (8th Cir.  1993), the court forbade a pizza chain's
relatively trivial practice of requiring employees to be cleanshaven.
 This case almost certainly will not become an important precedent,
for the court's reasoning was extremely poor.  The Eight Circuit's
opinion, for example, did not even discuss the operative provision
of the statute, and it actually misquoted the provision on which
it purported to rely.  In <I>EEOC v.  Joint Apprenticeship Committee</I>,
828 F.  Supp.  264 (S.D.  N.Y.  1993), the court used a disparate
impact theory to invalidate a high school education  requirement
for admission into an apprenticeship program.  This case was tried
well before the 1991 Act came into effect, and its significance
is reduced by the fact that the defendant chose for tactical reasons
at trial only to challenge the government's <I>prima facie</I>
case without offering a "business justification" defense.

<li>Section 703(j) provides:  "Nothing contained in [Title

national origin of such individual or group on account of an imbalance
which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage
of persons of any race, color, religion, sex, or national origin
employed by any employer...  in comparison with the total number
or percentage of persons of such race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin in any community, State, section, or other area,
or in the available work force in any community, State, section,

<li>The <I>Weber</I> majority inferred from 703(j)'s ban on interpretations
<I>requiring</I> employers to grant preferential treatment that
Congress meant to allow interpretations <I>permitting</I> employers
to grant preferential treatment.  This negative inference is absurd.
 There are an infinite number of possible misinterpretations of
any statutory language, and 703(j) could not possibly list them
all.  The fact that it rules out one misinterpretation, therefore,
does not imply that it means to allow any others.  By contrast,
a valid negative inference can arise when a statute creates express
exceptions to an otherwise general rule.  Absent contrary evidence,
the creation of such express exceptions implies that similar exceptions
are not intended because it shows that the legislature considered
and rejected the need for exceptions other than the ones it expressly
included.  Title VII includes an express exception for preferential
policies, which is carefully limited to certain circumstances
involving Indians living on or near reservations.  See 703(i),
42 U.S.C.  2000e2(i).  This exception clearly implies that other
forms of preferential affirmative action are forbidden.

<li>The legislation should leave untouched the existing law regarding
employers' use of classifications based on sex, religion, or national
origin where such characteristics are a "bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of
that particular business or enterprise."  703(e), 42 U.S.C.
 2000e2(e).  This exception to Title VII's prohibition against
discrimination has been construed more narrowly than Congress
had reason to anticipate in 1964, but the issues raised by these
narrowing constructions are separate from the issues raised by
affirmative action.

<h2>Affirmative Effort Op-Ed</h2>
<b>By Jack Kemp</b>
</center>
<hr>
<p>	
The scene is Washington D.C.:  a Republican President, new to the White House, defiantly throwing down the gauntlet to a Republican Congress, saying he will veto any bill that proposes to do more for "black Americans" than for "whites".
<p>
This is not some fast-forward vision of 1997, and the first days of a new Republican White House.  No, it's a flashback to 1866.  The agency to be vetoed was The Freedman's Bureau, established in President Lincoln's administration to "affirmatively" assist the recently emancipated African Americans.  The President -- Andrew Johnson, Mr. Lincoln's successor,  worried that any "affirmative action" would hurt the white population by specifically helping "negroes".
<p>
I offer this page out of history not to prove once again that, politically, there is not much new under the sun, but to illustrate that the issues of race and equality are woven into the very essence of our American experience.  While our present-day passions on the subject of affirmative action open old wounds -- they summon us to moral leadership of Lincolnesque proportions.
<p>
Thus far, the summons goes unanswered by both liberals and conservatives alike.  The unreconstructed liberal notion of endless racial reparations and race-based preferences is doubly guilty:  wrong in principle, and ruinous in practice.  President Clinton's much-vaunted affirmative action review produced more of a bumper sticker than a policy; Clinton's focus-group-fashioned "mend it, not end it" slogan makes a far better rhyme than reason.  The same, however, is true of the new affirmative action "abolitionists'" position which heralds equality but seldom addresses the way to truly give all people an equal footing.  Critics are right in asserting that "Affirmative Action" quotas have contributed to the poisoning of race relations in this country:  But critics must offer much more than just opposition and reproach.  We know what they are against, but what instead are they for?  
<p>
"A color-blind society," comes their response.  Of course, the goal of equal opportunity is paramount and a worthy destiny to seek -- but to say that we have arrived at that goal is simply not true.  My friends on the Right call for a color blind society and then quote Martin Luther King's inspirational "I have a dream" speech in which he imagined a nation in which every American would be judged not on the color of his or her skin, but on the "content of his character."  But all too often they totally neglect to quote the end of his speech when he describes the painful plight of minority America:  "The Negro," Dr. King said, "lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity."
<p>
Much has changed in the thirty years since King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.  Minority enterprises have begun to gain a foothold, although there are far too few of them.  But can any one venture to the crumbling brick and mortar of Cabrini Green Public Housing, or the fear-ridden projects of Bed-Stuy or the streets lined with the unemployed in South Central L.A. or East St. Louis, and believe that what he sees there today would pass as progress since Dr. King's day?
<p>
This is not to negate the gains made by so many in the black and minority communities, but for large numbers the situation has not only not improved in thirty years, it has grown dramatically worse -- with a welfare system that entraps rather than empowers and punishes work and marriage and prevents access to capital, credit, and property.  Reality requires that we admit two things-- difficult admissions for both liberals and conservatives:  First, that a race conscious policy of quotas and rigid preferences has helped make matters worse.  But second, and more importantly, the Good Shepherd reminds all of us that our work is not done and as we think about moving into the twenty-first century, we must not leave anyone behind.
<p>
Sound policy begins with strong principles.  Affirmative action based on quotas is wrong  -- wrong because it is antithetical to the genius of the American idea:  individual liberty.  Counting by race in order to remedy past wrongs or rewarding special groups by taking from others perpetuates and even deepens the divisions between us, but race-based politics is even more wrong and must be repudiated by men and women of civility and compassion.  	
<p>
Instead, like the "radical Republicans" of Lincoln's day, who overrode President Johnson's veto on The Freedman's Bureau, we would honor the past by creating a future more in keeping with our revolutionary founding ideals of equality.  In this way, the eventual ending of affirmative action is only a beginning -- the political predicate of a new promise of outreach in the name of greater opportunity for access to capital, credit, prosperity, jobs, and educational choice for all.
<p>
The time has definitely come for a new approach, an "affirmative action" based not just on gender or race or ethnicity, but ultimately based on need.  "Affirmative", because government authority must be employed to remove the obstacles to upward mobility and human advancement.  "Action", because democratic societies must act positively and make real equality of opportunity -- without promising the equality of reward.
<p>
Affirming opportunity in America begins with education.  America's schools, particularly our urban public schools, are depriving minority and low-income children of the education that may be their passport out of poverty.  Even the poorest parent must have the option more affluent families enjoy:  the right to send their children to the school of their choice.  Affirmative effort means ending the educational monopoly that makes poor public school students into pawns of the educational bureaucracy.  And we should be paving the way to a voucher and magnet school system of public and private school choice.
<p>
Opportunity means an entryway into the job market.  That means removing barriers for job creation and entrepreneurship and expanding access to capital and credit.  According to the Wall Street Journal, from 1982 to 1987, the number of black owned firms increased by nearly 38%, about triple the overall business growth rate during that period.  Hispanic-owned businesses soared by 81%.  Women owned firms expanded by 57% and their sales nearly tripled.  Even so, of the 14 million small businesses in existence across the U.S. today, less than two percent are Black-owned.  And of 27 to 28 trillion dollars of capital in the U.S., less than one percent is in Black ownership.  Affirmative effort would take aim at expanding capital and credit as the life-blood of business formation and job creation -- including an aggressive effort to end the red-lining of our inner cities and a radical redesign of our tax code to remove barriers to broader ownership of capital, savings, and credit.
<p>
Opportunity means the ability to accumulate property.  Affirmative effort would mean an end to every federal program that penalizes the poor for  managing to save and accumulate their own assets.  An AFDC mother's thrift and foresight in putting money away for a child's future should not be penalized by the government welfare system as fraud -- as is currently the case.
<p>
Finally, real opportunity for racial and ethnic reconciliation requires an expanding economy -- one that invites the effort and enterprise of all Americans, including minorities and women.  A real pro-growth policy must include policies ranging from enterprise zones in our cities to a commitment to lowering barriers to global trade.  It should also offer relief from red tape, regulation and freedom from punitive tax policies.  Each is part of an affirmative action that can "move America forward without leaving anyone behind."
<p>
Now that we have opened a somewhat hysterical dialogue on affirmative action, we can never go back --  we can only go forward.  Our challenge is to put aside the past -- abandon the endless round of recrimination and a politics that feeds on division, exclusion, anger and envy -- and reaffirm, like Lincoln at his moment of maximum crisis, a vision of the "better angels of our nature", a big-hearted view of the nation we were always meant to become and must be if we are to enter the 21st century as the model of liberal democracy and market-oriented capitalism the world needs to see.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the coming year, Americans will begin a serious debate over the meaning and value of affirmative action. Among the early signs:
	<P>	A proposed ballot initiative in California aims to amend the state constitution to 
prohibit preferential treatment in public policy based on race, sex, ethnicity, or national 
origin.</P>
<P>	In Georgia, the state legislature considers a bill to end preferences for women and 
minorities in landing county contracts.</P>
<P>	Senator and presidential hopeful Phil Gramm (R-TX) promises that, if elected, he 
will end major set-aside programs on his first day in office.</P>
<P>	President Clinton orders an "intense, urgent review" of all aspects of government 
affirmative-action policy. Veteran Democratic strategist Susan Estrich says that as far as 
affirmative action is concerned, "now is truly the time to move on to some other 
approach."</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court may oblige her. In agreeing to hear Adarand v. Pena, the 
Court threatens to reform, restrict, or undo federal set-asides for minority-owned 
businesses. Policy Review asked several black businessmen to describe the impact of 
race-based government contracting on entrepreneurship, and to offer their own insights 
into establishing successful businesses in an increasingly competitive market. Here are 
their stories:

<H3>Ward Connerly</H3>
<P>	Of all the terms used to describe America, none is more descriptive (and it is my 
favorite) than "the land of opportunity." Opportunity, the chance to advance in life, is the 
centerpiece of our value system. It is this concept that separates us from the rest of the 
world. For opportunity to have meaning, there must be entrepreneurs, people who are 
willing to take chances in order to succeed. True entrepreneurs are created not by 
government, but by God, and their natural talents are stimulated by the marketplace.</P>
<P>	In recent years, our nation has begun to debate the effects and consequences of 
"affirmative action." Affirmative action comes in many forms; some are acceptable, even 
desirable, such as advertising the availability of contract opportunities in minority 
communities, and adopting strong measures to ensure that racial and gender 
discrimination have no place in our society.</P>
<P>	Other forms of affirmative action, however, are very damaging to the nation and 
to those whom such programs and practices are designed to benefit. One of the most 
odious forms of affirmative action is the concept of awarding contracts on the basis of 
racial, ethnic, or gender preferences. There are many variations on this theme, but the 
approach taken in California is fairly representative and instructive.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, the California state legislature passed a law requiring every 
state agency to award 15 percent of all contracts to firms owned by minority business 
enterprises (MBEs), 5 percent to firms owned by women-owned business enterprises 
(WBEs), and 3 percent to firms owned by disabled veterans (DVBEs). Minorities are 
defined as "socially and economically disadvantaged" groups and include blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans.</P>
<P>	What are the effects of this policy?</P>
<P>	First, the prospect of getting government contracts, as a result of belonging to a 
protected group, is sometimes a false inducement for people to go into business without 
being adequately prepared to be in business. They often are undercapitalized and lack the 
business acumen to remain in business without government contracts. This is not itself a 
sin, but these businesses tend to become an extension of the government agencies 
themselves. Consequently, the agencies often create contract opportunities to sustain 
these businesses rather than acting to meet their needs or those of the taxpayers.
<P>	Second, the costs and headaches associated with administering the MBE and 
WBE programs are significant. A bureaucracy of MBE/WBE coordinators has been 
established in virtually every department of California's state government. This 
obviously increases the cost of government and creates enormous inefficiencies for 
companies that do business with the state. There is great inconsistency across 
departments, and many officials confess that their programs cost more because of these 
set-aside requirements.</P>
<P>	Third, these practices are marginalizing better-established businesses because they 
are forced to share their contracts with MBE/WBE partners. Few businesses can sacrifice 
23 percent from a contract and still make a profit. I hear the argument that 23 percent is 
not being taken off the top, but rather the total pie is merely being sliced differently. 
Sometimes that is true. Our firm, however, is usually able to carry out most portions of 
our contracts. Yet we must often create a role for those whom we are required to include. 
This generally means subcontracting for tasks that we could perform ourselves at lower 
cost. Whenever we take on a state contract, we lose profit, and our private-sector clients 
bear the burden of our higher prices.</P>
<P>	After 22 years in business, I know that government procurement of goods and 
services is less costly when the specifications are clear and private contractors are able to 
fit these requirements into their methods of doing business. Whenever contractors have to 
customize their methods of delivering products, such as aligning themselves with new 
partners, the cost on a per unit basis of doing business inevitably rises.</P>
<P>	Fourth, the quality of the work sometimes suffers. When you are forced into a 
shotgun relationship with firms with whom you do not regularly do business, it is 
inescapable that you lose some management control over the project.</P>
<P>	Fifth, the policy invites deception. For example, there is evidence that some 
women or minorities listed as "owners" exercise no control over the day-to-day 
operations of their businesses. In some instances, the so-called owner rarely sets foot on 
the premises. How is the goal of equality advanced when, say, a man who has owned a 
construction business for decades suddenly switches ownership to his wife?</P>
<P>	Finally, these set-aside programs are blatantly unfair. Consider my own business. 
I own 50 percent of the stock issued by my company. My wife owns the other 50 percent. 
Technically, neither of us "controls" the business, and we qualify for neither MBE nor 
WBE preferences.</P>
<P>	We have chosen not to change the ownership of our business merely to qualify for 
preferences based on my race or her gender. But why should we operate at a competitive 
disadvantage just because we prefer to be considered on the merits of our work? How 
does society benefit when a business established 22 years ago, by individuals who were 
willing to risk their economic futures, is disfavored in order to lure others to go into 
business?</P>
<P>	Minority set-aside programs are creating all kinds of dysfunction in the 
marketplace, they are unfair, and they are based on the false proposition that government 
should be creating business opportunities for women and minorities. What government 
should be doing is ensuring, through advertising and other forms of outreach, that 
opportunities are equally available, and then allowing the marketplace to produce the 
lowest legitimate bids for the goods and services that the government seeks to procure.</P>

<B>WARD CONNERLY <I>is president of Connerly and Associates, Inc., a Sacramento-based 
consulting firm. He serves on the University of California Board of Regents and recently 
testified in favor of the California Civil Rights Initiative.</I></B>

<H3>Daniel Colimon</H3>
<P>	I operate perhaps the largest black-owned litigation-support firm in California. 
We have been in business for 14 years, and our clients include at least 200 law firms from 
Santa Barbara to San Diego. We have never sought a government contract as a minority 
firm, and federal set-asides for awarding contracts to minority-owned businesses anger 
me to no end.</P>
<P>	After our firm did some work for the legal department of a state utility, one of its 
officials told me that if we became a certified minority enterprise, they would make us 
their primary vendor. There was no discussion of the quality of our work--none 
whatsoever. </P>
<P>	They merely needed to rack up points with the state's Public Utility Commission, 
which requires all state agencies to do at least 15 percent of their business with minority-
owned companies.</P>
<P>	I said no. Commission officials called me every other week for two and a half 
months. They warned that if we continued to refuse, they would simply opt for another 
vendor. They did, and I have since lost 80 percent of their business.</P>
<P>	It is time for America to acknowledge that affirmative action doesn't work. There 
are fatal flaws in set-aside programs, which, despite all of the good intentions, hope, and 
government intervention, have produced very few positive changes. If anything, the white 
"backlash" to affirmative action has perpetuated the polarization of America's various 
ethnic groups.</P>
<P>	If affirmative action was to be the vehicle by which we travel the road to racial 
equality, somewhere along the way we lost first the keys and then the map. If affirmative 
action was to redress past discrimination against African Americans and other racial 
minorities, it has failed miserably:</P>
<UL><LI>  White males dominate the social, political, and business landscape as never before.<BR>
<LI>  Racial minorities are still largely absent from the private sector's management or 
executive boardrooms.<BR>
<LI>  Worst of all, affirmative-action programs have established an extremely damaging 
stereotype that places African Americans and other racial minorities in a very precarious 
position. We are perceived as a group of people who--regardless of how hard we work, 
how educated we become, or what we achieve--would not be where we are without the 
preferential treatment afforded by affirmative-action programs.</UL>
<P>	Throughout my life, I have been taught that the best place to look for help is in the 
mirror. I grew up poor and  black and  in a single-parent household. I graduated from a 
predominantly white university. I have worked since the age of 12. I founded an 
extremely successful litigation-support firm that employs people of all races.</P>
<P>	Although I have suffered with the burden of being a businessman who happens to 
be black, never have I been given nor have I expected preferential treatment simply 
because I am black. I defy anyone to put an asterisk next to any of my accomplishments. I 
have always demanded that I receive respect, not by virtue of what I am, but of who I am. 
Conversely, I have always accorded the same treatment to all I have encountered, 
regardless of race, creed, or national origin.</P>
<P>	My personal experiences with affirmative-action programs, in the business 
community and outside it, have all been negative. It is not popular to be black and 
opposed to affirmative action. When discussing this with other blacks, I've been told that 
I have sold out to the white agenda. On the contrary, I argue that we don't need any 
affirmative-action programs precisely because I believe so strongly in my capabilities and 
those of all people of all races.</P>
<P>	Such programs are not the solution to America's race problem. Truly 
"affirmative" action should take the form of equal-quality education, which will help lead 
to equal political access and equal economic opportunity. Additionally, it is imperative 
that we acknowledge the existence of institutional racial discrimination. Rather than 
disavowing responsibility for it or wasting 25 years on programs that have not worked, 
we should aggressively ferret out those who practice clear discrimination and prosecute 
them. </P>
<P>	Only then will we truly be able to say that we have equal opportunity. The 
measure of this will be a society where people can achieve success regardless of race,  
where people "will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their 
character."</P>

based litigation-support firm.</I></B>

<H3>Herman Cain</H3>
<P>	When Pillsbury Co. hired me as president of Godfather's Pizza, one of its failing 
subsidiaries, we  couldn't count on a government contract to revive the chain. Not only 
did we want to rescue the chain from debt and looming bankruptcy; we wanted to have 
the industry's highest average sales per unit and the highest average profitability per unit. 
You don't get that without a commitment to quality and an acute sensitivity to your 
market.</P>
<P>	When Ronald Gartlan and I later led a team of other managers to buy Godfather's 
Pizza, we didn't use a set-aside program. We had to fight and defend and sell the banks 
on our merit as investors. Our success or failure was based on our own raw business 
ability.</P>
<P>	If there were no federal programs to assist minority business owners, the 1 percent 
of businesses owned by the black community would probably be zero. But federal set-
asides are a double-edged sword: Any time you have a guaranteed participation level, you 
may not have the same incentives or the same motivation to perform as in a situation that 
is driven by performance. On the other hand, without set-asides, many minorities 
candidates for contracts, jobs, or services would not even be considered for inclusion.</P>
<P>	Remember, you need capital to start a business. The lack of access to capital is the 
number one reason for the tiny percentage of black-owned businesses. Set-asides do not 
address the capital issue as it relates to starting, maintaining, and running a business.</P>
<P>	One of the most important aspects of being successful is relationship-building. 
The vendor and the customer have to develop a relationship based on trust and 
performance. But you can't legislate relationships; set-aside programs won't build 
relationships between minority businesses and their customers.</P>
<P>	As a businessman and as a black American, I know there still exists institutional 
racism, which tends to exclude people from consideration. As a result, I've practiced 
several principles to help me achieve my goals:</P>
<UL><LI>  Because I am a black American, I've had to perform better than my white counterparts. 
This is a personal standard that I've set for myself: I've got to perform a little better in 
order to get the same opportunity. I can't just be as good; I've got to be better. It should 
not be this way, but it is.<BR>
<LI>  When I come across those barriers, such as racial bias, I have to let my performance be 
my barrier buster. That's just the price you pay for success.<BR>
<LI>  I have to maintain focus and be tenacious in achieving my objectives.</UL>
<P>	I have been very successful in corporate America because I have refused to allow 
any of the normal obstacles--and there have been many--to stop me. Part of my success 
is linked to getting an opportunity, but another part is taking advantage of the opportunity 
by staying focused. That is something you can't legislate or put in a program.</P>
<P>	When I came to Godfather's, I sought the views of the management, the 
operations people, and the franchises on how we got into the mess we were in and how 
we could get out. By focusing on our strengths and on the market niches where we could 
win, we embarked on a path to recovery. In just over a year--and against intense 
competition--store sales increased about 10 percent, with some restaurants running as 
high as 25 percent. More important than the numbers, however, is the fact that over the 
last several years we have built a foundation for sustained profitability.</P>
<P>	I'm a firm believer that we are put on this earth to make a difference. I happen to 
have been blessed in that I have achieved some business success. But what's truly 
important to me is that I'm able to use the position, compensation, and incentives that go 
along with business success to help make a difference in other people's lives.</P>

more than 525 restaurants nationwide. He is the current president of the National 
Restaurant Association.</B></I>

National Center for Policy Analysis 
Saving the Medicare System with Medical Savings Accounts 
September 15, 1995
</center><p>
 
Earlier this year, the National Center for Policy Analysis addressed 
the Medicare financing crisis with a proposal similar to the one now 
being considered by the Republican leadership in Congress.  Under this 
plan, the elderly would be given a voucher allowing them to obtain 
coverage from a full range of private sector options, including a 
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).  However, the most interesting 
option would be catastrophic insurance paired with a Medical Savings 
Account (MSA).  
<p>
Patient power through Medical Savings Accounts.  
 Under the MSA alternative, the elderly would have catastrophic 
insurance plus a Medical Savings Account.  They would control more of 
their own health care dollars without answering to a health care 
bureaucracy and would likely become more value-conscious shoppers in 
the health care marketplace.  
<p>
What could private insurers do with voucher money?  Milliman & 
Robertson analyzed the cost of high-deductible policies with and 
without a managed care element for Medicare beneficiaries and 
estimated the amount of money that would remain for the MSA.  
According to the analysis:

<p>Without managed care, private insurers could put about $1,500 in a 
Medical Savings Account for each beneficiary and the insurance policy 
would pay for all expenses above $3,000.
<p>
With managed care, private insurers could put about $2,100 in a 
Medical Savings Account and pay for all medical bills above $3,000. 
[See Figure I.]
<p>
Protection against health care costs. 
 One problem with the current Medicare system is that it leaves 
seniors exposed to thousands of dollars in catastrophic health care 
expenses.  By contrast, the MSA plan would allow beneficiaries to 
obtain real catastrophic insurance.
<p>
For example, more than 418,000 Medicare beneficiaries currently pay 
more than $5,000 out of pocket every year.  Under the plan illustrated 
in Figure I, their out-of-pocket expenses could not exceed about $900 
in 1996.
<p>
Cash refunds for being prudent purchasers of care.  Under the current 
Medicare system, if a patient does something to eliminate waste, the 
benefit of that action goes to the government.  But under the MSA 
option, elderly patients who make wise and frugal choices would 
realize financial benefits.  They would keep any money they had not 
spent at the end of each year.  Thus, Medicare beneficiaries would 
receive up to $2,100 a year in cash.
<p>
Coverage for prescription drugs and other services.  Under the current 
system, Medicare does not pay for most prescription drugs and this 
leaves the elderly at risk for limitless pharmaceutical expenses.  But 
under the MSA plan, beneficiaries could have coverage for services not 
currently covered by Medicare by accepting a modest decrease in their 
MSA balance.  For example, the voucher plan would allow private 
insurers to extend coverage to drugs and other items.  Instead of a 
$2,100 MSA deposit, people could have drug coverage and receive a 
Medical Savings Account deposit of about $1,500. 
<p>
Meeting the congressional budget goals without any loss of benefits.  
A peer-reviewed analysis by Milliman & Robert-son demonstrates that 
this proposal for reforming Medicare could save $270 billion over the 
next seven years, and that Medicare beneficiaries would get more - not 
less - protection against health care costs.  Specifically, a voucher 
plan allowing the elderly to switch from Medicare to Medical Savings 
Accounts and catastrophic health insurance would save as much as $195 
billion without any other changes.
<p>
Extending the program to the disabled and making modest reductions in 
the amount of the voucher would save an additional $40 billion.  
<p>
Such options as means-testing benefits by requiring the highest-income 
elderly to pay higher premiums or increasing the age of eligibility 
(currently 65) by one month per year would save at least $30 billion 
more.  
<p>
More savings and an economic boost. 
<p> Currently, Medicare costs are growing faster than private sector 
health care costs, causing medical inflation for everyone.  [See 
Figure II.]  Less health care spending by the elderly would ease the 
pressure on all medical prices and slow the rate of increase in health 
spending.  Using the National Center for Policy Analysis/Fiscal 
Associates Health Care Model, the NCPA finds that by the year 2005, 
Medicare spending would be 18 percent lower than currently projected 
spending, and total U.S. health care costs would be 8.7 percent lower.  
Spending on all health care would decrease by $186 billion and the 
output of other goods and services would increase by $241 billion.
<p>
Best news of all:  seniors would benefit.  This MSA plan is better 
than traditional Medicare in at least five ways:
<p>
<ul><li>The plan provides full coverage for expenses over the deductible, 
while Medicare leaves seniors exposed to catastrophic expenses that 
could devastate their savings.  
<p>
<li>With the MSA, out-of-pocket exposure could be virtually eliminated 
by encouraging the 70 percent of the elderly now paying for private 
Medigap insurance to contribute their Medigap premiums (about $1,200 
per year) to their MSA.
<p>
<li>The MSA funds could be used to pay for health expenses such as 
prescription drugs, which are not covered by Medicare.
<p>
<li>At the end of the year, the beneficiaries could withdraw and spend 
their remaining MSA funds for any purpose, thus sharing directly in 
the reward for keeping Medicare costs down.
<p>
<li>People with MSAs plus catastrophic insurance would be free from 
Medicare rationing restrictions and from concerns about quality of and 
access to care.

This Brief Analysis was prepared by NCPA President John Goodman, 
Senior Fellow Peter Ferrara and Health Policy Director Merrill 
Matthews Jr.  
<p>
Institute Description
<p>
The National Center for Policy Analysis is a nonprofit, nonpartisan 
public policy research institute founded in 1983 and internationally 
known for its studies on public policy issues. It draws on an 
international network of academic advisors, including several Nobel 
Prize winners, to address the most critical policy issues in the 
world. Additionally, the NCPA has several policy experts readily 
available for media inquiries.
<p>
The Center concentrates on health care, tax and environmental issues. 
It is probably best known in the U.S. for its work on tax policy and 
health policy. The NCPA is the only private sector organization that 
prepares a formal forecast of every major bill before Congress. The 
NCPA's concept of Medical Savings Accounts has been endorsed by more 
than 150 members of Congress as the alternative to the Clinton health 
reform plan. And, the NCPA's task force report on pro-free-enterprise 
approaches to environmental problems is being republished in countries 
around the world.
<p>
The NCPA was founded by John C. Goodman, an economist who serves as 
its president, and the late Sir Anthony Fisher. It's primary goal is 
to, "discover and promote private alternatives to government 
regulations and control, solving problems by relying on the strengths 
of the competitive, entrepreneurial private sector."

      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD (HOUSE)<br>
     September 19, 1995<p>

       <p>IMPORTANCE OF A BALANCED BUDGET, WELFARE REFORM AND MEDICARE TO
                                        AMERICA
        <p></center>The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under a previous order of the House,
          the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) is recognized for 5
          minutes.
            Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I have just returned from 4 days in
          Georgia visiting with constituents, meeting with a few civic clubs,
          and riding in a parade or two.  In talking around the district that
          I represent, the coastal area of Georgia, Georgia`s first district,
          the three predominant things that seem to be on people`s minds are
          balancing the budget, reforming welfare, and the changes in the
          Medicare Program.
            On balancing the budget, even though the other body across the
          Hall failed to pass the balanced budget amendment, it is absolutely
          undeniable that the American people want us to balance the budget.
          As a member of the Committee on Appropriations I can say that we
          are moving in that direction.  We have 1 appropriations bill left
          out of 13. Hopefully, we will pass that this week or next week.
          When we do, we will have all of our appropriations bills passed,
          which take us to having a balanced budget by the year 2002.
    <p><center> PAGE H9223</center><p>
            The importance of this, Mr. Speaker, is that as we have these
          billion dollar deficits each year, it takes money away from other
          programs and we are unable to pay down the debt.  Now all we are
          doing is servicing the interest.  Currently, the interest on the
          national debt is the third largest item in our budget every year.
          In 2 years that interest is expected to exceed all of the military
          spending.  Once we get rid of the deficit, we can start paying off
          the principal beyond the interest of the debt.  Of course, it will
          take many, many years.  We have a $4.8 trillion debt.
            The definition, Mr. Speaker, of a trillion, to illustrate it,
          and, first of all, it is almost beyond comprehension, but if we
          spent $100,000 a minute, 24 hours a day, it would take 19 years to
          get to $1 trillion.  We currently have a debt of $4.8 trillion.  We
          simply cannot pass that on to the children of the United States of
          America.
            I think it is very important that this House is moving toward a
          balanced budget as fast as we can.  I certainly hope the folks in
          the other body feel the same way.
     <center><p>PAGE H9223 <p></center>
            We have passed welfare reform in the House. Our welfare reform
          has four significant planks to it.
            No. 1, a work requirement.  If an individual is able-bodied, in
          order to get welfare, they should have to work.
            No. 2, a mechanism to discourage illegitimate births, since that
          is one of the biggest problems in America today.
     <center><p>    PAGE H9223<p></center>
            No. 3, State flexibility.  We may do it differently in Georgia
          than the folks in New York, but let us make those decisions.
            And No. 4, no welfare benefits to illegal aliens.  We want to
          help them if they are hurt in this country, but we also want them
          to get back home if they are not American citizens, so that they
          are not coming over to America to enjoy the benefits of our
          generous public benefits system.
            The third thing people are interested in, of course, is the
          Medicare Program. The current trustees in April said that Medicare
          is going broke.  We have to move to save it.  We are trying to slow
          the growth of it, trying to make the growth of Medicare inflation
          about 6 percent, which is closer to what it is in regular medical
          inflation.  Actually, regular medical inflation was down last
          year.  It was not even inflation.  But the costs were down.
    <p><center>PAGE H9223</center><p>
            The thing we need to do on Medicare is protect and preserve it by
          simplifying it.  We want to give senior citizens a whole list of
          options: choice of doctors, choice of traditional fee-for-service
          plans, choice of traditional Medicare, and, along with that, some
          other options like Medisave accounts and so forth.
            We believe all this can be done, Mr. Speaker, and the result will
          be a better product to American seniors.  Again, we want to protect
          and preserve it.
            The big frustration that the American people seem to be having is
          while we have done a lot of things in the House, across the Hall,
          in the other body, they are taking the route of inaction.  It is
          true today they passed welfare reform, but we passed ours back in
          March. It is time to bring these issues to a question.  Will the
          other body and will the executive branch join the House, the lower
          Chamber, in making the reforms necessary to preserve our country?
  <p><center>PAGE H9223<p></center>
            I hope that they will, because we are clearly on the road to
          personal responsibility, personal discipline, balancing the budget,
          lowering taxes, decreasing Government regulation and
          micromanagement out of Washington, and, best of all and most
          importantly, increasing personal freedom.  We cannot do it alone.
          We have to have the cooperation of the full legislative branch of
          Government, which means the other body, and we have to have the
          executive branch to sign this into law.
            Mr. Speaker, if we can get the cooperation of the folks across
          the hall, I believe we will have a balanced budget, we will have
          Medicare reform, and we will have welfare reform.  This, Mr.
          Speaker, I believe, is what the American people are asking for.

<P>
Thirty years ago this March, Daniel Patrick Moynihan issued his
famous warning about the breakdown of the black family.  At the
time, liberal intellectuals and civil rights activists excoriated
him for &quot;defending middle-class values.&quot;  &quot;What
may seem to be a disease to the white middle class may be a healthy
adaptation to the Negro lower class,&quot;[1] Bayard Rustin intoned.
<P>
Today, however, overwhelming empirical evidence demonstrates that
there is nothing at all &quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of
families and that not all personal choices are equal in terms
of their impact on children, families, and communities.  The evidence
itself has propelled illegitimacy to the forefront of the current
national debate over welfare reform.
<P>
While a burgeoning white illegitimacy rate has helped strip the
debate of racial overtones, a black Democrat named Wayne Bryant
has pioneered in the state of New Jersey one of the key anti-illegitimacy
provisions recently adopted by the U.S. House.  The so-called
&quot;family cap&quot; would deny benefit increases to mothers
who bear additional illegitimate children while on welfare.
<P>
The essential purpose of the reform, according to Bryant, is to
restore healthy families.  &quot;Until the needs and the problems
of the family are confronted in a comprehensive way, welfare will
continue its course of entrapping one generation after the next
in a modern form of slavery,&quot;[2] he wrote in a paper describing
his proposal.
<P>
By incorporating the family cap, Senator Bryant intended, not
to constrict reproductive choices or to reduce births per se,
but to promote a sense of responsibility by insisting that families
on welfare live by the same values and confront exactly the same
choices as the general population.  He explained the rationale
for the cap in a series of newspaper interviews:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These welfare reform measures are not so much about capping family
size as they are about giving recipients a chance to make choices.
 Under our conventional welfare system, 
welfare mothers are effectively shielded from confronting the
difficult questions that other American parents face when considering
additional children.... I never pretended or intended to have
the law bring about a dramatic increase in births.  It was a responsibility
issue.... Why should people on welfare be guaranteed a 'raise'
when they have additional children?  If a person wants to enlarge
their family while on welfare, they should go to work to support
the additional children like any other working family....No one
is saying welfare mothers can't have families.  We're just saying
the state won't pay for it....If the kids are suffering because
parents are irresponsible in having children they cannot afford,
they'll still suffer if we give them the money because the parents
will still be irresponsible....The battle is dissolving the wall
that separates welfare families from the mainstream population
-- and the cap is an important part of that effort.[3]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Echoing Senator Bryant's most popular argument, California's welfare
commissioner Eloise Anderson is even more blunt: &quot;Working
women do not get automatic raises when they have children.  Why
should our expectations of a woman on AFDC be any different than
any other woman?  Do we think they're stupider or less capable
of being rational?&quot;[4] New Jersey's human services commissioner,
William Waldman, agrees: &quot;A lot of what we do [in the name
of welfare] is very patronizing.&quot;[5]
<P>
Since the family cap took effect in New Jersey in August of 1993,
the birth rate among welfare mothers in the state has dropped
substantially -- powerful proof that women on welfare are indeed
capable of governing their own decisions.  Robert Rector of the
Heritage Foundation estimates a decrease greater than 20 percent;[6]
but like Wayne Bryant, he too emphasizes that even if the birthrate
had not fallen the policy would be justified.  &quot;I support
the family cap simply because it's morally correct,&quot;[7] Rector
says.
<P>
Even the more conservative estimate of the birthrate decrease
reported by the New Jersey Department of Human Services (11.4
percent)[8] vindicates the two fundamental principles underlying
the current national debate: that economic incentives do influence
out-of-wedlock childbearing and that subsidizing irresponsible
sexual behavior has accelerated the moral and cultural decline
beyond what even Moynihan envisioned.
<P>
While Charles Murray notes that much of the force of noneconomic
social stigma was underwritten by economics in the past, he argues
that contemporary &quot;[w]elfare will not be abolished [despite
the potential economic savings to communities] until the moral
sanctions against illegitimacy have also gained great strength.&quot;[9]
 The seeming paradox highlights the difficulty of defining precisely
how government can promote character formation.
<P>
James Q. Wilson answers that &quot;[t]he essential first step
is to acknowledge that at root, in almost every area of important
public concern, we are seeking to induce persons to act virtuously&quot;[10]
-- a statement that has grown less controversial in the 30 years
since the Moynihan Report met with violent protest from moral
relativists who denied the existence of an absolute standard of
virtue.  Today, there is a mounting public consensus that bearing
children out of wedlock is wrong and that the perverse incentives
of the welfare system share much of the blame.
<P>
In a continuation of the same passage, Professor Wilson explains
the moral implications of economic incentives: &quot;Virtue is
not learned by precept...; it is learned by the regular repetition
of right actions.... Seen this way, there is no conflict between
economic thought and moral philosophy: The latter simply supplies
a fuller statement of the uses to which the former can and should
be put.  We...induce habits of right conduct...by arranging the
incentives confronting youngsters in the ordinary aspects of their
daily lives so that right action routinely occurs.&quot;[11]
<P>
Yet, morality is not merely a product of rational choices in response
to economic incentives.  If man is more than a material being,
then it is not unreasonable to expect some individual moral decisions
to override the economic incentives that run against the grain
of virtue.  Nor is it implausible to suggest that, of all the
choices an individual mother must make, the decision to abort
her child -- the most galvanizing moral issue of our day -- is
the one least likely to respond to policy variables.  
<P>
Precisely because human behavior is governed by a unique complex
of moral instinct and rational choice, the elimination of additional
cash benefits in New Jersey has decreased the birthrate without
causing an upsurge in the abortion rate.  While it is far too
premature to draw any decisive conclusions, there is absolutely
no statistical confirmation as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the New Jersey family cap took effect August
1, 1993.In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions in New Jersey
declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[12]
<P>
In fact, Anita Leone, executive director of an association that
represents all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey,
asserted in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in
New Jersey are currently <I>decreasing</I>.  We just don't know
why.&quot;[13] Because the decline in the birth rate among welfare
mothers in New Jersey has been rather substantial since the implementation
of the family cap, the fact that an increase in abortions is not
evident is particularly significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the front-lines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds <I>not</I>
to terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[14]
<P>
Women interviewed at Chelton Terrace in New Jersey said &quot;they
didn't see the cap forcing women into abortion clinics.  'It's
not going to make them get any more abortions than what they've
been getting,' one woman said.  'If you want to have that baby,
you will.'&quot;[15] Another woman in Camden, New Jersey said that
she knew about the cap but decided to have her baby anyway.  &quot;Abortion
is against my faith,&quot;[16] she explained.
<P>
A church pastor in the same town related a telling story.  A young
welfare mother had come to the church grieving over a miscarriage.
 Another pastor gently reminded her that she really had no way
of providing for a second child and that the state would not increase
her grant.  &quot;But it just didn't make sense to her,&quot;[17]
the pastor concluded, because mothers do not tend to subject their
relationships with their children to a strict cost-benefit analysis.
 Only the most callous of mothers places a price tag on her baby's
head.
<P>
One welfare mother recently quoted in <i>The New York Times</i>
said it perhaps most eloquently: &quot;[My fourth child] wasn't
planned, but I wasn't going to abort her.  Sixty-four dollars
is not going to change my love for my child, and if I would have
aborted her, it wouldn't have comforted my soul.... You just learn
that a pound of ground beef is overrated.&quot;[18]
<P>
Michelle Scholz of the Northwest Pregnancy Center in Washington,
D.C. explains that in her experience a mother decides first whether
or not to keep her baby and, then, how to pay for the child's
care.[19] Sister Connie Driscoll, founder of St. Martin de Porres
House of Hope in Chicago, testifies that over 9,000 destitute
women have passed through her shelter in the last 12 years.  Not
one of those women has opted for an abortion.[20]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[21] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <i>lower</i> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[22]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrate that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[23]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
The findings in New Jersey are striking evidence of the latent
moral potential in welfare mothers that is begging to be cultivated,
rather than frustrated by the perpetuation of policies that subsidize
immorality.  Remedial policies should reconcile the current tension
between moral knowledge and the economic incentives of the welfare
system -- before moral knowledge is altogether gone from the inner
city.
<P>
Charles Murray explains that, when illegitimacy reaches a critical
mass, the neighborhood effects create problems that extend far
beyond the recipients of welfare.  Community values and the norms
for male behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young
men and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.[24]
<P>
Yet, conservatives must acknowledge that government cannot be
an effective moral teacher.  Public policy can undermine, but
never instill, virtue.
<P>
Rather than attempting to devise the perfect bundle of carrots
and sticks, we must eliminate altogether the government subsidies
that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding them from
the natural economic consequences.  Michael Tanner of the Cato
Institute writes: &quot;We could reasonably expect that people,
faced with the consequences of their actions, would change their
behavior.  Such an approach would avoid coercion and the conceit
that government knows best.&quot;[25]
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  In <i>The
Road to Serfdom</i>, F. A. Hayek emphasized the symbiotic relationship
between morality and freedom from government intervention:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is
the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values
are daily re-created in the free decision of the individual.[26]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It is the intrinsic truth of Hayek's observation that motivated
Wayne Bryant to institute the family cap in New Jersey -- a cap
he himself describes as a mechanism to reduce government constriction
of personal choices.[27]
<P>
Government must instead cede ground to the character-forming institutions
that are found in every community -- families, churches, schools,
charities, and other traditional arrangements that have been supplanted
by public authorities.  Rather than merely ending government programs,
conservatives intend to <I>replace</I> government welfare by advancing
proposals like a tax credit for charitable contributions that
will help to strengthen civil institutions.
<P>
Unless those institutions are reinvigorated and social functions
are restored to neighborhoods and communities, the behavioral
problems Daniel Patrick Moynihan described 30 years ago will only
continue to grow more acute, jeopardizing personal freedoms and
ultimately the survival of the republic itself.  If it is true
that moral values do not have concrete meaning in the absence
of freedom, it is also true that the preservation of political
liberty depends upon the cultivation 
of virtue in the people.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The rates in columns 2 and 3 are defined as abortions per
1,000 females on AFDC.  The twelve months prior to implementation
of the cap are August 1992 through July 1993.  The cap took effect
August of 1993, and the most recent monthly data available are
March 1994 because of a time lag in reporting.</FONT>
<P>
<HR><P>
Together with all who decry abortion, the Family Research Council
reacted with concern to press reports Tuesday that New Jersey
experienced a &quot;slight increase in the abortion rate among
women on welfare during the first eight months since implementation
of the family cap.&quot;[1]
<P>
We were relieved to discover for ourselves and are now eager
to reassure fellow pro-life advocates that the data released do
not support the conclusion that the family cap has increased abortions.
<P>
Of course, no one can ascribe causality to the family cap, no
matter how the abortion rate appears to have changed.  Officials
from the New Jersey Department of Human Services themselves stress
emphatically that &quot;additional data and analysis are required
before any link can be made between the family cap and the abortion
rate.&quot;[2]
<P>
The much more immediate problem, however, is that the numbers
just released do not describe a consistent upward trend in abortions
as the accompanying press release suggested -- and the newspapers
then hastened to report.  Instead, the raw numbers indicate that
there is no real change in the rates, other than the normal month-to-month
fluctuation that would be expected regardless of the cap.   
<P>
Jacqueline Tencza, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of
Human Services, herself cautioned that &quot;the department does
not believe that the [perceived] increase is statistically significant
[i.e., other than a normal distribution of values] because it
is based on a short period of time and compared with only one
previous year.&quot;[3]
<P>
Upon closer scrutiny, the alleged &quot;increase in the abortion
rate&quot; is strictly a function of the particular eight-month
time period isolated for analysis.
<P>
The abortion rate for the month of March 1994 (or March 1993)
is noticeably and significantly greater than any other rate included
in the chart, in part because the month of March contains 23 weekdays
as opposed to the average 21.7 days.  Excluding that one anomalous
rate yields a total monthly average of 9.44 for the period following
implementation of the cap -- which is virtually equal to the pre-cap
average monthly abortion rate of 9.43.
<P>
Examining the pre-cap and post-cap numbers month by month helps
underscore the fact that a straightforward comparison of the two
8-month averages listed in the chart is meaningless.  Three of
the eight months before implementation of the cap in fact posted
a higher abortion rate than the corresponding months in the year
after the cap took effect.
<P>
The waters grow considerably murkier, moreover, when calculations
of average monthly abortion rates include the rates for the four
pre-implementation months in 1993 not included in the chart released
Tuesday.  When the rates for these months (10.96 in April 1993;
9.33 in May 1993; 10.9 in June 1993; and 10.34 in July 1993)[4] are
included, the average monthly abortion rate for the entire year
before implementation of the cap is 9.75 -- again, virtually equal
to the average rate for the eight months since the cap (the only
post-cap months for which data are currently available).  It is
possible, in fact, to isolate a different eight-month period prior
to the cap for which the average monthly abortion rate is higher
than the average calculated for the eight months post-cap.[5]
<P>
It would, of course, be foolish to jump to the conclusion that
abortions must have declined in New Jersey since implementation
of the cap -- but no more foolish than it is to conclude that
abortions have definitely increased in New Jersey, based on the
comparison of two 8-month averages.  It is worthwhile to note
in passing that to date the numbers do not exclude the possibility
that abortions have declined slightly since the cap took effect.
<P>
Given what limited data we have, however, it appears most probable
that the New Jersey family cap is essentially abortion-neutral.
 And we can assert with a large measure of confidence that the
fears of a large upsurge in the short-term abortion rate are unfounded.
<P>
But we repeat again, as we have carefully stated in all previous
comments on the family cap:  It is far too premature to draw any
decisive conclusions from the welfare reform experiment in New
Jersey.  Indeed, it would be a travesty for the national debate
over an issue as critical as welfare reform to rise or fall on
the basis of preliminary returns from one state.
<P>
New Jersey, of course, is a worst-case scenario for the family
cap because it is one of the few states that provides public funding
for abortion.  Failure to demonstrate a consistent, upward trend
in the abortion rate in New Jersey in particular confirms that
it is perfectly appropriate for the debate over the family cap
to go forward.  Given the pathologies of our current welfare system,
the debate <I>must</I> go forward.
<P>
Even with the release of the most recent data, there is still
every reason to theorize that the family cap may be functioning
as a new safeguard for the lives of the unborn.  To know whether
the net effect of the family cap is an increase or a decrease
in the abortion rate, we must know the number of abortions performed
on women who have left the state's welfare rolls.  If the cap
encouraged them to become self-sufficient or to seek alternative
means of support for their babies -- as the framers of the policy
intended -- the abortion rate for former welfare mothers may very
well have decreased.  And the total number of abortions in New
Jersey may have declined.  If that proves to be the case, in a
state that provides public funding for abortions, we will have
powerful evidence to predict that the family cap will be actively
anti-abortion in a state that does not fund or otherwise encourage
abortion.    
<P>
Family Research Council, however,  has never maintained that the
legitimacy of the family cap depends on its capacity to reduce
abortions over the short-term.  The current welfare system is
indelibly anti-marital and anti-natal -- peacefully coexisting
with the world's highest abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
 Long-term change may entail some risk of short-term harm, but
the cost of reform must be weighed against the moral cost of perpetuating
a system that destroys the lives of both the born and yet unborn.
<P>
The family cap is the only welfare reform initiative in the Senate
debate that will directly reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which
is strongly correlated with abortion.  Ardent support for the
family cap <I>is</I> the pro-life position because marriage is
the best protection for children both before and after birth.
 Paying women not to have abortions, by contrast, is morally corrupt.

<P>
<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear that the cap could promote an
increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates who support the measure
share both this concern and the long-term goal of driving abortions
to the point of zero.  Unlike the more conventional conflict between
pro-life and pro-choice groups, pro-life differences over the
family cap represent a dispute over means, not ends, that is complicated
by the absence of any hard data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  We should forfeit no battles, but neither can we expect
to win the war against abortion on demand without a comprehensive,
long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long
term but deserves their active support in the short term.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important 
issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending altogether
the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
To increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to a significant
number of people who do not now see the moral force in such arguments,
we must begin the task of rebuilding civil institutions that will
nourish human souls and liberate them to fulfill their full potential.
 Such an ambitious project will require a multifaceted strategy,
and eliminating the welfare benefits that encourage illegitimacy
must be a key component of that strategy.
<P>
The real fault-line in the current welfare debate is not between
pro-life social conservatives and economic libertarians.  Rather,
the crucial dispute pits those who think relimiting government
is a prerequisite for moral reform against those who believe that
the size of government bears no relation to cultural decay.
<P>
Most of the outspoken pro-life opponents of welfare reform do
not deny that reducing illegitimacy will reduce abortions.  Instead,
they deny that welfare subsidies increase illegitimacy.  The blame
belongs exclusively, they say, to &quot;the sex-drenched culture.&quot;
<P>
Yet, in a perverse twist of logic, the same pro-lifers also maintain
that abortion rates respond quite sensitively to small changes
in the size of cash benefits.
<P>
If man is more than a material being, then it is not unreasonable
to expect some individual moral decisions to override the economic
incentives that run against the grain of virtue.  Nor is it implausible
to suggest that, of all the choices an individual mother must
make, the decision to abort her child -- the most galvanizing
moral issue of our day -- is the one <I>least</I> likely to respond
to economic policy variables.  To suggest otherwise, in fact,
is to assert a particularly virulent form of economic determinism,
with the implication that morality is little more than a product
of rational choices in response to dollar incentives.
<P>
Thus, some pro-life advocates arrive at the argument that government
must pay women not to have abortions.  And while they advocate
incentivizing virtue, they are unwilling to give any credence
to the suggestion that welfare's economic incentives encourage
vice -- including abortion.
<P>
Cultural conservatives believe the diametric opposite: Public
policy can undermine, but never instill, virtue because government
cannot be an effective moral teacher.  Rather than attempting
to devise the perfect bundle of carrots and sticks to reward virtue
and penalize vice, we must eliminate altogether the government
subsidies that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding
them from the natural economic consequences.
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  The vast
majority of pro-life social conservatives support restrictions
on welfare benefits, while the majority of pro-lifers who oppose
reform couple their concerns about abortion with a commitment
to big government.
<P>
Failure to understand the real source of the pro-life dispute
now threatens to obscure the critical nexus between morality and
freedom from government intervention.  Misunderstanding the relationship
between morality and freedom in turn threatens both the moral
authority of limited government and the efficacy of cultural reform.
<P>
The Founders instituted a limited government to secure natural
rights, including the right to life; but as George Will noted
in a recent editorial, &quot;Our creed of limited government has
a corollary vision of human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot;
captured by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life proponents forget that at their peril in the
present debate over illegitimacy.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

<H2>RESPONSES TO LIBERAL SCARE TACTICS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  The movement away from cash benefits affects only a small percentage
of the prospective caseload.  It is the least we can do and still
claim that we are changing the system.
<P>
<LI>  By targeting teenagers, we intend to stop the cycle of misery
before it starts.
<P>
<LI>  Liberal social groups base their projections about the number
of children who will be cut from the rolls on a flawed and biased
study by a liberal think-tank, which derived the figures by going
back in time 10 years and implementing the bill, then returning
to the present -- without assuming any change in behavior or population
size.   
<P>
<LI>  The elimination of benefits affects only potential future additions
to the welfare rolls.  Not one person currently receiving welfare
would lose any benefits the day after the bill is passed. Given the Faustian bargain we have made
with current recipients,
it would be unethical to require them to function normally at
this stage.  Instead, we must protect future generations from
becoming mired in the habits of dependency.
<P>
The under-18 provision applies only with respect to federal funding.
 States are free to use state funds as they see fit.
<P>
<LI>  Minor mothers retain Medicaid, food stamps, and housing benefits.
<P>
<LI>  The federal government spends welfare dollars very inefficiently.
 One study found that less than 35 cents out of every federal
welfare dollar was paid in cash directly to the needy.  If the
federal government gave all the money it spends on welfare directly
to the poor, each family of four would receive more than the average
American family income.
<P>
<LI>  By cashing out AFDC benefits, the federal government frees
new dollars which the states can then spend on services for young
unwed mothers -- more compassionate alternatives that will minister
personally to mothers and children, instead of sapping their spirits.
<P>
<LI>  Private charitable efforts rescue far more individuals than
government social programs. Historically, private-sector organizations have succeeded in
transforming
the poor by setting behavioral standards for the receipt of assistance.
 Because it is far easier to receive a check in the mail, no questions
asked, federal welfare has kept the needy from receiving real
help. 
<P>
<LI>  In 1991, private charities provided, in cash or in kind, over
$176 billion for health, education, and welfare.  More than $100
billion of that amount was in cash.  The same year, Americans
volunteered time and manpower the equivalent of nine million full-time
employees.  After declining steadily through the 1960s and 1970s,
charitable giving rose during the 1980s.
<P>
<LI>  It is wrong to defer welfare cuts until some direct replacement
is identified for every current recipient because bad charity
drives out good.

<TITLE>THE TRUTH ABOUT AFDC</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>THE TRUTH ABOUT AFDC</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
 <I>MYTH:  Single mothers heading households
alone are being unfairly singled out in the discussion of reforming
the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  According to the Census Bureau, the vast majority (87 percent)
of AFDC recipients live in single-parent households.  Nearly half
(47 percent) of the mothers on AFDC have never married; 23 percent
are widowed or divorced; and 17 percent are married, but living
without a husband present in the home.  Only 13 percent of women
receiving AFDC are married and living with a spouse. 
<P><BR>
<I>MYTH:  Women
receiving AFDC have the same childbearing patterns as non-AFDC
women.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  Women on AFDC are significantly younger than other
first-time mothers when they bear their first child.  The average
age of new mothers in the AFDC population (age 20) is three years
younger than the average age of non-AFDC mothers at first birth.
 AFDC mothers also have a slightly higher average number of children
(2.6 children).
<P>
<BR>
<I>MYTH:  If AFDC mothers had guaranteed child care
and additional material resources, they could earn their college
degrees in a matter of years.</I>
<P>
<B> FACT:</B>  While 85 percent of non-AFDC
women are at least high school graduates, almost half (44 percent)
of AFDC mothers do not have a high school diploma.  Only 19 percent
of women receiving AFDC have completed at least one year of college.
<P>
<BR>
<I>MYTH: The majority of AFDC recipients are minorities.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  There are far more white women in their childbearing years on AFDC (27.4
million) than African-American and Hispanic mothers combined (5.7
million and 4.2 million respectively).  Minority women, however,
do receive aid in numbers disproportionate to their population
size.  Only 7 percent of white mothers collect AFDC, while 26
percent of African-American mothers and 19 percent of Hispanic
mothers receive AFDC benefits.

<TITLE>QUOTABLE COMMENTS ON WELFARE REFORM AND

<P>
<H2>QUOTABLE COMMENTS ON
<BR>WELFARE REFORM AND
<BR>ILLEGITIMACY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
&quot;Welfare programs must contribute to the attack on family
breakdown and illegitimacy.  Unless such problems are dealt with
effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping the strength of society
as a whole and extending their consequences in troubled families
from one generation to the next.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- John F. Kennedy</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Illegitimacy is the single most important social problem
of our time because it drives everything else.  The task is not
to devise a public relations campaign to discourage single teenage
girls from having babies, but to neutralize whatever is impeding
the age-old impulse of human beings to form families.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Charles Murray</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;The real source of the problem is the inordinate number
of out-of-wedlock births in this country.  There's no question
that ending welfare for unwed mothers would work.  The question
is, 'Is it morally right?'&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Bill Clinton</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;I do believe that having children out of wedlock is wrong.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Donna Shalala</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Unmarried teen childbearing is morally wrong because of
its costs for children and society.  It is wrong -- not simply
foolish or impractical -- for women and men to make babies they
cannot support emotionally and financially.  We must reject moral
relativism and reassert our common values.  It is also time to
challenge the complacent view that having babies out of wedlock
is simply a lifestyle choice, and that since all lifestyles choices
are equally valid, no behavior should be condemned.  This stance
is untenable in the face of compelling evidence that not all choices
are equal in terms of their impact on children, and that children
need fathers as well as mothers.  Massive federal spending on
remedial programs will not solve the problem.  Families are the
primary socializers of children; families teach children how to
be citizens.  To deprive children of crucial adult models of citizenship,
anthropologist David Murray suggests, is to 'undercapitalize'
society's investment in its own future.  The social welfare system
has 'normalized' fatherless families.  The dilemma is this: Everything
the welfare system does to create normal and acceptable lives
for the children of teen mothers creates the perception that their
parents' behavior is normal and acceptable.  The system makes
government rather than parents ultimately responsible for the
lives of children.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Progressive Policy Institute</I>

<P>
<BR>
&quot;The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root,
in almost every area of important public concern, we are seeking
to induce persons to act virtuously.  Not only is such conduct
desirable in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if
large improvements are to be made in those matters we consider
problems.  In Victorian England and Victorian America, countless
organizations tried to save the children and they succeeded. 
They did so on the basis of firm convictions as to what constitutes
a decent family life.  We have rejected implicitly if not explicitly
the moral convictions that underlay that effort, replacing child-saving
programs with something we now call condescendingly welfare. 
Replacing our desire to save children with the desire merely to
end poverty or dependency [sic].&quot;
<BR>
<I>- James Q. Wilson</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;After making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and 'value-free,' we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Gertrude Himmelfarb</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;We looked at a hundred different programs around the country
that were trying to deal with out-of-wedlock births, and not one
of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any results.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- anonymous Clinton aide</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;I know this must seem a strange message from a not particularly
religious writer in an utterly secular newspaper, but I am increasingly
struck by two phenomena.  The first is the growing sense that
America's major failings are not political or economic but moral.
 The second is the discovery that the most successful <I>social</I>
programs are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly --
by moral or religious values.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- William Raspberry</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Washington's continued medicalization of teen pregnancy
ignores the lessons of the past 20 years and is doomed to fail.
 Dealing with teenage pregnancy requires a one-on-one discussion
of values and morality.  What many call sexual liberation has
brought with it unhappy consequences for millions of teens.  This
is not liberation.  It is bondage for the child-mother and the
mother's child.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Joseph Califano</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;The project of self-government depends on the capacity of
citizens to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?&quot;
<BR>

<title>Job Prospects for College Graduates</title>

<h3>Job Prospects for College Graduates:  What's the Problem?</h3><br>
<h4>by Kate Obenshain Griffin<br>
Director of Program Development<br>
<a href="/yaf">Young America's Foundation</a><br>
September 7, 1995</h4><br>
</center>

	Students arriving at the "Ivies" this fall are encountering a surprising phenomenon.  Women's studies courses outnumber economics classes, often by as much as two to one.  Princeton remains the lone exception, but not by much:  25 women's studies courses compared with 32 in economics.<p>
	This phenomenon has something to do with the fact that over 50 percent of those who graduated from college in May still cannot find jobs appropriate for their degrees.  But that's only half the picture;  the following anecdote completes it.  <p>
	<i>New Republic</i> editor and outspoken liberal Michael Kinsley wrote this of his attempt to hire a recent college graduate as his research assistant:  "[T]he government makes it comically difficult for the honest citizen to hire a single employee."  Comical to some, but not to the new graduate.  Kinsley said government regulation "plunges you into an entirely new dimension of complexity as an employer" with "a minimum of 37 different forms and 50 separate checks to hire a single employee for a year."  As a result of government regulation, Kinsley's young assistant ended up right back where he found her:  in the unemployment line.<p>
	Two simple reasons explain why half of today's college graduates cannot find jobs befitting their degree.  First, colleges are not preparing students adequately and employers know it.  They are focusing on fads such as women's studies rather than spending limited resources on core academic subjects.  And second, burgeoning government regulation is having a pernicious, and often underestimated, impact on the job market. <p>
	Thanks to a dramatic shift in the direction of college curricula, a degree no longer indicates proficiency in the basic skills.  The <i>New York Times</i> reported that employers, "express a lack of confidence in the ability of schools and colleges to prepare young people for the workplace."  According to a major report by the National Center on the Educational Quality of the Workforce, employers, well aware of grade inflation, "pay little attention to measurements of school performance."  Nevzer Stacey of the Department of Education went one step further:  "Employers have given up on the schools."<p>
	What are our colleges and universities doing wrong?  While skill requirements for employment are increasing (57 percent of employers say skill requirements have increased), the quality and substance of our educational institutions are eroding.  Except at a few select schools which have maintained their commitment to quality academic instruction, multicultural and politically correct courses supplant classes that have practical value for future employment.  <p>
	What courses are now preparing our students for the work force?  At Columbia University this fall: <i> Race, Gender, and the Politics of Rock 'n' Roll</i> and <i>The Invisible Women in Literature</i>:<i> The Lesbian Literary Tradition</i>.   At Penn:  <i>Search for Extraterrestrial Life</i> and <i>(Im)possible Animals</i>.  At Brown:  <i>Unnatural Acts and Split Britches</i>, <i>Circumcision: Male and Female, Jewish and Gentile and Daughters of Darkness: Lesbian Tropes</i>.  And Harvard, not to give students the idea that the free market might is a good thing, offers <i>Alternative Economies:</i>  <i>The Case Against Capitalism</i>, <i>1648-1848</i> in addition to activist-oriented <i>Status of Environmental Justice as a Public Policy Issue</i> and<i> AIDS, Health, and Human Rights</i>.  Other courses influencing students' outlook on the free market include Cornell's <i>The Selfish Individual and the Modern World</i>, Princeton's <i>Income Distribution</i>, and Yale's<i> Gender and the Politics of Resistance:  Feminism, Capitalism and the Third World.</i> <p>
	According to a recent survey in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, finding a good job is the number one reason students attend college.  Yet schools are so caught up in hot political issues that they have lost sight of a critical aspect of their mission:  training students for the workforce.  As Wendy Bounds of the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> said, "After an outlay of thousands of dollars, college graduates discover that a bachelor's degree doesn't buy what it did 10 years ago."<p>
	Hand in hand with higher education's own responsibility for the attrition of opportunities for college graduates is another culprit:  government regulation.  While Clinton panders to the twenty-something crowd with his expensive AmeriCorps and student loan programs, his administration's regulatory policies are having a baleful effect.  Businesses are forced to spend vast resources on compliance with regulations rather than on expansion and hiring.  Take the paper industry for example.  Over the past four years, one of the largest book paper suppliers in North America, P.H. Glatfelter, spent <i>$180 million</i> to satisfy regulatory requirements.  That is $180 million that will not be spent developing the business or hiring new workers. <p>   
	The numbers are staggering.  There are four times more federal regulations today than in 1965 and 14 times more than in 1950, totaling over 200 volumes and 132,000 pages.  Estimates show regulations costing the U.S. economy over $500 billion annually.  Employment quotas, for instance, set businesses back between $5 and $8 billion annually on direct compliance (government paperwork, mandated advertising in minority newspapers, etc.).  Many billions more, however, are lost in indirect costs due to the diversion of management time, resources, and energy.  And according to author Thomas Sowell, minorities have not benefited from this loss.  He says the relative economic position of minorities has actually fallen since the United States implemented employment quotas.  <p>
	As a result of new and existing regulations, the jobs students have counted on are just not there.  Rather than pay the price of expansion, businesses are either stagnant or cutting back.  During July and August 1995, manufacturing jobs declined by an average of 38,000 per month.  Yet in August alone, government <i>increased</i> its payroll by 73,000 jobs.  That is 73,000 new bureaucrats to write, revise and enforce regulations which are largely responsible for factories losing 120,000 jobs overall in 1995. <p>
	While universities educate students in <i>The Drama of Homosexuality </i>(Harvard) and <i>Spirit Possession</i>, <i>Shamanism</i>, <i>Curing and Witchcraft</i> (Cornell), the Clinton administration is doing little to plan for the employment needs of future graduates.   For instance, there are <i>one million </i>cosmetology grads who cannot find jobs in their field.  Yet this year, there will be <i>200,000</i> new cosmetology students, many of whom will seek and receive assistance from federal loan programs.  While the Clinton administration demands increases in student loan program funding, those funds are not granted to students according to any reasonable estimate of what the market can sustain.  Rather, this administration is more concerned about building demand for federal student loan programs than in planning for employment needs.  Consequently, higher education continues to send graduates into ridiculously glutted markets, or no markets at all. <p> 
	Is it any wonder that over 50 percent of May's graduates are still looking for the jobs they hoped their degrees would lead them to?  If we continue to ignore the obvious impact of an increasingly politically correct curriculum, staggering new and existing regulations, and poor investment planning with taxpayer dollars on the part of the Clinton administration, recent college graduates, once our brightest hope for the future, will be increasingly unwanted in the workforce.<p>

<CENTER><H3>Winning the Next Education Battle</H3><p>
<A HREF="mailto:spaldingm@heritage.org">Matthew Spalding</A><br>

</CENTER>
<hr>
<br>
  Education will surely be an important issue in the 1996 presidential election.  President Clinton
regularly uses the issue as a weapon against Republican budget austerity and fiscal conservatism,
as was the case when a smaller than anticipated increase in federal funding for school lunches
(but an increase none the less) became a "cut" in the program and thus an attack on the whole
education system.<P>
    The next battle is likely to be over the financial aid program for college students--specifically the
Clinton administration's plan to provide direct government funded student loans.  Congress in
1993 approved a phase-in of the program over at least five years.  The Administration hopes to
accelerate the program to reach 100% participation in 1997-8.  Rep. William Goodling (R-PA),
Chairman of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and Nancy Kassebaum
(R-Kan), Chairman of Labor and Human Resources Committee, have separately introduced
legislation (HR 530 and S 495) to cap the growth of the direct loan program at the 40% level.  In
light of recent cost estimates for the program, some are now calling for a complete repeal of the
program.<P>

    This time around conservatives are on solid ground.  The prudent and fiscally responsible
position is to eliminate the program before it costs American taxpayers -- not to mention
American college students -- more than they can afford.  Besides, getting rid of this program is
pro-education.  Here are four reason why.<P>
<ol>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program does not save money</STRONG>.  By streamlining and centralizing the
whole student loan program, direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. 
President Clinton's 1996 budget claims $5.2 billion in savings if the direct loan program is fully
implemented and replaces guaranteed loans.  A recent report by the Congressional Budget
Office, however, argues that the direct loan program, if fully implemented, would save only $115
million over the next seven years.  The difference is largely explained by changes in official
budget scoring to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of direct loans.  (It
is also due to the removal from the cost estimate of savings that are not due to the direct loan
program.)  Indeed, according to the updated CBO report, eliminating the direct loan program and
maintaining the guaranteed program would save $1.5 billion over the next seven years.  <P>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program adds considerably to the national debt</STRONG>.  As it currently stands
private lenders provide the capital for the loans, private and state guarantor agencies process the
loans and the federal government subsidizes the loan interest rate, guarantees the loans in cases
of default and exercises regulatory authority over the whole program. That is to say, the vast bulk
of capital is provided by private sources.  Under the Clinton plan the federal government would
borrow the money necessary to provide capitol for the loans and would service and collect the
loans itself.  This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20-25 billion a
year to provide capital for the program.  According the Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) in testimony
last spring, a complete shift to direct loans could add $348 billion to the national debt by the year
2014.  And this does not consider any additional borrowing costs this expansion of debt will have
on the existing debt!<P>
<li><STRONG>The Direct Loan Program creates a new government bureaucracy</STRONG>.  Direct lending
centralizes control in the Department of Education and creates the potential for vast inefficiencies
and unconstrained costs.  The Department is hiring 600 new employees to administer the
program and anticipates 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational. 
The government is already funding the expansion with an unencumbered $2.5 billion
authorization.  This in a government department that is notoriously disorganized and
mismanaged.  In 1994, for instance, the Department of Education gave out $700 million in direct
loans but is unable to account for some $100 million.  The Advisory Committee on Student
Financial Assistance recently reported that the direct loan program is "potentially exposed to
multiple loans, overawards, loans to ineligible students, and excessive cash drawdowns" and, in
general, cannot "ensure program integrity."  This is the program that wants to take over
responsibility for making six million loans and dispersing over $20 billion a year?<P>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program is bad for students and education</STRONG>.  Direct lending radically
changes the federal government's involvement in college lending programs by nationalizing what
for three decades has been a private-public partnership.  There are currently efforts to nationalize
(though not directly within the government) the college accreditation process, which allows a
college's students to be eligible for financial aid.  One can only imagine the temptations
presented to education reformers if the power of accreditation is combined with government
control over student loan money.  If recent history is any guide--witness Goals 2000 and the
drive for multicultural curriculum changes--further government intrusion in the academy will
only hinder and not help college and university education.  <P>
</ol>

    At a time when many existing programs are being reconsidered in light of the need to balance the
federal budget, Congress should think very carefully before completely federalizing the multi-billion dollar student loan program.  In the early 1970s Congress experimented with a direct loan
program called the Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) program.  It was poorly managed and,
because the government was ineffective at collecting the loans, default rates increased above
previous levels.  Not surprisingly it was phased out in 1976.  It was largely because of this failure
that there emerged the current decentralized system that relies on private lenders and guarantors. 
Taxpayers should not be expected to tolerate more bureaucracy and an increased federal debt in
order to support another inefficient and costly program that does not help students or their
families.<P>  
    Let's eliminate the direct loan program and focus our energy on reforming the existing system
rather than replacing it with a new government-run program.  <P>

DUMB AND DUMBER
<P>
<a name="alumni">Alumni</a> to the Rescue
<BR>
T. KENNETH CRIBB JR.
<P>
<font size="-1"><i>*Selected definitions from ``A Short Educational Dictionary,''
by Kingsley Amis and Robert Conquest, published in Black Paper
3, 1970.
<P>
Mr. Cribb, president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute,
was chief of domestic affairs in the Reagan White House.
</i></font>
<P>
THE development officer of a reputable Western university recently
took one of the school's deans to meet a wealthy alumnus. In the
alum's office, the dean spied a bumper sticker that read: ``Socialists
reject history. Fair enough: History rejects Socialism.'' Upon
leaving, the dean condescendingly remarked that the sticker was
annoying, to which the development officer replied: ``You have
to learn how to talk to these people. This is the future.''
<P>
``These
people'' are concerned university alumni, and they represent the
best hope for influencing colleges and universities back toward
sanity. At schools such as Dartmouth, Princeton, Stanford, Wellesley,
Duke, Mount Holyoke, and Yale, alumni groups are demanding the
de-politicization of higher learning and better stewardship of
donations. According to the<I> Wellesley News</I>, in 1994 fewer than
50 per cent of alumnae contributed to Wellesley, for the first
time since 1978. Wellesley's alumnae-association director attributes
the decrease in part to a demand for accountability. A group of
Dartmouth alumni sued the Board of Trustees after rule changes
severely limited alumni involvement in decision-making. At South
Carolina's Converse College, trustees and alumni forced the president's
resignation after a string of multicultural excesses.
<P>
Until very
recently, the well-documented politicization of colleges and universities
went unchecked by alumni. The somnambulance of this core group
of university benefactors has allowed college administrators to
accede to the political demands of the academic Left without cost.
This inattentiveness, however, is ending at a propitious historical
moment, a time when universities are facing great financial pressure
from reduced government subsidies, resistance to skyrocketing
tuition hikes, and the hangover from years of improvident spending.
Universities depend to a significant extent on private giving.
According to <I>The Chronicle of Higher Education</I>, university trustees,
alumni, and private donors provide 49 per cent of the total revenue
of American colleges and universities, or nearly $3.4 billion
in 1994. With the increasing importance of the marginal dollar
should come an opportunity for those seeking authentic university
reform. 
<P>
While alumni slept, radicals who entered the academic world
in the Sixties slowly achieved positions of power in faculties
and administrations. Along with younger disciples, they redesigned
traditional curricula, revamped reading lists and course requirements,
instituted speech codes, redefined acceptable behavior outside
the classroom, and generally subverted the traditional mission
of the university. The end of higher learning was no longer to
be the cultivation of the mind but rather, as Richard Weaver observed,
``the conditioning [of] the young for political purposes.''
<P>
This
revolution within the university marched on virtually unnoticed
by alumni principally because the college public-relations apparatus
held a monopoly on the flow of information. Even when the national
press picked up on political correctness (years after the fact),
alums were lulled by reassurances that at their alma mater ``nothing
had changed.''
<P>
But the university stranglehold on information began
to loosen when in the early 1980s entrepreneurial students, aided
by the introduction of desktop-publishing technology and educational
institutes willing to contribute money and expertise, established
alternative student newspapers at a number of campuses. Coordinated
nationally by the Collegiate Network, these papers gave 75 to
100 schools voices independent of university control. To serve
the 2,000 campuses that had no such publication, the Intercollegiate
Studies Institute (ISI) launched in 1990 a nationwide alternative
student newspaper, CAMPUS:<I> America's Student Newspaper</I>, and began
informational mailings to tens of thousands of targeted alumni
donors. As these efforts took hold, alumni started to realize
that their alma maters were becoming radicalized laboratories
for multicultural experimentation.
<P>
The potential for exercising
real clout was most recently evidenced by an expose in an ISI-published
student journal at Yale, <I>Light and Truth</I>, which broke the story
of Yale's refusal to administer as promised $20 million given
by alumnus Lee Bass to establish an integrated program in Western
civilization. When it became evident to Mr. Bass that he had been
kept in the dark while the Yale administration explored ways to
divert the money from the agreed-upon program, he asked that Yale
refund the $20 million, plus interest. Yale was forced to comply,
to the accompaniment of nationwide headlines and the reaction
of a donor community infuriated by the sorry treatment of Mr.
Bass.
<P>
According to reports in both the New York Times and the Boston
Globe, much of the opposition to the Bass-funded Western-civilization
program was ideological. The Globe reported that ``Some Yale faculty
have resisted the emphasis on Western Civilization, favoring a
more multicultural curriculum.'' The Times stated that ``Liberals
had criticized the restrictions placed on the donation, arguing
that the money could be better spent on courses with a multicultural
perspective.'' John Leo noted in <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>
that the Bass affair is ``a reminder of how far the modern university
. . . will go these days to avoid hurting the feelings of the
campus Left.'' Meanwhile, Yale's donor community was kept minutely
informed by successive mailings of <I>Light and Truth</I> and other updates.
<P>
Such
shoddy treatment of one of their most prominent confreres led
many Yale alumni to ask, in effect, ``If Yale values a left-leaning
political agenda over $20 million, how will it treat my $1,000,
$10,000, or $100,000 gift?''
<P>
After subscribing to <I>Light and Truth</I>,
reform-minded alumni like Yale's Robert T. Eskridge are considering
novel ways to redirect their philanthropy. Mr. Eskridge wrote:
``We have been shocked when reading the <I>Light and Truth</I> publication,
and having recently arranged in our wills to leave most of our
estates to Yale and my wife's college, Beaver College, we feel
now that we would prefer to support an effort . . . to return
the education of future generations to its traditional moorings.''
Yale is out of the will, and the Eskridges have established a
trust to promote genuine higher learning.
<P>
The cost of Yale's behavior
is now estimated to be several times the original Bass gift of
$20 million. The principled stand of Lee Bass encouraged many
others to join a nationwide alumni movement committed to using
its financial muscle to restore the traditional foundations of
higher education. Already, alumni have organized for collective
action at Stanford (Winds of Freedom), Dartmouth (The Ernest Martin
Hopkins Institute), Yale (<I>Light and Truth</I>), Wellesley (Women for
Freedom), and Princeton (Princeton Alumni Viewpoints).
<P>
In countering
the agenda of the academic Left, these and other alumni efforts
will doubtless be accused of having a conservative agenda of their
own. If the impulse toward reform is indeed conservative, it is
the noble impulse to conserve the proper ends of an authentically
humane education.
<P>
From the earliest beginnings of Western culture,
the ends of education were those of Plato's Academy: wisdom and
virtue. If these ancient ends are to be rescued from the will
to power of campus politicians, all of us -- students, faculty,
trustees, donors, and alumni -- need to act with a sense of urgency.
As William F. Buckley Jr. stated in his landmark book God and
Man at Yale, ``If the present generation does not check the university's
ideological drive, the next generation most probably will not
want to.''

<P>&quot;We disapprove of the measures adopted by a certain party, styling
themselves the Christian party in politics,&quot; declared the petition
from a citizens' group. The document went on to indict Christian political
activists for advocating policies that were &quot;infusing a spirit of religious
intolerance and persecution into the political institute of the country,
and which, unless opposed, will result in a union of church and statte.
...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Given present controversies, the petition could have been written last week.
Instead, it was issued in 1831. Those who believe that religion in politics
is somehow a recent phenomenon in America should re-examine their history
books. Religion has been an integral part of the nation's politics from
the early years of the republic. This book tries to explain why. It also
seeks to illuminate both the opportunities and the dangers religion poses
for politics in a representative democracy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a political scientist interested in current affairs, I initially considered
writing about contemporary conflicts over faith and politics in America.
The more I studied the early years of the United States, however, the more
I realized that present controversies are simply a continuation of arguments
that have been going on since the nation began. The questions debated during
the early years of America are hauntingly familiar: Does religion have a
political role, and if so, what should it be? What are the advantages of
religion in politics? What are the dangers? And how can people of faith
bring their religious beliefs to bear on public issues without dividing
citizens along religious lines and infringing on the liberty of conscience
of those who do not share their religious views? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Exploring how these questions were answered in the past can help clarify
what is at stake at present. Indeed, examining the debate over religion
and politics more than a century-and-a-half ago may provide more illumination
than looking at current conflicts over abortion, school prayer, gay rights,
or any number of other issues. Contemporary controversies often cloud our
judgment because we have a direct interest in their outcome. When we are
able to examine the same fundamental disputes at a distance, however, we
are more likely to grapple with the real merits of the respective arguments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That is what I hope can happen here, for there is much we all can learn
from the way religion became involved in politics in the early United States.
Those who criticize the role of faith in politics today might gain a better
understanding of how and why religion can play a beneficial role in our
politics; and those who champion religion's political role might gain a
deeper appreciation of the dangers as well as the possibilities of religious
political activism. Finally, evangelical Christians might rediscover part
of their heritage, for much of the book is the story of how their forebears
first became involved in politics in America. Politically-active evangelicals
of today might profit from both the mistakes and the successes of their
nineteenth-century predecessors. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Evangelical political activisim in America has a long history
behind it, and present-day evangelicals might learn much from both the triumphs
and the failures of those who came before them. For example, evangelicals
in the early 19th century -- like their counterparts today -- were harshly
criticized for mixing religion and politics. In response, they appealed
to the twin ideas of religious libe4rty and common moral standards articulated
by America's founders. The purpose of this project is to reacquaint today's
evangelical reformers with the wisdom of their forebears. The project includes
public onferences, books, and an historical reprint series of classics of
American evangelical political thought.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>THE proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is
one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Its
influence can be detected in most, if not all, of the West's greatest achievements,
including representative democracy, human rights, free enterprise, and progress
in the arts and sciences.<BR>
<BR>
Yet a little over a century ago, this cardinal idea came under wholesale
attack by intellectuals drawing on the discoveries of modern science. Debunking
the traditional conceptions of both God and man, thinkers such as Charles
Darwin, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud portrayed human beings not as eternal
and accountable beings, but as animals or machines who inhabited a universe
ruled by chance and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the
unbending forces of biology, chemistry, and environment. This materialistic
conception of reality eventually infected virtually every area of our culture,
from politics and economics to literature and music.<BR>
<BR>
The cultural consequences of this triumph of materialism were devastating.
Materialists denied the existence of objective standards binding on all
cultures, claiming that environment dictates our moral beliefs. Such moral
relativism was uncritically adopted by much of the social sciences, and
it still undergirds much of modern economics, political science, psychology
and sociology. <BR>
<BR>
Materialists also undermined personal responsibility by asserting that human
thoughts and behaviors are dictated by our biology and environment. The
results can be seen in modern approaches to criminal justice, product liability,
and welfare. In the materialist scheme of things, everyone is a victim and
no one can be held accountable for his or her actions.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they
could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific
knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs
that falsely promised to create heaven on earth.<BR>
<BR>
Discovery Institute's <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for the Renewal of Science
and Culture</A> seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and
its damning cultural legacies. Bringing together <A HREF="crscfellows.html">leading
scholars from the natural sciences </A>and those from the humanities and
social sciences, <A HREF="crscarts.html">the Center explores how new developments
in biology, physics and cognitive science</A> raise serious doubts about
scientific materialism and have re-opened the case for the supernatural.
The Center awards fellowships for original research, holds conferences,
and briefs policymakers about the opportunities for life after materialism.
<BR>
<BR>
The Center is directed by Discovery Senior Fellow Dr. <A HREF="meyer.html">Stephen
Meyer</A>. An Associate Professor of Philosophy at Whitworth College, Dr.
Meyer holds a Ph.D. in the History and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge
University. He formerly worked as a geophysicist for the Atlantic Richfield
Company.</H4>

<H5><BR>
Discovery Institute Press Release August 10, 1996</H5>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Major grants help establish <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for Renewal of Science
and Culture</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="trubluln.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"></CENTER>
</H1>
<B>For over a century, Western science has been influenced by the idea that
God is either dead or irrelevant. Two foundations recently awarded Discovery
Institute nearly a million dollars in grants to examine and confront this
materialistic bias in science, law, and the humanities. The grants will
be used to establish the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture at
Discovery, which will award research fellowships to scholars, hold conferences,
and disseminate research findings among opinionmakers and the general public.
</B><BR>
<BR>
Heading the Center will be <A HREF="meyer.html">Discovery Senior Fellow
Stephen Meyer</A>. An associate professor of philosophy at Whitworth College,
Meyer did his doctoral studies in origin-of-life biology at Cambridge University
and is an associate editor of the scientific journal Origins and Design
. The Center's co-director will be <A HREF="jwestbio.html">Discovery Senior
Fellow John West</A>, asst. professor of political science at Seattle Pacific
University. West oversees Discovery's <A HREF="religion.html">Religion,
Liberty &amp; Civic Life</A> program. <BR>
<BR>
Working with Meyer and West will be an array of scholars and advisors from
around the world, including Phillip Johnson, professor of law at the University
of California, Berkeley, and author of <I>Darwin on Trial</I> (1992) and
<I>Reason in the Balance</I> (1995), and chemistry professor Michael Behe,
author of the much-anticipated <I>Darwin's Black Box</I>, on sale now at
major bookstores.<BR>
<BR>
Ina addition, the Center will award several full-time research fellowships
each year. For 1996-97, the full-time Discovery research fellows will be
William Dembski, Paul Nelson and Jonathan Wells. Dr. Dembski has a long
history of mathematical study at University of Chicago, Cornell and MIT
and is a fundamental contributor in the fields of chance, chaos, probability
and randomness theory. Currently, Dembski is completing a second doctorate
in philosophy. Nelson is in the final weeks of his Ph.D. program in philosophy
of science, also at the University of Chicago, and is the editor of the
scientific journal Origins and Design. Dr. Wells holds doctorates in molecular
and cell biology from UC Berkeley and religious studies from Yale University.
He is the author of the book Charles Hodge's Critique of Darwinism.<BR>
<BR>
The new Center grew out of last summer's <B>&quot;Death of Materialism&quot;</B>
conference that Discovery organized and which has gathered increased attention
since the four keynote addresses were published by the Intercollegiate Review
earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The conference pointed the way,&quot; Discovery President Bruce Chapman
says, &quot;and helped us mobilize support to attack the scientific argument
for the 20th century's ideology of materialism and the host of social 'isms'
that attend it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Crucial, start-up funding has come from Fieldstead &amp; Company, and the
Stewardship Foundation which also awarded a grant. <BR>
<BR>
The Center for Renewal of Science and Culture fits well with Discovery's
existing programs in high technology and religion. <A HREF="gilder.html">George
Gilder</A>, who heads Discovery's technology program, has a long-standing
interest in the interaction of science and culture. The end of his book
<I>Microcosm</I> explores the social and spiritual implications of contemporary
physics, another one of his works-in-process deals with the cultural necessity
of faith.

<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
</center>
<blockquote><P> 
For the past thirty years, affirmative-action policies have contributed to the 
balkanization of America by race, sex and ethnicity.   The original intent of these 
policies -- to redress past discrimination -- was a noble one, but the means of redress 
have been fundamentally flawed and the real-life consequences disastrous.  It is time 
to stop counting by race and to re-dedicate this nation to the proposition that we are 
a color-blind society.<p>    

To be sure, racism and discrimination are still ugly stains on the American 
landscape, and where they occur, we should use existing laws to stamp them out.   
But affirmative action as a remedy has outrun its course.  If we continue to count by 
race, hire by race, and admit by race, we will divide by race.  We must renew our 
commitment to the American ideal that we are one people:<i> e pluribus unum</i>.  The 
best way to achieve a color-blind society is actually to be a color-blind society, in law 
and in spirit.<p>

<B>Recent Developments</B><br>
Despite President Clinton's morally bankrupt defense of all federal affirmative-
action programs, public opposition to quotas and the institutionalized 
discrimination of affirmative action programs continues to mount.  Moreover, 
several recent developments have dealt powerful blows to federal policies and 
programs that count by race.<p>  

In June, the Supreme Court ruled in Adarand Constructors v. Pena that federal 
affirmative action programs must meet a standard of &quot;strict scrutiny.&quot;  Under the 
strict-scrutiny standard, the federal government must demonstrate that an 
affirmative-action program is narrowly tailored to redress identifiable past 
discrimination.  Few of the existing affirmative-action programs meet that test. 

In July, Congress introduced &quot;The Equality of Opportunity Act of 1995,&quot; which 
prohibits the federal government from taking race, gender, or ethnicity into account 
in its employment or contracting practices, or in the implementation of any federally 
conducted program or activity. The &quot;Equality of Opportunity Act&quot; is an important 
piece of legislation that, if passed, will guarantee all Americans justice and equal 
treatment under  the law.<p>

Empower America is also a strong supporter of the California Civil Rights 
Initiative, which should appear on the statewide ballot as a referendum in 
November of 1996.   The Civil Rights Initiative prohibits the state of California from 
using race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin as criteria for discriminating 
against, or giving preferential treatment to, any individual. <p>  

In dismantling the racially divisive programs of affirmative action, it is important 
for conservatives to be principled, not opportunistic:  We still need to reach out to 
disadvantaged Americans, especially those living in our inner-cities.  To this end,  
Empower America supports measures that will expand opportunities to the inner-
city poor, including tenant- management housing, empowerment zones, and school 
choice.  We also support redesigning the tax code to make possible broader 
ownership of capital, savings, and credit in the minority community.   Expansion of 
opportunity is necessary to ensure equality of opportunity.<p>

<center>
<i>Issue Briefing</i><P>
<h2>Outcome-Based Education</h2>
<P><i>March 19, 1996</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
				
There are serious, legitimate concerns surrounding outcome-based education (OBE).  In 
principle, it sounds good.  In practice, however, OBE can be used to undermine parental 
authority and traditional moral and religious beliefs.  This explains why much of the 
criticism of OBE has come largely from parents' rights groups.<p>

A key to understanding outcome-based education depends on making the distinction 
between cognitive outcomes (i.e., the development of intellectual abilities and skills) 
and behavioral and social outcomes (i.e., the shaping of social attitudes, values, and 
interpersonal relationships).<p>

A case can be made on behalf of outcome-based education if it is confined to cognitive 
outcomes; that is, if we objectively measure students' knowledge in the basics -- math, 
science, history, and English.  Some people still believe that OBE can be used to advance 
such ends (a good example of OBE, properly utilized, is the current high school 
Advanced Placement exam, in which students do not get credit for their course unless 
they demonstrate proficiency in a rigorous nationwide test).  This explains why 
conservative education reformers like Chester Finn, Jr. have spoken well of cognitively-
based outcomes.<p>

The real concern is when those in the education establishment use OBE to (1) eliminate 
objective measurable criteria (like standardized tests); (2) do away with the traditional 
subject-based curriculum in favor of an emphasis on things like general skills, attitudes 
and behaviors; and (3) advance their own radical social agenda.  Increasingly, OBE is 
applied to the realm of behavior and social attitudes--becoming, in effect, a Trojan Horse 
for social engineering, an elementary and secondary school version of the kind of 
&quot;politically correct&quot; thinking that has infected our colleges and universities.<p>

Outcome-based education raises a number of questions:  what if parents do not want 
their children to view all lifestyles as equal?  What if a young person has developed 
strong personal convictions based on traditional moral standards?  Will students who do 
not give  &quot;appropriate&quot; responses to desired &quot;outcomes&quot; still be allowed to graduate?  It is 
also worth noting that little in the way of public input is sought when it comes to OBE, 
and it offers no method of accountability.<p>


There are some other problems associated with OBE, including:<p>
<ul>
<li>	The &quot;dumbing down&quot; of classes.  Many of the curricula being developed call for 
teachers to wait for all students to understand all aspects of a subject before moving 
on.  Many parents fear that this will penalize more advanced students.

<li>	Traditional education terms are being reinterpreted.  In some programs, <i>cognitive</i> 
now refers to &quot;a belief system,&quot; and <i>critical thinking</i> refers to &quot;a willingness to 
question everything, including one's deepest convictions, beliefs and relationships.&quot;<p>
</ul>
Some of the confusion surrounding outcome-based education is based on semantics.  The 
conservative education reform movement of the 1980s wanted to focus on outcomes (i.e., 
knowledge gained) instead of inputs (i.e., dollars spent).  The aim was to ensure greater 
accountability.  What the education establishment has done is to appropriate the term but 
change the intent.

In short, the &quot;outcomes&quot; increasingly being measured are not based on objective and 
measurable criteria like standardized tests; the state-desired outcome is increasingly 
based on vague, subjective social aims.  Consider some of the vocabulary that surrounds 
OBE:  words like &quot;openness to change,&quot; &quot;appreciation of the global community,&quot; 
&quot;tolerance,&quot; and &quot;higher-order thinking skills.&quot;<p>

There is a big push in the country on behalf of outcome-based education.  But unless 
some means is found to ensure that it serves the traditional aims of sound intellectual and 
moral education, it should be resisted.<p>

<i>Issue Briefing</i><P>
<h2>School Choice</h2>
<P><i>February 23, 1996</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
 In 1983, President Reagan's Commission on Excellence in Schools
released its report, <I>A Nation At Risk</I>, warning of major
problems plaguing the public school system.  Today, more than
ten years later, low test scores, consistently high drop-out rates,
drug use, and increasing violence characterize many of our public
schools.  American education is still in crisis, and we need a
change.
<P>
 The current system is harmful to students and undermines parental
authority.  People around the country sense this:  In 1994, twenty-five
states had some form of school choice legislation pending or introduced.
 Denis Doyle, writing in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> (June
13, 1995) indicates that teachers, both public and private, are
more likely to send their children to private schools than the
general public (17.1 percent vs. 13.1 percent).  And in urban
areas like Boston, Chicago, and Cleveland, the percentage of public
school teachers who send their children to private schools is
much higher.  The widespread support for school choice is part
of the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
 School vouchers would provide all parents -- regardless of income
level -- with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child.  If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher will
simply stay with that school.  If they are not, parents now have
a choice -- they can send their child elsewhere, to another public
school, or to a private or religious school.  This is the same
concept we use in higher education; students can use government
grants and loans to attend the University of Indiana, or Notre
Dame, or Yeshiva University.  Higher education performs better
because of it.
<P>
 School choice allows all schools -- including private and religious
schools -- to compete for public dollars.  In addition, a voucher
system will save taxpayers money, and would promote a healthy
scholastic rivalry between public and private schools, as well
as among public schools, challenging them to serve parents and
students better.
<P>
 The intellectual debate about school choice is just about over.
 School choice is the most important and far-reaching education
reform in America.  It empowers parents to select schools that
reflect the values and the academic goals that they hold for their
children.

In Civilized Society, Shame Has Place
</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> <p>
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>
<BR><i>January 26, 1996</i><P></center><hr>

<P> 

<p>
A few months ago, Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn. ), Sam Nunn (D-Ga. ) and I began a campaign to focus public scrutiny on certain daytime television talk shows and their sponsors. The objects of our criticism are not close calls. They are shows that typically cross way over the line. We have described their content as cultural rot. How else could one describe shows whose typical subjects include a 17-year-old girl boasting of having slept with more than 100 men, a 13-year-old talking about sexual experiences that began when she was 10 and "Women Who Marry Their Rapists."
<p>
A number of commentators have defended these talk shows for "reflecting reality," arguing that our campaign won't succeed and that sponsors are within their "rights" to advertise on their programs. It is useful, then, to explain what we are attempting to do and what we are not.
<p>
First, our campaign is not about rights. We are not trying to curb-free speech. I am a virtual absolutist on the 1st Amendment and we have been emphatic about not arguing for censorship. Nor is our goal to remove every last vestige of garbage from our social landscape; this is impossible in a free society.
<p>
But we are asking talk show hosts and advertisers to reconsider their support of some of this daytime television fare. If they continue their support, we are asking that they be able to justify publicly what they are doing, which is to "mainstream" trashy behavior.
<p>
Almost every society has its red-light districts. That is part of reality, and we all understand that. A free society can tolerate such districts. But society should also do what it can to discourage them and contain them. And so, too, with the popular culture version of red-light districts. They ought to remain on the periphery, away from Main Street, our living rooms, our schoolyards.
<p>
Recent postgame interviews with athletes help illustrate a similar point: NFL players feel free to curse on the field and in the locker room. Not many people object to that. But it is nonetheless true that what you have a right to do is not always right to do. And it is wrong for people, even athletes, to curse on camera for national television.
<p>
The aim of our campaign is to use nongovernmental means to make the case that such cultural trash should be less pervasive. We believe that a sense of shame still exists in the highest reaches of corporate America and in the entertainment industry. We believe, too, that progress can be made, through moral suasion, not government intervention. And we intend to keep making the case that civilization needs cultural guardrails, certain reliable standards of right and wrong that may not be enforceable in law but must be enforceable through conscience and consensus.
<p>
All of this requires that we make normative judgments. Of course, some people balk at any attempt to do this, even as they balk at any effort to declare some things worthy and some things unworthy of human consumption. Martin Luther King Jr. was right when he wrote in his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail" that something that uplifts human personality is just and some thing that degrades human personality is unjust.
<p>
Instead of simply lamenting the debased state of our popular culture, citizens need to do something about it. After all, we are witnessing the pollution of the human environment. Cleaning out our cultural air ducts won't happen by itself; it requires concerted effort and specific action. Five years ago, our effort would not have resonated nearly so much with the public. But we have hit a cultural nerve. What we are seeing, here and elsewhere, is the shock of recognition that in too many places, not just in back alleys but in the main thoroughfares, America has been cheapened. We, the American people, have allowed this desecration to occur. It is past time that we do something about it.

Shut the Criminals' Revolving Door -- Empower</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h2>Shut the Criminals' Revolving Door</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> <p>
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>
<BR><i>January 16, 1996</i><P></center><hr>

<P> 
<i>Influenced by those opposed to punishment, government has failed to keep citizens safe from known repeat violent offenders.</i><P>

<P>
During the past 25 years, much of the crime debate has been dominated by criminologists who are philosophically opposed to punishment. In an attempt to advance their agenda, they have perpetrated a wide array of myths. The recently released report of the bipartisan Council on Crime in America is an attempt to provide an alternative: a rigorous, empirical, real-world analysis of the current state of crime and punishment.

The report tells us that the nation faces at least three distinct but related crime challenges: preventing at-risk children from becoming criminals, protecting innocent people from becoming crime victims and restraining convicted criminals who are under the "supervision" of the criminal justice system (on probation, parole or pretrial release) from committing additional crimes.
<P>
<b>Prevention.</b> We know that children born into poor families-- matter their race, region, religion, demographic stripe or socioeconomic status-- they have decent families and grow up with responsible, caring adults in their lives, are far less likely to become either victims or victimizers. We also know that not all children are born so lucky.
<P>
America is now home to nearly 70 million children 18 or under. As many as 15 million of them are growing up in relative poverty, often in places where the institutions of civil society--families, churches, schools, voluntary associations--are in near-complete collapse. The report argues that neither more spending by government nor the mere withdrawal of government can prevent today's at-risk 4- to 7-year-old boys from becoming next decade's 14- to 17-year-old predatory street felons or the next century's first big class of adult career criminals. The key to prevention is moral education. That, in turn, depends on reviving the character-forming institutions of civil society. But we know that there is no easy way to accomplish that.
<P>
<b>Protection.</b> The recent widely reported drops in serious crime in New York, Houston and other cities were due largely to innovative community policing strategies, citizen anti-crime initiatives and continued "target-hardening" or increased security and personal safety measures by individuals and businesses. But these drops in crime may be merely a lull. The storm is gathering in the form of a demographic bulge of highly crime-prone boys. During the next 10 years, enormous upward pressure will be exerted on crime rates. Redoubling crime protection efforts will not keep the storm offshore. But it can help to minimize the damage and reduce the human and financial cost.
<P>
<b>Restraint.</b> The criminal justice system imprisons only one criminal per 100 violent crimes. Most violent prisoners serve less than half their time in prison before being released. In 1993, there were 43.6 million criminal victimizations in America, more than 10 million of them violent. Between 1985 and 1993, the rate at which boys 14 through 17 committed murder increased by about 50% for whites and 300% for blacks. A third of all violent crimes, including murders, are committed by felons out on probation, parole or pretrial release. What is involved here is more than a failure of public safety; it is a massive failure of governmental obligation. Citizens should not have to accept their government's prolonged, persistent failure to restrain violent and repeat criminals. A government incapable of restraining known, violent, repeat criminals within its custody cannot be trusted to take on more complicated and costly public functions.
<p>
There is also the matter of eroding public trust in our political institutions. A government that, amid much fanfare, passes wave after wave of get-tough anti-crime laws but proves toothless in the execution of those laws eviscerates pubic confidence in the integrity of lawmakers and the criminal justice system. Indeed, in 1993 and again in 1994, there was only one public institution in which the American people had less confidence than in Congress: the criminal justice system. No representative democracy can long survive this deep and disheartening lack of public trust. And the only way to restore public trust is to shut the revolving door.
<p>
A final point: A society tells as much about itself by what it punishes as what it praises, by what it condemns as well as what it encourages, by what receives reprobation as what receives approbation. The message of our justice system is all too clear to criminals and victims: Too often, for too many, it says "nobody cares" and "nothing matters." That has to change soon or the carnage and violence that have become almost permanent features of America's landscape will worsen.

<h2>A 1996 VIEW OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IN AMERICA</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> 
<P><i>December 12, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
Toward the close of my tenure as secretary of education, in a
speech before the White House Conference on a Drug-Free America,
I called for a &quot;transformation of government policy to match,
and build on, the transformation of public sentiment.&quot;  I
was referring to the public's recognition that drug use was no
longer considered harmless fun or mere self-indulgence, but a
personal, medical and economic catastrophe.  That was in 1988,
and indeed we did continue to mount a strong offensive against
drugs throughout the Bush administration from 1989 to '92 -- with
real results.  Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned
the drug war.  But public sentiment, as this Gallup poll attests,
has not changed.  Americans still want a tough and decisive drug
control policy with the federal government rightfully leading
the fight.
<P>
It is no surprise that Gallup found more than nine in ten Americans
seriously concerned about drug abuse, and that the issue of drugs
rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.  Americans
should be concerned, because the news is bad; drug use among adolescents
is once again on the rise after the steady and dramatic decline
of the 1980's and early 1990's.  According to the Center on Addiction
and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, &quot;the jump in
marijuana use among children 12 to 18 years...signals that 820,000
more of these children will try cocaine in their lifetime.  Of
that number, about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and
addicts.&quot;  More bad news is that drug-related hospital emergency-room
cases -- dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts -- have reached
the highest levels since 1978.  Cocaine, heroin and marijuana
cases all have increased sharply to record levels.  
<P>
What Americans have witnessed -- and reacted to in the Gallup
Poll -- is the result of a failure of public policy brought about
by a moral torpor on the drug issue.  Policy follows attitude.
 But the public's attitude is not one of indifference toward the
scourge.  When asked what they wanted to see <I>a lot more</I>
of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law
enforcement and education of the young, and <I>two-thirds</I>
cited reduction of the supply of drugs coming into the United
States.  By contrast, <I>fewer than half</I> -- 43 percent --
asked for more treatment programs.
<P>
The current policy of &quot;treatment on demand&quot; presents
a record of failure that is reflected in the weak support it received
in the Gallup poll.  Unlike the effective and modest treatment
programs sponsored by churches and using variants of the 12-step
method, the government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly wasteful
and ineffective.  From 1988 to 1994, federal drug treatment spending
almost tripled while the estimated number of treatment slots actually
declined.  And the discouraging result is that overall cocaine
treatment is not significantly reducing the polulation of hard
core addicts.  We must turn our support toward the proven models
of treatment, while recognizing the harsh realities of cocaine
and crack addiction as yet one more compelling reason why preventing
casual drug use by the young -- the first step on the path to
addiction -- is so important.
<P>
Gallup poll respondents put drug interdiction high on their list
-- the percentage of those calling for increased efforts to reduce
the incoming supply of drugs into the U.S. was 88 percent.  Those
respondents are right  -- the government should put the U.S. military
in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from outside our
borders and give the military control over the entire interdiction
process.  We know that strong interdiction works.  In 1989, the
U.S. military followed Columbia's internal crack-down on the cocaine
cartels with the most extensive detection, tracking and interdiction
effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from the Andean countries
north.  These events produced substantial disruption in the cocaine
supply to the U.S. between 1989 and 1991.  Drugs were less available
on the streets; cocaine-related emergency room cases declined;
reported cocaine deaths decreased; the estimated number of heavy
users fell; and casual use dropped dramatically.  Today, U.S.foreign
policy no longer takes the drug problem seriously, and the once-strong
military interdiction role has been abdicated.   We need now to
restore our interdiction efforts and to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine-source countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine.  
<P>
More law enforcement efforts to punish and convict people for
the use and sale of illegal drugs were endorsed by 83 percent
of the Gallup respondents.  Even more forcefully, by 85 percent,
those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should
be legalized in America.  The response is wise on both counts.
 Law enforcement requires action at the federal, state and local
levels.  The federal role requires the identification and dismantling
of all major drug trafficking organizations known to be operating
in the U.S.   Law enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention
education are state and local responsibilities for which current
federal aid should be block granted without mandates.  
<P>
The majority of respondents (85 percent) who oppose legalization
of drugs send a strong message to those who would propose such
an option.  Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not dangerous and
threatening to society because they are illegal.  They are illegal
because they are dangerous and  threatening to American society.
 Any relaxation in standards of illegality would make drugs more
accessible, cheaper and morally permissible.  On this issue there
has long been a great gap between a select few who favor legalization
-- and the overwhelming body of the American people who  reject
such a policy of despair. In the Gallup poll, the people have
again made that point.
<P>
Success in the drug war depends above all on what happens in America's
homes, classrooms, churches, voluntary associations, television
and movie screens, city streets and civic halls.  It depends on
the efforts of parents, teachers, clergy,  police chiefs, judges
and community leaders.  When I was President Bush's &quot;drug
czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities.  I made a point to
go where the problem was the worst and to visit and learn from
the people who made things better.  I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements.  The point is, we know what works.
 The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and tough-minded and intelligent policies.

<center><h3>How Capitalism is Capitalized</h3> 
Letter to the Editor of the <i>Washington Post</i><P>
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>December 2, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
<blockquote>
Dear Editor:
<P>
John Berry's November 9 Trendlines article, &quot;Treasury Argues
That the Tax Bite on Capital Isn't So Bad,&quot; reveals the ignorance
of our Treasury Department with regard to the workings of capitalism.
 The core of Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' argument
is that declining inflation since the early 1980s has reduced
the tax burden on corporate profits.  But corporate profits taxes
are taxes on income, not capital.  Income can only be derived
from businesses that have already raised capital.  Companies reporting
substantial profits, such as those listed on Fortune 500, are
often established firms in mature markets.  Many are &quot;cash
cows&quot; that transfer wealth from capital to income because
they have exhausted their opportunities for successful risk taking.
 The fact that such firms are shouldering a lighter tax burden
with the decline of inflation tells us nothing about the &quot;tax
bite&quot; on capital.
<P>
The fact is, at a nominal rate of 28%, the capital gains tax has
stood at an historic high in the U.S. since 1987.  That's because
without inflation-indexing, the real rate can easily exceed 100%
on long-held assets that have merely earned a market-based rate
of return.  This high unindexed capital gains tax shuts off capital
to all but the least risky ventures, discouraging entrepreneurship
and thus producing sub-optimal economic growth.  That may be fine
for the large, established, risk-averse corporations throwing
off the cash that Larry Summers is proud to say is suffering lighter
tax burdens in a low-inflation environment.  But it offers scant
hope to our inner-cities and other capital-starved communities
that would have the most to gain from a rebirth of the entrepreneurial
spirit.  That's why I strongly urge congressional leaders and
the White House to include in their budgetary agreement a measure
to lower and index capital gains tax rates. 

<P><P>

<title>Kemp:  Op-Ed on Immigration</title>

<center><h3>Immigration:  Where We Go From Here</h3> 
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>November 27, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
 American immigrants generate jobs, products, processes, small
businesses, and government revenues at a pace that far exceeds
any strain on U.S. resources.  This is not just my conclusion;
  former Goldman Sachs chairman John Whitehead, U.S. News Editor
Mortimer Zuckerman, IBM Vice President Ed Zschau, Texas Instruments
CEO Jerry Junkins, and a dozen other investment, manufacturing,
and communications leaders expressed the same conclusion in a
recent joint statement.
<P>
Some immigration policies badly need reform, especially those
having to do with illegal immigration.  Under the 1986 immigration
reform act, for example, it's illegal to hire an undocumented
alien, and hard and costly even to hire a legal one.  By contrast,
it's allowed, and in many cases legally mandated, to pay out welfare,
medical, education and other benefits.
<P>
It would be better, and more American, to make it easy to work--for
example, with a generous guest worker program and low-cost i.d.
for participants.  It would be just and would create better incentives,
and make it harder to get welfare payments.  For instance, the
U.S. could more readily accept immigrants who take a pledge not
to go on welfare (a pledge many have already taken).
<P>
With such policies, we not only can &quot;afford&quot; to keep
the golden door open;  we will attract the same type of dynamic
men and women who historically helped build this immigrant nation.
 Let's agree to reform the welfare state and not allow America
to be turned into a police state.

Program</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3>Clinton and Cisneros Wrecked a Good Housing Program</h3>
<i>November 1, 1995</i><P>

Letter to the Editor of <i>The Washington Times</i> 
</center> 
<hr> 
Dear Editor: 
<P> 
I was surprised to learn that, according to your Oct. 26 report ("HUD's 
relocation of urban poor targeted for ax," Nation), I had "launched" the 
Clinton administrations' Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Moving to 
Opportunity program to "address urban blight by moving poor people from 
public housing in inner cities to subsidized rental units in higher-income 
neighborhoods."
<P> 
In the Bush administration, the Moving to Opportunity program was first 
authorized Oct. 28, 1992,--two weeks before President Clinton's election 
victory.  The program was designed as a demonstration project to support a 
family's choice to use a rental voucher to move to privately owned housing in 
any neighborhood of the family's choosing--one that offered more job 
opportunities for parents and better education for children.  This was the 
essence of the Reagan idea of vouchers for housing instead of public housing 
construction.  As such, the program was the antithesis of the social 
engineering that resulted in the forced residency of low-income families in 
government-run housing projects in the inner city. 
<P>Unfortunately, by the time Moving to Opportunity was 
<i>launched</i> by the Clinton administration in 1994 (see "A helping hand 
or social engineering?" Nation, March, 15, 1994), the program had been 
transformed by HUD into a massive new fair-housing program to disperse 
low-income families to middle-income suburban neighborhoods.  HUD 
Secretary Henry Cisneros said he wanted to replicate this dispersal strategy in 
every city in the country.
<P> 
The Clinton/Cisneros plan distorted a program that was intended to 
support the housing vouchers--the cornerstone of conservative housing policy.  
That's unfortunate, but under the circumstances, Congress was right to end it.

<h2>
Empower America <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<h2>Empower America Forges Ahead</h2>
</center><br>
<i>At a press conference on November 13, 1996, Empower America Co-Directors Vin Weber, Jeane Kirkpatrick, William Bennett, Lamar Alexander and Board of Directors member Donald Rumsfeld discussed the future of Empower America.  The following are excerpts from their remarks.</i>
<p>
<b>VIN WEBER:</b>  We've spent the last days assessing what happened in the last elections, the state of the debate and dialogue in the country, the state of our organization, what may have been accomplished, and where we're going from here.  In summary, we're very upbeat, positive, and optimistic about what has happened in the country, but certainly there are challenges ahead of us.  The election, and the debate in the election  and it's reflected in both parties  indicates the triumph or at least the progress of many of the ideas that we believe in and that this organization cares about.
<p>
There was no discussion in this campaign by any candidate about a bigger government, about higher taxes.  The debate was how best to restrain the size of government, what is the best path to reducing the scope of government, or what combination of  tax cuts  targeted or across-the-board  shall we employ.
<p>
There was no talk in this campaign about building new bureaucracies in Washington.  There was talk about various options for empowering individuals and decentralizing power out of Washington.  Some things probably were not talked about as much as they ought to be, such as national security policy and various social issues that Bill Bennett and others have been most prominent in talking about.
<p>
And there's a big agenda yet to be fulfilled over the course of the next 4 years.  But the good news is the debate has shifted dramatically in what we think is the right direction.  And we look forward to contributing to the debate and dialogue and trying to have an impact on the newly reelected Republican Congress as well as the Clinton Administration over the course of the next 4 years.
<p>
<b>JEANE KIRKPATRICK:</b>  We feel that the outcome of the election was very gratifying  The issues with which we have been preoccupied from our founding  served to refuel the discussion in political campaigns and the discussion between the parties.  The outcome is very positive from our perspective.  The new Congress is overwhelmingly committed to the principles and ideas that Empower America has been purveying and working on, reflecting on, and discussing and debating from our founding.  We think that this is missed to some extent by many of the people who have been discussing the election outcome, because there were so many predictions that the Congressional class of '94, with its emphasis on reducing and limiting the size of government, would be repudiated.
<p>
There were so many predictions of that outcome that many people didn't notice it didn't happen.  A good many people have spoken and written almost as if it had happened, as if there had been a repudiation of the class of '94.  In fact, what did happen was precisely an affirmation of those fundamental principles of the class of '94, including the multiple initiatives to reduce the size of government and its share of our lives and resources.  Since we're an organization concerned above all with policy and principles, and those principles were affirmed by the American electorate, we feel very good about it.  
<p>
<b>LAMAR ALEXANDER:</b>  My own view is that the voters knew exactly what they were doing last week.  I think they were saying to the Democrats, to President Clinton, we heard you say the era of big government was over and we agree with that.  But just in case you have a memory lapse, after you get back in, we're going to give you a Republican Congress to make sure you don't slip in more big government on us.
<p>
And I think the voters were saying to the Republican Congress, we know you believe in the end of the era of big government and you're going in the direction generally we think the country ought to go.  But until you can learn to tell us what's at the other end of that bridge to the future if you're totally in charge, we're not going to go with you.  I believe we'll never have an end to the era of big government until we have a Republican President to go with a Republican Congress.  And I believe there will never be a Republican President until Republicans learn to say what they're for, until they do a better job of explaining how tomorrow will be better than today if they are in charge of the government.
<p>
And that is also the mission of Empower America, I believe, to help paint a picture of our future, to look ahead, and say:  what will the post-big government era look like?  It's really not enough to say we're for abolishing the U.S. Department of Education and for home schooling, both of which I'm for.  There's something in between that affects about 90 percent of the American people.  So, our objective is how do we have the best schools in the world with less governmentwith a government that gives us tools and requires more from ourselves.
<p>
So, we've got some work to do.  We need choir practice, I think, on the conservative side.  And we need to paint a picture of what America would be like if the end of the era of big government comes.  That should be our mission.
<p>
<b>WILLIAM BENNETT:</b>  Let me talk about some of the issues I think we ought to address and that we  will address.  I believe below the presidential level the most important result of the elections was Prop 209 in California.  California, the country's most populous state and most culturally and ethnically diverse state, voted  by ballot referendum  to end preference and discrimination by race and gender.  It is a very interesting thing.  We will now have an argument about this issue in the courts and elsewhere.  To my point of view this was the right thing to do, a very momentous result.
<p>
Second, the courts.  In general, I don't think we give enough attention or pay enough attention to what is going on in the courts.  There is a very real risk, at least on a large number of issues, that the courts are abrogating the rights of a democratic people.  They are entering into areas where the people should decide:  Romer v. Colorado and doctor-assisted suicide, for example.  We'll see what happens with same-sex marriage.  These are areas where I think the democracy should work, people should weigh in on what they think.  The courts should not lift these things from the democratic process, arrogate them to themselves, and tell democracy that it's not fit to decide these important matters.
<p>
Third, there has been a lot of talk in the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns about big government, the end of the era of big government, too much government, and the devolution of government.  I think we've got some homework to do, and Empower America will try to do it.  Somebody needs to sit down and say:  Well, do we want a national weather service, do we want a drug czar, do we want a Bureau of the Budget, do we want HHS?   Why?  By what criteria?  By what principles?  Do we start with Lincoln?  Should government do those things which the people may not do so well for themselves?  This is analytic work.  We should be specific.  I think this would be a challenge to both Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.
<p>
Finally, I'll continue work in the area with Sam Nunn and Joe Lieberman and colleagues at Empower America, such as Dennis Prager and others, on this whole area called the culture, which I think central to the future of this country.  If we are the world's most important country, most powerful country, most affluent country, most envied country, we are also the country that leads the industrialized world in murder, violent crime, in juvenile crime, in cocaine consumption, in pornography production, in pornography consumption, in abortion, in divorce, in teenage suicide, and a host of other things.  
<p>
Some of us think these are problems that we need to address.  We think that the whole area has now opened up.  The President has addressed these issues as well, such as what he did the other day on liquor ads, of television, television advertising, the movies, sports, and I imagine he will continue to discuss these.  These are legitimate issues of public inquiry and public policy debate, but not necessarily government regulation, by any means.  Because these things shape our country and our culture and our children, Empower America will continue to work in this area.
The final point.  Some of us are concerned that this "vital center" that's being talked about doesn't become a kind of national hugging fest and that it doesn't become a kind of diffident or dormant middle.
<p>
There are important issues before us.  There are important differences.  Let me pick the hardest one, right now.  It is the ethical matters raised about the President's conduct of office, the abuse of power.  Many of these issues are in the hands of the independent counsel.  But not all of them, and not all of the responsibility is there.  Congressional oversight is required, and it is dictated by law.  We have been through this before, and congressional oversight must not go by the boards.  I think the people at Empower America feel very strongly that we should encourage our friends on the Hill to exercise that responsibility if that is needed.

<p>
<H2>Welcome Back, Jack!</H2>
</center>
Co-Director Jack Kemp has returned to Empower America after a leave of absence since mid-August to run for Vice President of the United States.  The former Congressman and Housing Secretary is a Founding Co-Director of Empower America.  Throughout the campaign, Secretary Kemp espoused many of the ideas he developed while at Empower America.  Tax cuts, the need for a fair, flat tax, indexing capital gains and cuts in capital gain taxes, and fairness and equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of race are among the central issues with which Mr. Kemp has long been associated.
<p>
	Secretary Kemp ran on the Republican ticket with Senator Bob Dole.  Empower America, an issue advocacy organization, does not endorse political candidates for any offices at the local, state, or federal levels.  However, it is with a great deal of pride that the Empower America family welcomes back Jack Kemp.

</center><p><br>
DEAR EMPOWER AMERICA ASSOCIATE:
<p>
          The political process by which America selects elected representatives is now over.  While Empower America does not endorse candidates, we were nonetheless thrilled that one of our Founding Co-Directors, Jack Kemp, was selected to be a Vice Presidential candidate.  After a vigorous and arduous campaign, Jack has returned to Empower America.  On behalf of the Board of Directors, Co-Directors, staff, and Empower America associates, supporters, and friends, I congratulate Jack for his distinguished contributions to our country and welcome him back.
<p>
          I hope this edition of Empower America Highlights conveys to you the sense of renewed vigor and commitment all of us feel to continue to advance the purposes of this organization.  I hope as well that you will recognize the extent to which the ideas and issues we have developed over the last four years did become agenda setters for the political debate which just occurred.  Most interesting, and gratifying, to us was the adoption of many Empower America positions by both major political parties.  I hope you feel as committed as we are to continue to shape the political debate and to experience the satisfaction of seeing ideas become actual policies.  That is our goal, and all of us at Empower America deeply appreciate your participation and support.
<p>
					Sincerely,
<p>

					Thom Weisel<br>
					Chairman

<H2>Crime Council Issues New Report</H2>
<p>
<b><i>Bennett, DiIulio and Walters Release New Book</b></i><p>
</center>
The Council on Crime in America, co-chaired by Empower America Co-Director William Bennett and Carter Administration Attorney General Griffin Bell, plans to release its second and final report this winter.    This report will provide wide-ranging recommendations on policies and initiatives that public officials, citizen-based groups, and individuals can take to reduce, control, and prevent crime in their neighborhoods.  
<p>
The Council on Crime in America was established in November 1995 to examine violent crime, crime prevention, and law enforcement efforts across the nation.  Earlier this year, the Council released its first report, which provided a comprehensive description of the extent and nature of crime in America.   The report argued that effective crime-fighting strategies must address three distinct challenges:  preventing violent crime, protecting the citizenry from violence, and restraining convicted violent criminals.   Effectively restraining violent criminals is necessary not only to  effectively address the first two challenges, but also to restore public trust in a criminal justice system that has functioned largely as a revolving door for predators -- releasing them back to the streets faster than they can be apprehended. 
<p>
Since then, the Council, led by co-chairs Bennett and Bell, has sponsored grassroots crime hearings across the nation to better assess public attitudes toward crime and explore community-based crime-fighting initiatives.   The publication of the final report will represent the culmination of the Council's research and findings and will highlight the most effective strategies and policies in America's on-going fight against crime.
<p>
<i>Body Count:  Moral Poverty...And How To Win America's War Against Crime and Drugs</i> is a new book by Empower America's William J. Bennett, and crime/drug experts John J. Dilulio, Jr., and John P. Walters in which the authors warn of ever increasing rates of crime and violence in the next decade, especially from a new generation of "super-predators."  <i>Body Count</i> contains a wealth of data and statistics that illuminate the depth of current and future crime waves, as well as the counterproductive operations of the nation's criminal justice system.  In a review of the book in the October 23, 1996 <i>Washington Times</i>, Gene Koprowski writes that "these disarming trends in demographics and drug use must be dealt with by attacking the cause, rather than the symptoms, of the problem. and that is, the [authors] say, the simple abdication of our institutionsfrom the family and the clergy to the entertainment industry and the federal governmentof their role as moral leaders."  As Bennett, Dilulio and Walters argue, "Many people have ignored or forgotten something that almost everybody once knew:  the good requires constant reinforcement and the bad needs only permission."  <i>Body Count</i> can be purchased at most bookstores.

<H2>CCRI WINS</H2>
</center>

<b>Proposition 209:  "The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin..."</b>
<p>
<p>
In an important vote with national significance, the citizens of California chose overwhelmingly to end decades-long practices of legally mandated racial and gender preferences that had come to be known as "affirmative action."  Empower America supported the passage of the California Civil Rights Initiative (C.C.R.I.), stating that "it is the first step in the necessary elimination of discriminatory and divisive practices."
<p>
Empower America Co-Director William Bennett commented, "C.C.R.I. will put us back on the path of the U.S. Constitution and Martin Luther King  the moral path."  C.C.R.I. reestablishes the spirit of the civil rights movement and the original intent of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that "no person...shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation, or be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance."
<p>
The term "affirmative action," as originally conceived by the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, was a moral injunction to reach out to the best-qualified people  regardless of race  and provide all people with equal opportunities.  However, during the past 30 years, well-intentioned but misguided efforts to address genuine racial inequalities have led to policies of racial discrimination because policies which mandated preferences on the basis on race shifted the emphasis from equality of opportunity to equality of results, and from individual rights to group entitlements.  The result was a divided America:  those who could legally be favored under the law, and those who could be legally discriminated against under the law. 
<p>
Martin Luther King's dream to judge Americans by "the content of their character" and not "the color of their skin" was embraced by C.C.R.I. chairman Ward Connerly, who led the successful effort to pass Proposition 209.  Empower America believes that the long civil rights crusade is embodied today not in racial preferences, but in school choice, lower taxes, economic growth, an end to rampant drug use and crime, and policies which emphasize opportunity over preference.  The California vote has opened the door for America to embark on an important national debate.  In that debate, Empower America will have a strong voice in favor of increased opportunity for all and equal treatment of every citizen under the law.

<H2>New EA Study Highlights Military Contribution of Immigrants</H2>
</center>
<p>
On the eve of Veterans Day, Empower America held a press conference with several leading immigration and veterans groups to release a study on the military contributions of immigrants to the United States.  The conference was held on Capitol Hill on November 7. 
<p>
Participating in the conference were Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett, Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), Alfred Rascon, a Mexican-born immigrant hero from the Vietnam War, and representatives from some of America's leading think tanks and veterans organizations, including the American Immigration Law Foundation, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S., the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, Heroes and Heritage, and the Japanese American Veterans Association.
<p>
The study, entitled <i>In Defense of a Nation: The Military Contributions of Immigrants</i>, was written by immigration expert Stuart Anderson, the director of trade and immigration studies at the Cato Institute.  It is a comprehensive historical account of the willingness of immigrants to participate in the defense of their new homeland and of the significant military contributions immigrants have made in areas such as weapons development.
<p>
The report tells the stories of numerous acts of bravery performed by American immigrants.  For instance, a special regimental combat team made up of the sons of Japanese immigrants was the most decorated of its size during World War II, even though the immigrant families of many of these men were interned by U.S. government authorities.  The study reports that more than 20 percent of Congressional Medal of Honor recipients in U.S. wars have been immigrants.
<p>
An immigrant war hero born in Mexico, Alfred Rascon, whose courage in Vietnam is described in the study, spoke at the press conference about the allegiance of immigrant soldiers.  As reported in the <i>Washington Post</i>, Rascon's "immigration status and ethnicity were not issues in the military.  'When you're wearing a uniform, everybody's green,' he said."  "I was always an American in my heart."
<p>
Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett said one of the purposes of the study was to acknowledge the "courage and patriotism" of immigrant soldiers, and, as the Roman poet Virgil said, "to give the honorable their due."  As a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial pointed out, "in an era where anti-immigration sentiment seems to focus on what benefits immigrants take away from this country, it seems worth it to recall their contributions to the nation's survival."
<p>
Copies of the report can be obtained by sending a check for $7.95 made payable to Empower America, to our address: 1776 I Street, NW, #890, Washington, D.C. 20006.

<H2>Rumsfeld on How Washington Has Changed</H2>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<b><i>Rumsfeld has been a member of Empower America's Board of Directors since its founding.  His distinguished public service includes four terms in the U.S. Congress, a Cabinet member during President Richard Nixon's first term, U.S. Ambassador to NATO, President Ford's Chief-of-Staff and Secretary of Defense.  Mr. Rumsfeld left Washington, D.C. in 1977 for a successful career in the private sector.  Senator Bob Dole brought him into his presidential campaign as a senior policy advisor and then chairman.  We found Mr. Rumsfeld's observations, made at Empower America's November 13 press conference, about how politics in Washington, DC has changed over the last 20 years insightful and instructive:</b></i>
<p>
As a non-Washingtonian, and a businessman from Chicago, I have several quick observations about how things have changed over the last couple of decades in this city.  
<p>
One change that struck me involves political polls; specifically the extent to which public opinion polling has seemingly almost taken over the political process, the proliferation of polls and the dominance they seem to have in the media's eyes.  I suppose that reporting on a poll is a relatively easy story to write.  It doesn't take a lot of legwork or thought to report on a poll.  I was also struck by the fact that the polls on the 1996 campaign were so wrong, for what I believe to be most of the campaign.  I think the final polls, the bulk of them, were in the 12 to 18 percent range in terms of the differential that they projected between President Clinton and Senator Dole.  It turned out to be 8 percent.  I should add that there were two polls that were quite close, Reuters and <i>Hotline</i>.
<p>
The effect of these polls on the campaign was not trivial.  A great many people were predicting and assuming that the campaign was over in May, and June, and July, which affected human behavior adversely from the standpoint of the Dole effort.
<p>
A second observation is the extent to which focus groups seem to have taken over the political process.  I had not been aware of it.  I watched some of these politicians stand up and in just a few sentences use the word "extremism," six, eight, ten times.  Over and over and over again, they did it.  I watched Mr. Gephardt on MEET THE PRESS just last week, even though the campaign is over, use "extremism" two or three times in the first few minutes.  No one ever stopped him and asked him, "What is extreme?  What are you talking about?  What do you mean?  Why is that word appropriate?"  No one in the media ever seems to call them on it.  
<p>
The phrase "risky tax scheme" obviously had been favorably focus-group tested.  It also was used over and over in the campaign.  If it hadn't worked so well, it would have been amusing.  What is a scheme?  A scheme is when somebody is tricked, in this context, out of their money.  It is when you promise a tax cut, come into office and impose a tax increase instead.  That's a scheme.  Leaving money in someone's pocket, as Senator Dole suggested, is not a scheme.  And yet no one ever called them on it.  I was intrigued; I have to admit it, it worked.  It dumbfounds me the extent to which there was a conscious attempt to manipulate the voters.  The politicians seemed to look for a word that's ugly and then used it repeatedly, and no one said, "Wait a minute, what do you mean?" 
<p>
I don't want to be judgmental about these things, because I am still trying to absorb it all.
<p>
The third thing that struck me, after being out of this town almost twenty years, is the extent to which politicians and the media spend enormous amounts of time not as politicians and not as journalists, but as "stars"  "media stars."  Putting on makeup, and taking off makeup.  Hustling from one event to another, where the basic task is to communicate through the media.
<p>
That seems to have led to a situation where the staff members in this town, in a sense, have begun serving as the politicians.  Now, I don't know that that's a fair comment, but I believe it is true to a much greater extent than was the case when I came here in the late 1950s as an assistant to a Congressman, and then served in the Congress in the '60s and the executive branch in the '70s.  It is a changed situation, regarding the roles that people are playing.  Remember the way the country evolved.  Members of the House and Senate under the Constitution were intended to be the human link between their constituency and their government.  And to do that, one has to actually think, to talk to constituents, participate in the legislative process, synthesize things, and be a true link.  
<p>
The roles have so shifted that, to a major extent, the people that are serving that role of link are young people, very bright, very talented staff people, who in many cases have never been in their bosses' states or districts, don't have the backgrounds of their principals, don't have the knowledge that theoretically their bosses were elected to bring to Washington, D.C., and to contribute to the legislative process.

Empower America <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<h2>The Media on the Media, the Elections, Liberals, Conservatives, Etc...</h2>
</center><br>
<i>At a panel discussion on November 19, 1996, hosted by Empower America, four highly regarded journalists analyzed the recent elections.  Selections from their remarks follow.</i>
<p>
<b>MICHAEL BARONE,<i>  U.S. News & World Report</b></i><br>
	This election was a pretty good election for conservative causes, but not entirely.  First, the country didn't move left, Clinton moved to the right.  Here you have a Democratic president who felt obliged to say the era of big government is over and attempted to campaign by moving sharply to the right on issue after issue...The Congress stayed Republican despite the $35 million labor expenditure; despite the Medicare issue which used be one of the third rails of American politics; despite a generally biased press and particularly a tough negative press which advocated and assumed the defeat of the Republican Congress for [many] months before the election...The country is in a very different placeDemocrats have 12 fewer senators, 60 fewer congressmen, 11 fewer governors, 500 fewer state legislatorsthan where it was when Bill Clinton was elected 4 years ago.
<p>
	The second point is on the level of government.  Four years ago, Democrats and liberals had several projects underway.  They wanted to increase tax levels...because they felt government should have more revenue.  They wanted to federalize health care.  They wanted to change the welfare programs but in ways that would be more centralized and federalized.  The Democrats did get their tax increase in 1993, but they got it at a ruinous political cost and also governmental cost, which is that taxes are completely off the table.  You can search this country very hard and not find a politician advocating more new taxes...The country made a decision...to keep health care reform devolved, and that decision is really not up for appeal.  Welfare...started partly as an attempt by House Republican leaders to bring up the welfare bill for the third time after Clinton had vetoed it twice.  But in fact he signed the [third] bill, [and we] are now having the defederalization of welfare...You don't see Democratic candidates running saying let's federalize welfare.
<p>
	The third point I would make is that to a very considerable extent, international markets are playing an important role in American politics and in politics all over the world.  And that is affecting the debate in a couple of places that tend to tilt conservative.  First, Clinton has made the most important appointment of his second term, and that's Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.  Why is Clinton talking about doing something about Medicare and producing the same kinds of cuts and slashes that he attacked during the campaign?  The answer is that when you look at the budget, [Medicare is] where the money is, and the international marketplace is looking at the budget and the marketplace is telling him he has no choice but to do this.  	
<p>
	My last point is on cultural issues.  I think the verdict is a very mixed one from either a conservative or liberal point of view.  Our politics, it seems to me, is very often an argument between discipline and therapy...Discipline won with the Congress, with Proposition 209 on racial quotas and preferences in California, won in the South and Rocky Mountains.  The therapy approach won with Clinton, some key state legislatures going Democratic (California and Michigan), in New England and the Metroliner corridor, which voted quite strongly for the Democrats this time, and in the general tone of the campaign...I think those fights, those cultural wars as Pat Buchanan called them, are very likely to continue with the resolution unclear or mixed.
<p>
<b>RON BROWNSTEIN, <i>Los Angeles Times</b></i><br>
	Turbulence has been the defining characteristic of American politics over the last 6 years.  We've had three successive sharp swings in voter opinion:   George Bush goes from a high 90% approval rating in the wake of the Gulf War, to his repudiation in 1992 in which he suffered the fourth largest decline in the share of the vote won by an incumbent from election to election in American history.  Then, Bill Clinton comes in on a wave of good feeling and in the first 6 months he sees his approval rating drop faster than any new incoming President in the history of Gallop polling.  Clinton's approval rating then goes up and down, recovers a little bit in the fall of '93, but suffers another sharp decline in '94, resulting in the Republican Congressional landslide in '94, which was a landslide of truly historic proportions.  
<p>
	But in '95, the cycle kept rolling.  Newt Gingrich, having a sort of odd baby boomer competition with Bill Clinton, takes it to a new level by driving down the approval rating of the Republican Congress almost as fast as Clinton drove down his own approval ratings in '93.  When you get to the fall of '95, you see as clearly as public opinion can ever show you, an unequivocal pivot in the way Americans looked at Bill Clinton.  Up until then, most of the time his approval rating was under 50%...more months than not.
<p>
	Every incumbent president we've had with an approval rating over 50% in an election year wins easily.  Those under 50% have had tumultuous races in which the incumbents lose:  Eisenhower '56, Nixon '72, Reagan '84 in the first group; Ford '76, Carter '80, Bush '92 in the second group.  I believe the incumbent president's approval rating is the single most important predictor of where a presidential race is going to go.  
<p>
	In the crucible of the budget fight, Bill Clinton regains his footing and is, I think, redefined for Americans in two ways:  he goes from being weak and liberal...to being strong and moderate...[We then] seemed to be poised for a third collapse, the absolute failure of the Republican majority to win reelection.  We don't get that.  In the summer of '96, they regain their footing in Congress...the late sag in Clinton support...around new ethics allegations...pushes him down and Republicans hold on to Congress even as Clinton wins victory in '96, which was unimaginable in '94.  Almost every time in American history that a party that wins as many seats in the mid-term elections as the Republicans did in '94, they win the White House 2 year later:  1890, 1910, 1930 with the Democrats; 1958 with the Democrats; 1966 with Republicans; 1974 with Democrats.  It usually is a precursor of a turnover, so Clinton's turnaround should not be minimized.
<p>
	I think we are moving now from turmoil and turbulence to uneasy equilibrium [stemming from a] partisan standoff between two plurality coalitions that are almost demographic and geographic mirror images of each other:  a Democratic coalition that is heavily based on the support of women and a Republican coalition that is heavily based on the support of men; a  Republican coalition that is centered in the South and the Mountain West and the Plains States, and a Democratic coalition that is moving toward a realignment of the Northeast, dominance of the northern tier states and the West Coast...
<p>
	If you average Bush and Dole's share of the popular vote, it was the lowest for Republicans in any consecutive election since the first two Franklin Roosevelt elections.  On the other hand, in Congress, the solidification of Republican control over the South is bolstering them in the same way that the one-party South helped the Democrats for so long.  The Republicans also show that they can convert majority into money, into advantage, in close races as Democrats were able to do.  Republican candidates showed a great deal of skill in tailoring themselves to local conditions.
<p>
<b>JOSETTE SHINER, <i>The Washington Times</b></i><br>
	I am an ardent defender of the free press and of the American press, and all it takes is a few trips abroad to understand just how fine our media is...[However,] there is a bias in the media;  the polls and surveys that have been taken tell the story.  Eighty-nine percent of the bureau chiefs and reporters in the Washington press voted for Clinton, more than 50% describe themselves as left-of-center, and only less than 5% describe themselves as right-of-center.  But if you look at the Clinton vs. Dole coverage, you will not see bias there.
<p>
	I think the bias is far more profoundly felt in the sense that it is a whole paradigm, the whole view of the media of the debate in America today...For example, the debate over decentralized government, the size of government, has swept the globe.  You can't go to any capitol in the world where this isn't THE debate of our time.  It has been a debate throughout American history.  And yet the inclination on the part of the media is to either turn that into a debate over compassion versus greed, or into a debate over who really cares about poor people.  Simplifying that debate, rather than honoring it for how profound it is, has affected this election tremendously.  
<p>
	When you are dealing with a paradigm like that you have to start with the basics and say, we are not talking about who are good people or who are bad people.  We're talking about a legitimate debate to see if we have found the exactly perfect size of government...The debate over what our society upholds as the standard of behavior is also a legitimate debate and is not about who is mean spirited or who is generous spirited...
<p>
	I think the other problem in the media is a ever-growing desire to be players in the political process.  This is reflected in a quote by Sydney Blumenthal [a journalist]:  "I'm not a reporter.  I don't believe that the accumulation of isolated fact upon fact yields some sort of pure Truth."  When asked about telling the truth about Clinton, he said, "I've urged other reporters to desist from writing anything that could jeopardize Mr. Clinton's chances."  He was then asked, "Well, don't you have to tell the truth?"  He said, "It doesn't matter.  This is too important."  Blumenthal is a caricature of the reporter who wants to [be a player].  
<p>
	More important is the ill-advised experiment of the newspapers in North Carolina.  I'm going to read from a <i>New York Times</i> story:  "Several of this state's major newspapers and television and radio stations have agreed on the real concerns for residents this year, and working together are trying to force candidates to address them.  Among the newspapers, the coordination is so tight that they've begun publishing virtually identical stories by the same reporters each Sunday.  The reports describe the presidential and statewide candidates' stands on issues like crime and taxes which residents said were important when polled by news organizations two months ago."...The candidates in North Carolina were tremendously frustrated because they were not allowed to set the agenda.  I think three cheers for real old-fashioned journalism where we'd go in and don't feel that we need to define the process.  
<p>
	The third trend that I think is disturbing is this overreliance on polls...In the media, one of our sacred rules is when sources are discredited, you drop them.  The polls this year were almost all wrong, by a large margin.  And so this reliance in our coverage on polls throughout the process not only disempowers the voter, but it's misleading.  You'd think at some point, we in the media would say, we're going to make our own judgments and pull back to some degree from the polling, but I think the opposite trend is taking place.
<p>
<b>WILLIAM KRISTOL, <i>The Weekly Standard</b></i><br>
	The good news obviously is the Republicans holding Congress for the first time since 1928.  It means that '94 was a fundamentally important election, and if you talk to Republicans around town, they're pretty cocky.  There are 32 Republican governors.  Every time in this century there is an election in the sixth year of a presidency, the out party picks up seats.  So if things go normally in '98 Republicans will increase their majority in Congress.  There will be a fresh shot at the White House in 2000 without an incumbent Democrat and with a fresh crop of Republican contenders.  Ideologically, big government is discredited.  The exit polls in this election showed a strong plurality of conservatives over liberals in the American electorate.  And in the core issue of do you think government should be somewhat bigger and do more to solve our social problems or smaller, smaller beats bigger by about two to one.  So there is a fair amount of good news out there.
<p>
	...Now the bad news.  The fact that there is good news, that Congress was held, that Dole was a particularly weak presidential candidate, as was Bush in '92, has led to much too much complacency on the part of conservatives.  The fact is that the Republicans barely held Congress, and wouldn't have held it if the elections had been held 2 weeks or 10 days earlier.  They held it because of the Indonesian money scandal and because Clinton sat on his lead a little too comfortably.  If Clinton had come in at around 52, 53 percent, the Democrats would have, I think, taken back the House and the mood would have been very different.  So to sit back complacently because of an incredibly narrow margin in about 15 Congressional districts that the Republicans held, is, I think, foolish.  
<p>
	Young voters, always a leading indicator, who went big for Reagan in '80 and '84, went big for Clinton in '96.  That's a big problem.  Hispanics, all the Republican progress that was made in that group over the last 15 years was erased.  Some of the data isn't very encouraging.  Everyone is confident about '98, but as someone pointed out to me last week, every other rule of American politics has been broken in this decade, why shouldn't the rule that the out parties pick up lots of seats in the sixth year be broken? 
<p>
	The last two Republican presidential candidates got 38 and 41 percent of the vote.  Some people don't think Congress is more important than the presidency.  But I continue to believe if you really want to change American policies and public policy, you need the presidency.  If you think back to the history of the 20th century, we remember President Wilson, President Roosevelt, President Johnson, President Reagan.  You don't remember Speakers of the House or Majority Leaders in the Senate in those periods.  And there is a reason for that.  If you really want to change the country, you need the presidency and you need Congress and you need big majorities in both.  And 38 and 41 percent is a weak showing, very weak showing at the presidential level...
<p>
	The '96 election in retrospect will be viewed as the calm before the storm.  We have a good economy, the country has been at peace, the scandals haven't quite broken.  You could have a very choppy next couple of years and the electorate could break big one way or the other.  It's a great opportunity and risk.

Empower America <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<h2>From Newspaper Opinion Pages...</h2>
</center><br>
<p>
<b>About Foreign Policy</b><br>
"The campaign is already in the home stretch and Americans have heard little about what the presidential candidates think we should do in the world, or to the world....In this presidential campaign, no one is asking:  What are the nature and limits of our obligations to others?  Are they different than those to our countryman?...Most Americans think our government's foreign policy should serve the national interest, as it's commonly understood.  But at least among America's elites...a tendency has developed to see any one's problems as our problems and every one's interests as our own....The Clinton administration has been trying to do some of these things in Somalia, where it spoke of 'nation building,' in Haiti where it spoke of 'restoring democracy,' in the U.N., where it has emphasized the emergence of a New World Order...and no one has asked American voters if they are willing to see their hard-earned tax dollars spent for these purposes." <br>
		Jeane Kirkpatrick, <i>The Washington Post</i>, October 6, 1996
<p>
<b>About Welfare Reform</b><br>
"There is now a powerful consensus that the welfare system is ruinous and fundamentally flawed.  At the same time, there are different, compelling, but mostly untried, theories about what ought to replace it.  It is now time to try them....Welfare subsidizes and helps sustain illegitimacy....That is the area where I believe we ought to concentrate our reform efforts, as well as on promoting adoption and channeling more support to private and religious poverty-fighting charities....Others think that replacing welfare with public service jobs is the best way to go.  The only way to prove who is right and who is wrongor determine what is the best mixis to test these social theories against reality.  This is precisely why we need to allow the states to try different approaches.  Which is precisely what this welfare bill does." <br>
		William J. Bennett, <i>The Washington Post</i>, August 19, 1996
<p>
<b>About the Tax Code</b><br>
"We now have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to unleash our economy from 60 years of accumulated policy mistakes by throwing out the Internal Revenue Code and replacing it with a low, single-rate, simple tax system that is pro-growth and pro-family.  As was pointed out by the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform (TRC), which I had the privilege to chair, fundamental overhaul of the tax system would accelerate real economic expansion to at least 4 percent a year for five or six years.  Such an acceleration of growth would not be inflationary, because the expansion wouldn't be induced artificially by unwarranted monetary expansion at the Fed but rather would be generated by unleashing the pent-up productive capacity of the economy." <br>
		Jack Kemp, <i>The Washington Post</i>, August 2, 1996
<p>
<b>About Education Reform</b><br>
"...I think there are two very clear visions of what schools should look like in the new century.  Sen. Dole's view and the Republican view is of independent neighborhood schools, both public and private, that are safe and drug-free, that have high academic standards, and among which parents may choose the best one for their childrenhelped by vouchers to pay part of their tuition costs....President Clinton and the teachers unions by and large want schools with a new name, but schools that look a lot like what we have today....[this] vision means more government control, more union control, more court regulation, more federal programs." <br>
		Lamar Alexander, <i>USA Today</i>, October 30, 1996
<p>
<b>About Indexing Capital Gains</b><br>
"...a farm, home or business purchased 30 or 40 years ago for $20,000 and sold today for 10 times that amount would attract capital gains tax not on the difference between $200,000 and $20,000, but only of the real price increasethe value of the gain adjusted for inflation.  In many cases, nearly the entire tax liability would disappear....It is nothing short of confiscation for our national government to take 28% of the values of U.S. farms, ranches, mills, mines and shops when they are sold simply because a government regulationnot even an act of Congressdefines inflation as a capital "gain," when any fool knows it is not....What better example is there of the people's wisdom than the fact that they prefer not to sell their assets when they know the value will be decimated in the process?  It has nothing to do with the rich, but with the tens of millions of ordinary people who have to pay taxes on inflation rather than invest the proceeds in job-creating enterprises." <br>
		Theodore J. Forstmann, EA Founding Chairman, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, October 22, 1996
<p>
<b>About Tax Cuts</b><br>
"Tax cuts a 'free lunch'?  Who in the world does Mr. Clinton think created this lunch in the first place?  Mr. Clinton's alternative of 'targeted tax cuts?'  In effect, Mr. Clinton is saying Washington has to direct us how to spend our money.  Americans should be able to make their own decisions as to what best fits their needs." <br>
		Steve Forbes, EA Board of Directors, <i>The Washington Times</i>, August 15, 1996
<p>
<b>About the Federal Budget</b><br>
"For the record, both the administration budget and the one adopted by Congress in June...allocate exactly the same amount, year to year, for Social Security.  Adding in Medicare, Medicaid, welfare reform, the Earned Income Tax Credit and other social programs mandated by law, the difference in total spending between the two proposals amounts to less than 1.5% on nearly $6 trillion in projected government spending over the next six years....Critics insist the Dole plan's capital gains tax reduction is aimed at benefiting 'the rich,' yet Internal Revenue Service data for 1993 show that 57% of all tax returns reporting capital gains came from taxpayers with incomes below $50,000 per year....Keep in mind, though, the Dole plan is more than numbers and economic assumptions.  Its ultimate rationale is grounded in moral philosophythe recognition that individuals are entitled to the fruits of their labor." <br>
		Judy Shelton, EA Board of Directors, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, August 27, 1996
<p>
<b>About Economic Growth</b><br>
"Under a policy regime of higher taxes, more regulation and a bigger welfare state, President Clinton asserts that today's economy is the best in three decades....What does the historical record show about the economy's performance?....The 2.5 percent average gross domestic product (GDP) growth experienced during the Clinton expansion years is unusually weak by historical standards, almost two full percentage points lower than the average annual growth rate attained during the past five economic expansions." <br>
		Lawrence Hunter, EA Chief Economist, <i>The Washington Times</i>, October 14, 1996
<p>
<b>About Affirmative Action</b><br>
"Thirty years ago, the animating spirit of the civil rights movement was noble:  America as a colorblind society...true to the principle of equal justice.  The most eloquent embodiment of that movement was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose dream was an America that judged individuals by the 'content of their character' and not 'the color of their skin'....That dream has been deferred...[and] replaced by something ugly, narrow and pernicious:  a color-conscious society in which race-based discrimination has become the centerpiece of the liberal civil rights agenda." <br>
		William J. Bennett, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>, August 12, 1996

<p>
<H2>Commentary About Empower America</H2>
</center><p><br>
<b><i>The Washington Times:</i></b>  Empower America Strategy, Stars Rise<br>
"In a town loaded with think tanks, Empower America is the think tank of the moment....At its inception, Empower America was considered a refuge for conservatives who where out of power...Now, Empower America is in the game." <br>
		Brian Blomquist, August 15, 1996
<p>
<b><i>The New York Times:</i></b>  Influential Group Brought Into Campaign by Kemp<br>
"Not long after Bill Clinotn defeated President Bush in 1992, Theodore J. Forstmann, a New York investment banker, sat down with Jack Kemp to discuss creating an organization in Washington to chart a new course of conservative causes, particularly Mr. Kemp's advocacy of stimulating growth by cutting taxes....The result was Empower America....Said Tex Lezar...who took over in May as chief executive of the organization, 'You could say it's been a shadow government.'"<br>
		Douglas Frantz, September 1, 1996
<p>
<b><i>U.S. News & World Report:</i></b>  A Conservatism of the Head<br>
"...the secret of the Dole campaign has been ideas.  The proximate source of these ideas was a small Washington think tank started four years ago as a home base for William Bennett and Jack Kemp, with Jeane Kirkpatrick, former Rep. Vin Weber, Steve Forbes and Lamar Alexander as principals.  Everyone played a key role in sculpting Dole's message." <br>
		Michael Barone, August 26, 1996
<p>
<b><i>Human Events:</i></b>  Conservative Spotlight<br>
"....[this] all-star lineup, according to Empower America President and CEO Tex Lezar, gives the organization both grassroots appeal and high-level visibility, which the group uses to promote conservative ideas in each codirector's area of expertise....Lezar said, Bill Bennett works as a proponent of 'tougher approaches on criminal justice and drug policy, the need for mediating institutions and personal responsibility to revitalize the culture.  Jack Kemp, of course, is the leading spokesman of what he calls "entrepreneurial capitalism" or pro-growth economics....[he] is also a proponent of a "conservative approach to do more for those who have been left behind by liberal, statist welfare policies"....Jeane Kirkpatrick [is] the foremost advocate "anywhere for a strong America and the use of America's military and diplomatic strength to advance America's interests"  Vin Weber's legislative background gives him a keen understanding of "where the political process and policy come together'"...Lamar Alexander focuses on education....In addition...[his] experience in running for President has made him very knowledgeable and very concerned about the issue of campaign finance reform.'"<br>
		Steve Schwalm, November 1, 1996
<p>
<b><i>The Minneapolis Star Tribune:</i></b>  Think Tank Spawned GOP Tax-Cut Plan<br>
"Not long after Bill Clinton won the presidency and ended a 12-year Republican reign in the White House, four leading conservatives formed a think tank in hopes of carrying forward their vision of lower taxes and less government....No one could have guessed that four years later the four Empower America founders and a cast of others from the organization would dominate Dole's campaign and help shape the tax cut that is its centerpiece.  Aside from Dole's selection of Kemp as his vice presidential running mater:   Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, an Empower America director and financial backer, is Dole's national campaign chairman.   Weber and Rumsfeld are the campaign's policy co-directors, and Weber picked the committee that crafted Dole's proposal for a 15 percent cut in income tax rates.   Empower America's co-founder Bill Bennett, who was education secretary in the Reagan administration, is a campaign co-chairman.... Co-founder Jeane Kirkpatrick, the former U.N. ambassador, is a Dole foreign policy adviser.   Ex-Empower America chairman Steve Forbes is a Dole economic adviser....[Weber] said the Dole camp turned to Empower America for 'intellectual horsepower.'"<br>
		Greg Gordon, October 28, 1996
<p>
<b><i>USA Today:</i></b>  Dole Gets Not Just Kemp, But His 'Brain Trust' Too<br>
"Empower America provided Kemp with an important political forum....and when he was named Dole's running mate, he arrived with a conservative brain trust...." <br>
		Judi Hasson, August 13. 1996
<p>
<b><i>Education Week:</i></b>  Empower America Cast in Key Role in Dole Campaign<br>
"In the past two months, perhaps no trio of Republicans has shared the spotlight with Bob Dole as much as Jack F. Kemp, William J. Bennett, and Lamar Alexander.  All three are influencing Mr. Dole's presidential campaign in different ways, yet they have something in common:  All have been waiting in the wings as co-directors of Empower America, the Washington think tank that promotes 'progressive conservative policies based on principles of economic growth, international leadership, and cultural renewal'....Voucher legislation first prepared in 1992 by Mr. Alexander, as secretary of education in the Bush administration, has been the basis for Mr. Dole's 'opportunity scholarship' proposal in an election in which voters say education is at the top of their agenda....And while the November election will render a verdict on Mr. Dole's agendaincluding its Empower America themesofficials at the organization plan to plow ahead with their efforts regardless of the election results." <br>
		Mark Pitsch, September 18, 1996

<H2>Bennett: Politics Aside</H2>
</center>
During the last three decades, America has experienced an unprecedented degree of social regression. If things continue the way they are going, we may well see the end of the American experiment in ordered liberty. To be more specific: if current trends in juvenile crime, illegitimacy, family disintegration, community breakup, education, and drug use continue, this experiment in self-government will end. This is a conclusion based on a disinterested analysis of social facts. After all, there is nothing inevitable about this experiment. Our system of ordered liberty was brought about by will and thought and reflection, not by chance. The Founders said that we would have to maintain certain efforts to keep it together. Some of those efforts are being maintained. But many are not.
<p>
During our Candidate School, you have heard from some people we regard as among the ablest and smartest around in various policy areas. Public policy is crucial; here at Empower America, we are trying to advance the most intelligent and thoughtful policies we can. But I believe the cultural arena is even more important. That is not to say that cultural ideas can't be significantly influenced by people in politics. Indeed, they can. But I have to say, I think it probably matters more for the cultural future of this country what happens in movies and television, and on the radio and in classrooms, than what happens on Capitol Hill.
<p>
Talk to a group of teenagers and tell me if they sound more to you like they're listening to C-Span or MTV. And I will tell you: they sound a lot more like MTV. This doesn't diminish the political task. It just makes it clear that there are other tasks as well. And of course the two are related.
<p>
I think that if the philosophy of life being promulgated in TV commercials, movies. television and other cultural media changed, it would probably bring about more of a positive change in American life than virtually any piece of legislation we can imagine.
<p>
There is the belief among many of the people who have the most power and influence to shape attitudes that the most important obligation in life is to yourself, that your duties are to yourself - not to God, not to country, not to work, or family, or wife, or children, but to self. And if self is not happy or satisfied. then it must take priority. This, in my view, is a social disaster and an invitation to barbarism. It is a dagger aimed at the heart of our society. But it prevails in many quarters . It has been given to us by some intellectuals. Much of Hollywood pushes that view. And it is central to much of contemporary liberalism. I think it is poisoning the moral environment of America.
<p>
Bad philosophy has destroyed the lives of many people in this country. It has destroyed many homes, many communities, and will continue to unless we confront it directly. If you do try to fight this thing by taking on its proponents, you will be in for one heck of a fight. But it is a fight worth having. Indeed, it is one of the fights that matters most.

Empower America's <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<H2>Kemp: Growth and Hope</H2>
</center>
Empower America was founded to present conservatism's positive face, on the premise that the instincts of the American people arc naturally optimistic and that their values are predicated upon the virtues of a Judeo-Christian society . We believe that conservatives should always be forward looking, not backward looking; optimistic, not pessimistic; confident, not timid; and inclusive, not exclusive.
<p>
You cannot lead anybody with pessimism. Can you imagine a quarterback going into the huddle and saying, "Gosh, it's hot out here. Wow, those guys are big over there. I know this play has never worked before, but I don't know what else to do. Let's try it again." No great adventure has ever been led by anybody who says it can't be done. Leadership has to be predicated upon confidence in one's own abilities as well as on a belief in the inevitability of ultimate victory.
<p>
Leadership should be centered around a world view of hope, optimism, confidence, and the ultimate achievement of victory - for the right reason. The Bible says overcome evil, overcome it with good. Conservatives are obligated morally, not only to indict darkness, but to also light candles; not only to be against that which is bad, but also to be for empowering and unleashing the potential of the human spirit.
<p>
A great conservative named Oswald Spengler wrote <i>Decline of the West</i> in 1931. He was pessimistic about democracy. He thought that democracy wouldn't survive against fascism and Nazism. One of the founders of <i>National Review</i>, James Burnham, wrote <i>Suicide of the West</i>. He said we were going to commit suicide because democracy wouldn't work. Jean Francois Ravel, another leading conservative, wrote a book in which he said democracy will turn out to be a parenthesis in the history of the world.
<p>
Unlike these men, I'm an optimist. I always knew we would win. Sometimes, however, it has been tough maintaining this positive outlook. I know there are problems. Human rights abuses continue in China, the Middle East, and Bosnia Despite these problems, democracy has defeated all of the "isms" of years past - absolutism, fascism, Nazism, and communism.
<p>
Socialism is dead intellectually. Isolated pockets remain in Cuba, North Korea, and in the economics departments of some of our Ivy League colleges, but very few people today talk about socialism as an answer to poverty. In my view, there is only one real answer to poverty: a system based on private property, limited government, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial capitalism. The Left has tried to make Americans feel guilty about this kind of a system - to envy the rich, to desire a redistribution of wealth, and to centralize power. Thanks to computers and the telecommunications revolution, much of the world now has instantaneous access to information. This revolution will be the ultimate undoing of modern liberalism's centralizing tendencies. Markets will be energized, unleashed, and individualized. In this new environment, mistakes in government policies can cause capital to flow out of a country as fast as it flows in. All of this means that governments cannot control commerce like they used to.
<p>
My entire political career has been dedicated to the proposition that conservatives should be positive and optimistic and demonstrate a concern for the underdogs in our society. It is outrageous that conservatives have allowed liberals to steal genuinely good words - welfare, for instance. Don't think of welfare in terms of what the Left has described. I care about the "welfare" of my family. Welfare is not a bad word. We have allowed it to become synonymous with government handouts . What welfare really means is the well-being of someone. Conservatives <i>should</i> care about the welfare of the American people. We <i>should</i> want everyone to be able to get a good education, get a job, get married, have children, and move up the economic ladder.
<p>
People don't care how much you know until they know that you care. That is why conservatives must be inclusive. We have got to show South Central Los Angeles that we care about them just as much as we care about Wall Street. If our policies will not work in East Saint Louis, how can we sell them to Russia or Eastern Europe?
<p>
I proposed the idea of free enterprise zones for the District of Columbia in order to enhance the city's ability to recover its middle class. Two hundred thousand families have moved out of D.C. over the past 15 years because of taxes, crime, and a lack of educational quality. I helped introduce a Hong Kong-like tax code for D.C. because we have to do something radical to save the nation's capital. Many liberals in Washington knocked my head off, saying, 'There goes Jack Kemp again, trying to help the rich, only thinking of himself." Recently, D.C.'s Delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, introduced a Hong Kong-like tax code for the District of Columbia. A flat, 15 percent income tax for the whole city. She is an African-American and a liberal Democrat. She introduced my bill for D.C. within 24 hours. She called it "The Economic Recovery Act." With that kind of a strategy, how can the Left say that conservatives don't care about the welfare of the poorest among us?
<p>
Liberals have shown that they care by putting people on welfare. Conservatives have got to show people how to get off of it, and how to get into jobs and education and the type of opportunity for which we are working. Every single voter - regardless of color, regardless of residence - is a potential consumer you have to communicate with. If you understand your job, your product, and treat people with care and concern, even though they may not vote for you, you've done a service for conservatives. If we have a good product, conservatives ought to be able to sell it in any area and to anyone in the United States.
<p>
Conservatism and optimism are not mutually exclusive. I believe that successful candidates for public office in 1996 and beyond will be the ones who embrace policies and strategies that exhibit both of these qualities. It means advocating a message of hope and it means supporting ideas that will spur economic growth. How you execute your campaign, how you approach leadership, what your attitude is toward people is essential to the outcome. Does anybody doubt that? Whether it's a huddle, a home, a business, or politics, your attitude will determine the outcome of your endeavor. If you've got the right outlook, the willingness to succeed, and the love in your heart for this country, your message and the strength of your ideas will be more powerful than any army in the history of mankind.

<H2>Kirkpatrick: US Credibility</H2>
</center>
I am pleased to be at this Empower America event with all of you candidates who are running for office and hoping to turn good ideas into the policies of the United States, at the local, state and national level. I'm sure you're going to know what to do after you're elected: to implement the policies that create free people, that strengthen free people, that expand and protect freedom, and that encourage the ingenuity, enterprise and energy that free people apply in situations where initiative and enterprise are permitted to prevail.
<p>
Our foreign policy is - always and inevitably - an expression of our government and our society, our will and our purpose, as is every government's foreign policy an expression of the morality and purposes of that society and that government. Policies of a government are not likely to be much better than the quality of its government - at least not for long. This is especially so in national security matters, where credibility depends directly on the government's strength and also its will. I firmly believe that American credibility, and the appreciation of our strength and our purpose, is our most important asset in the conduct of foreign affairs and national security. I believe the Clinton Administration has been squandering American credibility, power, reputation and respect in the world. I think our credibility has declined along with our military strength. There is a very real correlation - it is an unfortunate correlation when you are weak, and a fortunate one when you are strong - between strength and respect. We have been the strongest government and country in the world. We probably still are the strongest country in the world, but we are a good deal less strong than we were four or five years ago. We are a good deal less strong than we were when the Berlin Wall came down. We are a good deal less strong than we were when Bill Clinton was inaugurated.
<p>
When our credibility suffers, those leaders contending for ultimate power, in, for example, China, are strengthened. Those most likely to use force, like firing missiles to threaten Taiwan, are strengthened. And when our credibility suffers, North Korean dictators, like Kim Jong II, are more likely to violate the demilitarized zone, and more likely to offer new challenges to South Korea and other neighbors. And when American credibility suffers, the governments of countries like Iran, Syria and Libya are greatly encouraged.
<p>
We are becoming less strong because our military - our forces and our weapons, our research and development - are being permitted to decline by the refocusing of attention and reallocation of resources in the Defense Department. Generals in the Defense Department are confessing, reluctantly, to committee chairmen in the House National Security Committee that the level and rate of procurement which the Administration is providing for our future is not adequate to provide for our future. The military will be short of a good many things that we need. Already training budgets have been displaced by what are thought to be more urgent needs. Our armed forces' spare parts budgets have been raided for what are thought to be more urgent needs. And our research and development is just simply neglected.
<p>
The Clinton Administration has doggedly declined to invest in a missile defense for the United States, not facing the fact that if we don't develop a missile defense, we will not be able to help anyone else defend themselves against missiles either. Apparently, it occurred to the President recently that Israel might need some help with missile defense, and announced that the United States would assume that responsibility. The fact that some systems exist for missile defense comes from the research and development that was undertaken in the Reagan Administration. This was for a much larger missile defense program, one which would be able to defend you and the citizens you hope will vote for you, one to protect and defend the whole country. Unfortunately, Bill Clinton has shut down almost all of this program in the last three years. One hopes that he will reconsider missile defense for the United States.
<p>
This President is not oriented toward thinking about defense. He is not oriented toward providing for American strength. He is, in fact, reluctant to think about strength. The whole Administration is reluctant to think about strength, including even the Defense Department, of all the places to be reluctant to think about strength. The President and the Administration, the Secretary of Defense, have gone forth into the world again and again, carrying a very large carrot to deal with very disagreeable dictators, like Kim Jong II of North Korea, like Syria's Assad, like Fidel Castro, like some of the Chinese some of the time.
<p>
I believe that the decline in our credibility has already produced unfortunate experiences, such as the shooting down of American planes and the murder of American pilots over international waters near Cuba. Even though our media kept talking about Cuban exiles, those were American citizens flying very small, unarmed, American planes, which were shot down near Cuba. And what happened after they were shot down, unprovoked, these unarmed planes which had done no harm to anyone? What happened? Actually what happened, of course, was nothing happened. Nothing at all, there was no retribution of any kind. I don't know what Ronald Reagan would have done in that situation. But the point is, we don't know because Fidel Castro wouldn't have done something like that when Ronald Reagan was president. Muammar Khaddafi did something like it when Ronald Reagan was President, and he found out what Ronald Reagan would have done. <p>
The fact is that when America is strong and America is purposeful, and we stand with democracies, and we stand with freedom, we strengthen peoples and countries who share our values. The whole world profits. When our strength declines, and our credibility, strength and purpose are questioned by thugs, the world becomes more dangerous.

<H2>Candidate School Sets Out Fall Course</H2>
</center>
The notion that "ideas have consequences" is central to the work and mission of Empower America, and was at the core of Empower America's 1996 Candidate School held on April 29th in Washington, D.C. Candidates and campaign strategists from local, state and national races in twenty-four states met with Empower America's Co-Directors and leading policy experts for a detailed discussion of the issues that are central to the 1996 elections.
<p>
In his welcoming remarks, Empower America Co-Director Vin Weber told the candidates, "Our organization was founded in order to bring important political ideas to the forefront of our national debate, where they can be vigorously deliberated and acted upon. Empower America's candidate training school and briefing book are just one part of that broad effort. Our intention is to reach beyond the necessary issues of campaign management (i.e., polling, fundraising, advertising and organization) to the <i>intellectual</i> content of the political process. Our ambitious goal is to help seed the national political debate with substantive thought. We believe it is that dedication to ideas and issues that distinguishes this instruction."
<p>
The seminar was opened by Empower America Co-Director Jack Kemp, who spoke of unleashing America's economic potential. The path to the American dream must be opened, said Kemp, by reforming the tax code; removing barriers to work, savings and investment; and by opening the possibilities for all citizens to gain access to capital and credit.
<p>
Jack Kemp's remarks were followed by a panel of economic policy experts discussing three of the most significant reforms necessary for economic growth. Dan Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation offered a detailed discussion of tax reform; Mike Horowitz of the Hudson Institute described the need for tort and regulatory reform; and John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis (N.C.P.A.) addressed a topic that is about to become a leading economic and political issue: the privatization of Social Security.
<p>
A second panel, entitled <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>, tackled the fragmentation of American society. Stuart Anderson of the Cato Institute described the benefits of legal immigration and the unwise nature of current anti-immigration initiatives; David Murray of Statistical Assessment Service offered an excellent explanation of the true nature of American "oneness" and the pitfalls of "multiculturalism"; and Brian Jones of the Center for New Black Leadership spoke of the social harm produced by preferential policies based on race and gender.
<p>
Panel three turned its attention to devolution of societal responsibilities from government to civil society, and the need to rebuild and strengthen community institutions. The speakers were three leaders in that effort Adam Meyerson of the Heritage Foundation, editor of <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship;</i> Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a pioneer in community and individual self-help efforts; and Mike Gerson. policy director for Sen. Dan Coates, who spoke on behalf of the Senator's 19-point legislative program to strengthen civil society, the Project for American Renewal.
<p>
At lunch the candidates heard from former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick discussing foreign policy and the erosion of America's hard-earned credibility and worldwide leadership during the Clinton presidency.
<p>
Two afternoon panels instructed the participants on a wide range of domestic issues. and on the experiences of the 104th Congress . Domestic issues were covered by five of the top thinkers in their fields. John J. DiIulio covered crime; former assistant Drug Czar John P. Walters discussed drugs; Chester E. Finn of the Hudson Institute spoke on education; Merrill Matthews of the N.C.P.A.'s Center for Health Policy Studies reviewed health care; and the former Director of the U.S. National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Douglas Besharov, spoke about welfare.
<p>
Three leaders of the Freshman class of the 104th Congress conducted a lively question and answer session during the final panel, informing the candidates from their own experience. Congresswoman Sue Myrick (9-NC), Congressman Sam Brownback (2-KS) and Congressman Dave McIntosh (2-IN) urged the attendees to join their "revolution" to reduce government and return power and responsibility to Americans.
<p>
The final remarks were delivered by Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett. Dr. Bennett spoke of the need for cultural and societal renewal in America, and of the forces and policies that have weakened our culture. His address wrapped up a day that several candidates described as bringing focus and a winning edge into their strategy. "So much good information." said a candidate for U.S. Senate, "I'd do it again."

<H2>EA Releases Influential lmmigration Study</H2>
</center>
At a recent press conference in Washington, DC, William Bennett and Jack Kemp released a study sponsored by Empower America about employment-based immigration. The report, <i>Employment-Based Immigration and High Technology: Issues and Recommendations,</i> examines the impact on the wages and employment opportunities of native-born Americans produced by the employment of foreign-born engineers and scientists.
<p>
The author of the study, Stuart Anderson, a visiting scholar at the Cato Institute, compiled data from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and conducted interviews with engineering and computer industry corporate leaders to determine if immigrants hurt job opportunities for American engineers and scientists, as is commonly believed. The study concluded that U.S. high tech companies hire foreign-born engineers and scientists because, in these highly specialized industries, they frequently possess unique skills and fill key technical niches in the U.S. Iabor force.
<p>
Foreign born high-tech employees are not paid less than their U.S. counterparts, which is also commonly believed. Indeed, data from the NAS show that the median salaries of foreign-born engineers and scientists are significantly <i>higher</i>, not lower, than their native-born counterparts who completed their Ph.Ds in the same year. Furthermore, the study demonstrates more generally that foreign-born engineers and immigrants play a significant role in creating jobs in the high technology fields through entrepreneurship and innovation.
<p>
Calling the study a "wakeup call," Dr. Bennett and Secretary Kemp called the report "a warning specifically to those who believe that scaling back on legal immigration will help the American worker. Friends of the American worker are by necessity defenders of immigration, for immigrants serve as a catalyst for economic growth. This study dispels the myth that employing immigrants displaces American workers."
<p>
The study was distributed to all the members of the U.S. Congress as they considered legislation aimed at curbing legal immigration. Empower America's role in shaping the final outcome of this legislation was significant. Provisions aimed at reducing employment-based immigration were eliminated from the Senate bill; and, ultimately, the Senate voted to split their immigration reform bill by considering legal and illegal immigration separately. Similarly, the House passed a bill that cracks down on illegal immigration, but rejected provisions that would have reduced legal immigration by nearly one-third.

<H2>EA Announces New Leadership</H2>
</center>
The Board of Directors of Empower America has appointed Thomas W. Weisel as Chairman of the Board and Tex Lezar as President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Weisel served as Acting Chairman when Steve Forbes took a leave of absence as EA's Chairman to run for President in the Fall of 1995.
<p>
Weisel is founder, Chairman and CEO of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco one of the nation's leading securities firm. Under Weisel's leadership, Montgomery Securities' annual revenues have grown over the last 25 years to exceed $500 million. Weisel holds five National Master's titles in cycling and has served as Chairman of U.S. Skiing, the governing body of the U.S. ski team.
<p>
EA Co-Director Jack Kemp called Weisel, who specializes in taking smaller "growth" companies public, "the embodiment of the American dream." Kemp continued, "Thom has demonstrated in his professional life that entrepreneurial capitalism works. He has spent his life pushing entrepreneurs toward success. His real-world insight and world-class fundraising capabilities will continue to be of tremendous benefit to Empower America."
<p>
Empower America's new President and CEO, Tex Lezar, comes to the organization from Dallas, Texas, where he is engaged in private law practice. Lezar, who served as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President Reagan and edited <i>Making Government Work A Conservative Agenda for the States</i>, has been a prominent litigator and appellate lawyer in Texas since 1977. In 1994, Lezar was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.
<p>
Bennett, Kemp, Kirkpatrick and Weber jointly said, "Tex Lezar comes from the school of Ronald Reagan and adheres to its credo - an optimistic faith in freedom, democratic capitalism, strong national defense and time-honored values. He has a sound knowledge of public policy and politics, and brings to Empower America the fruits of an impressive career in government, law, and politics. We are very pleased to have Tex aboard."
<p>
Steve Forbes will rejoin the Board of Directors and William Dal Col, Empower America's former President, will be working with Forbes while continuing to informally advise Empower America.
<p>
Nick Forstmann, Partner at Forstmann Little & Co., is Empower America's new Vice Chairman. He is a long-standing member of EA's Board of Directors.

<H2>Co-Directors Support Missile Defense</H2>
</center>
<i>The Defend America Act of 1996 (H.R. 3144) would mandate the development and deployment of a national missile defense by 2003 to protect all Americans against the threat of accidental or limited ballistic missile attack. Empower America Co-Directors Kirkpatrick, Kemp, Bennett, and Weber sent a letter to the entire House of Representatives urging that they vote in favor of this vital legislation. Excerpts from the letter follow:</i>
<p>
"Today, dozens of countries have or are seeking to acquire ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. These include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, to name a few. Incredibly, America still has no defense against this threat. Even a single missile launched at our nation - whether deliberately or by accident - would have tragic consequences, and, if it were armed with a nuclear, biological, or chemical warhead, the results would be catastrophic.
<p>
The technology exists today to move forward with a limited ballistic missile defense that is able to protect Americans in all 50 states - and to do so at an affordable cost. The Defend America Act would make it clear that Americans will no longer remain hostage to unlawful states and the decisions of their unpredictable rulers.
<p>
The Clinton Administration still refuses to take our vulnerability to a missile attack seriously. The Administration has said it does not foresee missile threats to the United States emerging in the next 15 years. They ignore the still formidable Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals and place an historically unwarranted faith in the intelligence community's ability to recognize Third World missile threats in a timely manner - before they materialize. Our underestimation of the scope and magnitude of Iraq's missile program prior to the Gulf War is proof enough of this.
<p>
It is crucial to ensure that all Americans have the protection they deserve against threats to their security. But today, Americans have no protection against ballistic missile attack. We therefore urge you, in the strongest terms, to vote for the Defend America Act."

<H2>From Newspaper Opinion Pages...</H2>

<b>About "Same-Sex" Marriage </b><br>
"I believe that overall, allowing same-sex marriages would do significant, long-term social damage...Recognizing the legal union of gay and Iesbian couples would represent a profound change in the meaning and definition of marriage..Marriage is not an arbitrary construct; it is an 'honorable estate' based on the different, complementary nature of men and women - and how they refine, support, encourage and complete one another. To insist that we maintain this traditional understanding of marriage is not an attempt to:put others down. It is simply an acknowledgment and celebration of our most precious and important social act....It is exceedingly imprudent to conduct a radical, untested and inherently flawed social experiment on an institution that is the keystone in the arch of civilization. That we have to debate this issue at all tells us that the arch has slipped."<br>
      William J. Bennett, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 21, 1996<p>

<b>About Expanding NATO</b><br>
"Support for the admission to NATO of Eastern European democracies has been growing in Washington. A bill for which bipartisan support is expected has been drafted in the House International Relations Committee calling for NATO 'at early date' to include, at a minimum, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.... There is no spirit of Munich here. The bill's authors believe - as I believe - that it is about time that the new democracies begin to enjoy the full benefits of freedom, including credible security. Should such a bill be acted on before the Russian elections? Will it damage Yeltsin's chances - as some have argued? I think not. A weak, timid West would be far more damaging. Yeltsin and the Russian democrats will win if it is clear that the resurgent communist/fascist spirit cannot prevail. Enlarging NATO will send just that message."<br>
      Jeane Kirkpatrick, <i>New York Post,</i> April 10, 1996<p>

<b>About a Flat Tax for Washington, DC</b><br>
"Our nation's macro economy is a democratic-capitalist economy based on private property and rewards for productive human activity. However, we also have a concurrent, micro economy that is almost a Third World socialist welfare state...and nowhere is it better illustrated than in our nation's capital, Washington, DC.... Spending cuts and fiscal restraints must be an integral part of any plan to relieve the current financial burden and restore credibility to the nation's capital. But we believe the most important step is for the District government and Congress to fully embrace the proposal to reinvigorate the District announced last month by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. Norton has introduced the DC Economic Recovery Act, also known as a progressive flat tax plan, which will create much needed jobs, expand the tax base and serve as a great enticement to middle-class families to come back home to Washington."<br>
      Jack Kemp, with DC Council member Kevin P. Chavous, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About Stable Money</b><br>
"Businesses bringing their goods and services to the international market place should not have to contend with unpredictable exchange rate fluctuations that transform legitimately earned profits into currency losses. What is necessary in today's global economy is not a European Monetary Union so much as a viable plan for international monetary reform aimed at serving the needs of an open world economy dedicated to free trade."<br>
      Judy Shelton, EA Board Member, <i>Wall Street Journal Europe,</i> April 25, 1996
<p>
<b>About Tax Reform</b><br>
"What's truly driving voter frustration is a desire for clarity - for sharp-edge, distinct alternatives on how to move the country ahead...instead of beginning our debate by arguing over what appears on Page 6,743 of the tax code, why not begin on Page One? If we're sincere about wanting the public to participate in the debate over tax reform, shouldn't we start deciding whether we want to keep the current system we have?"<br>
      Theodore J. Forstmann, EA Founding Chairman and Member of the Tax Reform
      Commission, <i>Washington Times,</i> April 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About "Rap Rubbish"</b><br>
"A question for parents: What would you do if you discovered that someone was encouraging your sons to kill people indiscriminately, to find fun in beating and raping girls, and to use the word 'motherf---er' at least once in every sentence?" <br>
      William J. Bennett, Joe Lieberman and C. DeLores Tucker, <i>USA Today,</i> June

<H2>Rapping Obscene Music, Empower America Launches "Round Two" in Values Campaign </H2>
</center>
On May 30, Empower America launched "Round Two" of the campaign against obscene and harmful music Iyrics being produced and marketed by major entertainment companies. Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett announced the venture at a joint press conference in Washington, DC, with Senator Joe Lieberman (CT), and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women.
<P>
In this second round of the ongoing campaign, Dr. Bennett, Senator Lieberman, Dr . Tucker and Senator Sam Nunn (GA) released a radio ad calling on five of the largest music companies to end their involvement with degrading and indefensible music Iyrics. The ad targets music that glorifies murder and drug use, and that celebrates the beating and raping of women. The companies named in the ad and at the press conference are Time Warner, as well as foreign-owned Sony of Japan, Thorn EMI of Great Britain, PolyGram (owned by Philips Electronics) of the Netherlands, and Bertelsmann of Germany. The ad is airing on both national and local talk shows.
<P>
Listeners who hear the ad are encouraged to call Empower America's hotline to add their names to a petition being sent to the companies. The goal is to reach as many people as possible, who will, in turn. contact these companies and ask them to reconsider their support for this music.
<P>
Time Warner, the target of Empower America's first campaign against obscene music,took a positive step with their sale of Interscope Records last September. However, since that time, they have not limited their production and distribution of offensive music on some of their other labels. As a result, Empower America is again calling on Time Warner, as well as the other four foreign-owned corporations, to refuse to sponsor this cultural rot.
<P>
Prior to the press conference announcing the campaign, letters were sent to the heads of the corporations, and to their American subsidiaries, asking them to "make normative judgments about what is acceptable to produce and market" and calling on the corporations to "refuse to sponsor this vicious, vulgar music."
<P>
Empower America plans to continue efforts to focus scrutiny on obscene music Iyrics, and to ask major corporations to refuse to sponsor garbage. Said Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett, "We are going to continue to put the heat and light on these guys...We're in it for the duration."

<H2>Virtue on Public Television This Fall</H2>
</center>
William Bennett's highly acclaimed anthology, The Book of Virtues, is being brought to life in a new, fully animated television series: "Adventures from The Book of Virtues." The new television show will premier in the fall on PBS.
<P>
Produced by PorchLight Entertainment in association with KCET in Los Angeles, "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will air during prime time on PBS stations nationwide for three consecutive evenings, beginning on Labor Day, 1996. The series draws its themes from Dr. Bennett's collection of classic American stories, Greek mythology, European fairy tales, African fables, Asian folk tales, Native American legends and Bible stories.
<P>
The characters and stories in each adventure will exemplify the traits of good character and depict the virtues illustrated in the The Book of Virtues, which has sold over two million copies. Many well-known Hollywood stars will be lending their voices to the heroic characters and villains in the series.
<P>
William Bennett has been highly critical of network programs aimed at our nation's youth and believes that the way to respond to poor television programming is either to turn the television off or to try to put something on that will lift up spirits and minds. Dr. Bennett is hopeful that "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will add some much needed lift to family viewing time.
<P>
<B>Call your local PBS outlet for viewing times on Labor Day.</B>

<FONT SIZE=5>Bennett: Educating America on Crime<BR>
</center>
</FONT>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America's William Bennett was recently named
co-chair of the bipartisan Council on Crime in America. The commission
will present hard data to educate both the public and the media
on the nature and extent of the crime problem in the United States,
and identify policies and initiatives that protect citizens and
promote justice. Dr. Bennett co-chairs the Council on Crime with
Griffin B. Bell, who was Attorney General in the Carter Administration.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Council on Crime's first report, The State of
Violent Crime in America, generated widespread media attention.
It revealed that despite the recent drop in crime rates in certain
cities, the dangers law-abiding citizens face are near an all-time
high. These dangers are compounded by the reality of &quot;revolving
door&quot; justice which allows criminals to walk free on probation,
parole or pre-trial release. In fact, one out of every three convicted</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> criminals is under the &quot;supervision&quot; of
the justice system at the very time they commit more murders,
rapes and other violent crimes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This study paints a realistic and sobering
picture of violent crime in America,&quot; Bennett said, &quot;but
it is not without its rays of hope. If the success that cities
such as New York and Houston have had in reducing crime rates
teaches us anything, it is that the common sense of the American
people is right when it comes to crime: tough law enforcement
is a necessary part of the solution.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council's report also corrects some of the misinformation
about criminal justice spread by the popular press. For example,
the widespread myth that too many people are imprisoned in America
is refuted by the Council' s finding that only one criminal for
every 100 violent crimes actually goes to jail. Evidence that
over 90 percent of all state prisoners have been violent criminals
or are recidivists dispell inaccurate reports that prisons are
populated with nonviolent offenders. And the report presents calculations
which demonstrate that imprisoning violent offenders saves dollars
as well as lives: a single rape costs its victim and society an
average of $87,000 - many times greater than the cost of
keeping a rapist in prison for a year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This is an important report,&quot; Bennett
noted, &quot;it is rigorous, toughminded, and common-sensical.
It provides important information on the nature of the crime problem
in the United States. But more importantly, it points to the problems
in the American justice system that can be fixed, and if fixed,
can and will save lives. I am convinced that the first and fundamental
responsibility of government is protecting the citizenry. It is
the key provision in the social contract. And there is simply
no way that civil society can flourish if there is lawlessness
in the streets.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council on Crime will be holding several grassroots
hearings across the nation over the next several months to highlight
innovative policies and citizen initiatives to counteract crime.
The final report, which will offer policy prescriptions to cut
crime, increase the effectiveness and responsiveness of the criminal
justice system, and promote citizen safety will be issued in the
summer of 1996.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Along with Bennett and Bell, other Council members
include Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham, former U.
S. Attorney General William Barr, Florida Attorney General Robert
Butterworth, Princeton Professor John DiIulio, California Prison
Commissioner John Gillis, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith
and Colorado Attorney General Gail Norton. H</FONT>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kemp: Flatter, Fairer Tax System Urged<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>In January of 1996, the National Commission on Economic
Growth and Tax Reform issued a comprehensive report to Congress
and the country. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich created the Commssion last year to analyze the current
system and develop proposals for an entirely new tax system. Empower
America Co-Director Jack Kemp was appointed Chairman of the Commission.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The &quot;Kemp Commisson&quot; held hearings throughout
the country to learn the views of the American people about the
current tax system and their ideas for a new tax system. The Kemp
Commission found that the current tax code is far too complex,
intrusive and unfair, and is, in effect, a dead weight on the
American economy. As stated in the report, <i>Unleashing America's
Potential: A Pro-Growth, Pro-Family Tax System for the 21st Century:</i>
&quot;We believe the current tax code cannot be revised, should
not be reinvented, and must not be retained. Therefore, the commission
is unanimous: It is time to throw out the seven-million word mess
of tax laws and regulations and begin a new.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Commissioners outlined six working principles
they believe a tax code must have to ensure that the system is
fair while accurately reflecting and fostering the high ideals
of the American democratic-republic.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> These principles include: <i><b>fairness</b></i>, treating citizens
equally before the law;<i> <b>simplicity</b></i>; making compliance as easy as possible;
<b><i>neutrality</i></b>, so that people and not government make the choices;
<b><i>
stability</b></i>, so that people can accurately plan for their futures;
and <b><i>visibility</b></i>, so citizens will have an honest sense of the true
cost of government. The Commission also stressed that <b><i>economic
growth</i></b> must not be inhibited by the tax code.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With these firm principles anchoring the Commission's
vision, it offered recommendations for a new tax system to stimulate
a vigorous national debate about how best to change the current
system. The Commission proposed a low, single-rate of taxation
with a generous personal exemption&Ntilde;to remove those people
least able to bear a tax burden from the tax rolls. Such a system
would remove the biases against work, saving, and investment present
in the current system's double, triple, and quadruple taxation
of income.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another major recommendation was to make payroll
taxes fully deductible for working men and women. And it recommended
abolishing separate taxation of capital gains.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Addressing the current pattern of a constantly changing
tax code, the Commission also strongly recommended a 2/3 super
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> majority vote in Congress be required to increase
tax rates in the future. This will provide a measure of stability
in the tax system so people and businesses can better plan future
savings and investment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Secretary Kemp and other members of the Tax Reform
Commission recently testified before the Senate Finance Committee
where they outlined the very real and substantial problems with
the current system and strongly advocated the creation of a new
tax system for a new millennium, one that accomodates the new
information age and stimulates technological revolution.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tax reform will be a key issue in the 1996 elections,
and many candidates have endorsed the single-rate model outlined
by the Kemp Commission. The dissatisfaction with the current code
is producing a groundswell of support for radical tax reform.
The Kemp Commission made a substantial contribution to this rising
tide of change by providing the philosophical justification for
a new, single-rate tax system for America's 21st century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The fourteen Commissioners came from large and small
business sectors, academia, and the public sector. Empower America'
s Founding Chairman, Ted Forstmann, served as one of the Commissioners.

<FONT SIZE=3>Kirkpatrick: Facts on National Security<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America Co-Director and former US Ambassador
to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick has taken issue with President
Bill Clinton's State of the Union (SOTU) assertion that his administration
has &quot;enhanced the security of the American people.&quot;
In a series of recent speeches and articles, Ambassador Kirkpatrick,
who is also a syndicated columnist, stated that &quot;almost everything
President Clinton said in his State of the Union address concerning
foreign policy is misleading, much simply untrue.&quot; Some major
national security issues which merit examination include:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>National Missile Defense</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton's statement that &quot;for the
first time, since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian
missiles pointed at American children&quot; is misleading, as
it ignores the overwhelming need to defend the United States from
attack by ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The evidence that rogue regimes hostile to the United
States - such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea - are undertaking
extraordinary efforts to acquire advanced missile and weapons
technology is overwhelming. Two years ago, then-CIA Director James
Woolsey testified to the Congress, &quot;More than twenty-five
countries, many of them hostile to the United States and our friends
and allies, may now have or are developing nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons, and the means to deliver them.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton vetoed the Defense Bill on December
29, 1995, in large part because he objected to the Congressional
increase in ballistic defense program funding and mandate to deploy
the defense system by 2003. In his veto message, Mr. Clinton argued
that deploying this defense system would violate the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty (ABM) between the United States and the former
Soviet Union. As EA Co-Directors Jeane Kirkpatrick and Jack Kemp
wrote to Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC), Chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, last fall: &quot;The ABM Treaty, designed
for a bipolar world, always had dubious value. It is now wholly
outdated .... It dismays us that instead of focusing on our current
needs, opponents of ballistic missile defense worry about outdated
arms control treaties with countries that no longer exist.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The development of missile defenses today is technologically
and economically feasible. We can speak and act with confidence
in the world only when we can defend ourselves.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is interesting to note that public opinion polling
and focus groups indicate that most Americans are unaware that
the United States is unprotected from ballistic missile attack,
and believe this capability already exists. When they learn this
is not the case, they support national missile defense. President
Clinton did not mention the need to develop this defense capability
in his State of the Union speech. But as Ambassador Kirkpatrick
has said repeatedly, &quot;This is the most important issue in
defense policy for our times.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Bosnia</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As a candidate for the presidency more than three
years ago, Bill Clinton pledged to use air strikes and lift the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims so they could defend
themselves against Serb aggression. Instead, in recent testimony
before the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that &quot;more than two and
one half million have been displaced from their homes in this
war, more than 200,000 killed. Concentration camps, torture, mass
rape and mass murder have become familiar again in the region.&quot;
President Clinton's State of the Union assertion that &quot;we
stood for peace in Bosnia&quot; - while, as Ambassador
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> Kirkpatrick wrote, &quot;prisoners starved, young
men died, war and refugees spread across the country - is
shameless.&quot; Had President Clinton kept his campaign promise
to help the victims of aggression defend themselves, 25,000 U.S.
troops may not have had to spend this past Christmas enforcing
a tenuous peace agreement in Bosnia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Clinton's Use of Force</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton said that he has kept our military
strong, and has used force &quot;only where we must.&quot; But
as Ambassador Kirkpatrick has written, &quot;In truth, the Clinton
administration has not used force only when it must.&quot; In
Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, it used force when other policies would
have been equally or more effective, and the expressed goals for
these military interventions have not been achieved. &quot;A 'proud
nation' was not constructed in Somalia; 'democracy' was not restored
in Haiti; Bosnians were not protected from ethnic cleansing.&quot;
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>
Neglecting Major Powers</b><BR> 
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2>Ambassador Kirkpatrick also cites the Clinton administration's
neglect of relations with major powers. &quot;Here,&quot; she
writes, &quot;there is a sad contrast to the Bush administration,
which focused on building and enhancing US relations with Western
Europe, Japan, China, Russia. All these relations have now deteriorated.
The President - off in pursuit of unconventional goals - is
neglecting the store.&quot; </FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America and the Heritage Foundation recently
co-hosted the 1996 &quot;Congressional Advance&quot; for many
conservative freshman Members of the House of Representatives.
The Congressional Advance, held on January 25-26 in Baltimore,
marked the one-year anniversary of last year's Congressional Retreat,
which introduced the new conservative Members of Congress to Capitol
Hill. The Congressional Advance, like the Retreat, provided an
important forum to help the freshman Members plan the enactment
of a conservative agenda. Empower America CoDirector William Bennett
delivered the keynote address entitled &quot;The Republican Revolution:
The Next Steps.&quot; The conference also included panels on &quot;Government
Downsizing,&quot; &quot;Empowering Citizens,&quot; and &quot;Strengthening
America' s Families and Culture.&quot; More than fifty Members
of Congress attended the Advance, including several sophomore
Members of Congress.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Gallup Poll Finds Public Still Wants Tough Drug Control
Policy<BR>
</FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><i>According to a recent Gallup Poll, Americans still
view drug abuse as one of the most serious issues facing the country
in spite of decreasing public discussion by the media about the
&quot;war on drugs.&quot; Fully 94 percent of poll respondents
ranked the drug problem second only to violent crime. William
Bennett, former director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy (&quot;Drug Czar&quot;) under President George Bush, was
invited by the Gallup organization to review the polling results
and comment on their implications for public policy. His remarks follow.</i>

<center><FONT SIZE=2>Statement by</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>WILLIAM J. BENNETT</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>to accompany the release of the Gallup Poll</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>A 1996 VIEW OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IN AMERICA</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>December 12, 1995<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Toward the close of my tenure as Secretary of Education,
in a speech before the White House Conference on a Drug-Free 
America, I called for a &quot;transformation of government
policy to match, and build on, the transformation of public sentiment.&quot;
I was referring to the public' s recognition that drug use was
no longer considered harmless fun or mere self-indulgence, but
a personal, medical and economic catastrophe. That was in 1988,
and indeed we did continue to mount a strong offensive against
drugs throughout the Bush administration from 1989 to 1992 - with
real results. Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned
the drug war. But public sentiment, as this Gallup Poll attests,
has not changed. Americans still want a tough and decisive
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> drug control policy with the federal government rightfully
leading the fight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is no surprise that Gallup found more than nine
in ten Americans seriously concerned about drug abuse, and that
the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.
Americans should be concerned, because the news is bad; drug use
among adolescents is once again on the rise after the steady and
dramatic decline of the 1980s and early 1990s. According to the
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,
&quot;the jump in marijuana use among children 12 to 18 years...signals
that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their
lifetime. Of that number, about
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts.&quot;
More bad news is that drug related hospital emergency-room cases -
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts - have
reached the highest levels since 1978. Cocaine, heroin and marijuana
cases all have increased sharply to record levels.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>What Americans have witnessed - and reacted
to in the Gallup Poll - is the result of a failure of public
policy brought about by a moral torpor on the drug issue. Policy
follows attitude. But the public' s attitude is not one of indifference
toward the scourge. When asked what they wanted to see <i>a lot more</i>
of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law
enforcement and education of the young, and <i>two-thirds</i> cited reduction
of the supply of drugs coming into the United States. By contrast,
<i>fewer than 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>half</i> - 43 percent - asked for more treatment
programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The current policy of &quot;treatment on demand&quot;
presents a record of failure that is reflected in the weak support
it received in the Gallup Poll. Unlike the effective and modest
treatment programs sponsored by churches and using variants of
the 12-step method, thc government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly
wasteful and ineffective. From 1988 to 1994, federal drug treatment
spending almost tripled while the estimated number of treatment
slots actually declined. And the discouraging result is that overall
cocaine treatment is not significantly reducing the population
of hard core addicts. We must 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>turn our support toward the proven models of treatment,
while recognizing the harsh realities of cocaine and crack addiction
as yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use
by the young - the first step on the path to addiction - is
so important.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gallup Poll respondents put drug interdiction high
on their list - the percentage of those calling for increased
efforts to reduce the incoming supply of drugs into the U.S. was
88 percent. Those respondents are right - the government
should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of
illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control
over the entire interdiction</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> process. We know that strong interdiction works.
In 1989, the U.S. military followed Columbia's internal crack-down
on the cocaine cartels with the most extensive detection, tracking
and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from
the Andean countries north. These events 
produced substantial disruption in the cocaine supply
to the U.S. between 1989 and 1991. Drugs were less available on
the streets; cocaine-related emergency room cases declined; reported
cocaine deaths decreased; the estimated number of heavy users
fell; and casual use dropped dramatically. Today, U.S. foreign
policy no longer takes the drug problem seriously, and the once strong
military interdiction role has been abdicated. We need now to
restore our interdiction efforts and to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>More law enforcement efforts to punish and convict
people for the use 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>and sale of illegal drugs were endorsed by 83 percent
of the Gallup respondents. Even more forcefully, by 85 percent,
those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should
be legalized in America. The response is wise on both counts.
Law enforcement requires action at the federal, state and local
levels. The federal role requires 
the identification and dismantling of all major drug
trafficking organizations known to be operating in the U.S. Law
enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are state
and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should
be block granted without mandates.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The majority of respondents (85 percent) who oppose
legalization of drugs send a strong message to those who would
propose such an option. Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not
dangerous and threatening to society because they are illegal.
They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to
American society. Any relaxation 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>in standards of illegality would make drugs more
accessible, cheaper and morally permissible. On this issue there
has long been a great gap between a select few who favor legalization - and
the overwhelming body of the American people who reject such a
policy of despair. In the Gallup Poll, the people have again made
that point.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Success in the drug war depends above all on what
happens in America' s homes, classrooms, churches, voluntary associations,
television and movie screens, city streets and civic halls. It
depends on the efforts of parents, teachers, clergy, police chiefs,
judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush' s &quot;drug
czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made a point to
go where the problem was the worst and to visit and learn from
the people who made things better. I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is, we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Gallup organization has given us <i>A 1996 View
of The Drug Problem in America</i>. That view clearly shows that the
American people also understand what needs to be done and are
ready to renew the fight.</font>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>EA to Host Spring Candidate School<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Building on the success of EA's efforts in 1994 to
inform candidates for office about Empower America's political
message, EA Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William Bennett, and Jeane
Kirkpatrick invite 1996 candidates to join them in Washington,
DC on Monday, April 29 for Empower America's 1996 Candidate School.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Educating candidates for local, state and national
office is one of EA's most important functions. While most candidate
schools concentrate on the nuts and bolts of running for office,
Empower America's training is devoted entirely to a discussion
of issues and their philosophical and political foundations. The
EA messages of economic opportunity, cultural renewal and international
leadership are stressed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the day-long event, a variety of political
instructors will address the attendees:
individual leaders, policy experts, political
analysts and elected officials. EA will bring together the best
thinkers and the best ideas to help each candidate form a solid
base of information and craft a winning message. Another valuable
component of the sessions is to learn from participating candidates
about issues and concerns being raised by citizens in their districts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As in 1994, Empower America will prepare a detailed
candidate briefing book for all participants, and will make the
book available to candidates who are unable to attend.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994 Empower America worked with candidates for
office ranging from local school boards to the U.S. Senate. &quot;Graduates&quot;
include some of the leading &quot;revolutionaries&quot; of the
104th Congress - Congressmen Joe Scarborough (FL), Bob Barr
(GA), Ron Lewis (KY), Dick Chrysler (MI), Phil English (PA) and
Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee. Jack Kemp, William Bennett
and Jean Kirkpatrick look forward to exchanging ideas with the
1996 candidates who want to become better informed about Empower
America' s policy agendas.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For further information, write: Candidate School,
Empower America, 1776 I St., NW, Washington, DC 20006, or call
202-452-8200, or 1-800-761-2044. </FONT>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>Campaign Tackles Trash TVTalk Shows<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ads aimed at shows' advertisers having effect<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the past several months, Empower America Co-director
William Bennett has been involved in a public campaign with Senators
Joe Lieberman (D-CT) and Sam Nunn (D-GA) to focus scrutiny on
certain 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>daytime television talk shows. The campaign has resonated
strongly with the American people, many of whom have contacted
Empower America to express their relief that someone has finally
given voice to the concerns they have about the filth paraded
on television.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Consider the subjects discussed on a number of talk
shows during the past year, according to <i>Electronic Media </i>(April, 1995):
a l3 year old discussing her sexual experiences which began when
she was 10; a male guest admitting to sleeping with his girlfriend's
mother; a woman claiming to have been impregnated while making
a 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>pornographic movie; or the following titles: &quot;Sex
Caught on Tape,&quot; and &quot;I'm Marrying a 14-year Old Boy.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Clearly, shows such as these cross the line of decency.
They celebrate the perverse, and they normalize trashy behavior.
The campaign against trash television is based on the premise
that companies should stop their support of this kind of demeaning,
degrading content. And if they continue their support, they should
be able to justify publicly what they are doing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The campaign has had a number of different components.
Dr. Bennett and Senator Lieberman have written letters to the
heads of major corporations - Sony, Tribune, Time Warner,
National Amusements, King World, Gannett - which own the
companies that produce the shows, asking them to reconsider their
support of trash television, and questioning whether profits these
companies derive from such degrading, valueless products are really
worth it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In addition, advertisers have been targeted
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>for their support of trash talk television.
On December 7, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman and Nunn unveiled
a television ad calling on major advertisers to stop sponsoring
cultural rot, and asking them to reconsider
their support of these programs. There are
indications that some of them already have: Sears Roebuck, Unilever
NV, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Mars Inc. have said they are withdrawing
advertising from some of these programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>And on January 22, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman
and Nunn called on the owners of local stations to use their influence
to take the trash out of talk TV, with an open letter that ran
in the daily newsletter of the annual conference of the National
Association of Television Program Executives (NATPE).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since the campaign began, we've had evidence from
a number of quarters that the tide is turning. Not only have some
advertisers pulled out, but a number of shows have been canceled.
Several station managers in 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>California and in Colorado have decided to discontinue
airing shows they deem unacceptable. And a January poll by <i>Broadcasting
&amp; Cable</i> of TV general managers shows that 83 percent agree
that talk shows are purveyors of &quot;sleazy, tasteless subject
matter with little if any redeeming value.&quot; And the new shows
being offered up for next year focus less on sensationalism.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Viewers also have a responsibility. Instead of simply
lamenting the debased state of our popular culture, citizens need
to take action. While turning off these shows, or requesting companies
to 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>stop producing this kind of material won't eradicate
all of the garbage on our television screens, it will make an
important step toward relegating this trash to the sidelines,
and out of the mainstream. And so the campaign continues to petition
men and women of good will - viewers, sponsors, producers - to
do something about it. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There are obviously better things to do with
our time. Look, we all hear these commencement speeches and we
all give nice talks and say, we need to pay some attention to
civility, we need to pay some attention to some respect, we need
to have more respect for peoples' privacy. Here is indecent exposure
as a virtue. And it used to be the fact that if you had failures
in your life, it was something that you were quiet about, or you
confessed to an all knowing, or an all forgiving God. Now, you
get a ticket to get on one of these shows and scream.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We laid out a philosophical framework for revising
the tax code for the twenty-first century. And we suggested quite
specifically that the tax rate should be a single rate with a
large exemption for low-income people to remove the burden that
a woman or man would face as they take the first two or three
rungs in the ladder. And we came out specifically for the deduction
of the payroll tax, which is a huge burden on working men and
women throughout this country. That's to make the system fairer.&quot;

<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America is making an impact! In this important
political year, when American citizens and candidates will be
participating in the long process which will culminate in the
selection of America's president and Congress, Empower America's
ideas and issues have become an essential part of the debate.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Whether the issue is a flatter, fairer tax; crime,
drugs and television trash talk shows; or U.S. military forces
in Bosnia and the need for national missile defense - Empower
America's ideas are shaping the agenda. We urge Empower America
Associates to get even more involved in the days ahead. There
is so much to be done, and each of you has an important role to
play.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Re-ordering the size and scope of government in our
nation and in our lives is an immense project. By attending your
local town meetings, writing letters to your elected representatives
and the editor of your local newspaper, calling in on radio talk
shows, meeting with your neighbors and discussing the issues,
you can make sure that your concerns and your ideas are heard.
And by doing so, you demonstrate the most fundamental tenet of
our shared beliefs: that individual citizens, not government,
are responsible for setting the nation's priorities and deciding
how best they are met.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We have never been better positioned to make a difference.
In January 1996, Empower America celebrated its third birthday.
In this short time, we have established an organization unlike
any in Washington today. The energy, commitment and involvement
of Empower America's Co-Directors and grassroots Associates have
made us a formidable team. Like you, Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and
Jeane Kirkpatnck share a positive vision of America's future.
Our shared belief in economic growth and opportunity, social and
cultural renewal, and strong international leadership can lead
a vibrant Amenca into the twenty-first century and the information
age.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Your continued involvement and commitment are essential.
and we are grateful for your support and activism.<BR>

VOL. 3 NO. 2, FALL 1995 
<P>
<H3>"Beyond the Contract: The Next Steps"</H3>
Speech by Rep. Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House
</CENTER>
<p>
MAY 9,1995, WASHINGTON, DC-- This is V-E Day, and there is a parallel about which we need to be aware. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that our generation has a rendezvous with destiny. He was referring to dealing with Italy, Japan and Germany. That generation ultimately, reluctantly, rose to that challenge, driven in part by Pearl Harbor, and ultimately succeeded.
<p>
We then had a rendezvous with destiny in containing the Soviet empire until it collapsed. For 45 years we did that. We led the largest worldwide coalition in history, and we sustained forces against the Soviet empire far longer than anybody thought a democracy could. So we've won two enormous victories on the world scene in the last two generations.
<p>
The surprising thing, I think, is that our current rendezvous with destiny is here at home. We have to renew American civilization because if it continues to decay, we will literally be incapable of being effectivein the world and the world market.
<p>
The situation is very grave. It is obvious to all of you if you watch any local television news anywhere in the country, that we have a level of violence, a level of decay, a level of brutality which is not sustainable in a free society. I've often said that you can't maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies, with 15-yearolds killing each other, with 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, with 18-yearolds getting diplomas they can't even read. And all four of those things are happening in our country.
<p>
There is much more to do. For starters, we will be building on the success of the Contract. We adopted the Contract last summer and fall. We stood on the Capitol steps in September and introduced it to the American people; then we based our campaigns on it. We ran a TV Guide ad that had no negatives, no attack on Bill Clinton and no antiDemocratic rhetoric. It just said, "Give us a chance, here's what we'll do," and outlined the Contract With America. We then got elected.
<p>
Starting the opening day, we kept our word. We passed nine reforms in a 14 hour opening day--the longest in United States history. We continued keeping our word. We brought up every item we said we would. We passed 30 out of 31 items. The only legislative item we lost from the Contract was term limits, where we got 85 percent voting "yes" from the Republican side, 82 percent voting "no" on the Democratic side, and because term limits require a Constitutional majority of 290, we couldn't get it to pass. In the first 93 days, we had a total of 302 recorded votes.
<p>
We're now looking at "where do we go from here?" I think the answer lies in three large projects at the vision level, and then, nine strategies. Let me very briefly run through these visions and strategies:
<p>
We have three major things we have to do. We've got to communicate to the American people that there is an American future that's better--better economic growth, better technology, better services, better opportunities, better safety--and we want to work with the American people to get to that better future.
<p>
Second, we have to have a dialogue. I think it's very important for us to go beyond just debating liberals. We have to have a dialogue with the American people. We have to get people engaged and talking about their future.
<p>
Out of that new vision of a successful America, and new dialogue with the American people, we want to establish a new partnership. Remember, this is not government-to-citizen, this is citizentocitizen. The Constitution begins, "We, the people of the United States," and what we've got to do is go back and reestablish that as a reality in everyone's life.
<p>
I also believe that if our children are going to compete in the world market they have to do a whole lot more homework than they've been doing. My guess is they've got to do probably two hours a night. I think we literally cheat them if they don't have enough homework to learn how to study, to acquire the information they must have in order to compete with Germany, Japan and China. However, I do not suggest that that means we need a "Federal Department of Homework Checkers." Instead, we need to reestablish a partnership where we expect parents to care about their children's education, and we make that a standard and a routine expectation.
<p>
This is why I believe that what we're doing is as much a cultural change as it is a political change. We are reasserting the core of American civilization. The road there is made up of nine strategies.
<p>
First, we have to renew American civilization. That means reasserting the work ethic, family, savings--all the core values that started with the notion that we're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. Remember that is the most radical statement of human rights in history--that power comes from God to you, and then you loan it to the government. The power doesn't come from God to the government.
<p>
Second, we need to be competitive in the world market. We get high economic growth by reestablishing a system in which entrepreneurs are encouraged to go out and compete, in which there are enough savings, and in which we're prepared to create American jobs through world sales. To do that we have to rethink litigation, regulation, taxation, education, the welfare system, and the bureaucratic structure of government, because we are not a competitive society today. If we want our children to have the best jobs on the planet with the highest take-home pay, it's going to take real effort.
<p>
Third, we have to accelerate moving into the information age. The fact is there are extraordinary opportunities out there, and we are doing too little to take advantage of them.
<p>
The fourth strategic change we need is to replace the welfare state with the opportunity society. We can design a volunteercentered, spiritually-centered replacement for the welfare state that dramatically improves the life of the poor. Every time you hear a liberal jump up to defend the current-system, just remember that what they're telling you is that they are prepared to use the children as the device to keep the bureaucracy. It is inexcusable what we do to poor children in the inner city. We have to replace the welfare state with an opportunity society.
<p>
Fifth, we have to decentralize power and disperse power. They are two different things. Decentralization gets it out of Washington; dispersing it gets it back to you. Ultimately, block grants are, in my mind, a first step toward a dramatic degovernmentalizing of America. One of the reasons we were so strongly for the $500 child tax credit was to make the flat assertion: "parents who earn it have a higher claim than bureaucrats who want to spend it," and that we want the money to stay with the parents, not go to a bureaucracy. That's a very different model of how you organize America.
<p>
Sixth, for the parts of government that we do keep, I think they should be the best in the world. I think our principle ought to be that if you're going to have a federal government it ought to be excellent. I am not anti-government. I think we need a lean, effective government. What we have today is a big, fat, sloppy, ineffective and weak government, incapable of setting priorities and incapable of doing well the things government should focus on.
<p>
Seventh, we should balance the budget. It is a practical matter, and I can give you the simple moral test. For most of American history we paid off the family mortgage and we left the children the farm. In this generation, we're gradually selling off the farm and leaving the children the mortgage. A child born this year will pay $187,000 in taxes in their lifetime, just to pay interest on the federal debt, that is $3,500 per working year just to pay interest. Interest on the debt will be larger than the cost of national security in 1997. That gives you some sense of scale. More and more, your taxes will go to pay interest to the bond-holders than will go to pay for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, intelligence agencies, and defense bureaucracies combined. Now, that is not sustainable, which is why I think we do have a profound challenge to balance the budget.
<p>
In addition, Medicare has its own freestanding problems. The Clinton Administration's Medicare Trustees reported that Medicare literally runs out of money by 2002. And when you look further into the future to when the baby boomers retire, it's dramatically worse. We have the challenge to be prepared to implement the reforms that are necessary to save Medicare now, and then to have a commission which will look at how you save Medicare in the baby boom years, which is a massively bigger challenge than trying to save it now.
<p>
Eighth, I think we have to have a strategy of safety for the American people. If your government can't protect you, then you have no constitutional liberties. We have an obligation to reassert and reestablish the legitimate right of every citizen, that they ought to be able to live without fear in a safe country which loves its children enough to protect them from the predators who right now dominate all too many of our streets.
<p>
Lastly, we have to have a strategy for leading the planet. We are the only country large enough, complex enough and strong enough to lead the human race. If in fact we allow our culture to collapse and our economy to decay, there is nobody who can replace us. If we can't do the first eight things in order to set ourselves up to be able to lead, and we collapse as leaders, you will in fact, I think, leave your children a dark and bloody planet. In that sense I think Chechnya and Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia are harbingers of the kind of future that could come if America grows weaker.
<p>
I think over the last couple of years that Empower America has been a very helpful part of this. I think that it really has given us a range of ideas. There is a whole series of things we've done over the last couple of years that I think have been very, very helpful. We can continue building this momentum; we need as many voices and as many systems out there as we can get that are educating, encouraging, and pushing in the same general direction. And so I appreciate very, very much the chance to be here with you today, and I thank you all very much for coming.

<H3>Empower America's Victory Against Time Warner</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America has scored an important victory on the cultural front. For the past several months, William J. Bennett, Co-director of Empower America, and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women, have been involved in a public campaign against offensive and misogynistic music Iyrics. They have targeted their efforts on Time Warner, one of the greatest perpetrators of this kind of cultural filth. This spring, Time Warner increased its investment in "gangsta rap" by expanding its stake to 50 percent of Interscope Records, the label behind such artists as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre, Nine Inch Nails, and Tupac Shakur. Such "artists" extol the rape, murder, and torture of women. Some of these Iyrics glorify sexual abuse and even celebrate the murder of police officers. Columnist John Leo called Time Warner's investment "the cultural equivalent of owning half the world's mustard gas factories."
<p>
As a result, Bennett and Tucker called on Time Warner's sense of corporate responsibility and citizenship to end their sDonsorshiD of such music. They asked Time Warner to stop producing music which was unworthy of human consumption or corporate support.
<p>
In May, Bennett and Tucker met with Time Warner executives to present their case. At that time, their appeal fell on deaf ears. Bennett and Tucker then expanded their efforts to include a television ad, press conferences in New York and Los Angeles, as well as radio and television programs. In addition, Dr. Bennett wrote to Gerald Levin, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and both Tucker and Bennett wrote letters to members of the Board of Directors of Time Warner, informing them of the kind of music Time Warner was involved in producing and distributing. In June, Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) joined Tucker and Bennett in a radio ad and press conference calling on Time Warner to exercise corporate responsibility.
<p>
The campaign has had strong resonance with the American public. The New York Times, The Wall Street Joumal, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Time, and Newsweek have all covered the story. Political figures from both parties, including President Clinton, and Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, have voiced their support for Empower America's efforts.
<p>
On September 27, Time Warner announced that it planned to sever its ties with Interscope Records, selling its 50% stake back to Interscope founders Ted Field and Jimmy Lovine--an indication that shame and a call to corporate responsibility do work. Dr. Bennett applauded Time Warner's decision, and said that the company was "acting like a leader" in its decision to sell Interscope. Said Bennett, "I congratulate them, they did the right thing. I hope this is a statement about a larger point--that there are some things so bad that no responsible company will market and sell them to our children."
<p>
Empower America will continue to monitor the fate of Interscope, to see which music company, if any decides to purchase it. If other major companies pick up Interscope, they will hear from us. We will continue to press our case against corporations which peddle filth as entertainment for children.

<H3>EA Letter To Our Readers</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
The level of change effected in the first session of the 104th Congress has been unprecedented. Members passed more bills and worked more hours than during any previous congress. The battle over the size of the federal budget and the scale of Washington's bureaucracy is being won by those who would cut the size and scope of government.
<p>
This coongress accomplished policy goals that the cynics and skeptics dismissed as impossible. Nine of the ten components of "The Contract with America" passed the House of Representatives during the first hundred days of the 104th Congress and were sent to the Senate for consideration. Many of those measures have now passed the
<p>
Senate, while others continue to move through the legislative process under the guidance of those who understand the rightful limits of federal power.
<p>
The majority of members elected in November, especially those serving their first term, are committed to the empowerment agenda. They believe that individuals --not the federal government--should make the choices that affect their own lives. They know that high taxes hurt families and businesses at all income levels.
<p>
We have many friends in Congress, but we must remain active. This puts us in a position to get things done. We are working with individuals who understand the ideas that are important to us and who can act to promote them.<p>

Continue to write your representatives in Congress. Attend local town meetings and other events that allow you to meet with your representatives and articulate your views on national issues. This focal point of American politics allows you to become active in the governing process at the grassroots level.
<p>
We greatly appreciate your continued support and activism.
<P>
Charles Kupperman
<br><i>Executive Director</i>

<H3>Empower America On The Hill</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Co-directors and board members have-been busy and active with the new Congress. We have been working with the Congressional leadership since January of 1993 to advocate the principles we represent. The new 104th Congress has provided us with a heightened opportunity to work for change. Our Co-directors and board members have tes fied before numerous Congressional committees promoting the empowerment agenda. Following are some highlights from the testimonies of Jeanne Kirkpatrick, William Bennett, and Jack Kemp.
<p>
<b>Jeanne Kirkpatrick:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick spoke to the House Foreign Relations Committee on January 24, 1995 about "National Security and International Affairs in the Context of Cooperation and Limitation." She was one of the select foreign policy experts chosen to give remarks on stability and instability in the international arena, and policy directives America should pursue.
<p>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said, "I believe this Congress and the National Security Revitalization Act have arrived just in the nick of time. Our military forces are beginning to 'go hollow,' and are feeling the full impact of schedules and budgets which have left them over-deployed and undertrained, overworked and underpaid."
<p>
<b>William Bennett:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director William Bennett testified several times before the new Congress. Of particular interest were his remarks to the United States Senate Budget Committee on January 24, 1995. His testimony was in regard to the topic, "Governing in the 21st Century." The new Congress has the opportunity to change the role and enormous size of the federal government, which Dr. Bennett strongly advocates in part through a "radical devolution" of decision-making.
<p>
Dr. Bennett told the committee, ":..it is critical to take a step back and establish once again a clear delineation of government's role. We need to articulate once again the proper responsibilities and limits of government--things like providing for the defense of the nation, waging war, building infrastructure projects, administering transfer payments, keeping the streets safe, and the like."
<p>
<b>Jack Kemp:</b>
<p>
Jack Kemp testified before the Senate Small Business Committee on October 19th in support of Senators Abraham and Lieberman's enterprise zone bill. The bill, entitled "The Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act of 1995," is closely patterned after Kemp's -bill from the 80's.
<p>
i In his testimony, Kemp pointed out, "How can we possibly begin to address the problems of crime, drugs, and education without first recognizing that without jobs and opportunity, there is little hope and few reasons to graduate from school, stay off drugs, and resist the underground economy? Without the expectation that there is a good job waiting out of college or high school, there will be no link between effort and reward, and no way to address fully the social pathologies that are all too prevalent in our inner cities."
<p>
Kemp went on to say that "over the past several years, the federal government has created an economic climate in America that is indifferent at best, and hostile at worst, to the agents of economic growth. Washington now imposes a vast array of income taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, regulations, and mandated benefits that encourage businesses to keep employees to an absolute minimum. Today, the combined tax and regulatory burden on risktaking-- the process by which new enterprises and jobs are created-- has climbed to the levels of the early 1980s."

<H3>Kemp Heads National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp was chosen to chair the newly formed <a href="http://www.townhall.com/taxcom/">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich appointed Kemp to lead the eight member commission in proposing a new economic pratform.
<p>
The goals of the new commission are ambitious and sweeping. Senator Dole charged the commission with moving "beyond tax reform toward a complete overhaul of the entire tax system." He added, "that's why we have asked Jack to reexamine the entire 4,000 page federal tax code... to start with a blank piece of paper." Kemp promised that the commission will focus on "reforming our tax code, restoring incentives to entrepreneurial capitalism, lowering tax rates, helping create jobs, and assisting low-income persons escape the conditions of poverty and welfare dependency."
<p>
In this effort, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform will design, and push for the passage of, an alternative tax system that is fairer, flatter, and simpler. Speaker Gingrich noted that Kemp and the commission will "reach out to all of the presidential candidates, to all of the Republican governors, to all of the members of the House and Senate, to corporate America, and to the American people to put together the kind of reforms that are vital."
<p>
Both Dole and Gingrich asserted that naming Kemp to chair the commission carried both symbolic and practical significance. Speaker Gingrich asserted that "it is clear that there is a yearning in America for a very profound rethinking of the tax code, and Jack Kemp is the one to provide that type of leadership, having given President Reagan the Kemp-Roth tax cut of 1981." Dole added, "For over two decades Jack has been one of our most innovative thinkers on economic policy. No one can speak to these issues more creatively and more credibly."
<p>
The commission will issue a final report at the end of 1995--in time for the 1996 presidential primaries.

<H3>A Fairer, Simpler 21st Century Single Tax Rate System</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Recent polling shows almost twothirds of all Americans are interested in replacing the current income tax system with a single rate tax system which would require all American citizens and businesses to pay one, simple, low tax rate--around 17 percent.
<p>
Today, American economic policy is a mess. The tax code is now more than 5 million words long, understood by few, and oppressive to all. Washington's 60,000 pages of federal regulations further stifle entrepreneurial spirit while government spending remains out of control. The bottom line is lethargic economic growth and the loss of opportunity for millions of Americans.
<p>
The tax increases in the budget acts of 1990 and 1993 reversed the trend toward lower tax rates and fewer federal regulations that spurred the unprecedented growth and job creation of the 1980s. To put the tax code in perspective, it is worthwhile to look at how much the average family of four pays in taxes. In 1950, the typical middleincome family paid about 2 percent of its income in federal taxes. By 1993, that amount had increased to about 24 percent of income.
<p>
The only thing more costly to America than its tax system is its system of federal regulations. Experts estimate that these regulations cost Americans nearly $1 trillion a year.
<p>
The U.S. spends more money on its federal government than all other countries, except Japan, spend on their entire economies. In 1950, federal spending was about 16 percent of total gross domestic output. Today it has ballooned to 23 percent of GDP.
<p>
Taxes, regulations, and spending have produced an economy with anemic growth, slow job creation, and hindered entrepreneurship, and one in which the American Dream is not yet secure for enough of our people. Since the current economic recovery began, GDP growth has averaged just 2.4 percent in real terms, less than half the 5 percent growth rate usually associated with recoveries.
<p>
Job creation has lagged even further behind, increasing by only 3 percent instead of the average 9 percent recovery.
<p>
There is a straightforward way to deal with taxes, regulations, and spending-- the single rate tax system. The need to address all of these concerns is precisely what has piqued the American public's and Congress' interest in this revolutionary idea.

<H3>EA Brochure Lets You Make Federal Budget Cuts</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Washington, DC--Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp, along with Rep. Steve Largent (R-OK) and other members of the House Budget Committee, unveiled Empower America's new brochure on the budget process, entitled "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget."
<p>
Described by Largent as "a great way for people to become better informed about the budget process and to see for themselves what it is like to balance the budget," the brochure includes a worksheet which outlines current budgetary expenditures. Readers are also invited to enter their own numbers in an effort to develop a balanced budget reflecting their priorities.
<p>
Both the House and Senate have passed plans that would bring the federal budget into balance over a seven-year period, by slowing the rate of growth in many federal programss and targeting many others for elimination--those that are outdated or duplicative.
<p>
The share of the federal debt held by every man woman and child today totals over $18,500. Without fundamental change, children born today will pay nearly $200,000 over their lifetime in taxes to sustain the interest on the debt, and face a total tax rate (for all local, state, and federal spending) of 84 percent of their earnings over their lifetime, according to calculations in President Clinton's own budget.
<p>
Once the federal budget is balanced, for the first time since 1969, the government will be able to pay off its debt, which has grown over the 219 years of our history to nearly $5 trillion this year.
<p>
If you are interested in receiving your own copy of Empower America' s brochure, "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget," to discover how the process works, and make your own choices, then please send your request to Empower America at 1776 I Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Leadership Council's Conference Forum</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Leadership Council held its second Conference Forum in early May. One hundred members attended the day and a half conference set against the backdrop of our nation's capitol. Focusing on the state of the 104th Congress, "The Contract with America," and the future of our government, the conference's main objectives were to inform, enlighten, and empower its participants.
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick kicked off the formal program with a dinner address titled, "Beyond the Contract: Foreign and Domestic." In her remarks, Ambassador Kirkpatrick outlined the position that the United States government has taken on several foreign policy issues, her thoughts on those policies, the future of our government, and the changes that are necessary to ensure maximum peace and protection for the world.
<p>
The next day was packed with various speeches and discussions. Breakfast keynote speaker Co-director Bill Bennett remarked on the cultural impact of "The Contract with America," as well as giving his thoughts on the upcoming presidential election. Following Dr. Bennett, Senators Connie Mack (R-FL) and John Ashcroft (R-MO), and Congressmen John Boehner (R-OH) and Chris Cox (R-CA) shared their experiences and insight on the phenomenal first one hundred days of the Senate and House. 
<p>Two freshmen members of the House, Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS), spoke about being part of a freshman class which retains the same hope and enthusiasm that they had when the 104th session of Congress began. Perhaps the most anticipated speaker of the day was the Speaker of the House and Empower America Board Member, Newt Gingrich. Speaker Gingrich, introduced by Co-director Jack Kemp, eloquently argued that "our rendezvous with destiny is here at home." He illustrated this point with his three vision levels and nine strategies for Congress to follow up 'The Contract with America."
<p>
The sessions and speeches successfully wrapped up with an inside look at the work of pollsters and their influence on elections. As the day drew to a close, Council Members were invited for a private tour of the Capitol.

<H3>Empower America Pushes the Single Rate Tax System In New Hampshire</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America continued its ad campaign advocating a low, single rate tax system by running radio spots in New Hampshire. Since the 1996 presidential race begins in New Hampshire, Empower America wanted to produce a radio spot that would influence the debate on the single rate system. William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber have been strong proponents of a low single rate, and hope their efforts will influence the 104th Congress, and the presidential hopefuls.
<p>
William Bennett was the voice behind the message Empower America sent to the people of New Hampshire. The 60 second radio ad ran 88 times on five news and talk radio stations in New Hampshire.

First, I want to express my thanks to Senator Joe Lieberman. Senator Lieberman is the father of this idea. It was his suggestion that we continue to bring pressure--public pressure--on the perpetrators of cultural rot by calling attention to these shows.
<p>
Earlier this year, Senator Lieberman joined C. DeLores Tucker of the National Political Congress of Black Women and me in our campaign to urge Time Warner to sell their stake in Interscope Records, Inc. Today, we turn our attention to television. Now these days there is a lot of criticism directed at television--the casual cruelty, the rampant promiscuity, the mindlessness of sit-coms and soap operas. Most of the criticisms are justified. But this is not the worst of it. The worst of television is the day-time television talk shows we have identified. In these shows, indecent exposure is celebrated as a virtue.
<p>
It is hard to remember now, but there was once a time when personal or marital failure, subliminal desires, and perverse taste were accompanied by guilt or embarrassment. But today, these conditions are a ticket to appear as a guest on the Sally Jessy Raphael show, the Ricki Lake show, the Jerry Springer show, or one of the dozen or so like them.
<p>
I asked my staff to provide me with a list of some of the shows of some recent day-time talk-show topics. The list included "A Mother Who Ran Off with Her Daughter's Fiance," "Women Who Marry Their Rapists," "I'm Marrying a 14-year-old Boy," a woman who claims she got pregnant while making a pornographic movie; a 13-year-old guest who was urged to share her sexual experiences which began when she was 10; a woman eight months pregnant who boasted of having eight sexual partners during her first two trimesters; a 17-year-old girl who boasted of having slept with over a hundred men--well, you get the idea.

<p>
It is important here to point out who we are not talking about. We are not talking about shows like Oprah, or Regis and Kathie Lee. The shows which are the object of our criticisms are not close calls; they go way over the line of decency. They are at the bottom of the television barrel. Instead of simply lamenting the state of our popular culture, we think it's a good idea to try and do something about it. So here we are.
<p>
Our objectives are these: to raise a hue and cry across the land; to cast some light on what's being produced and distributed --"Sunlight is the best disinfectant," Justice Brandeis once wrote--and to petition men and women of good will--producers, sponsors, advertisers, and viewers --to rethink their support and sponsorship, participation and promotion of these programs.
<p>
What exactly is the harm being done by these programs? In his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. instructed us that that which "uplifts human personality" is just and that which "degrades human personality" is unjust. Can anybody doubt that these shows degrade human personality? Do the sponsors think not? If so, why not?
<p>
Let me try and put this campaign in a broader context of the state of our popular culture, our country, and our civilization.
<p>
What is happening today is the pollution of the human environment, a kind of tropism toward the sordid. This nation desperately needs more opportunities for moral uplift. We believe that progress can be made through moral suasion and justifiable public discontent.
<p>
In a fundamental way, that is what this effort and efforts like it are all about. So today we declare ourselves to be part of a Resistance, a Resistance Operation to the giant popular culture sleaze machine. We welcome more volunteers to our ranks.<p>

Let me conclude with a personal note. Joe Lieberman is a Jew. I am a Catholic. Like most Americans, we believe in God; we both believe men and women are His creation, made in His image. And so we believe that men and women should not be celebrated when they debase themselves. <P>

<li>"Early deployment of an anti-ballistic missile defense system ... is the only way the U.S. government can fulfill its constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense. If we start now, immediately, and work as rapidly and well as possible, we may achieve an operationally effective missile defense in time to prevent a tragedy."

<p>
<li>"I'm here to defend the idea that the [tax] rates ought to come down, that it will be flatter, fairer, simpler; they've got to be lower across the board on labor and capital, the factors of production, and we ought to raise revenue for government and not try to redistribute the wealth of America. I don't think that is the purpose of the tax code--the tax code from time immemorial was to raise revenue and reduce the burden on those least able to bear that burden. And frankly, all of our plans--or all of 'the' plans are going to be judged on that basis. Does it raise revenue? Is it efficient for the economy and does it remove the burden on those least able to bear that burden?"
<br>
<b>Jack Kemp,<br> 
CNBC Inside Opinion, July 20,1995</b>
<p>

<li>"Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education and White House Drug Czar, may have just won his biggest political victory: According to The New York Times, Time Warner is trying to sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records, the home of socalled gangsta rap...."
<p>
He and Mrs. Tucker both took their concerns directly to Time Warner, where they argued that distributing albums that glorify violence, murder and the abuse of women is fundamentally immoral. Instead of wielding political power against Time Warner, Mr. Bennett and Ms. Tucker brought moral authority to bear: They sharned Time Warner executives, both in private and in public....
<p>
This success should be a paradigm for culture warriors.... Culture cannot be dictated from Washington, it is a matter of millions of personal choices made by millions of people every day. Moral persuasion can affect those personal choices in a way that laws and regulations can't. Snoop Doggy Dogg may not be particularly open to suasion, but if the corporation that made millions off of him is able to rethink its place in the market, and maybe figure out how to make millions of a less noxious product, there is hope.<br>

<b>"Culture War Victory"<br>

<p>
<li>"It is significant that today nobody--nobody--is willing to defend the current welfare system. And for good reason; it is a complete wreck. After thirty years, we have finally reached a consensus that much of the anti-poverty strategy of the 60s arid 70s has failed--and failed horribly. Poverty today is more widespread, more deeply entrenched and more pathological than it was three decades, and $5 trillion, ago.... It is time to encourage poverty fighting-efforts that are both compassionate and effective, rather than maintaining a system that is neither."<br>

<H3>The Battle for School Choice in Milwaukee</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Milwaukee has long been the standardbearer for the school choice movement. In 1990, the nation's only government-funded school choice program was enacted in Milwaukee. And in early 1995, Governor Tommy Thompson submitted an expansion plan of the program, which allowed students to redeem vouchers at religious as well as non-religious schools. The plan was approved and passed by the legislature as part of the 1995-97 state budget bill. However, on August 25, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued an injunction barring the state from paying tuition for students attending private religious schools until the court rules on whether it is constitutional. Several hundred children had already begun classes as participants in the voucher program. As a result, Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE) set up an emergency fund to provide funds for children for the school year.
<p>
Empower America Co-director William J. Bennett traveled to Milwaukee to affirm his support for school choice, and for a program that allows parents to choose either religious or non-religious private schools for their children. Said Dr. Bennett, "This moment in Milwaukee is probably the breakthrough point. This is the beachhead." Bennett toured St. Matthew's, an elementary school participating in the choice program, and was a guest on Charles Sykes' radio program on WTMJ-AM (620). Bennett was joined by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and by another former education secretary. They then held a press conference praising the expanded program at Messmer High School, an independent Catholic school. Dr. Bennett summed up the objective of the school choice movement: "This is not an anti-public school effort. This is a pro-good school effort ... Good public schools have nothing to fear from school choice."

<H3>Empower America Sets Conservative Agenda</H3>
<P>
<I>Baltimore Conference Launches 104th Congress</I>
<P>
BALTIMORE, MD: In this city, an hour's drive north of Washington,
DC, three&#171;busy days of seminars, workshops, discussion sessions
(and a bit of speechmaking) in early December brought home the
latest example of how the political landscape of America has changed.
<P>
Previously, under the control of the Democrat House leadership,
only one institution, the Kennedy School of Government in Boston,
had run freshman orientation for incoming members of Congress.
This monopoly had lasted for over
 twenty years. New members would 
have to travel to Massachusetts to actually I 
participate, and topics were often narrow 
and unambitious.
<P>
But in 1994, the Boston organization had to cancel its program
due to lack of interest, since the vast majority of newly-elected 
House freshmen chose to attend an orientation program organized
by Empower America and the Heritage Foundation.
<P>
Held December 811 at the Radisson Plaza in Baltimore, MD, the
conference drew 
a majority of the Republican members- elect, as well as a couple
of their Democrat counterparts. This high energy gathering demonstrated
that the incoming Republican majority plans to hit the ground
running to deliver the real change America endorsed on November
8.
<P>
The days were packed with programs and presentations designed
to supplement incoming members' knowledge of issues they'll face
in the 104th Congress, as well as highlighting dramatic, conservative
alternatives to 30 years of Great Society philosophy. Nearly 50
conservative experts in all major issues of domestic and foreign
policy attended.
<P>
New members took the lead in debating innovative alternatives
on issues such as welfare reform, crime, defense and farm policy.
They also worked to plan legislative strategy and tactics on reforming
Congress, strengthening America's health care system, tackling
the over regulation that the Federal government imposes on states
and individuals, and limiting congressional terms.
<P>
They discussed how to draw on the new conservative majority in
the country to construct coalitions necessary to effect change
in Washington. And how to balance their professional obligations
with the needs of their families, so that families will always
come first.
<P>
All five of Empower America's co-directors, Lamar Alexander, Bill
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber spoke at the
conference and participated in smallgroup meetings, sharing advice
and insights which they hoped would be valuable to the attendees,
both personally and professionally.
<P>
One of the orientation's highlights came at its conclusion, with
an address by radio/TV talkshow host Rush Limbaugh- whom many
of the freshman credit, in part, with their victory. According
to Bill Bennett, Limbaugh is &quot;a symbol of encouragement.
He's a pretty reasonable read on what a lot of America thinks.
Rush is a way conservatives know that they're not idiosyncratic.&quot;
To express their appreciation, the freshmen voted to make Limbaugh
an honorary member of their incoming class.
<P>
Limbaugh was quick to return the compliment. 
 &quot;I am in awe of you,&quot; Limbaugh told them, &quot;You took the risks.
You are the ones who engaged the opposition ... You actually went
out and did the work.

<P>
<H3>Grassroots, With Message of Change, Made Difference at Ballot Box</H3>
<P>


Political observers are calling what happened on November 8th
a &quot;tsunami.&quot;
<P>
In Japan, that' s the word for tidal wave. In America, that's
the term for the overwhelming victory conservatives gained at
the federal, state, and local level in 1994's midterm elections.
<P>
Beginning in January, Republicans will control both Houses of
Congress for the first time since 1954. In the U.S. Senate, the
margin will be 5347, a gain of nine seats. All 11 Senate freshmen
will be Republicans. In the U.S. House, Republicans picked up
52 seats, for a 230-204 edge, with one independent. Of the 86-member
freshman class, 73 are Republicans.
<P>
For the first time since 1970, Republicans also have the lion's
share of governors' mansions. They'll control 30 governorships,
in states with 70 percent of the U.S. population.
<P>
But the victories weren't just wide, they were deep. Republicans
now control both houses of 19 state legislatures, while Democrats
control 18.
<P>
In the South, for the first time since Reconstruction, a state
legislative body will be led lay Republicans. The South Carolina
House, which went Republican, hasn't had a GOP majority since
1886. Down the ballot, at all levels, candidates
supporting a powerful and vigorous conservative message won election.
<P>
Keeping this in mind, Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp observes,
&quot;The 1994 elections rivaled Ronald Reagan's 1980 victory
in its importance to the conservative movement.&quot;
<P>
What made the difference in the 1994 election was the dedicated
effort of grassroots activists, who constructed a network of information
and support that bypassed both the media and, in many cases, the
established political parties. Compared to previous midterm elections,
turnout was up. Polling data indicates that many of those who
voted intended to send a message for conservative change. This
turnout was the key difference in many close races - the defeat
of House Speaker Tom Foley, House Judiciary Committee chairman
Jack Brooks, and Senate Budget Committee Chairman (and
likely next Senate Democrat leader) Jim Sasser.
<P>
So dramatic was the mandate for change voiced in November that
no less than the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, dean of
the Washington pundits, saw in the results the evidence for a
massive political realignment - a return to the political landscape
as it looked before the New Deal.
<P>
However, to make re-alignment a reality requires even more effort
in 1995 and 1996, to make sure the 104th Congress delivers on
the change its leaders promised. According to a recent Times-Mirror
poll, 52 percent of Americans approve of the GOP's plans for the
future. Reducing crime, reforming welfare, cutting the deficit,
cutting middle class taxes, and a balanced budget amendment are
all supported by a majority of Americans.

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
<I>Dear Empower America Members: </I>
<P>
Our hard work during the last two years has definitely paid off!
Because of your dedication to ideals and policies that empower
individuals and families, our country has witnessed one of the
most historic elections of our time. As a result, we have elected
a new Congress committed to the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Through our candidate schools, issue briefs, radio actualities,
newspaper editorials and numerous other media opportunities, Empower
America has been pleased to play its role in the 1994 elections.
We look forward to the months and years ahead as a continuation
of our responsibility to help shape the conservative future of
America.
<P>
Therefore, this is not a time to rest. We must remain an active
voice in all the debates on policy that affect our daily lives.
This is an opportunity for us to propose progressive ideas for
the future of our country and our children. The days of the tax
and spend liberals controlling the agenda and our pocket books
are over!
<P>
It is because of concerned citizens like yourself, the ones that
only want a strong and stable country for our children, that this
Congress is like no other one before. It is
important that you remain in the fight. We will need you for every
battle that comes up on Capitol Hill. This new Congress must know
what the American people need and want from their government.
You are the only way they will know.
<P>
Thank you for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
<B>Bill Dal Col</B>
<P>
<I>President</I>

<H3>Kirkpatrick Unveils Foreign Policy Critique</H3>

<P>

WASHINGTON, D.C.: On the fifty-third anniversary of Pearl Harbor
Day, Dr. Jeane J. Kirkpatrick released a new Empower America publication
entitled <I>Security and Insecurity: A Critique of Clinton Policy
at MidTerm </I>at a crowded, well-attended press conference at
the Willard Hotel.
<P>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said that given the &quot;major events through
which we are living ... responses that would be required are much
stronger than have been given. And the leadership that is needed
is much stronger, more purposeful, serious leadership than has
been available. And the strength that is needed, both I think,
moral, political and strategic, of the United States is greater
than has been available.&quot;
<P>
In opening remarks, Empower America Chairman Malcolm S. Forbes,
Jr. said that &quot;We believe that the midpoint of this 
Administration - the
two year mark - is a good time to do a thorough examination
of its foreign and defense policies. A variety of experts were
brought together by Jeane to do this book.&quot;
<P>
But the volume is not just limited to criticism. In an article
entitled &quot;U.S. Security Policy for the Nineties&quot;, Dr.
Kirkpatrick outlines what Mr. Forbes described as &quot;Empower
America's foreign policy approach . . . pro-democracy, pro-growth,
pro-opportunity.&quot;
<P>
Calling Dr. Kirkpatrick &quot;perhaps the seminal thinker of America's
role in this emerging world,&quot; EA Codirector Jack Kemp said
that one of &quot;lessons of the 20th century is that weakness
is provocative,&quot; and while &quot;foreign policy, trade policy,
defense policy have been bipartisan in support .. . we at EA have
been quite moderate in our critique of the first two years of
the Clinton administration.&quot;
<P>
Twenty-one of the more than thirty experts who contributed essays
to <I>Security and Insecurity </I>attended the press conference.
The book offers a comprehensive analysis of the Clinton national
security record, including foreign, defense, intelligence, information,
international economic, regional and countryspecific analyses.
It is available by sending $3.00 to Empower America, 81776 I Street,
NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Ads Tout Flat Tax</H3>

<I>Radio and Television Campaign for Reform</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Moving the empowerment agenda forward, Empower
America began airing a new radio ad the week of January 9th. The
60second spot advocates replacing the current variablerate tax
system with a flat tax.
<P>
The ad, the first in an advertising campaign supporting the flat
tax, will be heard on news and talk radio stations in Iowa, New
Hampshire and Arizona. Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp set
the stage for the flat tax with an advertisement, run last month,
calling for lower acrosstheboard taxes, cutting and indexing capital
gains taxes, and raising the personal exemption for all families.
This generated considerable support.
<P>
The ad's text is as follows:
<P>
<B>Announcer</B>
<P>
<I>
Two years ago, President Clinton raised
taxes by over 250 billion dollars.
Now Clinton says he wants to cut taxes by
just 60 billion dollars. It's not enough. 
Clinton's high taxes, big spending, and
soaring interest rates are a blueprint for 
recession. To get the economy going, we need 
a real tax cut. It' s called the flat tax - 
and it' s one low rate of 17 percent will 
really cut taxes, while needy and working 
families will pay even less. The flat tax will
eliminate taxes on interest, dividends, and 
capital gains - encouraging savings, invest-
ment, and new jobs. Tax cuts worked for 
President Kennedy; they worked for President 
Reagan. What' s more, Americans could file 
their income taxes on a post card. 

To tell Bill Clinton you want a real tax cut, 
join the fight for the flat tax by calling 
Empower America at 1-800-332-2000.
</I>
<P>
Striking these same themes, Kemp along with Co-director Bill Bennett
delivered a one minute message on national CNN just prior to President
Clinton's January 24 State of the Union address.
<P>
The time, purchased by Empower America, criticized the Clinton
tax proposals and offered an economic vision for America's future,
renewing the call for a flat tax that will bring jobs and tax
relief for America's families.
<P>
The television spot, promoted by radio spots on January 23 and
24, reached a large and politically diverse audience. Empower
America hopes that such widespread exposure to these views will
encourage national discussion.
<P>
Congress is receptive to dramatically changing the tax system,
and both the House and Senate will be holding hearings during
the next several months to examine ways to reform the system,
simplify tax collection, and reduce tax rates. Empower America
will work energetically over the next several months to keep its
members informed and involved, to organize grassroots efforts
supporting the flat tax, and to let Congress know that Americans
support a flat tax.
<P>

<H3>Empower America Interview: Michael Harrison</H3>

<P>
<I>Michael Harrison is the editor and publisher of </I><B>TALKERS
Magazine, </B><I>the major trade publication in the talk radio
industry. As such, he presides over the nation's largest data
base about the medium in addition to researching the opinions
expressed by hosts and callers. In this role, Mr. Harrison has
emerged as the leading spokesman for talk radio and what he refers
to as the &quot;new media&quot; and is one of the most sought
after analysts of American public opinion. Mr. Harrison is a regular
guest on radio talk shows and network television in addition to
being constantly quoted in most of the nation's major news publications.
He also hosts </I><B>TALKERS Magazine's </B><I>nationally syndicated
weekly program, &quot;The Talk Radio Countdown Show,&quot; which
overviews the hottest topics of theweek on talk radio, and continues
to guesthost local talk shows whenever he has the time regularly
filling in on WRC Radio during his many visits to the nation's
capital</I>
<P>
<I>EMPOWER AMERICA:</I> What impact did talk radio have on the 1994 elections?
<P>
<I>MICHAEL HARRISON: </I>First of all, talk radio proved to be
an accurate bellwether of American public opinion foretelling
the results of the election as early as two years ago. As a spokesman
for the field, I've had to defend the accuracy of talk radio to
the mainstream press more than a hundred times during the past
couple of years. TV news and many of the daily papers would downplay
the sentiment expressed by both hosts and callers on talk radio
as representing a &quot;small but vocal&quot; segment of the population
of reflecting a &quot;conservative Republican bias.&quot; Or worse,
they denigrated it as playing to a &quot;radical fringe.&quot;
The point is, talk radio did not cause the election to happen
the way it did. Talk radio forecasted it. As such, talk radio
has shown itself to be more in touch with the American people
than any other of today's mass media. In doing so, it provided
the people of this nation with the opportunity to discuss the
real issues of the day and exchange populist views. It is only
in that context that talk radio impacted the election. It provided
a vehicle for public opinion which
already existed to play itself out and reach some sort of collective
resolution.
<P>
<I>EA:</I> Will there be an increase in &quot;liberal&quot; talk
radio as a result of the 1994 election?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Only if the newly elected politicians who call themselves
&quot;conservatives&quot; are ineffective, corrupt, arrogant and
elitist and besmirch the concept of popular conservatism. You
see, I don't believe that the ever-growing talk radio audience
is inherently Democrat or Republican in a partisan sense. Nor
are they unilaterally liberal or conservative. I think the average
thinking American here at the end of the Twentieth Century is
more prone to be an active Independent. At the moment, the conservatives
are more accurately addressing these concerns than the liberals.
But actions speak louder than words and more and more, the American
public is able to perceive the difference between talk and deed.
The biggest mistake politicians on both sides of the fence can
make is to think that the electorate is primarily composed of
party faithful. In the old days the term &quot;independent&quot;
was usually associated with &quot;apathetic.&quot; Today, however,
the independent voter is more likely the most active. That's today's
gigantic difference.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What will the state of the industry be two years from
now, during the 1996 elections? What role will talk radio have
on the next election cycle?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Talk radio will set the pace for the entire mass media. Now
that the mainstream media, particularly the press, have caught
wind of talk radio's position in the political scheme of things,
its proclivity to play the leader, will insure this prediction
coming true. The 1996 election will be played out on talk radio
and that ensuing scenario will be amplified and cemented in the
mainstream media. As far as the details of the next election are
concerned, I'm not an astrologer&#151;but I can give you this
insight, this hint: Talk radio does not choose its good guys and
bad guys simply based on party line or academic political ideology.
It bases these things on personality, character and the handling
of &quot;people&quot; concerns on an issue to issue basis. Look
what's going on in Massachusetts. The same hosts who beat the
daylights out of Dukakis for his ultraliberalism have just turned
like vicious dogs on the conservative William Weld for supporting
a 55 percent legislative pay raise on the heels of the election.
<P>
EA: Do you consider talk radio to have more entertainment, news
or education value?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Ah, now that's the question talk radio programmers
are constantly wrestling with. Finding the perfect balance between
information and entertainment. This is not a media characteristic
peculiar to talk radio. Television news, newspapers, even Presidential
campaigns are preoccupied with capturing attention and developing
interest. Or to put it another way, to avoid being boring at all
costs&#151;even if it means leaving out important information
or glossing over serious, complex issues. Fortunately, we live
at a time when a growing portion of the American public finds
news and public affairs entertaining. The problem is when the
public expects and demands that it be entertaining first and foremost.
Remember during the Persian Gulf War when people talked about
going home at night to &quot;watch&quot; the war on CNN and began
to complain when it started to get &quot;boring?&quot; At least
half the audience viewed it as just another miniseries. So yes,
talk radio is entertainment. . . but so is Connie Chung. And so
are political debates. And so are political conventions. That's
why the networks no longer cover then gavel to gavel. Shakespeare
understood this hundreds of years ago.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What is the proper role for talk radio in the political
debate?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>To create an environment that will draw a large audience
while maintaining a fair and even playing field. That's the ideal.
Uq,fortunately, the fair and even playing field often suffers
in the process of drawing the large audience. I only hope that
the bean counters who ultimately control talk radio&#151; or at
least will gain more control over the medium as it continues to
show itself to be a potential moneymaker&#151;don't overresearch
and package it to the point that it loses the rough edges and
accessibility to the people that I believe is at the core of its
impact.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What new technologies can we expect from talk radio,
such as interaction with online computer services, etc.?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Fifty years from now, today's talk radio will be looked
back upon as the
<P>
primitive public address system of the emerging 21st century electric
age democracy. As far as the present is concerned, talk radio
makes maximum effective use of existing technologies to make twoway
mass communications fantastically accessible and immediate&#151;
telephony, satellites, and digital transmission technology make
talk radio amazingly flexible and ubiquitous. The next step is
universal interaction with online computer services. <I>TALKERS
Magazine is </I>about to go online with CompuServe. The relationship
between talk radio and online services, the Internet, will be
close.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Why has there been a recent resurgence in interest
in talk radio, and when did it begin to come into its own?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Talk radio's been around for ages, but I trace the
real beginning of the modern era of talk radio to the removal
of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 which opened
<P>
the door up to stations feeling free to tackle controversial issues.
Prior to that, the Fairness Doctrine actually had a chilling effect
on the discussion of public policy in the electric media. But
that's just one factor. In the late eighties, you had all these
AM stations being beaten up by FM music stations so they turned
to talk which sounds just fine on AM. Also, talk radio addressed
issues and reflected public opinion in a way that was largely
ignored by the mainstream press and media, so it filled a massive
void and garnered tremendous public support. Other factors that
contributed to talk radio's growth have been the changing demographics
of the nation&#151;boomers are extremely interested in public
policy&#151;as well as the fact that talk radio is great company.
People are lonely and talk radio provides a sense of community
that's missing in the modern world. Then there's the advertising
aspect of talk radio. It's a powerful advertising medium <B>because
</B>it has such an active and interested audience.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Are stations moving away from locally produced talk
shows to carry more nationally syndicated shows, or are they still
cultivating local talent?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Both! The average talk station in America is a blend
of the two - and both have proven to be a vital part of the
programming success of talk radio. The networks are providing
local stations with the chance to get into the talk radio business
and provide a solid, national product. That, in turn, creates
the need to supplement the network stuff with a local perspective.
For every job that Rush Limbaugh has taken away, he's created
the need for two.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Do you see any future Rush Limbaughs on the horizon?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Yes and no. Yes, I do see tons of new and exciting
talents up and coming in talk radio and I find that very exciting.
But no, I don't think we'll see another &quot;Rush Limbaugh,&quot;
per se. He's one of a kind phenomenon that is actually historical.
If talk radio were rock and roll, then Rush Limbaugh is Elvis
Presley. Of course, as we know, there was only one king of rock
and roll - but that didn't stop him from self-destructing, and
the medium was certainly able to thrive without him.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>How can the public and grassroots organizations best
utilize the power of talk radio?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>The key is to tap into its accessibility without abusing
it. The public, of course can always listen. Callers should avoid
overdoing it as &quot;regular&quot; callers. No one wants to hear
the same person whining on and on using talk radio as a personal
soap box. Organizations should maintain the same rule. Be in touch
with the stations and hosts. Give them information that they want
and believe the public will be interested in. Do not flood them
with self-serving hype and minutia. Remember, talk radio is a business.
Put yourself in its shoes and it'll respond much more readily.

<P>
VOL. 3 NO. 1 
<P>
<H3>The Republican Agenda in the 104th Congress</H3>

<P>
<I>Now in control of both the House and Senate for the first time
in four decades, Republicans face the challenge of legislative
leadership. Fortunately, preparation for this welcome challenge
began during the campaign season when Republicans gathered on
the steps of the Capitol to sign their </I>Contract With America.
<I>This contract lays out the blueprint for thefirst 100 days
of the 104th Congress. The ten points of the </I>Contract <I>are
as follows.</I>
<P>
<B>Fiscal Responsibility Act</B>
<P>
Under this Act, Congress will vote on a balanced budget amendment
and the line item veto. The aim of this legislation is to force
Congress to live within its means and to restore financial accountability
to the budget.
<P>
<B>Taking Back Our Streets Act</B>
<P>
This provision takes a get tough approach to crime fighting;
calling for stiffer punishment, placing more police on the street,
and implementing truthinsentencing legislation that requires convicted
criminals to serve their full sentences.
<P>
<B>Personal Responsibility Act (Welfare Reform)</B>
<P>
The focus of this Act is twofold: (1) to encourage people to work,
and (2) to discourage people from having children out of wedlock.
Most Americans agree that the welfare system is seriously flawed
and must be dramatically reformed. Dramatic reform is what the
Republican leadership hopes to achieve through this legislation.
<P>
<B>Family Reinforcement Act of 1995</B>
<P>
The federal government has, in the past two decades, intruded
upon the parent/child relationship. This provision seeks to reverse
that trend by placing control of a child back where it belongs - with
the parents. The Act would also strengthen penalties for child
pornographers, and create tax breaks for those who adopt a child.
<P>
<B>The American Dream Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This Act provides a tax credit for families, reforms the &quot;marriage
penalty,&quot; and improves the tax treatment of IRAs. Beginning
in 1996, the bill would allow a $500 per child tax credit for
families with annual incomes up to $200,000. In addition, Americans
would be allowed to contribute up to $2,000 a year into an American
Dream Savings Account (ADSA).
<P>
<B>The National Security Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This provision would reform the Department of Defense by placing
an emphasis on a strong national defense through ensured funding.
It would also ensure that U.S. troops are only deployed to support
missions in the U.S.'s national security interests.
<P>
<B>Senior Citizens' Equity Act</B>
<P>
The senior citizens' earning limit would be raised. This would
end age discrimination for those who choose to work after a certain
age.
<P>
<B>The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</B>
<P>
Rolling back government regulation has long been a priority for
Republicans; this Act would slash many burdensome regulations
that strangle small businesses, thus making it easier for investment
and job creation.
<P>
<B>The Common Sense Legal Reforms Act</B>
<P>
This Act will curb excessive lawsuits and limit abuses of the
legal system by overzealous lawyers. This type of reform is crucial
to American competitiveness.
<P>
<B>Citizen Legislature Act</B>
<P>
This Act would force a vote on the issue of term limits for Senators
and House members. This would help put an end to career politicians
and give the American people a citizen legislature.
<P>
<I>These 10 points represent the backbone of the legislative agenda
for the 104th Congress. Empower America will work closely with
Congressional leaders to go forward with these initiatives endorsed
by the American peoples ' vote in November. Empower America 's
Codirector William J. Bennett is fond of telling audiences that
this is a </I>Contract With America, <I>it is not a handshake
with America. It is in this spirit that Empower America will continue
the fight for true reform in the days to come. </I>
<P>

<DD>&quot;Bennett, the former education secretary who took to the
campaign trail this year for an array of candidates, said he was
utterly clear on the meaning of this election. 'It was about limited
government, about the end of the nanny state,' he says. It was
about beginning to reverse 'the discharge of responsibilities
from families and communities and local government onto the federal
government,' and reviving personal responsibility.&quot;

&quot;As opposed to Bill Clinton's effort to 'reinvent government,'
Alexander wants to dismantle it. One problem lies in making sure
someone else&#151;individuals, community groups or local entities&#151;does
the work that federal agencies have been doing for decades.
Alexander's first effort to deal with these and other questions
will come at a &quot;Send Washington Home&quot; conference November
14 sponsored by Empower America.&quot;

<H3>New York Gala Honors Innovative Governors</H3>

<I>Governors Tommy Thompson, Christine Todd Whitman and John Engler
accept Empower America 's first annual </I><B>Empowerment Awards.</B>
<P>
On November 17th, Empower America held its second annual New York
Gala Dinner aboard the historic USS Intrepid aircraft carrier.
The evening's dinner and discussion were particularly eventful
as Empower America honored Governor John Engler for his changes
in Michigan education policy, Governor Tommy Thompson for the
overhaul of Wisconsin's welfare system, and Governor Christine
Todd Whitman for her bold economic policies in New Jersey. These
governors were the recipients of Empower America's first annual
<I>Empowermerlt Awards&#151;</I>in recognition of their ingenious
and innovative policies benefitting the men and women, business
leaders, families, and children of their states.
<P>
The evening' s patriotic celebration was heightened with the presentation
of the colors by the USS Inchon Color Guard. Empower America Chairman
Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. presided over the event and began the evening
with an introduction of New York Governorelect George Pataki.
The Empower America Board of Directors welcomed over 500 friends
and supporters as Lamar Alexander, William Bennett,
<P>

Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick presented the awards to the Governors.
The energized crowd and impressive lineup of state and local leaders
set the tone for the debate which will resume in the new congress.
<P>
The discussion shed light on the emerging discussion surrounding
illconceived policies at both the national and state levels, in
addition to addressing the federal government's stream of unfunded
mandates. The progressive agendas of Governors Engler, Thompson
and Whitman will be on the leading edge of change -- to restructure
the relationship between the federal government and the states,
and comprehensively change the way that our elected leaders do
business.

<H3>Issue Conference Campaign Tackles Gold Standard</H3>
<P>


<I>Bretton Woods</I>
<P>
On September 8th, Empower America hosted a conference on monetary
policy which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the historic
Bretton Woods Conference. The anniversary conference, which took
place in Washington, DC, featured reputable experts in the field
of economics including Lawrence Kudlow, Arthur Laffer, Lawrence
Lindsey, and Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., in addition to Empower America
Co-directors Jack Kemp and Vin Weber. 
<P>
Communications Campaign Proves Effective
<P>
Over the past couple of months, Empower America has been waging
an intensive television and radio advertising campaign. Issueoriented
ads have been placed throughout the country opposing bad legislation,
like the Clinton health care plan, and promoting good proposals,
like tax cuts and the A to Z spending cut plan.
<P>
These ads often put Empower America squarely in the middle of
major issue debates. For instance, Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala publicly attacked an ad that
called President Clinton's welfare reform plan &quot;cynical and
deceptive.&quot; The resulting debate brought to light many of
the Clinton plan's flaws, helping to defeat it.
<P>
Empower America produced one of the most critical television ads
that ran during
the health care reform debate. The ad pulled no punches in asserting
that &quot;President Clinton wants to socialize our health care.&quot;
This ad, with an intensive buy, helped put Empower America on
the front lines of the battle that eventually saw the Clinton
health care plan soundly defeated.
<P>
&quot;Because Empower America is a non-profit non-partisan organization,
our ads can also be run by TV and radio stations as public service
announcements, which many do. Also, stations can hear each ad
through a special digital phone line established to transmit radio
actualities. By absorbing the production cost, Empower America
thus is able to support friendly and conservative TV and radio
stations throughout the country by producing professional issue-oriented
messages. &quot;

<H3>Lamar Alexander Joins Empower America</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151;Lamar Alexander, former secretary of education
and governor of Tennessee, recently joined the leadership of Empower
America. He will serve as a codirector elong with Bill Bennett,
Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber.
<P>
Since leaving government, Mr. Alexander has remained active in
national politics. He launched a satellite TV network based in
Nashville, TN, which conducts a monthly public policy discussion
through nearly 3,000 town meetings across the country. Alexander's
satellite network will provide another vehicle for the organization
to advance its empowerment agenda among a broad coalition grassroots
activists.
<P>
&quot;Our neighborhood meetings and Empower America fit together
perfectly ' Mr. Alexander said. &quot;I'm delighted to be on the
same team as Bill, Jack, Jeane and Vin, who are constantly challenging
conservatives to say more clearly what we are for.&quot;
<P>
Lamar Alexander is also an advocate for congressional reform and
champions the idea of &quot;cut their pay and send them home.&quot;
His plan includes cutting a congressman's time in Washington and
pay in half.
<P>
Alexander explains, &quot;If members ate their breakfasts in hometown
diners instead of Capitol Hill restaurants such harebrained notions
as turning the health care system over to the government to run,
raising taxes to create jobs, 'reinventing
<P>
welfare' from Washington, DC for the 7th time, would never see
daylight.&quot;
<P>
The new codirector's colleagues, Bennett and Kemp, praised his
addition to the group.
<P>
&quot;I have always respected and admired Lamar's outspoken advocacy
of creative
<P>
solutions to our nation's problems:' Kemp said. I'm thrilled that
he's agreed to join our team and help advance the conservative
cause.&quot;
<P>
Bill Bennett added, &quot;I'm very glad to have Lamar join our
organization. His is another clear and experienced voice on the
cause of empowering Americans.&quot;

<P>

<H3>Making Ideas Matter in the Fall Elections</H3>
<P>
EmpowerAmerica plays key role in development of popular message
in the fall elections.
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: As the fall elections draw near, political
experts across the country are predicting big gains for proponents
of the principles of empowerment. In the House of Representatives,
most experts predict a shift of twenty five or more seats into
the conservative ranks. In the Senate, gains of four to seven
seats are not only possible, but likely. The same is true at the
state and local level. Several statehouses and several state legislatures
may move from the domination of liberal control to majority empowerment oriented
control.
<P>
One of the reasons for this success is the ability of conservative
candidates to define a coherent message of limited government
distinguished from that of President Clinton and his liberal allies.
Empower America has played an important role in the development
of this agenda.
<P>
We recently completed a series of successful Candidate Schools,
in which candidates from across the country learned about effective
and viable messages of family and community empowerment over massive
governmental bureaucracy. Now, Empower America has turned its
efforts to helping primary winners develop that same message.
<P>
While not endorsing or supporting any particular candidate, Empower
America has been actively involved with candidates in advancing
the message of empowerment.
<P>
As Congress struggles through the final weeks of the current session,
it is becoming increasingly clear that President Clinton is going
to be a huge millstone around the necks of big-spending, big-government
congressional candidates across the county. This stands in stark
contrast with Empower America's message.
<P>
Candidate School attendees and winners from across the country
are succeeding on the Empower America message. In Rhode Island,
Dr. Kevin Vigilante is running for Congress in the first congressional
district. Faced with strong opposition from Patrick Kennedy, son
of Senator Edward Kennedy, he has overcome huge Kennedy advantages
in name identification and fundraising to be within points of
Kennedy in the polls. Dr. Vigilante is utilizing the facts, theories
and vision advocated by Empower America. Crime, welfare, education
and economic growth define his campaign.
<P>
In Tennessee, attorney and former actor Fred Thompson is running
for the Senate against Congressman Jim Cooper.
<P>
Principal sponsor of the &quot;Clintonlite&quot; health care plan,
Cooper entered the race as the heavy favorite. Thompson, however,
has closed the gap significantly by running a campaign based on the 
principles of empowerment. Advocating a strong welfare reform package as well
as crime and real health care reform, Thompson has made this race
&quot;too close to call&quot; as the days count down to November.
<P>
Empower America also has been briefing candidates who did not
attend the Candidate Schools. Through weekly faxes on issues to
all primary winners and other periodic &quot;urgent updates&quot;
on breaking issues, Empower America is ensuring that all candidates
have access to the powerful message of empowerment.
<P>
When the November elections have come and gone, America will have
taken a step closer to returning power to citizens and local governments
and a step away from the big government control of the last thirty
years. 
<P>

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
 
Dear Empower America Members:
<P>
These past few months have been very exciting at <B>Empower America</B>
 and we must thank you, our membership, for this. Your continual
interest and involvement in this organization makes it possible
for us to promote the empowerment agenda across the country and
play a leading role in the national debate.
<P>
We are pleased to welcome Lamar Alexander to our leadership as
a codirector. There is no doubt that his involvement with us will
bring vigorous new energy to the public policy debate.
<P>
Empower America has been actively involved in the fight against
the costly crime and health care bills using an aggressive television
and radio advertisement.campaign to deliver our message on
both. Our goal was to activate Americans to participate in the
political system by contacting their representative and senators
and persuading them to vote against these economically destructive
pieces of legislation.
<P>
As the debate over health care continues in the months ahead,
Empower America will lend its voice around the nation to promote
insurance availability, affordability and portability for everyone
without government mandates.
<P>
<B>Now, we are encouraging all of you </B>to become active
in the fall midterm elections. This is a cridcal time for all of
us. This election represents the opportunity to make changes that
will affect the policies governing all of our futures. This is
the time to elect individuals who support the advancement of freedom,
the promotion of
economic growth and the pursuit of solutions to cultural and social
problems.
<P>
The best way to do this is to vote! Research the candidates in
your state and district. Then cast your vote for those who will
support legislation that empowers people and not government bureacracies.
Let's elect individuals to office who represent the most important
special interest: the American people.
<P>
Once again, thank you very much for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Bill Dal Col
<P>
President
<P>

<H3>Crime in America: A Nation Held Hostage</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Over the past three decades violent crime
has increased by more than 500 percent. America leads the industrialized
world in rates of murder, rape and violent crime. As these
disturbing numbers continue to grow, nearly three out of every
four convicted criminals remain on the street, and the American
public's faith in its government's ability to fulfill its first
priority, to protect its citizenry from enemies foreign and domestic,
steadily erodes. As a result, parents are afraid to let their
children freely roam the neighborhood with their friends; individuals
are afraid to walk the streets of many cities at night;
and law-abiding, hardworking citizens in the nation's inner cities
live with the constant fear of being the next victim of a random
act of violence while traveling to and from their home. In short,
the lawlessness of an incorrigible few has been allowed to alter
the lifestyles of law-abiding citizens throughout the nation. The
Democratic leadership, sensing the urgency of the problem, has
delivered a crime 
bill to the American people. This type of legislation will help,
right? Wrong.
<P>
The recently passed crime bill is being hailed by supporters as
a tough assault on crime, but the specifics of the legislation
betray their rhetoric. Instead of focusing on the principles of
apprehending criminals quickly and sentencing them to terms which
they will actually serve, the bill continues the liberal tradition
of fighting crime by pouring taxpayer money into more untested
social programs aimed at the &quot;root causes&quot; of crime
(e.g. poverty, boredom, low self-esteem). For example, in the recent
legislation one can find:
<UL>
<LI>A provision to teach arts and crafts and establish dance programs;
<LI>A provision designed to increase self-esteem;
<LI>A provision establishing Midnight Sports Leagues.
</UL>
Regardless of what one might think of these programs, it is ludicrous
to present them as answers to the very serious crime problem facing
our nation. Such an ivory tower approach by the social scientists
on 
Capitol Hill who drew up these provisions is an insult to the
average hardworking American who is looking to Washington for
some real help. Most Americans who pay their taxes and fear for
their personal safety would probably not agree that funds, desperately
needed by local law enforcement agencies, would be more wisely
spent by social workers (in the name of crime fighting) to establish
late night basketball leagues.
<P>
Even though there are some meritorious provisions such as the
community policing and prison provisions, these are so encumbered
with restrictive federal language that their beneficial effects
will be severely hampered. Overall, the bill simply possesses
too many untried provisions, is too complex and is too cost-inefficient
to be accepted by an American public under siege and seeking real
reform.
<P>
What can we do? Plenty. First, we must reform our criminal justice
system.
Punishment needs to be swifter, more certain and longer than it
is now. We need to build more prisons, hire more police officers
and prosecutors, implement truth-in-sentencing provisions and overhaul
the current juvenile justice system.
<P>
Numerous police officers and prosecutors around the country tell
of the frustration they face when they see the same offenders
arrested time after time as our 
revolving door justice system places these lifetime criminals
back on the street. Stories of a brutal attack by a criminal on
early release from his or her sentence are becoming all too common.
The system must be altered and it must be soon. The problem is
that legislation such as the crime bill will spend billions of
taxpayer dollars and do little to slow down the revolving door.
<P>
America also needs more police officers and more prisons (the
diluted provisions of the current bill are not sufficient) to
attack the rise in crime seriously. Each time a federal judge
orders a state to release prisoners because of overcrowding, justice
takes another blow and society comes face to face with criminals
who have not served their full sentence all because the state
could not house the offenders. If society expects criminals to
take its laws seriously, then society must be willing and able
to enforce those laws and the punishment that is given to those
who break the law.
<P>
America also faces the problem of juvenile crime. As John DiIulio
of Princeton University has stated, &quot;America is facing a
ticking youth crime bomb. We have burgeoning numbers of young
people who, from all the statistical profiles, are at risk of
becoming violent and repeat criminals.&quot; Once again, this
is a problem we must address by altering the justice system's
handling of young offenders; again, the crime bill presented by
the Democratic leadership does not. There is hope; however, it
is just not in Washington, DC.
<P>
In Richmond, Virginia, Governor George Allen is attempting to
reform a parole system that allows criminals to avoid 
large portions of their sentences. His administration is looking
past the failures of the last three decades and saying it is time
we apply basic principles in our fight against crime. The main
principles are age-old: justice must be swift and it must be sure.
If it is not both of these, it will not be justice. Criminals
seem to understand this very well. It is unfortunate that
President Clinton and those members of Congress who voted for
the most recent crime bill do not.

<H3>How To Cut Government Spending...From A To Z</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; A bipartisan coalition of representatives
has presented Congress with the opportunity to restore some measure
of fiscal sanity to the federal budget. Their initiative, known
as the A to Z Spending Cuts Plan after its primary co-sponsors,
Democrat Rob Andrews of New Jersey and Republican Bill Zeliff
of New Hampshire, would hold every member of Congress accountable
for wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary government spending.
<P>
Ever wonder why Congress can't just repeal the federal Helium
Act (started just after World War I to supply helium to our fleet
of military blimps) and save $1.7 billion? Or save $74 million
over five years by ending treeplanting grants offered by the Small
Business Administration? Or eliminate the $26 million the government
will spend this year to subsidize vacant public housing?
<P>
The answer is that these and hundreds of other federal boondoggles
costing billions are hidden deep inside huge pieces of legislation.
These omnibus spending bills are much more difficult to defeat
than individual examples of ridiculous government spending.
<P>
Liberals argue that the cuts outlined above won't make much of
a dent in the projected 1994 budget deficit of $220 billion. Maybe
so, but that's just a start. Citizens Against Government Waste,
a congressional watchdog organization has published a list of
556 &quot;Prime Cuts&quot; that would reduce federal spending
by nearly $187 billion this year and more than $1.3 trillion over
five years. People can argue the merits and demerits of these
and other spending programs. But supporters of these initiatives
don't want to encourage debate, they want to stifle it.
<P>
Until now, spending cuts which everyone purports to support, such
as the infamous Honey Bee and Mohair subsidies, have been allowed
to escape the budget ax. But for the first time, the A to Z plan
will force legislators to defend absurd special interest spending,
instead of denying responsibility .
<P>
The plan is simple and straightforward. Congress would set aside
an entire week &#151;56 hours of debate&#151;to consider nothing
but spending cuts. There would be no &quot;sacred cows.&quot;
Every government program would be on the table, vulnerable to
an amendment to reduce or eliminate its funding. Each individual
proposal would receive a recorded &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;
vote. It would only take a simple majority of House members to
eliminate once and for all hundreds of federal programs that serve
no legitimate public purpose. Outdated and wasteful programs will
no longer survive by clinging onto popular proposals. Each member
will be held accountable for his or her vote with no excuses.
<P>
But in Washington, there has to be a catch for any proposal that
makes this much sense. Despite the fact that a strong, bipartisan
majority in the House of Representatives supports the A to Z plan,
Democratic leaders will not allow the proposal to come to the
floor for a vote. If all of the bill's 230 cosponsors would sign
what's known as a &quot;discharge petition,&quot; the legislation
could be discharged from the committee, where it is being bottled
up, and brought to the floor. As of press time, only 204 members
have signed the petition, 14 short of the necessary number.
<P>
Why would someone cosponsor the bill but then refuse to allow
a vote on the plan? Members of Congress sometimes use this tactic
to safely demonstrate support for a popular proposal knowing all
along that they will never have to cast a vote. By doing so, they
are blocking an important deficit reduction tool and contributing
to the deepening level of public cynicism toward Congress as an
institution.
<P>
Pressure is building on A to Z cosponsors who refuse to sign the
discharge petition. The bill continues to inch forward as more
and more legislators feel the heat of public scrutiny. More and
more Americans are demanding responsibility and accountability
in the federal budget process. Constituents want to know exactIy
where their representatives stand on helium reserves, mohair subsidies,
and treeplanting grants.
<P>
The fate of A to Z will help determine the legacy of the 103rd
Congress. That legacy can either be one of missed opportunities,
or one where Congress helped restore the public's faith in America's
elected of ficials. For now, the choice is up to Congress. In
November, the voters will decide.

<H3>Kirkpatrick Speaks at Foreign Policy Forum</H3>
<P>
<I>Calls For Missile Defense Program; says no justification for invasion
of Haiti</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; Empower America Codirector Jeane Kirkpatrick
called on the Clinton administration to develop a defense for
America against ballistic missile attack. The former U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations said, &quot;I believe that it is impossible
today for any president to fulfill his pledge to provide for the
defense of the United States without developing an effective missile
defense, period. That is just a fact. Like it; dislike it; it
is a fact of life in our times. And it is incredible to me that
the current Administration should continue its blindness in this
regard.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that efforts to control
the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
of mass destruction and to stem the development of ballistic missiles
that can carry these weapons to targets long distances away have
reached a &quot;point of breakout&quot; that &quot;simply cannot
be tolerated.&quot; Ambassador Kirkpatrick said we need &quot;to
complete a missile defense program, a space-based missile defense
program which would enable us to defend ourselves and for
us to defend our friends and allies in the world against weapons
of mass destruction.&quot; She concluded by adding that &quot;the
problems are all of our making today in this regard. And this
president bears a heavy responsibility for his decisions in this
area.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also stated that &quot;there should be
no use of force of Haiti.&quot; She
added that &quot;I do not believe that there is an
 American national interest that justifies an
 invasion of Haiti.&quot;
 Ambassador Kirkpatrick was one of
 four distinguished speakers at a recent
 Foreign Policy Forum held by the
 Republican National Committee at which
 she made these remarks. She was joined
by former Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and former Secretaries
of State Henry Kissinger and James A. Baker III at the Forum to
address current international relations problems and to discuss
the Clinton administration's foreign policy.
<P>
Regarding the current government, Ambassador Kirkpatrick said
that she &quot;believes this administration underestimates the
danger in the world today, under
estimates the role of power and of force in the world, and, in
a curious kind of way, underestimates the force of American values
and institutions in the world.&quot; The countries of the former
Soviet Union are turning to America's values and institutions
as the model for their developing democratic and free market systems.
Therefore,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick said, &quot;It is as terrible a mistake
to underestimate the force of American values, as it is to underestimate
the value of American force.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also evaluated various aspects of the Clinton
administration's foreign policy, pointing out that their actions
stemmed in part from conceptions about the limits of American
power and that &quot;multilateralism was to be at the center of
their foreign policy.&quot; Another key Clinton administration
belief is that America is, &quot;in some fundamental sense, in
a process of inexorable decline. Therefore, they think we should
not seek to act unilaterally in the world, but should act only
multilaterally. Moreover, they clearly believe that multilateral
action is more moral and more legitimate than unilateral action.&quot;
<P>
Further, the Clinton administra
tion has moved to &quot;dramatically
draw down American military
forces, to diminish American weapons and
weapons procurement, to downsize the mil
itary's industrial complex, to reduce
research and development and to concen
trate on producing enough weapons and
maintaining just enough military forces
only, as they always put it, to defend our
own country.&quot; The problem, Ambassador
Kirkpatrick asserted, is that &quot;we can only
do good in the world if we have the power
 to do good in the
 world.&quot; Under the
 Clinton administration, &quot;American
 Power is being 
neglected and dissipated.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick's address, 
&quot;U.S. Leadership: The Uses and Abuses of
Multilateralism,&quot; is available from
Empower America's <I>Speeches and 
Lectures</I> senies.

VOL. 2 NO. 3 FALL 1994

<H3>Empower America Interview: Public Opinion Pollsters 
Edward Goeas and John McLaughlin</H3>
<P>
<I>Mr. Edward Goeas is President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Tarrance Group, a survey and research company located in Alexandria,
Virginia. Mr. Goeas has served as the pollster for a number of
senate and congressional campaigns. He is also the pollster for</I>
U.S. News and World Report.
<P>
<I>Mr. John McLaughlin is a partner of Fabrizio, McLaughlin &amp; Associates,
a national public opinion polling and strategic consulting firm
in Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. McLaughlin has worked on hundreds
of campaigns, most recently as strategist and pollster on Governor
George Allen's campaign in Virginia.</I>
<P>
<B><I>Empower America:</I>What do you perceive to be the major issues
and concerns that will ultimately affect the 1994 elections? What
do you believe to be the &quot;mood&quot; of the nation and what
is on voters' minds?</B>
<P>
<I>Edward Goeas:</I> Issue concerns of the American public are being
voiced at two levels as we enter the final months of the 1994
election. One level is the actual problems voters are concerned
about, and on a second level they are judging incumbents and challengers
alike on their ability to address those concerns with common sense,
workable solutions.
<P>
As concerns over the economy (unemployment, taxes and the deficit)
have dissipatedeover the last year, the American electorate has
refocused on &quot;lifestyle&quot; issues. Crime has been the
major &quot;lifestyle&quot; concern that voters have focused on
for almost a year now, with nearly 41 percent of the electorate
mentioning crime as the number one problem facing the country.
Voter concern over health care, welfare reform, declining values
and education have rounded off these &quot;lifestyle&quot; concerns
now mentioned by six out of ten voters.
<P>
Candidates' ability to put forward credible solutions to these
problems has become much more difficult because of the skeptical
mood of the American elec
torate. After a brief period of optimism, voters have turned even
more cynical about government's ability to effectively address
the problems that they face on a daily basis. This cynicism has
increased as the voters have seen the solutions coming out of
Washington to be more government, more bureaucracy and the demand
for more of their hard earned money.
<P>
<I>John McLaughlin:</I> The Clinton administration appears to be better
able to run a campaign than a government. There is a large policy
gap between their rhetoric and the actual legislation they support.
This leads to three overall themes that appear to be undermining
Clinton's success among the voters. First, since Clinton's election,
American voters have repeatedly told us by a 2 to 1 margin that
they favor less government with fewer services as opposed to larger
government with more services. Clinton talks about less government,
but the facts reveal that all his policies point to larger government.
Americans are becoming more freedomoriented in a technological
age rather than the biggovernment orientation of the Industrial
Age.
<P>
Second, in June we asked voters if they were more concerned about
where a candidate stands on the issues, or about the candidate's
honesty. By a 7 to 3 ratio, the vast majority of Americans prefer
voting for someone who is honest. This is a direct
reflection upon President Clinton's character, or lack of it.
<P>
Finally, American voters are in the midst of a spending revolt.
In the late 1970's we saw America generate a tax revolt. From
our surveys of this year, the voters believe that the federal
government wastes $.42 cents out of every dollar it spends. By
margins of 7080 percent, they prefer cutting government spending
over any measures to raise taxes. Overall, it appears that the
1994 elections will be a state by state referendum for the Senate
and House on Bill Clinton.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> In your opinion, is there an empowerment agenda that voters
want?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Voters are looking for three things; accountability from their
elected officials, the opportunity for individuals and communities
to take more personal responsibility in both their daytoday lives
and their future, and the hope that a renewed emphasis on the
values of honesty, hard work, and a commitment to family and community
will once again put the American Dream within reach for middle
class Americans. The overwhelming majority of voters are certainly
not looking for government to do everything for them, nor are
they looking for an ineffectivc government that is always getting
in their way and hampers their ability to move forward. Proposals
like term limits and national initiatives and referenda receive
support from over 70 percent of the electorate because they are
searching for ways to have a greater say in their government.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The voters are looking for new ideas. They want to turn away
from the old failed policies of the past and try creative solutions
to their current problems. Voters seem to be very receptive to
the idea of cutting taxes to create jobs. And on a local level,
voters who elected Republican mayors Tom Fetzer in Raleigh, and
Bret Schundler in Jersey City, are efljoying more police on their
streets while at the same time seeing their local taxes cut. Other
ideas to which voters are extremely receptive include: term
limits, workfare, common sense solutions to crime, school choice,
and tax credits for health care coverage. All these ideas would
give people greater control over their lives, and less control
to government. Finally, technology is driving voter beliefs that
they can have more direct democracy.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>From your data, do you see a major shift on the horizon
in either the House of Representatives or the Senate for 1994?
Will 1994 be a vote on Bill Clinton's policies?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> As we enter the fall elections, it appears there will be a
substantial gain for Republic ns in both the House and the Senate.
In the Senate, it is likely that Republicans will pick up five
or six seats (with a chance of tak
ing control). In the House Republicans look to gain between
twenty-five to thirty seats (The last time GOP numbers in the House
were over 200 seats was 1954). The reality is that significant 
gains are likely for Republicans come November's elections.
 There is no question that significant gains will force Bill
Clinton to reevaluate the course of &quot;bigger government is
better&quot; that he has set for the country.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Since last year, it has been apparent from Clinton's lack
of success on the stimulus package and the budget that the Republicans
would have large midterm gains in both the Senate and the House.
In the House, there is a minimum gain of about 15 seats, which
are mainly seats the Republicans should have gained in 1992 after
reapportionment. Add to that the usual historical antiincumbent
setbacks in Congressional elections to the party that controls
the White House, and it's likely that the Republicans will gain
30 seats. A similar antiClinton trend in the Senate would find
the interesting outcome of a 5050 tie, where Vice President Gore
might have to cast deciding votes in the Senate the last two years
of Clinton's term. On the gubernatorial level, Republicans may
have 
the potential for even greater gains. The growing trend for Republicans
with new ideas to attract Perot voters and disenchanted Democrats
is one that appears to be wellfounded for this November's election.
Only the Republicans themselves could lose this opportunity if
they compromise on principle.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From what you see, what are the bellwether races in the
country that will show whether a shift is underway?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Without going into the numerous races that could be highlighted
as bellwether races, look for surprises in two areas&#151;the
South and West. The South is where resistance toward Bill Clinton's
overall philosophy of governance is
strongest. In the West, voters have increasingly felt that Clinton's
policies coming out of Washington are hostile to the West, and
they are looking to force Washington's policies to either help
or get out of the way.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The bellwether races in the country certainly include high
profile Senate races, however, for the Republicans to make gains
in the Senate, they are going to have to win in states where Bill
Clinton may still be popular, and the trend towards Republicanism
is less strong. For example, in the Senate, wins by Republicans
that would point to a landslide would include Maine, Ohio, New
Jersey, California, Wisconsin and knocking off Ted Kennedy. A
more important trend regarding ideas could be the successful reelection
of innovative and pioneering governors that Republicans brought
to office four years ago. Voinovich of Ohio, Thompson of
Wisconsin, and Engler in Michigan have all experimented with ways
to keep taxes low, keep the size of government in check and find
creative solutions to problems. At the House level, there are
very interesting races which are absolute bellwethers of change
in the nation.
<P>
Mark Sharpe defeating Sam Gibbons, the House Ways and Means Chairman
of Florida, would be a strong sign that goodoldboy politics is
over with. Tom Davig' strong showing in Virginia's northern suburbs
would show that a successful progressive local executive would
be able to bring new solutions to Washington. And in Rhode Island,
Kevin Vigilante's victory over Patrick Kennedy would be another
setback for the failed liberal policies of the past. Across
the board, the message is change. Republican candidates are
running with the message of change, and all the previously 
mentioned contests will show whether that  message has a
very partisan edge, or whether American 
voters are still confused about who will give them the leadership
they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>How much change do Americans really want in health care?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> After numerous delays and a year of debate, concern over government
control of health care, the threat of declining quality and increasing
costs, the possible loss of choice in the selection of their personal
doctor has left a bad taste in voters' mouths. Adding to these
negatives is the perception that, with the elections right around
the corner, it would be best to delay final action until the next
legislative year. In fact, the harder Congress pushes for a health
care bill this year, the more the voters are made to feel that
there is something to mistrust in Washington's motives. To many
Americans it looks like Congressional Democrats are rushing health
care reform only to improve their political health and not America's
health.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans want their health care system improved, however,
they don't want the quality of their health care reduced. An early
warning to the Clinton administration came in June when Governor
Lawton Chiles called a special session precisely to enact the
Florida Health Security Act. Republican legislators stood firm
in the state Senate and the House, and nothing passed. There was
very little outcry; in fact, there was a sigh of relief among
Florida voters. Our polls showed that the vast majority had health
care and did not want the government to take it over. Furthermore,
twothirds of the voters were not willing to pay more than $100
a year in higher premiums or tax increases for universalhealth
care. As the details about Clinton's health care plan surfaced,
the voters became extremely concerned that these changes will
reduce the quality of care while increasing the cost. With the
prospect of larger government intervention in health care, the
potential decrease in quality, and an increase in taxes or premiums,
Americans agree this is not the change they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your information, how do you perceive the American
people's response to the Clinton administration's welfare
proposals? Do they find them dramatic or cosmetic?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> The President has lost his &quot;New Democrat&quot; effort
to take over the welfare system as his own. Last year voters felt
that
 Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress would do a better job
reforming welfare over Republicans in Congress by nineteen percentage
points. After delayed introduction, and then introduction of a
plan that clearly missed the mark of voter concerns, Republicans
are, once again, seen as best able to address welfare reform.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans responded very well to Clinton's rhetoric to end
welfare as we know it, but it's just rhetoric. Since his first
proposal, they have found out that among those people who currently
receive welfare, over 80 percent of them will continue to 'receive
it under Clinton's welfare proposal because he has exempted the
vast majority of them from work lre requirements. Also, 
the voters are underwhelmed by Clinton's promise of government
subsidized jobs for those who cannot find work in the private
sector. This sounds like merely a shell game rather than an actual
improvement in the system. This is why Clinton would increase
welfare spending by $9 billion dollars. In contrast, there is
a real vacuum in the media to present more popular alternatives.
The best piece of legislation, by Senator Lauch Faircloth and
Congressman Jim Talent, has gone unnoticed. Although endorsed
by Empower America, no one has yet drawn the direct contrast to
the Clinton bill. While Clinton would increase welfare spending
by $9 billion, FairclothTalent would cut it by $5060 billion dollars.
Clinton would only take 12 percent of the people off the rolls,
FairclothTalent would take 50 percent off the welfare rolls, and
FairclothTalent has more initiatives within it to keep families
together and end the destructive disincentives in the current
welfare system.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your research, is America's
international standing an issue with the voters?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Traditionally foreign affairs does not play a major role in
nonpresidential elections. In this election cycle, however, background
noise from Bill Clinton's continual mishandling, and sometimes
total incompetence, in the international arena, has made nervous
voters, even more skittish about where our nation is really heading.
It is puzzling to the voters how, in two short years, international
respect for the United States can so quickly plummet with misdirected
foreign policy. The one issue that will play a major part in this
year's election is Bill Clinton's policy to place U.S. troops
under United Nations command. American voters reject this Clinton
policy in overwhelming numbers and want it reversed.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> At present there is very little immediate concern among the
voters with foreign policy, defense, or international issues.
This is primarily because there is no perceived threat to the
voters' freedom and international security. Nevertheless, Clinton
scores very low ratings compared to the previous Republicans.
It is paramount in the voters' minds that Presidents Reagan and
Bush collapsed the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; while Bill Clinton
withdrew in the face of embarrassing opposition from a warlord
in Mogadishu and a band of thugs in Haiti. If there is an intemational
crisis where the United States cannot succeed to preserve this
feeling of security among our voters, Bill Clinton would suffer
drastically in 1996. The last election was an aberration, in that
it was the first election since 1932 where the economy was the
dominant issue. Every other presidential election in between had
an international issue as the dominant or leading factor in deciding
who would win.
<P>
For Clinton, the true wildcard would be a foreign policy setback.
Just like the Panama Canal became a symbol of weak leadership
under Jimmy Carter, Clinton's legislation to force the military
to accept homosexuals, illustrated from the start that he was
more interested in social engineering than.in protecting national
security. The subsequent defense cuts have actually provided reasonable
grounds for voters to believe any foreign policy setbacks are
the direct result of Clinton's policies.

<H3>THE SATELLITE MEDIA TOUR: Empower America's venture into communications
technology</H3>
<P
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;Reaching the public through earned media
opportunities poses a challenging task for any grassroots organization.
There are many methods for getting the message out, ranging from
the conventional news release, a static relic of oldstyle politics,
to building a new traditionl television or radio network, a costly
and cumbersome undertaking which ultimately reaches a minimal
audience.
<P>
Is there a better way?
<P>
New technology and the '90s information explosion have opened
the door to cheaper, more efficient, and more targeted means to
raise an organization's name and mission profile through the media.
<P>
One such method is the satellite media tour, which Empower America
has utilized with remarkable results.
<P>
Research shows that Americans are more likely to watch their local
news than network news. That means, in order to shape the debate
on current issues, it becomes critical to gain access to local
news broadcasts.
<P>
Using only a studio and uplinks to satellites, Empower America's
opinion 
makers can talk directly with your local TV news anchors and reporters,
free of the &quot;insidethebeltway&quot; news filter.
<P>
Empower America has conducted four satellite media tours. In September
1993, Bill Bennett discussed the results of the American Legislative
Exchange Council and Empower America Report Card on American Education
with local news stations across the country. Through the use of
fiber optics, Empower America chairman Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr.,
and other Empower America leaders, conducted a remote satellite
media tour in December 1993, live from Empower America's national
summit on the Clinton economic record. On June 6, 1994, Jack Kemp
and Jeane Kirkpatrick reflected on the 50 years since DDay during
a one and onehalf hour satellite tour for local TV stations doing
original reporting marking the 50th anniversary of that historic
day. And on August 11, 1994, Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. conducted
a tour on health care reform plans and the debate in Congress.
<P>
Satellite media tours have enabled 
Empower America's leaders to talk with 27 TV stations, in roughly
ten minute increments each, for live broadcast or livetotape for
later use.
<P>
And the cost? The D-Day anniversary satellite tour tells all. On
June 6, 1994, Empower America reached 2 million actual viewers
at a cost of onefifth of a penny 
per viewer.
<P>
Empower America used satellite communications to make available
its 60-second TV ad on the Clinton health care plan to 1,800 television
stations and cable carriers across the country, for their use
in original news coverage or as a public service announcement.
In this case, satellite technology enabled Empower America to
greatly expand coverage for an alreadyproduced product, at modest
additional cost.
<P>
Satellite communications technology is costeffective and highly
efficient for grassroots organizations to harness the same power
as tbe major television networks.
<P>
Empower America is helping lead the conservative movement through
this exciting information revolution.

<H3>Empower America <I>Speeches &amp;Lectures</I></H3>
<P>

<B>Remarks by George Gilder<BR>
<I>At EmpowerAmerica's
San Francisco Regional Conference</I></B>
<P>
...What's going on in electronics with this exponential upsurge
is not comrnodity competitioh, it's dynamic competition. It's
creative destruction. And what is optimal now in technological
competition, technology competition focuses on innovation, and
innovation is the pursuit of the temporary positions of monopoly&#151;that's
what innovation is. And innovation is an advance that nobody else
has for a while. It's a monopoly...That's what motivates high
levels of investment and risktaking in technology advance. But
if you begin a race by saying nobody can win, and nobody can make
any money, you essentially prohibit the creation of a real broadband
infrastructure in dynamic advances in electronics and communications...
<P>
<B>&quot;Building Bridges To Build
A Better Michigan&quot;
<BR><I>
By John Engler, Governor of Michigan Addressing the Greater Detroit
Chamber
of Commerce Mackinac Conference</I></B>
<P>
...How did we turbocharge Michigan's economy? By cutting taxes,
cutting red tape and holding the line on government spend
ing. We made tough decisions, built partnerships, and we worked
together. Just as Michigan companies are reengineering the way
they do business, we are reinventing state government&#151;from
top to bottom...
<P>
<B>&quot;Capitalism and Democracy
American Style: Can They Co-Exist?&quot;
<I>
By Theodore J. Forstmann,
Founding Chairman, Empower America Grants Political Conference</I></B>
<P>
..No political freedom, their words echo down to us, is secure
where the right to property, the fruit of one's own intellectual
or physical labor, is not strong. Government's job, our Founders
all believed, was basically to create a stable environment in
which free people could operate; to provide the permanent political
conditions in which economic changes would inevitably occur. This
was all basic noncontroversial stuff. And so, for example, in
Wilson's day, Americans paid no more than 10 percent of their
earnings to all levels of govemment. When the income tax was first
proposed in l909, one senator rose to suggest a constitutional
limit of ten percent. And it's staggering to reflect how this
suggestion was greeted. After further heated debate, the idea
was rejected on the 
grounds that if a ten percent maximum were set, the income tax
might inevitably rise to that ominous level...
<P>
<B>&quot;The Real War On Crime: 
States On The Front Lines&quot;
<I>
By George AUen, Governor of Virginia
Addressing The Governor's Forum</I></B>
<P>
...The surge in violent crime is more than a &quot;thief in the
night&quot; stealing some one's belongings. It is stealing something
much more precious: our freedom. It is denying our citizens their
unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;
their right to work, live and raise a family without being terrorized
and victimized by violent criminals and lawlessness...
<P>
...There is only one way to stop it [crime], and that is to take
the people who are committing the violence&#151;that small percentage
of criminals who commit the vast majority of crime&#151;and get
them out of the free society that they have declared war on. Because
one thing is certain: The one place a violent career criminal
won't harm more innocent people is in prison...
<P>
..But the last thing we need from Congress is more expensive social
spending designed to fight crime. If social welfare spending were
the answer to crime, the street corners of America would be far
and away the safest in the world. This approach has failed us
for the past 30 years, and will continue to fail. We in the states
need flexibility, we need to cover the costs of prison construction,
and we need the freedom to combat violent crime with the commonsense
methods our citizens demand.

VOL. 2 NO. 3 FALL 1994
<P>

<H3>Empower America Draws the Line on Health Care</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151; Empower America's goal in the health care
debate has been to defeat any health care reform plan that includes
individual or employer mandates, price caps or controls, standard
benefit packages, more government interference, or higher taxes.
<P>
Empower America advocates more sensible, targeted health care
reform and is promoting marketoriented reforms that include tax
breaks for individuals and the selfemployed; making insurance
affordable, accessible, and portable; instituting taxfree Medical
Savings Accounts; medical malpractice reform; and voluntary purchasing
pools.
<P>
Empower America has been advancing its health care goals on a
variety of fronts, including an aggressive advertising campaign,
an effort to mobilize members and numerous television and radio
appearances.
<P>
The advertising campaign consists of a widely shown television
commercial and a series of more targeted radio commercials. Using
an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio of a normal
heartbeat, the television ad
states that President Clinton's plan would &quot;socialize our
health care&quot; system. The ad notes that small businesses will
be called upon to pay the bill for what amounts to &quot;the largest
government bureaucracy in history.&quot; As the text and the narrative
continue, the EKG and heartbeat steadily increase in speed and
severity, culminating in a flatline across the bottom of the screen
and a terminated heartbeat.
<P>
The impact of Empower America's television ad is best demonstrated
by the outcry from the White House and the Democratic party. The
administration and the Democratic National Committee have made
the following critical comments about Empower America's television
ad on health care.
<UL>
<LI>On May 21, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos appeared
on 
CNN's &quot;Capital Gang.&quot; A clip of Empower America's ad
was shown during this particular show. Stephanopoulos commented
that the ad was a &quot;scare tactic&quot; and that &quot;people
aren't going to buy it.&quot;
<LI>Democratic Media Consultant Mandy Grunwald called Empower
America's radio ads on health care &quot;partisan politics&quot;
in the Wall Street Journal on June 30. She went on to assert that
Empower America and The American Cause &quot;believe in doing
whatever they can to damage the president.&quot;
<LI>On a PBS panel discussion on July 18 addressing health
care advertising, Democratic National Committee
Communications Director Ed Lazarus called the Empower America
television ad the most irresponsible and offensive ad of the entire
health care debate. He characterized the ad as misleading and
called the use of the word &quot;socialize&quot; a scare tactic.
Lazarus went on to criticize Empower America for the negative
tone and the absence of an alternative solution to the health
care problem in the ad. At the same event, AARP Policy Director
John Rother and Health Care Reform Project's Bob Chlopak agreed
with Lazarus' assessment of Empower America's ad.
<LI>Also on July 18, Vin Weber appeared on PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour&quot; along with the DNC's Ed Lazarus, the RNC's Chuck
Grecner,
 and Bob Chlopak of the Health Care Reform Project (a group closely
tied with and partially funded by the DNC) to discuss health care
advertising. Chlopak said the television ad was &quot;aimed at
inflaming public opinion...There are no facts, no documentation
in the ad.&quot;
<P>
In addition to the television ad, Empower America has run a series
of radio ads on health care reform. An ad advocating a delay on
health care legislation until after the November election aired
nationwide and two other ads, which quoted prominent Democrat
senators, played in targeted markets. One ad quoted Senator Jay
Rockefeller saying, &quot;We're going to push through health
care reform regardless of the views of the American people,&quot;
and the other quoted Senator Ted Kennedy speaking of health
care saying, &quot;We l want people to understand very quickly
what they are entitled to and what they're not entitled to.&quot;
<P>
Empower America began its first targeted  state ad campaign
in Nevada recently. Nevada was chosen because a 
majority of its Congressional delegation has expressed support
for the Clinton health care proposal. The television and radio
ads created a great deal of media attention in Nevada and nationwide.
The ads generated a significant grassroots campaign against the
health care position of Nevada ' s more liberal members of Congress.
Massachusetts soon followed and other states will be targeted
as the debate continues.
<P>
Empower America's ads have also been featured in news stories
by ABC News, CBS News, CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; and &quot;Capital
Gang,&quot; PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour,&quot; <I>The Wall
Street Journal</I>, Associated Press, and dozens of other media outlets.

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
<P>
<I>In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates substantial coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a snapshot of recent news stories that discuss
Empower America:</I>
<P>
<DL>
<DT>&quot;Empower America, the conservative coalition founded by
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, has
hit the airwaves with their own ads, which warn that the
Clintons' plan would 'socialize our health care.' These ads reflect
the growlng opposition to anything that smacks of another entitlement
program. That is the last thing that our fragile economy and debt-ridden
government needs.&quot;
<DD><B><I>The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, </I>May 26, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative political organization,
urged members of Congress to postpone final passage of any health
reforms until after the November elections. Its leaders, including
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Vin Weber, attacked the 'ttzggered'
requirement that employers pay for health insurance as 'merely
a rest stop on the road to socialized medicine.&quot;' 
<DD><B><I>The Ketchikan Daily News,</I>Ketchikan, AK, June 14, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;EMPOWER AMERICA CHOOSES NEVADA: Empower America (EA)
launched a TV and radio ad campaign in NV to oppose Clinton's
[health wcare] plan. The 60sec. ads are airing in Las Vegas and
Reno. 'Using an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio
of a normal heartbeat,' the TV ad maintains Clinton's plan would
'socialize' the system. The radio ad 'urges Congress to postpone
health care legislation until next year.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Hotline; </I>American Political Network, July 13,
1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America criticized Mr. Clinton's plan as socialized
medicine and urged that the health care debate be delayed until
next year after the November election when Republicans stand a
good chance of making significant gains.&quot;

<DD><B><I>The New York Times, </I>July 12,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;[William 1.] Bennett said that he prefers a [welfare] policy
that cuts off benefits for any illegitimate child born after a
certain date... 'If they know they will not get anything from
the government, people will have to change their behavior. The
real message is you should not have children...unless you are
able to support them.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Courier-Journal, </I>Louisville, KY, June 19, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;'This is classic Clinton [on welfare reform], except to
the nth degree: Overpromise, underdeliver, and then try to fudge
the difference, 'said William Bennett, former education secretary
and drug czar in Republican administrations who now heads an advocacy
group called Empower America. 'What we've got here is marginal
tinkering which will cost more money.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>Newsday,</I> New York, NY, June 15,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;A leading spokesman for conservative ideas, Bennett thinks
the nation can still recover its triedandtrue social standards.
'This is America,' [William J.] Bennett says. 'You know the American
capacity for selfrenewal. Look at what we have overcome in 200
years: England, King George, slavery, the Great Depression, fascism,
communism. This country has a tremendous record of going up against
very tough things and prevailing. But this one's a little different
because it's internal. But you never count this country out.&quot;'
<DD><B><I>The Dispatch, </I>Cookeville, TN, April 24,1994</I>
<DT>Jack Kemp, Codirector of the think tank called Empower America,
and a hope for imbuing capitalism with compassion, reminds again
how the most vulnerable among us were hurt by a welfare system
that sent a destructive message that was indifferent to a moral
life. 'It is an exarnple of how the capital of the human spirit
can be squandered in the course of a few generations,' he said
in a recent call for cultural and spiritual renaissance.&quot;

<H3>Empower America Continues the Fight for Real Welfare Reform</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;At present, those pushing for welfare reform
in Washington must await the outcome of the health care debate,
and may have to wait until the next Congress to see any legislation
actually reach the House and Senate floors. Even so, the lines
of disagreement have been drawn during the 103rd Congress. The
benchmark for the debate was set by President Clinton during the
1992 campaign when he promised to &quot;end welfare as we know
it.&quot; Unfortunately, like many of his promises, this bold
statement has not been supported by any meaningful legislative
language from the White House.
<P>
Eighteen months into his administration, President Clinton introduced
his long awaited welfare reform plan. After capitu l lating to
the liberal special interests in the House of Representatives
(specifically the Congressional Black Caucus), Clinton unveiled
a plan draped in conservative rhetoric, but founded upon the proposition
that risking a rift between the White House and the liberal wing
in Congress would be too high of a price to pay in order to help
repair the societal damage being inflicted by the present welfare
system. The result of this capitulation is legislation that proposes
mere tinkering with the present system instead of true reform.
<P>
On the Republican side there is dis l agreement as well. As was
mentioned in the spring newsletter, Empower America
has helped lead the fight for legislation that will truly &quot;end
welfare as we know it.&quot; This means moving past the original
House Republican bill to a more ambitious bill. This approach
is embodied in the TalentFaircloth Welfare Reform Act of 1994.
The TalentFaircloth bill is based on three basic principles:
<UL>
<LI>Ending the subsidization of outofwedlock births;
<LI>Enhancing work requirements for individuals on welfare;
<LI>Controlling welfare spending.
</UL>
<P>
Although the Republican bill has some worthwhile provisions, it
does not take the bold steps found in the TalentFaircloth approach.
And while President Clinton gives lip service to the basic principles
found in the TalentFaircloth bill, his legislation violates all
of them.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Empower America effort on behalf of reform is continuing.
Empower America Codirector William Bennett has appeared at one
press conference on Capitol Hill to endorse the TalentFaircloth
bill, and at another press conference to decry the fraudulent
reform being proposed by the Clinton administration. In a USA
Today article, Bennett was quoted as saying &quot;the Clinton
proposal is a onehalf joke, onehalf fraud.&quot;
<P>
In addition to Dr. Bennett's many efforts, the policy division
of Empower America is lending its help to reformers 
such as Congressman James Talent and Senator Lauch Faircloth by
providing information to members of Congress as to the necessity
for dramatic reform. &quot;Many individuals on the Hill simply
don't understand the suffering being wrought by the current system,&quot;
says Peter Wehner, policy director for Empower America. &quot;We
are finding more members of Congress are willing to support the
TalentFaircloth bill once they are given all the facts.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will, according to Wehner, &quot;use all its resources
to help bring about real reform.&quot; The reason for Empower
America's tenacity is obvious&#151;the current welfare system
has wrought havoc on the American poor. After three decades of
welfare programs the nation is faced with an underclass that is
much larger, more violent, less educated and which consists of
an alarmingly high number of singleparent families. In short,
the system is destroying the American social fabric.
<P>
In addition to the TalentFaircloth legislation, Empower America
is supporting initiatives aimed at loosening the restrictions
on adoption (particuarly interracial adoptions), as well as initiatives
to bring economic development to the inner city through incentive
based programs. Hopefully, many in Congress will begin to see
the need for real reform and join in the fight to rescue our culture.
Until that happens, Empower America will stay on the front lines
of the fight.

<H3>Empower America Hosts San Francisco Conference</H3>
<I>Regional Meeting Draws 500 Local Activists</I>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, CA&#151;Empower America drew over 500 local activists
to its fifth regional conference, held in San Francisco, California,
on June 1, 1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage
conference participants in an open discussion with Empower America's
Codirectors William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and
Vin Weber.
<P>
The conference focused on the future of entitlements. Panel discussions
addressed different aspects of entitlement programs ranging from
the information superhighway, to welfare policy, to the current
debate over health care reform.
<P>
The first session covered America's newest entitlement, the information
superhighway and the direction of the current administration's
technology policy. Famed author and economist George Gilder advocated
free market alternatives to President Clinton's government managed
approach to developing information technologies. Other panelists
included Larry Ellison, Chairman of the Oracle Corporation and
Tom Hazlet, a professor at the University of California at Davis
who specializes in telecommunicadons policy. A lively discussion
followed panelists' presentations in which several conference
attendees shared frustrations with a governmentrun technology
policy.
<P>
Empower America Co director William Bennett led the discussion
on welfare reform from which several suggestions were offered
by both panelists and conference participants. Addressing the
status of the welfare system, BenneK told the grassroots activists,
&quot;The current system is a complete failure. We have spent
enormous sums over the past three decades on welfare programs
and what do we have to show for it?&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp provided the luncheon 
address entitled, 'Yhe Assault on Personal Liberty: The Clinton
Administration and the Growth of Entitlement Programs.&quot; Addressing
the recent growth and creation of entitlement programs, Kemp said,
&quot;Government- not the entrepreneur- is the centerpiece
of the Clinton economic plan. The notion that government can guide
America to prosperity is the fundamental flaw that fuels Clinton's
belief that 'government must do more.' This is wrong- individuals
must do more. The future of American prosperity depends on whether
we can roll back government's interference in our lives and allow
the entrepreneurial spirit to flourish again.&quot;
<P>
The afternoon session, chaired by Empower America's Chairman of
the Board, Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., addressed health care reform.
Forbes opened the session by airing Empower America's latest health
care television commercial which criticizes President Clinton's
nationalized health care plan. Joining Mr. Forbes in the discussion
were health care policy experts Stuart Butler of the Heritage
Foundation, Merrill Matthews, Jr. of the National Center for Policy
Analysis and Sally Pipes of the Pacific Research Institute. Each
pol
icy expert stressed the need for free market health care reforms
as opposed to government managed proposals.
<P>
Forbes criticized the Clinton administration's assumption that
individuals can't be trusted to make sensible decisions about
health care and that the only solution is a government run system.
He advocated a new health care system based on private sector
decisions and reforms, such as tax incentives like medical taxfree
savings accounts. He emphasized that individual based plans have
eliminated health care inflation, and that individuals are very
capable of making free market decisions regarding their specific
coverage needs.
<P>
Empower America's regional conferences have served to unite grassroots
activists around the country in an effort to promote the conservative
agenda of limited government. The San Francisco conference received
national media attention which has helped Empower America deliver
its message to the American people. It is this message that; Empower
America will build upon as the'se issues are discussed during
the 1994 elections. For more information about Empower America's
upcoming events, call 1-800-4-EMPOWER.

<H3>Empower America Launches Candidate Schools</H3>
<i>Seminars in Atlanta, San Francisco, Detroit, New York and other
U.S. Cities To Teach 1000 Candidates How to Run and Win on the Empowerment
Agenda</i>
<P></CENTER>
ATLANTA, GA--More than 120 candidates and campaign managers gathered
in Atlanta, Georgia March 9, 1994 to attend Empower America's
Atlanta Candidate School, the third in a series of candidate training
seminars that the political advocacy group is holding this year
in cities across the United States. The schools are designed to
help teach candidates for local, state and national offices how
to run and win on the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Candidates for offices ranging from mayor and state legislator,
to Governor, Congressman and U.S. Senator, gathered at the Atlanta
Hilton and Towers to meet with Empower America's distinguished
faculty of policy experts, elected officials and campaign consultants.
Instead of discussing campaign management, fundraising and &quot;get-out-the-vote&quot;
techniques, they attended panels on the elements of effective
welfare, education, crime and health care reform policies, and
the importance of economic growth, free trade and lower taxes.
<P>
&quot;Our schools are unique,&quot; said Empower America Vice
Chairman Vin Weber, who is heading up the candidate schools program,
&quot;because unlike most traditional candidate schools, which
teach the 'nuts and bolts' of campaigning, Empower America's schools
are focused on ideas and issues. We are teaching candidates how
to campaign effectively on the empowerment message.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school followed two schools hid earlier this year,
in Washington, DC on January 11th, and at Stanford University
on February 17th. Empower America will be holding candidate seminars
in cities such as Detroit, Denver, New York and a second school
in Washington, D.C.
<P>
&quot;By the time the 1994 elections come around, we expect that
some 1000 candidates for local, state and national office will
have attended our schools,&quot; said Weber. &quot;We are essentially
working with the next generation of public officials, building
a cadre of new political leaders who share our belief in the empowerment
agenda, and who will help us turn those ideas into real public
policies at all levels of government.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school opened with a panel discussion on economic
growth and empowerment. Mayor Tom Fetzer of Raleigh, North Carolina
discussed the growing movement towards privatization and individual
empowerment in America's inner cities. &quot;From Raleigh to Jersey
City to Indianapolis, a whole new generation of leaders is rising,&quot;
Fetzer said. &quot;These leaders represent a political view that
emphasizes the empowerment of people over government and families
and communities over spending and programs.&quot;
<P>
At lunch, Empower America Co-Director Bill Bennett suggested that
candidates for all offices emphasize a message that focuses on
returning power to people and private institutions, not on government
solutions. Cultural renewal, Bennett said, &quot;has to do with
what comes out of TV and the radio, it has to do with the composition
of families, it has to do with the health and well-being of schools,
neighborhood institutions, communities, churches and the like.
If the country is to get better, to improve, it will depend much
more on the health of those institutions than it will on the things
that government does.&quot;
<P>
Ed Goeas, President of the Tarrance Group, a leading national
potting firm, told candidates that his recent studies indicate
that &quot;the American public wants change, and they want change
that is reasonable and rational. Policies which encourage real
welfare reform, real change in education, real economic growth,
and real reductions in crime comprise the real winning platform
for 1994, 1996, and beyond.&quot;
<P>
The earlier schools drew an equally stellar faculty and were also
heavily attended. At the Washington, DC school, for example, more
than 170 candidates and campaign workers from 31 states and American
Samoa participated in panel discussions featuring House Minority
Whip Newt Gingrich, Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, New Jersey,
former Attorney General William Barr, former Chief of Staff to
Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and Empower America's William
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. At the San Francisco
area school, more than 100 candidates participated in a program
highlighted by an address from Dr. Edward Tetter, former director
of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the &quot;father&quot;
of the H-Bomb.
<P>
During his luncheon speech, Teller urged the candidates not to
shy away from foreign policy as a campaign issue: &quot;I don't
think I need to tell you of President Clinton's mistakes in the
realm of foreign policy. In the former Soviet Union, in Yugoslavia,
in Somalia, in North Korea, in Haiti, in every continent with
the possible exception of Australia, there have been mistakes.
These mistakes should indeed be discussed because of the widespread
belief that people will vote on the economy, on family values,
and not on foreign affairs.&quot;
<P>
All candidates who attend the Candidate Schools receive Empower
America's &quot;Candidate Briefing Book,&quot; with detailed chapters
on each of the issue areas discussed at the schools. Throughout
the course of their campaigns, candidates will also receive, by
mail and fax, &quot;94 Issue Briefs,&quot; expanding on the chapters
in their briefing books, &quot;Urgent Updates&quot; giving them
information on breaking issues that might be of importance to
their campaigns, and packets of material giving them more information
on the hot issues of the 1994 campaign cycle.
<P>
Candidates or campaign managers interested in attending upcoming
candidate schools should write to: Candidate Schools (Attn: David
Kuo), Empower America, 17761 Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington,
DC 20006.

<H3>Kemp, Bennett, Weber Call GOP Welfare Bill &quot;Too Soft&quot;
Urge Republicans to Unite Behind More Aggressive Reforms</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--In a move that drew wide attention in the media
and on Capitol Hill, Empower America Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William
Bennett and Vin Weber issued a memorandum April 14th, in which
they criticized the welfare reform bill backed by House Republican
leaders, and urged them to scrap the current plan and replace
it with a &quot;bold, principled and fundamentally different alternative.&quot;
<P>
The Empower America memo, released to coincide with a meeting
of GOP lawmakers to discuss their welfare reform package, sparked
coverage in several major newspapers, including The New York Times,
The Washington Times and several dozen regional dailies. In it,
the Empower America Co-Directors argued that the House Republican
bill &quot;falls short in three important areas: It contains no
serious attempt to curtail out-of-wedlock births, its work requirements
are weak, (and) its hidden costs are exorbitant.&quot;
<P>
According to Kemp, Bennett and Weber, welfare is illegitimacy's
&quot;economic lifeline.&quot; They argue that &quot;direct welfare
payments that subsidize illegitimacy must cad,&quot; and recommend
that &quot;beginning a year after the enactment of legislation,
women under 21 who have children out-of-wedlock ... be ineligible
for direct welfare payments.&quot; They also called for ending
benefit increases to women who have more children while on welfare.
<P>
In an interview with The Washington Times, Kemp stated that Republican
leaders must &quot;recognize that there has to be a more dramatic
effort at welfare reform if we are to end welfare as we know it--a
socialist, Third World trap permanently subsidizing dependency.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It would be irresponsible and politically unwise for Republicans
to assist the President in perpetuating welfare reform that is
too costly and too soft on illegitimacy and work requirements,&quot;
he said.
<P>
&quot;The central issue is people having babies out of wedlock,&quot;
said Bennett, in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot;Babies
are coming into this world with no fathers and ill-prepared mothers.
It adds to the welfare rolls, education problems and criminal
problems. It adds to the social breakdown of this country. We
have seen enough of the carnage, the cruelty, the 19 kids living
in the (Chicago) tenement, the babies left in dumpsters.&quot;
<P>
Asked what the goal of the Republican alternative legislation
should be, Weber, a retired Member of Congress and former House
GOP Conference Secretary, said that Republicans should frame their
welfare reform plan in a way that &quot;stops President Clinton
from passing a phony welfare proposal that sounds tough, but really
does nothing to bring about fundamental reform.&quot; The GOP
leadership, Weber said, must &quot;prevent passage of a bad welfare
reform package by using their plan to show just how bad the Clinton
bill is, and to force improvement.

<H3>Empower America Economic Summit Findings: Jobs Deficit Is Nation's No. 1 Economic Problem</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--America's number one economic problem is not the
budget deficit, but the nation's 5.4 million jobs deficit, according
to testimony delivered at Empower America's recent national economic
summit. Held in Washington, DC, December 14, 1994 exactly one
year after President Clinton's Little Rock Economic Summit, the
Empower America meeting brought together some of the nation's
leading economists, entrepreneurs and business leaders to assess
the state of the economy one year into the Clinton Administration,
and to develop pro-growth alternatives to Clintonomics. The goal
of the economic conference was to assess past and present economic
policies, and to propose an alternative growth plan for the economy.
<P>
In his presentation, Lawrence Kudlow, a noted economist and Empower
America board member, argued that ever since Congress voted to
raise the tax on capital gains from 20 percent to 28 percent in
1986, our nation's economic growth has fallen dramatically below
historic trendlines. This has cost America 1.3 million new businesses,
and has created a 5.4 million jobs deficit--the difference between
the jobs that should have been created and those that actually
were.
<P>
This jobs deficit is being created, according to testimony given
during the conference, because the largest job creator in the
country--the American entrepreneur--has been under continual assault
in the 1990's from higher taxes, more government red tape, and
diminishing incentives to risk-taking.
<P>
Chief among the problems with &quot;Clintonomics&quot; identified
at the conference is the Clinton Administration's core belief
that government is the most important actor in the economy. The
risk-taking entrepreneur is the most important actor in the economy,
argued Kudlow, not government. &quot;Far more important is the
individual man or woman, driven by a dream or an idea--the person
who is willing to sacrifice everything, to mortgage the home or
borrow from the family, friends and neighbors to start a new business.
So any true economic growth model must place the individual, the
investor and the entrepreneur at the center of the economic equation.&quot;
Kudlow said.
<P>
Kudlow argued that a direct link exists between several critical
economic policy mistakes and the plunge in entrepreneurial activity
in the country over the past eight years. The policies that have
caused this decline in job creation, which he compiled into a
list called &quot;The Assault on Capital Formation &amp; Growth,&quot;
include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> 1986 Capital Gains Tax Hike (20% to 28%),
<P>
<li> 1986-90 Social Security Payroll Tax Hikes (14.1% to 15.3%)
<P>
<li> 1989-91 Regulatory Reign of Terror owl bank credit
<P>
<li> 1990 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (28% to 31%) and temporary phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions
<P>
- Alternative Minimum Tax hike (to 24&#162;)
<P>
- Luxury and business tax hikes
<P>
<li> 1991-1992 Regulatory Mandates
<P>
- Clean Air, Americans with Disabilities, and Civil Rights Acts
<P>
<li> 1993 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (31% to 39.6%) and permanent phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions - Medicare tax cap eliminated
(2.9% tax rate) - Corporate tax hike (34% to 35%) and other business
tax hikes including entertainment deduction limits from 80% to
50%) - Other tax hikes: Alternative Minimum I Tax (24% to 28%),
Gas Tax Hike, Taxation of Social Security income.
</ul>
<P>
As a result of these higher taxes, business start-ups since 1986
have dropped dramatically below the historic trend costing millions
of jobs (see accompanying chart). According to Kudlow, &quot;When
taxes were low in the 1980's, we surged above the (historic) trendline
for business startups. Since 1986, as capital was taxed and incentives
diminished, we've fallen sharply below the trend, creating a 1.6
million business start-up deficit&quot; and the 5.4 million new
jobs that should have been created, but never were. Kudlow argued
that if the U.S. continues to &quot;strangle entrepreneurial activity,
America will find itself with European-like economic stagnation
and rising unemployment.&quot;
<P>
Also addressing the conference were Empower America Co-Director
Jack Kemp, Empower America board member Malcolm S. Forbes, Ir.,
and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-GA), who argued that
closing this jobs deficit required the creation of entrepreneurial
incentives through lower taxes on capital investments and income.
Gingrich took the Clinton health care plan to task, arguing that
the Clinton plan is an anti-capitalist proposal &quot;designed
to seize control of the health system and centralize power in
Washington.&quot;
<P>
The conference was aired live, gavel-to-gavel, by C-SPAN and covered
by both CNN and CBS, which broadcast Empower America's message
to millions of viewers across the nation. It was also covered
in 167 newspapers in 37 states, reaching well over 10 million
people. Since the conference, Empower America has been flooded
with requests for transcripts and videos of the event. To accommodate
this demand, Empower America has made available a 60 minute video
presentation covering the conference.

<H3>Simon &amp; Schuster Publishes Bennett's Index of Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--With the tremendous response last year to Empower
America Co-Director William Bennett's release of his Index of
Leading Cultural Indicators, Simon &amp; Schuster has released
the ground breaking study of our culture in book form. The new
book, published under the Touchstone Books insignia, is a significantly
enhanced version of the original Index, with new and updated data
on a wide range of cultural indicators.
<P>
The new Index is the most comprehensive statistical portrait available
of social and behavioral trends over the last 30 years. It consists
of five chapters: Crime; Family and Children; Youth Pathologies
and Behavior, Education; Popular Culture and Religion; along with
appendices on social spending and various economic indicators.
The cultural index is based on the government's &quot;Index of
Leading Economic Indicators,&quot; a set of statistics which track
the health of the nation's economy. The Index of Leading Cultural
Indicators is designed to provide a similar window into the state
of our nation's cultural health.
<P>
Unlike the first edition of the Index, this edition contains extensive
factual analysis of our current cultural condition, with commentaries
by experts and commissions that interpret and provide perspective
on the raw data.
<P>
Among the key findings: Over the past three decades there has
been a 560 percent rise in violent crime, a 400-plus percent increase
in illegitimate births, a quadrupling of divorce rates, a tripling
of the percentage of teenagers living in poverty.

<H3>Recent Visitors to Empower America:  Dr. Edward Teller, Father of H-Bomb, Criticizes Clinton-Gore Defense, Technology Policies</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--Dr. Edward Teller, father of the H-Bomb and one
of this century's greatest minds, visited Empower America, March
29, 1994 to meet with Empower America's staff and offer his perspective
on the Clinton administration's defense and technology policies.
America, Teller warned, is in a critical state of transition,
and the current administration is making serious policy mistakes
that he-said &quot;could lead to-very great trouble ... (and)
must be corrected &quot;
<P>
Teller specifically criticized Vice President Gore, who has taken
the lead in the administration on technology issues. Teller said
that Gore has been moving America from being a &quot;progressive
country&quot; into a &quot;reactionary country&quot; in terms
of its receptivity to new technologies.
<P>
&quot;When I came to this country in 1935 everything new was good,&quot;
Teller remarked.
<P>
&quot;Now everything new is under suspicion.&quot; As an example,
Teller cited the Clinton administration's gutting of the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). &quot;The Strategic Defense Initiative
is new and is good,&quot; Teller said. &quot;I don't see any argument
that would say otherwise. But in the book of Al Gore, SDI is a
form of aggression.&quot;
<P>
Teller argued that, with the rapid spread of technology throughout
the world, America's era of isolation and invulnerability is over.
&quot;America is no longer isolated. America today is as vulnerable
as Poland was at the outbreak of the Second World War, or even
more vulnerable.... Today Iran or Iraq could put a missile loaded
with biological material on a ship and deliver it from a distance
of ten miles to New York or Los Angles and actually kill 50 thousand
people,&quot; Teller said.
<P>
Teller further added that, while the danger of attack from small
hostile powers which are rapidly acquiring nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, is less awesome than that once posed by the
Soviet Union, it is also much more likely to occur. The danger
today, Teller said, is &quot;not as terrible as the danger (was)
from the threat of the Soviet Union during the Cold War --that
was a much bigger but much less probable danger. Now we have dangers
that are smaller but more probable.&quot;
<P>
But Teller argued that, despite the dangers posed by rapidly expanding
access to technology, government should not try to stop or interfere
with the progress of technology. &quot;We scientists are responsible
to find the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so far as we can; including potentialities, what can be done,
and how to use it,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not to be determined
by any elite, not by the religious community, not by the scientific
community and not by the political community, except to the extent
that the political community is an honest representative of the
people.&quot;
<P>
In fact, Teller expressed his support for the &quot;very widespread,
very thorough declassification of information&quot; which the
Clinton administration has recently proposed, because he said
that this declassification would encourage public understanding.
Public understanding, he said, is the only way to combat fear.
<P>
But he also emphasized the potential dangers of such declassification,
and cautioned that it not be misused. &quot;While general principles
and ideas can't be kept secret,&quot; he added, &quot;detailed
blue-prints and precise weapons procedures can be kept secret
and in some cases they should be.&quot; Limited access to this
information does not interfere with increasing public understanding,
he explained.
<P>
Teller said that instead of teaching people to fear technology,
or controlling technological advances, government should harness
technology to protect us. The United States, he insisted, must
use the technological know-how at its disposal to develop defenses
aimed at protecting the lives of its citizens.

<H3>Empower America Interview: David Kay Former Chief of U.N. Nuclear Inspection Team in Iraq Discusses North Korea,Emerging Threats to American Security</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In 1991, following the United States' successful prosecution of
the Persian Gulf War, the United Nations sent a team of nuclear
arms inspectors to Iraq to enforce Saddam Hussein's compliance
with the terms of surrender and supervise the dismantling of Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. What the U.N.
team found was horrifying--unbeknownst to the West, Iraq was less
than 18 months away from &quot;going nuclear.&quot; For the next
several months, Iraq played a cat-and-mouse game with the U.N.,
trying to hide and preserve as much of its nuclear capability
as possible.
<P>
David Kay led the U.N. team that discovered Iraq's nuclear program,
and stood down Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard when they tried
to forcibly prevent him from bringing proof of that program to
international attention. An eminent authority on nuclear proliferation
and national security issues, David Kay recently spoke to Empower
America about the current nuclear stand-off with North Korea and
the new threats to American security emerging in the post-Cold
War world.
<P>
Empower America: The conventional wisdom today seems to be that,
with the Soviet threat gone, America will face no major threats
to its national security in me foreseeable future. Do you agree?
If not, what are the emerging threats to our security in the post-Cold
War world?
<P>
David Kay: No, I do not agree. While the Cold War held the potential
for the destruction of our society as we know it --and we are
clearly better for its end-- the Soviets and the U.S. also had
forty years to learn to manage the Cold War in ways that limited
the likelihood of direct nuclear conflict. Today we are witnessing
the emergence of states and groups that are quite unrestrained
in their hostility to the West and willing to run what to most
Americans must seem like irrational risks to advance their interests.
Saddam Hussein's massive miscalculation in the Gulf and North-Korea's
dash for nuclear arms are but two examples of this new development.
<P>
The United States now towers above all others as the only state
in the world with the power to restrain the lust for domination
of renegade states and radical ethnic movements. It is inevitable
that these states will seek to threaten us and diminish our willingness
to stand in the way of their ambitions. Further, even under the
best of circumstances, the vast Soviet nuclear arsenal will take
more than twenty years to dismantle. In the worst of circumstances
some of the former Soviet nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
could well leak into the hands of states and groups hostile to
the U.S. or become the tools of a resurgent Russian dictatorship.
<P>
EA: How soon do you believe it will be before hostile states like
Iran and North Korea are able to directly threaten the continental
U.S. with nuclear or biological weapons?
<P>
DK: North Korea probably already has the capability to threaten
the U.S. with the terrorist use of biological weapons. Biological
weapons have undergone a largely unpublicized revolution in their
lethality and ease of production, and the Director of the CIA
has recently testified that two dozen states have active biological
weapons programs. North Korea's long range missile program is
surging ahead at a rate well ahead of estimates of only two years
ago. I would not be surprised to see North Korea, particularly
if its missile program is assisted by unemployed Russian experts,
able to field an intercontinental missile that could strike the
United States during the mid-part of the next decade. Well before
then it will be able to threaten U.S. bases in Japan and Guam.
Cruise missile technology provides an even easier path than intercontinental
missiles to reach the continental U.S. from ships off our coast,
and this threat will almost certainly be with us by the end of
this decade. The Iranians have already benefited from North Korean
military expertise, and it is reasonable to assume that North
Korea will continue to sell weapons and technology to all bidders.
<P>
EA: What can the U S. do to prepare for this eventuality? Where
should we be directing our resources today, in terms of defense
and intelligence spending?
<P>
DK: First, every effort should be made to slow and disrupt the
advanced weapons programs and cooperation between states such
as North Korea and Iran. While general export controls of the
type that were applied against the Soviet Union during the height
of the Cold War are no longer practical, it is possible to maintain
highly targeted controls on exports and technology assistance
against rogue states such as these. We should do this and be sure
that our allies and states such as China and Russia that want
to benefit from Western trade and assistance do so as well.
<P>
Second, we must develop the capability and political will to destroy
their leadership and political society if they threaten their
neighbors. While we are rightfully proud of the accomplishments
of the coalition military forces in the Gulf, the fact is that
poor intelligence and the lack of suitable weapons for penetrating
deep underground bunkers allowed much of Iraq's military might
to escape attack.
<P>
And finally, we must develop a credible defense capacity able
to handle the most likely threats to American forces abroad and
our people at home. By the end of the decade, we must either have
a workable cruise missile defense and the ability to intercept
a small number of long range missiles aimed at the continental
U.S. or be prepared to accept intimidating military threats to
our society.
<P>
EA: What is at stake with the crisis In North Korea today? Why
should Americans be concerned about North Korea's nuclear program,
and why is it In our national interest to stop it?
<P>
DK: Without a doubt the most dangerous place in the world today
is the Korean peninsula. Within 60 miles on each side of the Demilitarized
Zone (DMZ) that marked the end of the Korean War, approximately
37,000 American troops, 600,000 South Korean and upwards of one
million North Korea troops face each other. The North Korean regime
of aging Kim Il-Sung and his son, Kim Jong-II, rule over an impoverished,
isolated relic of Communism which, if it were not for its military
might and its craftily constructed Image of unpredictability and
irrationality could be ignored until it collapsed into the footnotes
of history.
<P>
But the military might of North Korea is real. Its army is equipped
with Russian, Chinese and Korean-improved armaments that make
up in sheer numbers what they may lack in Gulf War-type quality
and precision. It also fields a battlefield rocket force capable
of reigning, with almost no warning, terror on the South's capital
of Seoul and U.S. bases in the South. Its recent testing of the
Rodong I missile with a range of at least 600 miles now brings
large areas of Japan into range. And most frightening of all,
the U.S. intelligence community is widely reported to have concluded that North Korea has deployed one or two nuclear devices from plutonium
illegally diverted from its IAEA safeguarded reactors. So nuclear
arms must now be added to the regime's armory of chemical and
biological weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
Beyond the fate of South Korea lies the reaction of other Asian
states who have grown used to leaving to the U.S. the management
of regional security concerns. The Japanese may well view the
outcome of a U.S. policy that leaves them to live with a North
Korean bomb as just the opening move in the inevitable retreat
of U.S. power and political influence from Asia. Allowing North
Korea to cheat its way into possession of nuclear weapons could
easily bring an end to this stability and open the way to a less
safe, less open Asia. In this case, foreign policy does matter
even if you believe, &quot;it's the economy, stupid.&quot;
<P>
EA: What is your assessment of the Clinton Administration's approach
to the crisis in North Korea thus far? Is the U.S. approach today
making a conflict more, or less likely' What should the Administration
be doing differently?
<P>
DK: North Korea's nuclear bomb program has faced this Administration
with a set of circumstances that must seem to them depressingly
familiar:
<ul>
<li> Presidential rhetoric has set out a policy that on reflection
the Administration has neither the will nor the ability to implement
and now must find a way to abandon.
<P>
<li> US allies are unwilling to support the announced position of
the President.
<P>
<li> The existing intelligence committee and military capabilities
inherited from the Cold War are inadequate to either implement
the President's policy or to cope with the failure to implement
it.
<P>
<li> Even the best of what are now viewed as possible outcomes, leaves
the US hostage to the actions of irrational, unpredictable leaders
of a regime that has demonstrated implacable hostility to our
ally, South Korea, and to the U.S.
</ul>
<P>
But the allocation of blame should be the least of our concerns
now. There are three important steps that must be taken soon to
ensure that the least possible damage results from the situation:
<P>
First, the U.S. decision must clearly convey to North Korea that
any use by them of weapons of mass destruction, whether they be
chemical, biological or nuclear, would immediately result in the
annihilation of their society. If this is not to be dismissed
as just more overheated U.S. rhetoric then the forces that would
implement this policy must be visibly put in place. If we are
going to have to learn to live with a North Korean bomb, then
we must make it clear to the North Koreans that the use of any
of their arsenal-of weapons of mass destruction would mean the
end of the history of their political leadership. To live with
a North Korean bomb is to live with a regime that has cheated
and won. We will discover that the task of ensuring that victory
does not feed the North Korean appetite requires a toughness of
policy and resolution that has not yet been seen in Washington.
<P>
Second, the inadequacies in U.S. intelligence and military posture
which left the Administration with only a series of bad options
for eliminating the North Korean program must be put right. Proliferation
has already occurred, and North Korea will not be the last case.
The highest priority must be finding effective defensive measures.
As the Administration has discovered, it is impossible to build
a coalition in favor of standing up to a nuclear cheat when the
cost of doing so involves the destruction of one's own country.
Unless we can provide our forces and our allies with meaningful
defenses against missiles and aircraft, the prospect of controlling
proliferation will become much more difficult.
<P>
Third, we must make it clear that North Korea will not be allowed
to export its military technology to others. If North Korea will
not accept effective international inspection and controls on
its nuclear program (and this seems clearly unlikely), and if
the Administration is unwilling to run the risk of a war on the
Korean peninsula to eliminate the North's nuclear capability (and
this seems clear despite occasional Presidential rhetoric to the
contrary), then it is incumbent that we and our allies use our
individual and collective rights to ensure that all of the North's
attempts to export this capability are interdicted.
<P>
EA: You led the weapons inspection effort in Iraq after the Gulf
war which uncovered Saddam Hussein's advanced nuclear program.
What lessons can you draw from your experience in Iraq for how
the Administration should approach North Korea?
<P>
DK: The clearest lesson from Iraq is that the world is better
off to intervene before a rogue state acquires a nuclear capability
than to deal with such a state after it has acquired even a crude
nuclear capability. Korea is in many ways a tougher case than
Iraq. The North is capable of inflicting truly horrible damage
on South Korea with little or no warning. Our closest ally in
the region, Japan, can now be reached by missiles from the North.
While our ability to make the North pay a high price for any such
attack remains, we have little if any ability to truly defend
against such a blow and prevent massive damage to allies and significant
American casualties. Korea, like Saddam's Iraq is a revolutionary
state bent upon overturning the regional order. It is wrong to
assume that we share common objectives with such states and that
more or better negotiations will lead to an acceptable solution
that will provide long-term stability. North Korea under its present
leadership will not play a constructive part in a stable and prosperous
Asia. Our policy should be directed toward containing the destructive
forces of North Korea while waiting for the inherent destructive
forces of the failed regime to bring about its own collapse.
<P>
EA: Can the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
be stopped, or is their proliferation inevitable?
<P>
DK: Every effort should be made to limit the further spread of
these weapons. But regardless of how vigorous such efforts are,
I believe that further significant proliferation is inevitable.
It is therefore vitally important to ensure that U.S. forces and
our allies are able to defend themselves against the use of such
weapons. We must make clear to any rogue state that the United
States cannot be intimidated from protecting its vital interests
by their possession or use of such weapons. If these states come
to believe --and this is the long-range danger of the situation
in North Korea--that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would
stop the U.S. from protecting our allies and our own interests,
then the forces of proliferation would become unstoppable. The
most effective nonproliferation policy would be rooted in a vigorous
U.S. military capability to operate and advance our foreign policy
objectives in the face of such weapons.

<H3>Kudlow, Shelton, Coulter Join Empower America Board</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America announced that two of the nation's
most respected economists, Lawrence Kudlow and Judy Shelton, and
one of America's leading entrepreneurs, Jamie Coulter, have joined
the organization's Board of Directors.
<P>
Mr. Kudlow, former Chief Economist with Bear Stearns, served as
Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
in President Reagan's first term, and was one of the principal
architects of the Reagan Administration's economic and budget
policy. Most recently, Mr. Kudlow served as Co-Chairman of the
Economic Recovery Council in New Jersey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman's election campaign, where he co-developed the tax cut
plan that helped Whitman win the 1993 race against incumbent Governor
Jim Florio.
<P>
Dr. Shelton is currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University, and is one of the nation's
foremost experts on international monetary, financial and economic
policy. She is the author of several highly-acclaimed books, including
1989's prophetic The Coming Soviet Crash (which was translated
into German and Italian), and the forthcoming Money Meltdown,
to be published by the Free Press in April of 1994.
<P>
Mr. Coulter, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of
Lonestar Steakhouse and Saloon, Inc. since 1992, is one of the
nation's most successful entrepreneurs.
<P>
He has been responsible for developing and operating more than
250 restaurants throughout the United States. And, under the umbrella
of companies he controls, more than 8,000 people are employed
in 30 states. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors
of the Young Presidents Organization, Chairman of the Venice International
University of Leadership, and as a Member of the Board of Advisors
of the Wichita State University Center for Entrepreneurship.
<P>
&quot;Larry Kudlow, Judy Shelton and Jamie Coulter bring a wealth
of experience to Empower America,&quot; said Chairman Malcolm
S. Forbes, Jr. &quot;They will play a crucial role in helping
us develop progrowth alternatives to the Clinton economic agenda,
and to champion policies that encourage entrepreneurship, create
jobs and expand opportunity for all Americans.&quot;

<H3>Following Washington State Vote, &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; Initiatives Gaining National Attention</H3>
<i>Empower America Was Early Supporter of the Innovative Anti-Crime Proposal</i>
</CENTER>
<p>


WASHINGTON, D C - Last November, when voters in Washington state
passed Prop. 593, the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; and-crime
initiative, they had no idea they were starting a national movement.
But since the historic vote, in which the ground-breaking initiative
won by a margin of more than 3-to-1, versions of the Washington
state &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law have been proposed across
the country, at both the federal and state level, drawing support
from both Democrats and Republicans alike.
<P>
Empower America was one of the earliest active supporters of the
Three Strikes idea, which would place criminals convicted of their
third violent felony in jail for life, no chance of parole. Co-Director
William Bennett -- campaigned in Washington state on behalf of
the initiative, making public appearances, publishing op-eds in
favor of the proposal, conducting interviews with local media
and preparing taped radio &quot;actualities&quot; supporting the
initiative. &quot;When this thing passes,&quot; Bennett argued
during the campaign, &quot;a lot of other states are going to
do the same thing. We do not have a health crisis in this country.
We do have a violent crime crisis.&quot;
<P>
Bennett's prediction has come to pass. Since Washington state
passed Three Strikes in November, legislation has been introduced
in Washington, DC, and as many as thirty states are considering
Three Strikes proposals. An initiative process is underway in
California to place a Three Strikes measure on the 1994 ballot;
legislation was passed last March in California to require a life
prison term with no chance of parole for 25 years for third-time
felons convicted of two violent crimes. Governor Mario Cuomo (D-NY)
has indicated support for legislation involving Three Strikes-type
provisions, and even President Clinton stated his support for
Three Strikes measures for federal crimes during his State of
the Union address this January. Some leaders, such as Gov. Zell
Miller (D-GA), have even claimed that three strikes are too many.
Miller has called for a two strikes and life law.
<P>
The Three Strikes law is intended to target the small group of
repeat offenders who commit the vast majority of violent crimes.
Studies indicate that less than 10 percent of all criminals commit
some two-thirds of all crimes.
<P>
The popularity of the Three Strikes proposal stems from the growing
concern many Americans have about the safety of their communities.
Recent national polls have shown that Americans consider crime
the number one issue facing the country, and politicians have
responded to this sentiment by proposing a number of &quot;tough
on crime&quot; initiatives, both in Washington, DC and in the
states. In addition to the various Three Strikes proposals, both
Florida and Oregon are gathering signatures to put initiatives
on the 1994 ballot which have truth in sentencing provisions prohibiting
the early release of prisoners. The Florida initiative would ensure
that prisoners serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.
<P>
Critics of Three Strikes proposals raise the cost of incarceration
as an issue. But while the average annual cost to incarcerate
an inmate is $25,000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates
that the average annual cost to society of allowing a career criminal
to roam free is $430,000. Thus, the costs of keeping criminals
on the streets and out of prison is much more significant than
the cost of keeping them in prison.
<P>
Critics also cite the discrepancy in the severity of crimes covered
by the law. The initiative passed in Washington state includes
40 crimes as violent crimes, a list which some view as too long.
Critics also argue that the Washington law does not provide rules
to prove Three Strikes, an omission which is likely to set off
a Constitutional challenge.
<P>
Whatever the outcome, the Three Strikes idea has gained significant
popular support in the current and-crime climate. Three Strikes
proposals signify a tough, realistic approach to crime and get
multiple offenders off the streets and into prison where they
belong.

<H3>Issue Briefing</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
<b>The Clinton Health Care Plan: The Making of a Crisis</b>
<P>
There is an emerging consensus that the current health care debate
is perhaps the most consequential domestic public policy debate
in recent American history. The stakes are so high because of
what the 1,364 page Health Security Act, reduced to its essence,
represents: a power-grab by the federal government that is unprecedented
in its scope, its dimensions and its political ambition.
<P>
As the health care debate proceeds, it is important that we establish
a clear concept of what constitutes (and what does not constitute)
real victory by advocates of responsible health care reform. We
believe, for example, that the defeat of the Clinton health care
plan would be an unambiguously good thing. But we also believe
that the passage of a modified version of the plan or an &quot;alternative&quot;
plan which accepts many of the flawed premises of the Clinton
plan--the Chafee plan and the Cooper-Grandy proposal come immediately
to mind--is unacceptable because they, too, would inflict real
long-term damage on the country. In sum: many of the &quot;alternatives&quot;
to the Administration's health care proposals are merely distinctions
without essential philosophical differences. Their passage would
result in a ratcheting leftward--a steady, incremental march toward
statism and collectivism. And so they, too, need to be opposed.
<P>
The good news is that a thoughtful, humane, and essentially conservative
reform of the health care system is now within the realm of legislative
possibility. Opponents of the Clinton plan should therefore resist
the calls for premature capitulation or accommodation and build
on the momentum for intelligent reform. At the same time, we need
to provide a coherent philosophical framework by which to judge
various proposals--to better establish in the public mind what
we believe should be central, and what we believe is unacceptable,
to any health care reform. . .
<P>
<b>Crime and Punishment in America</b><P>
...Crime is one of the most important issues facing America. Government's
first responsibility is the protection of its citizens from &quot;all
enemies, foreign and domestic.&quot; Those who terrorize the lives
of law abiding citizens are, by any measure, enemies; citizens
deserve protection against them. Unfortunately, under our current
system, crime often pays; high crime rates reflect this. The odds
need to be changed back in society's favor.
<P>
The Solution: Incarcerate prisoners, build more prisons and correctional
institutions, enforce prison sentences, increase the police force,
focus on juvenile crime, reduce illegitimacy...
<P>
<b>School Choice</b>
<P>
...The current system is harmful to students and undermines parental
authority. The American people sense this: more than 70 percent
of Americans support school voucher systems, and as of 1992, thirty-four
states had some form of choice legislation pending or introduced.
Increasingly, even teachers and education bureaucrats lack faith
in the system they defend--22 percent send their children to private
schools, for example, and the number is far higher in urban school
districts. The widespread support for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents--regardless of income
level--with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher will
simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents now have
a choice --they can send their child elsewhere, to another public
school, or to a private or religious school. This is the same
concept we use in higher education; students can use government
grants and loans to attend the University of Indiana, or Notre
Dame, or Yeshiva University...
<P>
<b>Clinton's SDI Cuts imperil America</b>
<P>
(Prepared exclusively for Empower America by Henry F. Cooper,
former Chief Negotiator at the Geneva Defense and Space Talks
and the first civilian SDI Director)
<P>
...In 10 years with $30 billion, the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) made dramatic technical advances enabling the deployment
of systems to protect the United States, our troops abroad, and
our friends and allies from ballistic missile attack. The 1991
Gulf War demonstrated the importance of defending civilians against
missile attack, and Congress directed that advanced defenses be
developed for deployment as soon as technology permitted. The
Bush administration left a fully funded plan, approved by a comprehensive
Pentagon acquisition review, with options to deploy advanced defenses
for our troops, friends and allies as early as 1996 and for the
American homeland as early as 1999. After Clinton's first year,
what remains is barely a shadow of the Reagan-Bush SDI legacy.
<P>
The Bush plan to protect the American homeland against limited
missile attack by as early as 1999 called for 5-times the Clinton
budget, which aspires only to support a &quot;technology readiness
program.&quot; The Bush plan included 60 percent more for advanced
technology to assure that America excels at the very competitive
edge of the technology frontier. The Clinton cuts severely constrain
efforts to respond to reactive threats that will follow from the
inevitable measure-countermeasure competition--and will stop development
of new technologies...
<P>
<b>Goals 2000</b>
<P>
...President Clinton's $420 million education bill, Goals 2000,
falls far short of the mark of qualifying as education reform,
and provides for no real change such as more choices, greater
accountability, more
<P>
local control and flexibility to teachers. Instead, the bill contains
a number of &quot;business as usual&quot; options as well as a
number of potentially harmful provisions. Unfortunately, the Clinton
Education Department receives its marching orders from the education
establishment, which has opposed every meaningful education reform
proposal during the past 20 years. The establishment is largely
responsible for engineering the worst decline in the history of
American education. And they are now in the posit ~~n of defending
one of the worst-performing systems in the world.
<P>
Our education system needs entrepreneurial reform. Here's what
that might look like: reform measures providing for accountability,
decentralization, national standards in the core subjects, merit
pay, alternative certification, and allowing parents to choose
the public, private or religious school to
<P>
which they send their children. These proposals, if implemented,
would dramatically improve American education. . .

<H3>Bennett's <I>Book of Virtues Reaches</I> Nation's Best Seller
List</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett's
<I>The Book of Virtues</I> has reached number one on the national
best-seller lists, including those complied by The New York Times,
The Los Angles Times, and The Washington Post. The book, an anthology
of great moral stones, focuses on ten virtues: self-discipline,
compassion, responsibility, friendship, work, courage, perseverance,
honesty, loyalty and faith. The purpose of the collection, Bennett
writes in his introduction, is &quot;to aid in the time-honored
task of the moral education of the young.&quot;
<P>
The book has proved not only a popular success, but a critical
success as well. It has received rave reviews in both the general
press and opinion journals from across the political spectrum,
including <I>Newsweek, Time, People, The Washington Post, The
Wall Street Journal, The New Republic, National Review</I>, and
<I>Commentary</I>.
<P>
However, despite the wide attention it has received, Bennett is
quick to emphasize that <I>The Book of Virtues</I>, was in no
way animated by politics. &quot;I commit a lot of political acts,&quot;
he recently told the Associated Press. &quot;This book was not
a political act.&quot; In a recent essay, Time magazine columnist
Lance Morrow echoed this sentiment, writing: &quot;Bennett is
not demagoguing the verities. He anthologies the old republic
and the old virtues, but he addresses virtue at a level of commonality
that is deeper than politics or nostalgia.&quot;
<P>
Perhaps what is most encouraging about the success of <I>The Book
of Virtues</I> is what it may say about changes in our culture.
The book's popularity seems an expression of the American people'
s desire to hear again --and to read again --about time honored
virtues. As U.S. News &amp; World Report put it in a recent article,
&quot;the Public longing for moral anchors helps to explain how
William Bennett's anthology ... was able to push shock-jock Howard
Stern's autobiography from the top of the bestseller list earlier
this year.&quot; Asked why he feels these moral tales have struck
a chord with the American public, Bennett answers simply: &quot;Unless
you're a criminal, these are your values.&quot;

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates a great deal of coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a sample of recent news stories that discuss Empower
America.
<P>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative organization, said Clinton's
(State of the Union) speech had one purpose: 'to resuscitate his
faltering health care plan,' which it said 'has steadily been
losing support with the American people.' 'He has manufactured
a phony health care 'crisis' to scare people into accepting his
plan to nationalize the health care industry,' said the group,
led by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and other conservatives.&quot;
<P>
--<I>San Jose Mercury News</I>, January 26, 1994
<P>
&quot;Many conservatives say Clinton's (health reform) plan is
a liberal power grab based on the illusion that there is a health
care crisis. 'The crisis will come only if the Clinton plan becomes
law,' said a press release Tuesday from Empower America The White
House responded to such criticism with offers to back off some
of its more ambitious goals...&quot;
<P>
--<I>Orlando Sentinel</I>, January 26, 1994

&quot;William Bennett--the former education secretary and drug
czar under the Reagan and Bush administrations--called for an
end to welfare, saying it fosters the dissolution of low-income
families. He advocated instead programs to strengthen the family.
He said polling data shows a change in values in America that
has worsened the crime crisis, with few modern parents looking
at their children as their most important priority. 'We have conducted
a social experiment in the last 30 years in this country along
these lines--what happens if we have lots of children and don't
raise them?' said Bennett. 'The results of that experiment are
now in.&quot;'

<P>
&quot;Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick ... took Clinton
to task, saying his just-concluded trip to Russia and Eastern
Europe was a pullback of the historic U.S. commitment. 'The U.S.
performance was largely interpreted as a retreat,' said Kirkpatrick.
Kirkpatrick ... (was) in Miami for the third regional meeting
of the new organization, Empower America.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Palm Beach Post</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;During his visit to Miami Wednesday ... Kemp says his organization
(Empower America) is reshaping the party. He called Clinton's
foreign policy in general 'a disaster' and U.S. policies in both
Bosnia and North Korea 'an empty shell.' As for the problem of
ending the cycle of poverty in American cities, 'President Clinton
doesn't have a clue.' 'We've turned our cities into socialized,
almost Third World economies,' he said. Kemp shared the podium
with Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
and former Education Secretary and war-on-drugs czar William Bennett
....&quot;
<P>
-- <I>The Miami Herald</I>, January 16, 1994
<P>
&quot;Jack Kemp ... blasted the Administration's first year as
a failure in foreign policy .... 'The President's administration
has been close to a disaster in terms of credibility,&quot; Kemp
said Wednesday. Kemp ... Ridiculed Clinton for allowing 'a bunch
of thugs with AK47 submachineguns' to force a U.S. Navy warship
to leave Haiti. He criticized Clinton for being too soft on North
Korea's nuclear threat, and said the administration has fumbled
the Bosnia crisis with its inaction.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Marietta Daily Journal</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;Vin Weber, Co-Director of Empower America ... (noted) that
the version of the (balanced budget) amendment sponsored by Senator
Paul Simon, D-Ill., that is being debated on the Senate floor
would make tax cuts designed to stimulate economic growth unlikely,
largely because any tax cut would be seen as adding to the deficit.

<B>&quot;A Cultural Renaissance&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Jack Kemp, Co-Director, Empower America, delivered at Hillsdale College
<P>
...A government conceived in liberty has none of the tools of
tyranny. It depends, instead, on other institutions-- structures
between the individual and the state--that instill character,
purpose, and virtue. Churches and synagogues that raise a moral
standard. Parents who provide a moral and spiritual example to
their children. Schools that teach, not only the basics of math
and history, but the basics of citizenship and character that
come from an understanding of the Decalogue as well as the Declaration
of Independence.
<P>
Can we separate economics and values? The choice is not necessary.
The achievements of capitalism depend on the achievements of the
human spirit, nurtured in families. I am a believer in the power
and promise of free markets, free minds, and free nations. I am
also a believer in fostering the values that make them possible.
And I will admit no conflict between them. . .
<P>
<B>Commencement Remarks at Pepperdine University's School of Business
and Management</B> 
<P>
By Theodore J. Forstmann, Founding
<P>
Chairman, Empower America
<P>
...Basically, there are just two ways to organize society. The
first is the statist society, in which inequalities are reconciled,
resources are redistributed, and interaction is regulated through
the machinery of the state. The other is the civil society, in
which people organize themselves through voluntary association.
It's an old argument, filled with a lot of ideological 'isms'
and intellectual pretensions, but it basically comes down to a
question of who has the power to make some of the most important
decisions in your life. Do you invest your money, or does someone
else invest it for you? Do you choose your children's schools,
or are they assigned? Can you give to the charity of your choice,
or is the money funneled to state welfare programs? When you get
sick, can you pick your doctor or is your health-care plan prescribed.
<P>
The irony of the politicization of American life is that no country
on the face of the earth could be more ill-fitted for statism
than the United States of America. This is not a value judgment.
It is a simple statement of fact. For better or for worse, the
American spirit is not a bureaucratic spirit. It's a risk-taking,
rulebreaking, establishment-shaking spirit. While Western Europe
was groomed for statism in its centuries of monarchical rule,
America was born of revolution. For 60 years now, we have been
subjected to the materialist wisdom of the state as it imposed
ever increasing levels of social engineering. Today, sadly, we
all reap its non-spiritual devastating rewards...
<P>
<B>Closing Remarks at Empower America's National Economic Conference</B>

<P>
By Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., Chairman of the Board, Empower America
<P>
...We're living in a world where, more and more, capital is intangible.
It's in the mind. And if people don't have an education, don't
have that tool, they're never going to get ahead. They're never
going to fulfill their potential. This new age is symbolized by
the microchip which is extending the reach of the human brain
the way machines extended the reach of human muscle in the last
century. The microchip, which is doubling in power every 18 months,
will dramatically expand our standard of living.
<P>
Our nation must take the lead to create and preserve not only
a national environment but an international environment where
democracy, pluralism, tolerance and free markets can take root
and flourish. Only we can guarantee that this will happen. If
we don't take the lead in making sure that there is a benign world
order, an environment where freedom can flourish, no one else
will. . .
<P>
<B>&quot;An Agenda for Economic Growth&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Lawrence Kudlow, Economist and Member of Empower America's
Board of Directors, Delivered at Empower America's National Economic
Conference
<P>
...During the Bush Administration some Republicans became ashamed
of their support for a lower capital gains tax. They cowered before
anyone who cried 'fairness' and abandoned the effort to reduce
it further and index it for inflation. By doing so, they surrendered
a core principle of successful economic policy: the idea that
growth comes from dynamism, risk-taking, and entrepreneurship
and that we cannot punish productive capital with a confiscatory,
unindexed tax on capital gains.
<P>
The entrepreneur suffers the most from bloated government spending
because he or she looks to government for little, but pays the
most every time taxes go up. Government &quot;investment&quot;--the
latest euphemism for more spending--may help a special interest
group, but the rest of society will suffer as incentives are blunted
and risk-taking is punished. Our economic and cultural policies
should nourish and support the family and the family-owned business,
not undermine them. We must pass an end to economic and social
policies which obstruct risk-taking in the marketplace and traditional
values at home. We need a vision that offers people maximum incentive
to succeed and a complementary vision that offers them maximum
faith and hope when they go home to their families...

<i>Regional Meeting Draws 400 Local Activists</i>
<P>
MIAMI, FL - Empower America drew over 400 local activists to its
fourth regional conference, held in Miami, Florida, January 19,
1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage participants
in open discussion with Empower America's Co-Directors William
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Vin Weber and other political
leaders, in an effort to promote conservative grassroots activism
throughout the nation.
<P>
Participants in the Miami meeting discussed issues such as crime,
foreign policy and the economy at the one-day meeting. The morning
session, led by Empower America Co-Director William Bennett, focused
on national and community crime issues. Looking back on his tenure
as Drug Czar in the Bush Administration, Bennett told the grassroots
activists, &quot;I traveled to more than 100 communities in America,
most of which were poor communities. And whenever I visited these
communities I never heard people say 'let's deal with the root
causes of crime.'
<P>
What they kept asking me is, 'why can't you keep criminals off
the streets?' Our poor communities deserve the same protection
that society provides its more affluent communities.&quot; Joining
Dr. Bennett in the discussion were local experts who addressed
issues such as local law enforcement and community policing.
<P>
Among the highlights was a presentation by U.S. Senator Connie
Mack (R-FL), who addressed the conference on the Clinton administration's
domestic policy. Mack told the audience that since taking office,
President Clinton had largely backed away from his conservative
campaign promises. &quot;I'm very disappointed,&quot; Mack said,
'I'd give him a 'D' for his first year.&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp chaired the afternoon discussion on community empowerment
and conservative prescriptions for economic renewal. As for the
problem of ending the cycle of poverty in American cities and
promoting economic growth for all, Kemp said, &quot;we've turned
our inner cities into socialized, almost Third World economies.
President Clinton is moving in the wrong direction. Instead of
easing government's burden on the American taxpayer and entrepreneur,
he's raised taxes, discouraged entrepreneurship and now he's trying
to nationalize health care, all under the disguise of a recovering
economy he has inherited.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will be hosting its next regional conferences
in Houston on May l9th and San Francisco on June 1st. For more
details on how you can participate in upcoming regional meetings,
call Empower America toll-free at 1-800-4EMPOWER.

<H3>Kirkpatrick Assails Clinton Policy in Europe</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>


MIAMI, FL--At Empower America's recent regional conference in
Miarni, former UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick gave an assessment
of the Clinton administration's policy in Europe, arguing that
President Clinton's recent statements, and the U.S. performance
at the recent NATO Summit, were viewed by the Europeans as &quot;a
broad policy of withdrawal, (and) a weakening of America's NATO
role in Europe.&quot; According to Kirkpatrick, the Europeans
believe foreign policy is more concerned with power than democratic
ideals, and the Clinton administration's fitful responses to the
reemergence of Europe's historical balance of power concerns has
produced an unnecessary and growing ambiguity about U.S. purposes
in Europe and in NATO.
<P>
By its failure to exercise U.S. Leadership in Europe and in NATO,
and by delegating too much authority to the United Nations Secretary
General, the Administration, Kirkpatrick asserted, has permitted
collective security to be weakened and &quot;has had a difficult
time finding common ground with our European allies.&quot;

1994. I look forward to building on this record of success.&quot;

<H3>What's Ahead for 1994</H3>
<P>
1993 has been a very successtul year for EmpowerAmerica. 
We created and built a brand new organization from the ground 
up, and with your support has forged it
into a powerful political voice for promoting
innovative ideas in the public arena. 
<P>
Now, as 1994 approaches, we have kicked off a number of exiting
projects for our second  year:
<UL>
<LI>To make sure that the campaigns of 1994 are tough on the
issues you and I care about, next year Empower America will be
hosting candidate training schools across the United States.
<LI>On Decomber 14, 1993, the one year anniversary of  President
Clinton's economic summit in Little Rock, Empower  America will
be hosting an economic summit of its own to assess the Clinton
Administration's perforrnance and to begin developing alternatives
to Clinton's economic agenda. <A HREF="/empower/aehigh21_2.html">
(see article)</A>.
<LI>In 1993, Empower America worked hard to promote Proposition
174, the California school choice initiative, and Proposition
593 the anticrime initiative  in Washington State, which places
repeat offenders convicted of their third felony in jail for life,
with no chance of parole, probation or work release. In 1994,
we will be backing more of these kinds of grassroots campaigns
in states across the country.
<LI>As the Clinton team continues to grope for a coherent foreign
policy we believe it is time for a serious dialogue on preserving
America 's leading role on the world stage. To this end, Empower<B>
</B>America plans<B> </B>to host its first major conference on
international issues.
<LI>And finally we will continue to expand Empower America's
efforts to bring our message of empowerment, opportunity and entrepreneurial
capitalism to new groups of citizens by establishing Empower America's
&quot;Community Empowerment Project.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
As you can see, 1994 will be an important year for us. We look
forward to working with you, and to seeing you at our 1994 regional
conferences. Please keep us informed about your ideas on how we
can make EA more effective in fighting for the ideas we believe
in.

<H3>NAFTA Approved by Congress</H3>
<P>
<I>Empower America Campaign Credited as Central to Securlng NAFTA
Victory</I>
<P>
<B>Washington, DC  </B>On November 17, the House of Representatives
voted 234 200 to approve The <B>North American Free Trade
Agreement</B> (NAFTA), the historic accord which will now link the
economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada into the world's
largest and most powerful free trading bloc. Days later the accord
easily passed the Senate, and will now be implemented beginning
January 1,1994.
<P>
The battle for NAFTA was hard fought, and Empower America's efforts
to help pass the trade pact were described by many as central
to the victory in Congress. In an article published before the
House vote, columnist Morton Kondracke praised Empower America's
efforts on behalf of NAFTA, calling them a model for other conservative
leaders to emulate. Empower America and its CoDirector Jack Kemp,
Kondracke wrote, &quot;are doing what the entire GOP leadership
should be doing: making passage of NAFTA one of its top priorities
for 1993... Kemp boosts NAFTA in every speech, blankets the nation's
oped pages with proNAFTA columns and is circulating a...proNAFTA
(open letter to America) among the nation's governors. Now other
GOP leaders need to take up the cause in an equally public way.&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Empower America was one of the earliest vocal supporters
of NAFTA. Early on, Kemp published proNAFTA opeds that ran in
newspapers in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois,
Missouri, North Carolina, New York, Texas, Georgia, Arizona and
Massachusetts, spreading the NAFTA message to some 4.17 million
Americans. And, as the House vote neared, Kemp played a key role
delivering the GOP vote for NAFTA and winning over undecided House
Republicans
<P>
Empower America concentrated its efforts on bringing in the votes
of undecided Republicans, many of whom supported NAFTA in principle
but were hesitant to &quot;deliver a big victory for Bill Clinton.&quot;
Just one week before the vote, Kemp held a private, closed door
meeting on Capitol Hill with some 40 undecided GOP House Members
to discuss their concerns about the vote. Paraphrasing Lincoln,
Kemp told the Republicans to vote on their convictions on NAFTA
because &quot;you serve your party by serving your country.&quot;
Immediately following the meeting, Kemp held a Capitol Hill press
conference, at which several previously undecided Members announced
their support for NAFTA.
<P>
The following Sunday, Kemp appeared on &quot;This Week With David
Brinkley&quot; to argue the case for NAFTA. The next night, just
two days before the vote, Kemp took on conservative NAFTA
opponent Pat Buchanan in a oneonone debate, broadcast on CNN's
&quot;Larry King Live&quot;. The day before the vote, Kemp published
an editorial in the Washington Post, cowritten with Rep. Dick
Armey (TX), laying out the reasons why conservatives should support
NAF TA. And Kemp worked the phones lobbying Members who were still
wavering.
<P>
In the end, all these efforts paid off, as Republicans came through
for NAFTA, voting in favor by an overwhelming 132-43. The solid
GOP support provided the margin of victory for NAFTA&#151; as
the final tally showed, Clinton would never have succeeded in
passing the accord had he depended solely on his party's vote
in Congress.
<P>
With NAFTA now signed into law, Empower America is now calling
on the Clinton Administration to use the momentum the GOP has
provided him on free trade, and move quickly to expand NAFTA to
other Latin American countries. In a Wall Street Journal oped
published just after the House vote, Empower America President
Vin Weber called on the President to immediately &quot;pursue
the next step in building a hemispheric free trade zone: negotiations
to incorporate Chile, Argentina and Venezuela into the NAFTA trading
bloc.&quot;
<P>
Whether Clinton heeds this advice and continues to support free
trade policies, or seeks to heal his Administrations wounds
with organized labor by moving left again, remains to be seen.
But one thing is certain: thanks to the support of Congressional
Republicans, Ronald Reagan's vision of a North American free
trade zone has finally become a reality. Empower America is proud
to have played a major role in this historic effort.
<P>

<H3>The Forced Collectivization of Medicine</H3>
<P>
By Jack Kemp
<P>
After a Clinton Administration official let slip that 40% of Americans
will pay more under its health care plan, the President's media
rapid response team went immediately into action...to change the
subject.
<P>
The diversion they chose was a frontal assault on insurance companies.
&quot;It is time,&quot; Hillary Clinton told an audience of doctors,
&quot;for...every American to stand up and say to the insurance
industry, 'Enough is enough. We want our health care system back.'...It
is time we stood up and said, 'We are tired of insurance companies
running our health care system.'&quot;
<P>
The First Lady's attack would have been more credible if not for
this ironic fact: The centerpiece of the Clinton health plan is
a dramatic increase in the power of insurance companies over the
health of Americans&#151;the power to ration medical care.
<P>
Remember, first, how the Clinton proposal is designed to cut health
costs. It would create regional &quot;Health Alliances&quot; that
would enforce a health care budget by placing legal limits on
what insurance companies could charge. Insurers could be fined
if their premiums don't meet these caps on health costs.
<P>
The result? Only those insurance companies that place the most
effective, restrictive controls on what they are charged by doctors
and hospitals will survive. By some estimates, only 5 or 6 insurers
will remain, and each of these companies will provide &quot;managed
care&quot;&#151; programs to cut costs and meet a budget set by
government.
<P>
How is that budget met? Insurance companies will dictate how doctors
and hospitals reduce expenses. Insurance reviewers, or &quot;gatekeepers,&quot;
will micromanage medical treatments to cut costs, secondguessing
doctors and nurses. These bureaucrats with little direct knowledge
of a patient, will effectively have the final say on what specialists
that patient can see, or what tests and technology they deserve.
<P>
This, in essence, is the Clinton plan: Big government would require
a few big insurance companies to meet smaller health budgets.
Those companies, to cut costs, would do the dirty work of rationing.
<P>
Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute recently described how this
rationing process works in other nations with nationalized health
care. In Canada, hundreds of medical procedures and drugs that
once were covered by national insurance have been declared too
expensive and are no longer paid for&#151;a process Canadians
call &quot;delisting.&quot;
<P>
In Germany, a 1989 reform reduced the range of medical services
covered by that nation's &quot;social insurance&quot; program.
The story is similar in Britain, Spain, Sweden&#151; and Oregon.
Yes, Oregon.
<P>
That state's Medicaid program lists 709 medical services in order
of urgency. The list is then matched against the amount of government
funding available in the health budget. Only 535 medical procedures
made the cut this year, while the remainder will not be paid.
So, for example, the treatment of swelling of the esophagus&#151;
numbered 538&#151;is covered. Disk surgery&#151;number 536 --is
not.
<P>
The Clinton plan's national budget for health care would make
this kind of rationing inevitable for every American.
<P>
&quot;When individuals pay for their own health care,&quot; Michael
Tanner concludes, &quot;they decide what services to buy. When
government pays for health care, it decides what services it will
pay for. The availability of health care services becomes subject
to the whims of majority rule.&quot;
<P>
Even Stanford University's Alain Enthoven, one of the original
designers of &quot;managed competition,&quot; has opposed the
Clinton plan because it uses health alliances to impose price
controls.
<P>
Nationalized health care always puts bureaucrats in the business
of choosing who deserves care, and who does not. In the Clinton
plan, those bureaucrats would work for insurance companies, enforcing
a health budget set by the government. In other countries, those
bureaucrats work for the government directly. The effect, in
either case, is precisely the same: a decline in the quality
and accessibility of medicine.
<P>
<B>Bad Medicine: The Clinton Health Care Plan</B>
<P>
Despite the hours of television time and millions of dollars spent
by the Clinton Administration to drum up support for its health
care reform plan, the public isn't being told much about the details.
A close look at these details reveals why:<B> </B>the President's
health care plan masks the largest power grab by the federal government
in recent history.
<P>
Here's what the Clinton administration won't tell you about their
health care plan:
<P>
I. <B>Government bureaucracies will be granted massive new powers
to ration care, set price controls, and eliminate competition.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Price Controls: Central to the President's plan is the
creation of a new bureaucracy, the National Health Board (NHB)
which would set &quot;global budgets,&quot; or limits on the total
amount of public and private spending on health care. It would
also set price controls on insurance premiums and prescription
drug prices.
<LI>Rationed Care: If total health care spending exceeds the
governmentset &quot;global budget,&quot; rationing must follow.
Managedcare &quot;gatekeepers&quot; will have systemic incentives
to ration care to comply with the spending caps imposed on them
by governmental health bureaucracies.
<LI>Tyrannical Enforcement: The National Health Board would
also have bigbrotherish enforcement powers. If a state fails to
fully comply with its edicts, the NHB can cut off all health care
funds to the state or direct the Secretary of the Treasury to
impose a payroll tax on every employer in the state.
<LI>Outlawing Traditional Medicine: Everyone will be required
to purchase insurance through governmental &quot;health alliances&quot;
in each region. Health alliances choose which insurance plans
consumers can choose among; they can shut out any plan whose premium
is 20% above the average,
thereby eliminating feeforservice (traditional) medicine and forcing
all residents of a particular region into HMOs. Clinton's plan
could take away citizens' ability to choose their doctor.
</UL>

<B>II. The President's plan cannot be
 paid for without drastic tax or deficit increases.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Underestimated Costs: Clinton originally estimated the
cost of his plan to be $30 billion; now, most economists place
that figure at least $120 billion higher. Harvard Economist Martin
Feldstein estimated that the plan would require an additional
$120 billion in taxes in the first year alone.
<LI>Unrealistic Expectasions: The President plans to expand
Medicare to include prescription drug and longterm care coverage
(price tag: $152 billion) while realizing a net savings of $124
billion:cutting &quot;waste and fraud.&quot; He relies on a steep new
cigarette tax to finance the bulk of government subsidies, even
though many studies have shown that his tax will bring in less
than half of the revenues he is counting on.
</UL>
<B>III. Economic downturn and job destruction will result.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Employer Mandates: Small companies will face a payroll
tax of 3.5%&#151;an estimated $29 billion in new costs to those
small companies which now account for around 80% of new job creation.
Larger companies would have to pay 7.9% of their payroll.
<LI>Job Loss: The Employment Policies Institute estimates that
Clinton's employer mandates will eliminate 3.1 million jobs.
<LI>Dislocation: The health care industry accounts for 14%
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs 10 million people.
Huge changes in the structure and delivery of health care will
lead to significant dislocation and further job loss.
<LI>Stunted Innovations: Price controls on premium caps and
drug prices will stunt pharmaceutical and biomedical research
and development, which in turn, will postpone or eliminate the
opportunity to develop new drugs, prevention medicines, and disease
cures.
</UL>
<B>IV. Clinton's health plan strips individuals of choice,
autonomy, and privacy.</B>
<UL>
<LI>No Choice of Benefits: The Clinton Administration will
draw up a &quot;standardized benefits package;'9 that every American
is required to purchase. The content of this package will inevitably
be politicized.
<LI>Loss of Medical Privacy: Clinton would require every American
to carry with them at all times a &quot;National Health Care Card&quot;
which would contain one's entire medical history on a computerized strip. 
Anyone who can gain
electronic access (legally or illegally) to the computer system
could access an individual's medical records.
</UL>

<P>
President Clinton's health care plan begins with a wrong assumption
and ends with the wrong treatment. The President seeks to convince
us that our health care system&#151;which has consistently delivered
the best, most technologically advanced care in the world&#151;is
so broken that it must be replaced by bureaucracies and governmental
oversight. The flaws of our current health care system are real
and demand redress; changes in malpractice, tax, and insurance
laws are all necessary. But President Clinton's plan to disempower
Americans by placing the government in charge of health care will
ultimately result in higher prices, greater inefficiency, and
poorer health care.

<H3>EmpowerAmerica Launches 1994 Candidate Schools</H3>
<P>
Empower America is initiating a series of issues-oriented 1994
Candidate Schools to provide candidates at the local, state, and
national levels a coherent and comprehensive empowerment agenda.
These schools, to be held early next year in Washington, D.C.,
San Francisco, Denver, Detroit, Atlanta, and New York will focus
on economic competitiveness, growth, and entrepreneurship, free
trade, international leadership, health care, as well as education,
welfare, and crime.
<P>
Currently there are a number of political schools that address
the nuts-and-bolts of campaigns: fundraising, electoral strategies,
opposition research, and direct mail. What is missing, however,
are schools that present candidates with the <I>substantial </I>elements
of a political agenda and how best to campaign on such issues.
<P>
Candidates will be given a briefing book and a series of papers
authored by policy experts explaining the elements of the empowerment
agenda. Each candidate school will then be led by policy experts
who will explain the issues in detail, and political analysts
and pollsters who will instruct candidates on how to translate
the agenda into a winning campaign. Empower America's principals,
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber will
offer insights based on their political experience in governmental
leadership.
<P>
Interested candidates or campaign managers should contact Empower
America at 1-800-332-2000.

<H3>From the Grassroots....</H3>
<P>
Empower America held three successful grassroots events during the fall.
In Los Angeles, California, William Bennett, Vin Weber and Jack
Kemp greeted over 700 Empower America associates and supporters
at a highenergy reception honoring several of that city's noteworthy
citizen! who are devoted to the ideals of empowering individuals.
Also, it was our pleasure to be joined by Robert Woodson, Sr.
of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, Orson Swindle
of Empower America, and Leon Watkins of the Family Help Line,
all of whom played essential roles in the evening's success.
<P>
In Dallas, Texas, our members gathered for a daylong conference
led by Jack Kemp and Vin Weber to address topics of vital interest
to southwest America. The eloquent conservative insight of former
Chief of Staff to Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and the hardhitting
pragmatism of Dallas' own, Mayor Steve Bartlett were major attractions.
We were also joined by local area experts for panel discussions
on the economy and NAFTA.
<P>
In New York City, Empower America held a dinner and panel discussion
with some notable conservative leaders. Joining Jack Kemp, Bill
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, was radio talk show
host Rush Limbaugh. Also in attendance was National Review founder
and Editor-at-Large William F. Buckley, Jr.
<P>
We are currently scheduling 1994 conferences for Miami, Houston,
San Francisco, and New York.

<H3>Empower America and GrassRoot state Initiatives</H3>
<P>
By William J. Bennett
<P>
On November 2,1993, citizens of the C November 2,1993, citizens
of state of Washington passed two important referenda that should
serve as models to other states, and will hopefully be a harbinger
of things to come. Their success reflects a growing (and healthy)
citizen conviction that government's primary duty is to protect
its people, rather than confiscate and redistribute their income.
<P>
Proposition 593, also known as &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out,&quot;
will place criminals convicted of their third violent felony in
prison for life, with no chance for parole, probation, or work
release. The simple logic of ensuring the incarceration of the
most dangerous and violent criminals made plenty of sense to the
citizens of Washington state; &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot;
garnered the support of 75% of the voters.
<P>
The reasons for Proposition 593's landslide victory are straightforward:
violent crime is destroying our social and civic order. And despite
evidence that the crime problem is largely caused by a small group
of hardcore criminals (studies indicate that two thirds of all violent
crimes are committed by less than 10 percent of criminals), government
has done little to protect law abiding citizens from these predators.
While the modern state has expanded its reach into virtually every
aspect of citizens' lives, it has increasingly abdicated its first
responsibility: to ensure public safety. Citizens are afraid and
they want to fight back; the passage of &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; is a very good start. It may well serve as a blueprint
for other states, and has already been passed as an amendment
to a comprehensive crime bill awaiting passage in the U.S. Senate.
<P>
Voters also registered their opposition to an ever expanding &quot;nanny
state&quot; that takes too much from us in order to do too much
for us.
<P>
Proposition 601 restrains future state spending growth and tax
increases by limiting the growth of the state budget to the population
and inflation growth rate and mandates that any new tax increase
must be approved by the voters. Proposition 601's success heralds
a rising tide of public support for job creation over social service
expansion, and economic opportunity over higher spending. Today
there is an enormous gap between what people believe government
can do and what it actually can do. The passage of Proposition
601 is a first step toward narrowing the gap and securing a progrowth,
fiscally responsible economic program.
<P>
Conservatives need to lead a national conversation that examines
anew the relationship between government and the governed. What
happened on the first Tuesday in November was a good place to
begin. And events in Washington state should remind people to
look less to the nation's capital and more to the states and localities,
those &quot;laboratories of democracy,&quot; where the most innovative
reforms are taking place.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>

This has been a very busy three months. We launched our grassroots
citizens' action campaign to defeat the Clinton tax increases.
The Clinton plan wilI~ raise taxes, destroy jobs and increase&#151;not
lower&#151;the federal budget deficit. We worked hard to defeat
it. Many of you received your Tax Action Packet, which explained
what you could do in your own state to help defeat the Clinton
plan. Jack Kemp, WilL; am Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and I gave
literally hundreds of radio and TV interviews, attacking the plan
and explaining why it will be so destructive to our economy. We
also launched an eightstate grassroots lobbying campaign to put
voter pressure on speciallytargeted, key &quot;swing vote&quot;
Senators. We appreciate the thousands of petition signatures that
you gathered and returned to us. And thanks to your generous support,
we were able to produce and place antitax radio ads on the Rush
Limbaugh show.
<P>
We're also working to promote positive change in America. We've
gotten behind the &quot;A Better Choice&quot; school choice ballot
initiative in California. It's the kind of innovative empowerment
idea America needs. It's a tough fight&#151;the antichoice forces
are spending millions of dollars to defeat us. But we're fightina
to win.
<P>
School choice will be one of the central themes at Empower America's
reception in Los Angeles September 23rd. The evening will feature
speeches by both William Bennett and Jack Kemp.
<P>
Our first conference in Milwaukee was a huge hit&#151;we sold
out all 700 spots. We'll also be holding regional conferences
this year in Dallas, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona. To get a copy
of our special video of the Milwaukee conference, send in the
form on the last page of this newsletter.
<P>
We look forward to seeing many of you in LA, and appreciate all
your hard work in the antitax effort. Together, we can make a
difference.
<P>
<B>Vin Weber, President</B>

Three years ago, Americans were hit with the highest tax increase
in history because of the disastrous 1990 Budget Deal that was
sold on the promise to reduce the deficit by $500 billion. Sound
familiar? The result: the deficit exploded to over $300 billion,
taxes were raised on the &quot;rich,&quot; while revenues were
reduced and the economy suffered from anemic growth.
<P>
History demonstrates that economic growth and deficit reduction
cannot be achieved through higher taxes and promises of future
spending cuts. The parallels between the 1990 Budget Deal and
President Clinton's 1993 Budget Deal are remarkable. Both packages
rely heavily on &quot;soaktherich taxes,&quot; a regressive gas
tax, and the hope that a future Congress will cut spending. Specifically,
the 1990 Budget Deal raised taxes by $158 billion. Clinton's package
will nearly double that tax increase. Moreover, 80% of all spending
cuts in the 1993 Budget Deal are not scheduled to take effect
until after 1996.
<P>
One would think that somewhere along the way to constructing and
selling a budget package that is a mirror image of the deal struck
less than three years ago, someone would check whether the desired
results were achieved. Apparently, it is not in President Clinton's
nature to do so. Now that data from the 1990 Budget Deal is in,
we can compare the promises with the results. According to the
IRS, in 1991 the rich paid 6.1 % less in taxes even though their
tax rates were raised in 1990. Can Clinton blame this on the
slow economy? No, he cannot. The middle class paid more in
taxes (1% more)
even though their tax rates stayed the same. According to projections
of the 1990 Budget Deal, the deficit this year should be $142
billion. In fact, it is over $300 billion.
<P>
There is nothing new in the President's tax and spend asoroach;
it has been tried again and again, not once achiev
ing lower deficits and higher growth. The reason why people are
buying into the President's call for sacrifice (through higher
taxes on Americans as the only alternative to smaller deficits)
is that there has been no complete explanation of the ramifications
of the Clinton plan. However, the blame can be extended across
party lines. Unf ortunately, many Republicans, along with the
Democrats, have paid zero atten
tion to the real alternative - GROWTH.
<P>
Americans, after reading the fine print, will come to realize
what is in store for them. Will higher taxes, massive cuts in
defense spending and a growing dependency on government services
lead to longterm prosperity? Or will a broader tax base through
lower rates and the responsible scalingback of government free
up the resources that individuals and families can use to control
their own destinies? The real defining issue is whether we allow
our Tiation to cure its economic ills through growth or taxation.
I side with growth and the American people.

<H3>American Leadership or Disengagement?</H3>


<B>By Jeane Kirkpatrick</B>
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised a middle class
tax cut, while President Bill Clinton has increased the taxes
on the middle class.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised American armed
forces second to none, while President Bill Clinton has cut the
defense budget so deeply that the Secretary of Defense was forced
to change U.S. strategy and Clinton has also demoralized the armed
forces by imposing, without consultation, decisions that violate
basic American standards and values.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Clinton promised American air strikes,
if necessary, to save Bosnian civilians from Serbian aggression.
President Clinton has only followed the European lead in doing
nothing for too long.
<P>
Candidate Clinton promised to preserve U.S. leadership, but President
Clinton has retreated from a policy of leadership to a point of
acquiescent multilateralism. &quot;We have taken the lead,&quot;
said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, &quot;in passing to
multilateral bodies decisions and action on threats to peace.&quot;
They call it leadership. These policies variously called assertive
multilateralism, or cooperative security are, in fact, policies
of progressive AmeAcan disengagement and abdication.
<P>
The policy of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; is applied far
beyond the issue of gays in the military to other important questions
of preparedness, morale and AmeAcan power.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how robust or hollow our military forces
will be after the scheduled cuts have been carried out.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what President Clinton will do when it becomes
even clearer that Iraq and North Korea are developing nuclear
weapons in spite of promises to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what the Clinton Administration will do
when it is undeniably clear that China is selling missile technology
to Pakistan and nuclear technology to Iran - in spite of promises
to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how the Clinton Administration proposes
to protect the continental United States from missiles launched
by the world's most violent dictators now that they have eliminated
funding for a strategic missile defense.
<P>
The President and Secretary of State have shown signs of improved
clarity and effectiveness in Lebanon and Bosnia, but not enough.
Further evidence of American disengagement can be perceived in
a variety of Clinton Administration decisions to date: the unconditional
extension of Most Favored Nation status to China, the unconditional
diplomatic recognition of the MPLA government of Angola, the uncon
ditional release of financial assistance to Nicaragua, the Administration's
continuing inaction on the North American Free Trade Agreement
and related hemispheric matters.
<P>
Some see in the U.S. insistence on multilateralism in economic
relations with Russia yet another example of a deliberate nonleadership
style in foreign policy.
<P>
Is the Clinton Administration renouncing the global leadership
the United States has excercised since World War II? Secretary
of State Warren ChAstopher has suggested that is the case, and
other State Department officials have recently emphasized the
Administration's determination to reduce U.S. commitments abroad.
<P>
One can only hope that our new president will heed the emerging
warning signs of the large price we, and the world, could pay
for abdication of U.S. leadership. The worldwide increase of terrorism
that has spread to the United States is a dramatic wakeup call.
A disengaged and unprepared America courts the very problems it
seeks to avoid.

<H3>The Politics of School Choice</H3>
<P>
<B>By William J. Bennett</B>
<P>
Over the last 30 years, we have witnessed a sharp decline in the
quality of public education. Today, low test scores, consistently
high dropout rates, drug use and increasing violence characterize
many of our public schools. Even as per student expenditures have
jumped (in constant 199192 dollars) from $2,035 in 1960 to $5,247
in 1990, student performance has continued to decline. Median
SAT scores have fallen almost 80 points over the last three decades,
and a recent international comparison of math and science skills
scored Americans at the bottom of the list of industrialized countries.
We need real reform, and we need it now.
<P>
The problem with our public schools is not a lack of money. Indeed,
both teacher salaries and overall educational expenditures have
increased dramaticallv. The failure of our schools is systemic:
despite the poor record of many schools,
unionization has strengthened the education establishment's power
over students and parents. Teachers' unions have made it virtually
impossible to fire even the most inept educator, and have freed
administrators from accountability. Parents, particularly lowerincome
parents, have few recourses, since they often lack the financial
means to send their child elsewhere.
<P>
The current system is a wreck; it hurts students, it undermines
parents and it perpetuates a social injustice. The American people
sense this: more than 70% of Americans support school voucher
systems, and as of 1992, 34 states were considering various school
choice initiatives. Increasingly, even teachers and education
bureaucrats lack faith in the system they defend&#151;22% send
their children to private schools, for example, and that number
is far higher in urban school districts. The widespread support
for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents - regardless of income
level - with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher
will simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents would
now have a choice - they could send their child elsewhere,
to another public school, or to a private or religious school.
This is the same concept we use in higher education; students
can use government grants and loans to attend the University of
Indiana, Notre Dame or Yeshiva University. Higher education performs
better because of the competition.
<P>
The intellectual debate about school choice is just about over.
It will increase competition, accountability and parental involvement.
It will save taxpayers money. Indeed, school choice is the most
important and farreaching education reform in America.
<P>
The only people to benefit from the public schools' lock on educational
resources are those who hold the key&#151;the teachers' unions
and the educational bureaucracy they represent. The National Education
Association (the nation's largest union with 2.1 million
members) has a
vested interest in ensuring public schools' monopoly over taxpayer
money, which is why they are raising teachers' dues for the express
purpose of funneling more than $15 million into a campaign to
defeat school choice in California. That is why we at Empower
America are taking a leading role in the fight for school choice
in California. As a recent <I>Forbes </I>article noted, &quot;The
public may be only dimly aware of it, but the union's growing
power has exactly coincided with the dismal spectacle of rising
spending on education producing deteriorating results.&quot; 
<P>
The timehonored task of education is to provide children with
sound intellectual and moral instruction. School choice empowers
parents to select schools that reflect the values and the academic
goals that they hold for their children.

<H3>Success in Milwaukee</H3>

<I>Standing Room Only at Conference</I>
<P>
&quot;...more than 700 regional political activists gathered
here. . .to celebrate. . .ideas. Conservative ideas such as public
school choice, welfare limits, free enterprise-style economic incentives
and things as basic as good oldfashioned tax cutting.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Wisconsin State Journal, </I>June 26, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton's economic, foreign and social policy
initiatives were found lacking by three prominent conservatives
who were in Milwaukee for the first meeting of a new national
organization called Ernpower America.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Milwaukee Sentinel, </I>June 25, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
Well over 700 enthusiastic supporters crowded into Milwaukee's
Italian Community Center on June 25th to hear Empower America's
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick as they launched
their series of regional conferences. With more than twenty events
scheduled over the next 18 months, these conferences are designed
to integrate national policies with state and local initiatives
and programs.
<P>
The Milwaukee event featured a morning session of comments by
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick, followed by
energetic question and answer sessions.
<P>
The lunch session featured two prominent conservative leaders.
Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, a member of Empower America's
Gubernatorial Advisory Board, listed his state's numerous innovations
in the areas of education and welfare reform. Bob Woodson, president
of The National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, focused on
reviving our nation's inner cities through economic growth and
policies which encourage home ownership and &quot;workfare&quot;,
not welfare.
<P>
The afternoon panels emphasized school choice and economic growth,
and provided an indepth look at efforts in these areas on the
local and state levels.

<H3>Battling for School Choice:EA Joins the
Grassroots Effort in Calif. </H3>

<P>
On November 2, the people of California will vote on Proposition
174, a revolutionary school choice initiative tesignet to empower
parents, reform education and save taxpayers money. The initiative
would give parents the opportunity to choose where their children
will be educated&#151;at a public, private or religious school.
If parents choose a public school, that school receives full funding,
about $5,200 per child. If parents choose a private or religious
school, they will receive a voucher worth half that amount, about
$2,600, to be used to pay the tuition (62 percent of California's
private schools cost $2,600 or less.)
<P>
Empower America is playing a leading role in the battle for school
choice in California. CoDirector William 1. Bennett signed the
ballot argument supporting Proposition 174 that will be sent to
all of the state's registered voters and he plans to participate
in numerous school choice events. CoDirector Jack Kemp has raised
$600,000 for the effort thus far. For a School Choice Action Packet,
please call 1-800-332-2000.

<H3>Free Trade and NAFTA</H3>

<P>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is scheduled to
be considered this fall by Congress. This agreement will make
history&#151;either as the missed opportunity that cost the U.S.
jobs, increased trade and a more competitive economy; or as the
creator of the world's largest free trade zone which expanded
exports to Canada and Mexico and created a growing supply of higher
paying jobs. Despite support by President Clinton, NAFTA might
not make it thtnilah Concrrecc Tf those onnosed to NAFTA would
only
look at the facts, they would find consensus among economists
who has seriously studied the documents and realize that it will
increase U.S. exports and create American jobs.
<P>
Before Mexico's 1986 decision to join the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (GATT), tariffs on U.S. exports
were as high as lOOSo; Now they are down to an average of 10%.
The average tariff placed on Mexican products being sold in the
U.S. is 3%. The arithmetic is straightforward. The U.S. clearly
has more to gain by the elimination of tariffs. But let the facts
tell the story: since 1986 these declining tariffs produced a
windfall of export activity (see chart), shifting our trade status
with Mexico from a deficit of $4 billion to a surplus of $9 billion.
Mexico has become the fastest growing export market, purchasing
73% of its imports from the U.S. It has now established itself
as our second largest market; Canada being the first. Consequently,
as the Mexican economy grows, so do U.S. exports.
<P>
These increased exports have already created 300,000 new
jobs, doubling the number of jobs supported by exports to Mexico
(see chart). In fact, the Department of Commerce estimates that
each extra $1 billion in exports creates over 19,000 net new jobs.
The Institute for International Economics projects that by 1995,
over 1 million U.S. jobs will be supported by U.S. exports to
Mexico alone.
<P>
The answer to the question, &quot;what kind of American jobs will
be produced by the NAFTA agreement?&quot; is key. According to
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, exportrelated jobs
pay 17% more than the average U.S. wage. This applies to workers
in both the service and manufacturing industries.
<P>
Our borders and trading patterns have a finite capacity; but our
potential to expand trade and grow the economy, is infinite&#151;provided
we pursue free trade. The evidence is dear. If PresidentClinton
truly wants a stimulus package that creates longterm, private
sector jobs, he would seize the moment and urge passage of this
agreement now.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>
<P>
This is a critical time for our country as we are finally getting
a good look at President Clinton's economic plan. It's tax and
spend all over again.
<P>
The bottom line for individuals, families, and businesses: the
biggest tax increase in American history, $328 billion over five
years; an effective acrosstheboard tax increase on every taxpayer
of up to 20 percent; a tax on individuals earning as little as
$30,000; and more government spending. Whatever happened to President
Clinton's campaign promise to cut taxes for the middle class?
<P>
Every time you turn around, the Clinton team is talking about
another new tax on American families and workers. But they never
talk about cutting taxes.
<P>
Empower Arnerica thinks that's wrong and we've launched a campaign
to defeat the Clinton tax hikes. By energizing activists like
yourself, we're convinced <B>that the Clinton tax bill </B>can
be defeated. America needs economic policies that promote growth,
create jobs, and provide opportunity for entrepreneurs.
<P>
President Clinton says that his policies reflect the &quot;new&quot;
Democrat. Frankly, I can't tell the difference between his tax
hikes and tax hikes of the old Democrats. We need to get the economy
moving up the growth curve again. The Clinton tax increases will
only hurt our economy and increase the deficit.
<P>
Bill Clinton thinks you're not paying enough taxes. Empower America
thinks Americans are overtaxed, and we need your help in defeating
these tax increases and promoting an agenda for economic growth.
<P>
At a grassroots level, thousands of concerned citizens are helping
us to promote conservativeoriented empowerment strategies at all
levels of government. So, if you're concerned about Bill Clinton's
tax and spend policies, stay involved with Empower America. We
know there's a better way. 
<P>

<H3>Clinton's First 100 Days</H3>
Bill Clinton now concedes that his presidency is off to a rough
start. The problem, the White House would have us believe, has
to do with a lack of &quot;agenda discipline,&quot; trying to
do too much too soon. Mr. Clinton's problems, however, run much
deeper. <I>His Administration is not working because his liberal
philosophy is not taking.</I>
<P>
At an April 28th press conference, Empower America released its
analysis, &quot;The Credibility Gap: The First 100 Days of the
Clinton Administration.&quot; Among the key points:
<P>
  1. The idea heavily marketed during the campaign that Mr. Clinton
was a &quot;New Democrat&quot; has been disproved.The gap between
candidate Clinton and President Clinton is rapidly becoming a
gulf. He has reversed himself on middle class tax cuts, free trade,
Haitian refugees, home ownership for lowincome Americans, and
tax funding for abortions, among other issues. This is part of
the reason why his opinion ratings are the lowest in history of
any president at a comparable point.
<P>
 2. The presupposition that guides the Clinton Administration's
policies is, as the President told a joint session of Congress,
&quot;government must do more.&quot; In Bill Clinton's America,
the federal government will tax more, spend more, regulate more&#151;and
the American people will depend on government more. The public's
increasing frustration and alienation toward government does not
square with President Clinton's vision of an everexpanding government.
<P>
  3. During the campaign Bill Clinton invoked the word &quot;change&quot;
like an incantation. He made a compelling case for &quot;reinventing
government.&quot; But he seems far less interested in reinventing
government than in reinflating it. President Clinton's budget
will increase spending almost $300 billion over the next five
years.
<P>
4. Bill Clinton's political career has been characterized by an
easy abandonment of commitments. Rather than allaying these concerns,
President Clinton has confirmed them through a series of welldocumented
policy reversals. Bill Clinton is coming dangerously close to
forfeiting a president's most precious political asset -- his
credibility with the American electorate.
<P>
5. President Clinton has failed to create a government that can
govern. Many agencies still lack key appointments. Meanwhile,
President Clinton's policies and tactics have galvanized the Republican
party to a remarkable degree while key Democrats are backing away
from many of the President's proposals.
<P>
The Clinton presidency is way off stride and on the defensive.
His Administration appears overwhelmed. Public skepticism is rising.
It is in the nation's best interest for Bill Clinton to purposefully
steer his presidency to the responsible center --  which after
all is how he got elected.
<P>

<H3>The American Scene: Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
by William J. Bennett
<P>
The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, the most comprehensive
statistical portrait available of behavioral trends over the last
30 years, was released on March I 5th. The Index provides an empirical
analysis of the condition of modern American society.
<P>
The findings are troubling. Over the last three decades we have
experienced substantial social regression. Since 1960 there has
been a 560 percent increase in violent crime; more than a 400
percent increase in illegitimate births; a quadrupling in divorce
rates; a tripling of the percentage of children living in singleparent
homes; more than a 200 percent increase in the teenage suicide
rate; and a drop of almost 80 points in the average S.A.T. scores.

<P>
The Index does more than document cultural decline; it points
to some solutions. Cultural renewal depends above all on strengthening
and revitalizing our social and civic institutions -- families,
churches, schools, and neighborhoods. But government has a role to play. 
First, government should heed
the old injunction, &quot;Do no harm.&quot; The longterm impact
programs have on strengthening families, discouraging dependency
and criminal behavior, and encouraging educational achievement
should inform debate on social policy. Second, political leaders
should make use of their ability to shape attitudes through discourse
and legislation. Third, a legislative social agenda should emphasize
a tough and intelligent criminal justice system; radical education
reform (including school choice for public, private, and religious
schools); reversal of the destructive incentives of the welfare
system; removal of economic barriers to those living in poverty;
support of families by increasing the personal dependent exemption;
rescinding nofault divorce laws; removal of major obstacles to
adoption; improving child support collection; and encouraging
responsible fatherhood.
<P>
The Index struck a responsive chord with the public.  More than
70,000 people called to request copies of it. The Index also received
extensive media coverage, including 130 newspapers each with a
circulation over 100,000 and more than 500 newspapers overall;
and television, radio, and magazine coverage. It received favorable
coverage from the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, the <I>Wall
Street Journal's</I> Paul Gigot, and nationally syndicated columnists
Mona Charen, Cal Thomas, Georgie Anne Geyer, Morton Kondracke,
Ben Wattenberg, and Richard Grenier.
<P>
Perhaps the most encouraging news is that there is a rough consensus
emerging about the nature of the cultural debate. Gerald Seib
wrote in the <I>Wall Street Journal </I>that recent writings on
social issues, including the Index, are &quot;starting to cause
ripples inside Washington, and in time are likely to transform
the standard liberalconservative debate over social policy.&quot;

<H3>It's the Economy, Stupid Not A Stupid Economy</H3>
by Jack Kemp
<P>
Conservative activists now have an opportunity to defeat President
Clinton's tax increases and to go to the American people with
a superior agenda for real jobs, real economic growth and renewed
American leadership in the global economy.
<P>
First, we must debunk Clinton's notion that higher taxes will
lead to a more prosperous America. In reality, higher taxes will
weaken the economy, reduce revenues and increase the deficit.
Never in American history have tax increases created jobs or economic
growth. 
<P>
<B>A ProGrowth Agenda</B>
<P>
Empower America believes we can reduce the size of government
and lower the deficit without raising taxes. At the same time,
we support a progrowth agenda that really puts people first, not
government.
<P>
Here are some ideas for a growth agenda:
<P>
 <I>&#149; </I><B>Encourage en&#166;repreneurship, saving, investment</B>
<P>
The best way to rekindle the job creating power of America's entrepreneurs
is to expand the supply of risk capital available to finance creative
new ideas and develop new products. All provisions in the tax
code affecting saving and investing should be immediately indexed
to stop the corrosive effect of inflation. This includes indexing
capital gains taxes, depreciation allowances, corporate tax rates,
and retirement plans, such as IRAs and 401Ks.
<P>
Ultimately, we should phase out the capital gains tax altogether
on longterm investments and eliminate it for anyone who works,
saves, or invests in America's lowincome communities.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Tax relief for families and working Americans</B>
<P>
We should advocate a flat, fair, and simple tax system that rewards
success instead of punishing it.
<P>
To spur job creation, the payroll tax, currently the greatest
burden on middle class families and small businesses, should be
reduced. Since the mid1960s, the payroll tax has more than doubled
from 7.25 percent to 15.3 percent today. Middle income families
now face an effective marginal tax rate on all income of over
30 percent, compared with less than 20 percent 30 years ago. Reducing
this tax would expand employment by lowering the cost of hiring
additional workers and increasing the reward for working for unemployed
Americans.
<P>
 We must also champion tax reform, such as raising the dependent
exemption, that recognizes the family as America's paramount valueshaping
institution. The moral, spiritual, and cultural health of our
nation is inextricably linked with the strength of the Amencan
family. That strength is being undermined by government policies,
both economic and social, which are biased against marriage and
famiiies with children.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Spending restraint</B>
<P>
Spending restraint and regulatory relief is a key part of our
philosophy of limited government. Government spending absorbs
valuable resources, often for inefficient and wasteful purposes.
<P>
While cutting wasteful spending, there must also be strong budget
caps to restrain the growth of government spending. Capping the
rate of entitlement growth, except Social Security, at inflation
plus population growth,would save more than $250 billion over
five years.
<P>
However, real spending control requires institutional changes
to enforce accountability in the federal budget process, including
a lineitem veto to help balance the budget without raising taxes.
<P>
<B>* Free Trade</B>
<P>
Opentrading policies helped expand the global export market to
$3.1 trillion by 1989. Mr. Clinton is dangerously reversing course
by threatening trade wars with Europe and Japan.
<P>
The key to U.S. and global economic growth lies in opening new
markets to goods and services. Passing a clean, mutually beneficial
North American Free Trade Agreement and completing the floundering
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is
a top priority.
<P>
The next step is to negotiate marketopening trade agreements culminating
in a hemispheric freetrade zone. Our ultimate goal should be to
incorporate the Pacific Rim nations, Russia and other former communist
states into an open global trading system.
<P>
Clinton's farleft liberal policies must be stopped to prevent
them from hurting America.  Now is the time for us to once again
raise the banner of economic growth, low taxes, limited government,
strong families and equality of opportunity for all. Nothing could
produce a sharper contrast with the policies of the Clinton administration.
<P>

<H3>NATIONAL SECURITY FOR THE '90s</H3>
By Jeane Kirkpatrick
<P>
There have been three great watersheds in the twentieth century&#151;moments
when the world came apart and recreated itself.
<P>
The first occured in the wake of World War I, and like today,
the optimistic trend in Europe was to a continent of democratic
governments. But in the decades that followed, Lenin in Russia,
Hitler in Germany, and Mussolini in Italy were able to seize power.
In each case, resurgent nationalism and a tradition of authoritarianism
played a role. In each case, the world stood by as democracy floundered.
And in each case, the cost of failed democracy proved incredibly
high. World War II, the Holocaust, and the Cold War were only
part of the price. The replacement of new democracies with Bolsheviks,
Fascists, and Nazis was wholly unexpected. It should prompt us
to ask ourselves now: what could happen that we do not expect?
<P>
The second watershed of the century occurred following World War
II. After Eastem Europe was conquered by the Soviets, the democracies
<I>did </I>act to prevent Westem Europe from the incorporation
into the Soviet bloc. U.S. resistance &#151; in the form of the
Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and NATO&#151;stopped the Soviet's
westward drive. NATO succeeded in providing a framework for democracy,
development, and stability because it was an organization of democracies
around the principle of collective security. Each time a former
dictatorship&#151;Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece&#151;was
incorporated into NATO after they established democratic institutions,
the belief that membership in NATO reinforced democracy was reiterated.
<P>
Now, in the wake of the collapse of Communism and the end of the
period of Soviet military threat, we have arrived at the third
great watershed. It is a moment of possibility when the world
is creating itself again. The transition of the former communist
states from totalitarianism to democracy, and from command to
market economies has already proved more complex and difficult
than was generally anticipated. The consequences of failure could
be catastrophic, yet no innovative Westem response comparable
to the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO, or the Common
Market has been forthcoming. <I>It is critically important that
we make room for the new democracies in Western institutions.</I>
<P>
Now is the time to think about collective security. The U.S. and
the democracies helped create the context for the defeat of Communist
governments by providing an altemative model of more successful
societies and by maintaining military strength. But the peoples
of Central and Eastem Europe were not liberated by foreign armies,
but by their own efforts. They are already our allies in SpiIit.
We should make them allies and trading partners in fact.
<P>
After World War II, we believed that institutionalized association
with other democracies would reinforce habits of constitutional
rule and peaceful cooperation. We were right. It is time to apply
the lessons.
<P>

<P>
<B>Bill Clinton wants the largest tax increase in American history.</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton plans to hike taxes $328 billion between 1994 and
1998.
<P>
This means Bill Clinton wants the American taxpayers to send an
extra $7,488,584 an hour to Washington,D.C. --  that's $124,809
a minute!
<P>
The average family of four will pay $904 more in taxes per year.
The average New Jersey family will pay $1,276 more. (source: The
Tax Foundation, February 24, 1993)
<P>

<P>
A typical middle income family will pay about $500 more a year
in energy taxes under the Clinton proposal.
<P>
Gasoline taxes will go up 8 to 12 cents a gallon.
<P>
The Clinton energy tax will cost $50 billion and 600,000 jobs.(source:

Bill Clinton wants to raise the maximum taxabte amount of Social
Security benefits from 50% to 85% for those individuals making
over $25,000; and for couples making over $32,000.
<P>
For some retirees, this could amount to $2,700 a year&#151;or
$225 per month. (source: U.S. Sentate Republican Policy Committee,
March 17, 1993)
<P>
<B>Small businesses and farmers will be plowed under. </B>
<P>
Small business owners will be the victims of Bill Clinton's new
36% tax bracket, not the rich.

<B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans are keenly aware of what is right with America's  health care
system. They are overwhelmingly impressed with the  quality of medical services
they get from doctors and hospitals and  other health care providers; they
appreciate the fruits of modern  medical science and technology that are
available to them; they are  often satisfied with their own insurance plans, and
with the level of  benefits and services available to them through these plans.
At  the same time, however, Americans are concerned about the  current and
future costs of health care, the gaps in insurance coverage  that still
characterize the system, and the fact that too many  Americans are uninsured.
Moreover, they want the frustrating paperwork  and administrative costs of the
system reduced, both in the public  and private sectors, and the laws governing
medical malpractice  improved. And while they want to see certain aspects of the
 health care system reformed, Americans want reform that preserves  personal
choice and the quality of medical services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the past year, Congress has made the country aware of  the growing
financial pressures and instability of the  government's two huge health care
programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Failure  to modernize these programs means
having to drain an ever  larger portion of funds from existing government
programs,  contributing 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  to higher deficits and taxes, and
compromising the level and  quality of care available for the next generation of
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Given the magnitude of these issues and concerns, the health  care debate
during the next election should revolve around three  central goals:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  The crises in Medicare and Medicaid must be resolved.</B>  Medicare
is facing bankruptcy. Absent structural reform, the program  is projected to be
insolvent by 2002. This financial crisis is  hitting Medicare just before the 77
million baby boomers, the  largest bulge in America's population pipeline, begin
to retire in  2010. The program needs to be reformed so that it can pay benefits
to  the next generation of retirees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress enacted sweeping Medicare reform in 1995 as part of  its Balanced
Budget Act. But President Clinton blocked this  reform by vetoing the
legislation and argues  wrongly  that no  tough decisions are needed to preserve
the program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Likewise, Medicaid, which serves the poor and the indigent and  is financed
jointly by the federal and state governments, is  experiencing explosive rates
of growth. Since 1990, Medicaid has been  the fastest growing segment of the
federal budget, with costs  increasing at annual rates as high as 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Medicaid is out of control because the federal government  curbs state
initiative through expensive mandates, preventing the  states from integrating
health care into other services. Medicaid must  be moved to the states.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  Americans must be freed from the fear that they will  become
uninsured.</B> The main political pressure for changing the health  care system
comes not from those who are uninsured, but from  those who fear they will lose
their health benefits in the future.  Candidates need to recognize that most
insured working  Americans know someone who has lost his or her insurance and
has  faced financial hardship or disaster as a result. They do not want to  join
them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain that this anxiety flows directly  from today's
employer-based health system. Americans can get tax  relief for health insurance
only on one condition: that they get  it through their employer. It is not
surprising, then, that this tax  bias in favor of health insurance through the
place of work has  created an employer-based health insurance market to the
practical  exclusion of often better alternatives. The employer-only system 
means that if workers lose or change their jobs, they also lose their  health
insurance. This anxiety about losing health benefits gives rise  to the twin
problems of a lack of &quot;portability&quot; and &quot;job lock.&quot;   The
portability problem is caused by the inability of Americans  to transfer their
health insurance from job to job. The related  phenomenon of job lock occurs
when an employee or family  member does not move to a more attractive job for
fear of losing  health benefits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This tax penalty against paying for health care directly or  obtaining
insurance from any source other than an employer must  be ended. Americans
should no longer be penalized for wanting  the security of owning and
controlling their own health care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Health care costs for working people must be brought  down 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  without sacrificing choice.</B>
While corporate premiums have  dipped during the past two years, health care
costs are still too high.  As employers try to control costs, they often simply
make  workers and their families pay a progressively larger share of the  health
insurance premiums, or else enroll them in managed care  plans which are far
more restrictive than traditional indemnity plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain to the public that the way to  bring down health
costs is not to provide less, but to improve the  efficiency of the health care
system by stimulating much greater  consumer choice and competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The movement to reform the health care system gains much of  its momentum
from the spiraling cost of medical care in America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>National health expenditures reached 13.9 percent of gross  domestic product
($884.2 billion) in 1993 and reached  approximately 15.6 percent ($1.1 trillion)
in  1995.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#1">1</A>  This compares with
$251.1 billion in 1980, when national health expenditures were just  under 10
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While few Americans even know how much the country as  a whole spends on
health care, they do worry about the rising cost  to them personally, as
individuals or as business owners.  Typically, people mistakenly blame rising
costs on drug manufacturers,  insurance companies, physicians, and hospitals.
But the rapid growth  in medical expenditures actually is attributable to the
rising  demand for medical services and new technologies and, more 
significantly, to the peculiar way in which the tax system treats health 
insurance, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  which leads to an artificial
employer-based system for most  working Americans.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The major factor in determining access to health insurance  coverage is
employment. 
</P>
<P>Overwhelmingly, working Americans receive their health  benefits through
their employer. The reason: For most working  Americans to obtain any tax relief
for health care costs, they must ask  their employer to earmark part of their
worker's compensation to  pay for a health insurance policy that the employer 
not the worker   then owns. This tax break ties health insurance to the place of
 employment. As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) explains:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     Tying health insurance to employment causes further 
inefficiencies. Workers who are sick or who have a sick  family member can get
trapped in their jobs because most new  insurance policies will not cover the &quot;preexisting
condition.&quot;   Finally, because insurance is tied to one's job, it is 
inherently insecure. Employees can lose their insurance if they lose  their jobs
or if their employer stops carrying  insurance.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#2">2</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax benefit for having employment-based coverage (and  thus the penalty
for not obtaining a plan in this way) is huge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     In 1996, the federal treasury will lose
approximately $93 billion  in foregone revenues, given the tax-exempt status of
employer  contributions for medical insurance premiums and medical care. 
Households with income of $50,000 or more will share  approximately $53 billion
in tax relief on health care, compared to  households earning $20,000 or less,
which will receive only $5.4 billion in  tax relief.<A

<P>A major misperception that conservative candidates must  explain to the
American public is that employment-based health  insurance is not a &quot;free
benefit.&quot;  Employers give employees nothing;  health benefits, like wages,
are part of an employee's total  compensation. Under normal market conditions,
there is invariably a  trade-off between wages and benefits; for every increase

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal tax treatment of health insurance is exclusive.  Americans can
get tax relief for health insurance on only one  condition: that they get it
through their employer. If they have a large  benefits program, the tax breaks
are generous, and they get a large  amount of tax-free income; if the employer
offers a less generous  benefits package, they get a less generous tax break.
Employees who  purchase health insurance on their own receive negligible tax
relief  in comparison to employment-based packages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only other significant health tax break for employees  under current law
is that individuals who itemize deductions may  deduct what they have paid
during the taxable year (if not reimbursed  by insurance) for medical care
(including medical insurance) to  the extent that the total of such expenses
exceeds 7.5 percent of  their adjusted gross income (AGI). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Employees and their families without adequate  employer-provided insurance
must go without insurance altogether or purchase  individual policies outside of
employer-based insurance. But  these individual policies are marketed on an
individual basis and  thus are considerably more expensive. Worse, a worker and
his  family will have to pay for these policies with after-tax dollars,  making
their purchase substantially more expensive than a similar  package of benefits
offered through an employer tax-free. For most  middle-class Americans, health
insurance outside of the  employer-based system is not a financially realistic
option.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given the federally created constraints on the health  insurance market,
which basically limit Americans to one type of  insurance option (employer-based
insurance), it is not hard to see why  employees often are unable or unwilling
to move or change jobs,  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  when career opportunities promise
better lives for them and  their families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It also is not surprising that uninsurance in the United States  is largely
a function of employment status. According to the  Employee Benefit Research
Institute (EBRI), a prominent  Washington think tank specializing in job-based
benefits, some 55.5 percent  of uninsured Americans are uninsured because of
loss of jobs  or change of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Uninsurance also is highly correlated with employment in  small businesses,
or businesses with smaller profit margins. Under  the federal tax code, workers
in small business are not on a level  playing field with workers in large
corporations.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Employment-based coverage, like public programs, has  fostered the
rise in third-party payments.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1970 and 1980, the amount of insurance premiums  paid by American
employers for their employee group insurance  policies increased by more than
352 percent. During the  mid-1980s, premium increases were between 6 and 8
percent annually;  by 1990, they once again were in double digits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1992, group health insurance plans amounted to  approximately 81 percent

accounted for 2.5 percent; and worker's  compensation insurance accounted for
almost 16  percent.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#9">9</A>

<P>
</P>
<P>The growth of Medicare and Medicaid has contributed to the  trend toward

<P>
</P>
<P>Unlike automobile insurance, which provides for accidents  and other
unexpected events, medical insurance typically pays for  routine medical
services such as dental examinations. To  understand why third-party medical
insurance for routine services helps  drive up costs, consider what would happen
if automobile  insurance worked this way: It would cover not only damages due to
 accident or theft, but also all regular repairs, regular oil changes, and 
other routine expenses  perhaps even a weekly fuel fill-up. Now  suppose that
the insurance policy was paid for by the driver's  employer. The driver would
have little incentive either to question  a mechanic who said a certain repair
was needed or to quibble  about the price. The result would be predictable: a
rapid rise in  automobile repair and servicing costs.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>HOW EMPLOYERS HAVE RESPONDED TO COST INCREASES WITH MANAGED CARE</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite the increased utilization of third-party payments, the  rate of
increase in health care costs has slowed in recent years.  Between 1992 and
1993, medical care prices, as measured by  the Consumer Price Index for Medical
Care (CPI-MC), rose by  just 5.9 percent.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#12">12</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One factor contributing to the recent reduction in growth has  been the
increased enrollment of workers by their employers in  man
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  aged care organizations. In the
private sector, at least, these  arrangements are less expensive than
fee-for-service or  traditional indemnity insurance plans. Managed care
organizations are  networks of doctors and hospitals in which the patient faces 
varying levels of limitation in the choice and availability of services.  They
include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).</B> HMOs generally  provide a
defined set of health services to an enrolled  population within a specified
geographic location. Providers usually are  reimbursed on a capitated basis,
which is pre-determined by the  HMO. By December 1994, there were 574 HMOs with
a total  enrollment of 51.1 million persons, or about 19.5 percent of the U.S. 
population.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs).</B> Developed in the  1980s,
the PPO tries to achieve the same type of cost savings as HMOs  by directing
patients to certain providers that have agreed to  cost-effective methods of
care delivery as prescribed by the PPO.  However, the PPO also gives patients
some degree of flexibility  and freedom by allowing them to select providers of
their choice at  a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Point-of-Service (POS) Plans.</B> POS plans combine the features  of
HMOs and PPOs. They utilize a network of selected,  contracted participating
providers, and if an employee goes to a plan  provider, there are minimal or no
out-of-pocket expenses. Enrollees also  can go to a provider not in the plan,
but will be charged  significantly higher copayments or deductibles.

<P><B>Who Are the Uninsured?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is routine to read that as many as 41 million people, or about  18
percent of the population, are uninsured. This estimate is  correct, but it also
hides more than it reveals. Americans need to be  reminded that 82 percent of
the nonelderly and 99 percent of  the elderly (aged 65 and over), or 215.7
million individuals, were  covered by private or public health insurance in 
1993.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#13">13</A>  Why the seeming
contradiction?  Because millions of the uninsured  lack coverage for only a
short time, typically between jobs (a  problem that nevertheless must be
addressed). Furthermore, most have  access to health services if they choose to
use them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most commentators tend to view the uninsured as a large,  undifferentiated
mass. A closer look, however, reveals that they fall  into three broad
categories: the &quot;temporarily&quot; uninsured, who are  without insurance
only briefly or intermittently; the &quot;voluntarily&quot;  uninsured, who
choose not to pay for medical coverage, although it  is accessible to them and
affordable; and the &quot;chronically&quot;  uninsured, who want to be covered
but cannot obtain affordable  coverage. The last category is the most troubling,
since 50.7 percent  of the uninsured in 1993 were in families with income under 
$20,000 annually.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#14">14</A>  It is this
relatively small segment of the  population that liberals often talk about but
have failed to help for the past  40 years. They represent a serious problem
that conservatives  must address.

<P>Some of those seeking to address the weakness of the U.S.  health care
system look to Canada's single-payer,  government-controlled system. Although
Canada spends less on health care as a  percentage of gross national product (10
percent in 1995) than does  the United States (15.6 percent in 1995), its
per-capita health care  expenses are still the second-highest in the world,
outranked only  by those in the United States.

<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, it is important to understand how Canada's  lower spending affects
care.
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Canada spends much less of its GDP on medical
research and  development, generally importing new technologies from the  United
States. The elderly, who tend to use health care services at a  higher rate, are

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medicaid</B> was established as a joint federal-state matching  program.
It is an open-ended entitlement that pays for medically  necessary health care
services provided to specific groups of  low-income individuals. Individuals
eligible for Medicaid now  include the aged, disabled, pregnant women with
children, and the blind.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending on Medicaid is out of control:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>*</CITE></B>     In FY 1995, Medicaid cost taxpayers $156.5
billion. Of  this amount, the federal government was responsible for 
approximately $89.2 billion.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#21">21</A> 
This represents an 11,050 percent increase  over the program's initial cost to
the federal government of $800  million in FY 1966. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Remarkably, Medicaid was not intended to provide health  insurance to all
poor Americans. Originally, individuals became  eligible because of their &quot;categorical&quot;
relationship to two federal cash  assistance programs: Aid to Families with
Dependent  Children (AFDC) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). However, 
congressional mandates since the late 1980s have resulted in  huge 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  expansions in Medicaid
eligibility provisions. Now the  eligibility of individuals in additional
selected low-income groups is  based solely on the relationship of their incomes
to the federal  poverty level. In recent years, a progressively higher
proportion of  Medicaid spending is for nursing homes of formerly middle-class 
aged who have spent their resources and have become eligible for  Medicaid
custodial care. Each state is responsible for defining its  own package of
covered medical services, but some benefits are  mandated by Congress. These

<P><B>The Failure of Price Controls</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many Americans still mistakenly believe that government  controls on the
price of pharmaceuticals, health insurance, and hospital  and physicians' fees
can reduce the cost of health care without  reducing either quality or
availability. Since the beginning,  Congress has been trying to keep down the
costs of Medicare and  Medicaid largely by reducing reimbursements as a way to
control the cost  of medical procedures. Since 1966, Congress has imposed 75 
different restrictions on doctors alone. In 1983 and 1989, respectively,  it
introduced the Prospective Payment System (PPS) of fixed  payments for
procedures in hospitals and the Resource-Based  Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), an
enormously complex  reimbursement schedule, in addition to balanced billing
limitations, to fix  prices 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  for doctors serving Medicare
patients.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Such cumbersome controls have proved to be just as ineffective  in health
care as in every other part of the economy where they  have been tried. Faced
with price controls, doctors and hospitals  have responded like every other
profession or trade subjected to  price controls: by trading them.

<P><B>A Model for Health Care Reform: The Consumer Choice  That Members of
Congress Already Have
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Members of Congress and 9 million other federal workers and  retirees, as
well as their dependents, enjoy a very different system  of health care.
Candidates might want to suggest that  Congress should let Americans in on the
same kind of system it now  enjoys: a system based explicitly on the free-market
principles of  consumer choice and competition. This system, known as the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), enables almost  400 private
insurance carriers nationwide to compete for the  personal business of Members
of Congress and their staffs along with  almost 9 million federal employees,
retirees, and dependents. Once  a year, these special consumers can make their
personal choices. It  is virtually the only system in the country where
individuals  and families can pick and choose the kinds of benefits and 
insurance plans they want at prices they wish to pay. In any area of the 
country, federal workers and retirees can choose from among a  dozen to two
dozen plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each year, the government contributes a set dollar amount to  each
individual or family for the purchase of a private insurance plan  of their
choice. If they choose a more expensive plan, with a  richer set of benefits,
they pay more directly for those benefits. If  they pick a less expensive plan,
with a less generous set of  benefits, they are able to pocket the savings from
making such a choice.  All of the plans have catastrophic coverage and, health
insurance  experts with the National Association of Retired Federal  Employees
(NARFE) rate all of the plans offered as &quot;good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, the federal government's managerial role in  the FEHBP has
been passive. The Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), the federal agency
which administers the FEHBP, has  focused on negotiating with private insurance
carriers, setting  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  basic ground rules for
competition among private insurers,  and making sure that private insurance
companies meet fiscal  solvency, consumer protection, and basic benefit
requirements  outlined in statute. While the FEHBP is imperfect, it has  many
strengths, particularly its level of consumer choice and  competition, the
bounteous benefits of a genuine market largely  unavailable to workers and their
families in employer-based  insurance. Compared with Medicare, the levels of
bureaucracy and  regulation are very low. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Wide Choice.</B> Unlike most employees or Medicare 
beneficiaries who are locked into an inflexible standardized benefits  package
pre-determined for them by an employer or the government,  Members of Congress
can choose from a broad range of health  insurance options. Not only are they
allowed to choose from a  wide variety of private plans, with a variety of
prices and benefits,  but they also pocket the savings that result from their
own choices.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Excellent Cost Control.</B> While Americans typically are  being
herded into health care plans at their employers' discretion in  order to cut
down on corporate costs, Members of Congress and all  federal employees in 1996
will enjoy a solid range of benefits  and plans at insignificant premium
increases. Furthermore, many  federal employees will see no premium increases
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the government, federal workers in 1996 &quot;will find  a
total average premium increase of only four tenths of one  percent, compared to
an average private sector premium increase of  more than six percent over a
comparable  period.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#40">40</A>  For
1995, premiums actually declined on average by 3.3 percent.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Helpful Information for Making Choices.</B> The federal  government also
assists Members of Congress and federal workers and  retirees with unbiased
information on various health plans. But this  most often is not the chief
source of information on plan options.  A whole private-sector information
explosion has accompanied  the FEHBP. Members of Congress and federal workers
and  retirees can get helpful tips and advice from private-sector 
organizations, unions, and employee associations on the best plans available  to
workers, retirees, and their families in terms of value, quality,  and price.
For congressional and federal retirees, the National  Association of Retired
Federal Employees, which represents over  500,000 active and retired personnel,
suggests the best plans for those  needing specialized medical services.<I>
Washington Consumers  Checkbook</I>, a major publication available in
bookstores, rates plans  according to comprehensive patient surveys.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Portability.</B> Within the federal workforce, there
are many  different functions and many different jobs. Federal workers can move 
from one job to another, or from one federal agency or department  to another,
and keep their health insurance plans. While  federal workers have a chance to
change insurance plans once a year,  most are satisfied with the quality and
service that their plans  provide them. If they belong to a union or an employee
organization,  they may wish  as approximately one-third of them now do  to 
retain their union-sponsored or employee organization-sponsored  health
insurance plan. Moreover, federal workers, unlike an  increasingly large number
of workers in the private sector, can take their  health insurance plan with
them when they retire, even if they retire  early at age 55. Because they have
this level of portability in their  insurance, they do not suffer the same kinds
of anxieties that  commonly plague workers and their families in the private
sector.

</P>
<P><B>The FEHBP as a Model for Health Care Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medicare.</B> The basic market principles of consumer choice  and
competition that underlie the FEHBP are at the heart of  congressional efforts
to reform Medicare. Many of the key features  that federal workers and retirees
now find so attractive in the  FEHBP are incorporated in the congressional
reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>First, like retired Members of Congress and federal workers,  Medicare
beneficiaries would be given a choice. They could keep  traditional Medicare, if
they wish, or they could choose from a  full range of qualified private health
care plans, including an  alternative fee-for-service plan; a managed care plan,
such as an HMO  or Preferred Provider Option; a &quot;provider service network&quot;
plan  (a plan run directly by physicians or hospitals); plans sponsored  by
private organizations or employers; or a special medical  savings account option
coupled with catastrophic health insurance  coverage. Like plans that compete
today for the dollars of retired  Members of Congress and federal workers, these
plans would have  to meet similar consumer protection, fiscal solvency, and core
 benefit requirements. In fact, the addition of the medical savings  account
option, which would allow Medicare beneficiaries to deposit  a significant
portion of the government contribution to a  tax-free account to pay routine
medical expenses, is a distinct  improvement over the current FEHBP, which does
not yet have a medical  savings account option. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, like retired Members of Congress and federal  workers, senior
citizens could get better value for their money in a  competitive health
insurance market. Medicare currently spends  about 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  $4,800 per year for each
beneficiary. Under the congressional  reform plan, it would increase to $7,100
by the year 2002. Just  as federal workers and retirees get a specific
government  contribution for the purchase of private insurance in the FEHBP,
Medicare  beneficiaries would get a specific government contribution. With  this
contribution, not only could they choose the plan or option  best suited to
their personal needs, but they also could pocket the  savings of their personal
choices, getting cash rebates from the use  of medical savings accounts and
other private plans. In other  words, the congressional Medicare reform
proposal, by enabling  Medicare beneficiaries to pick and choose their plans and
options just  as federal workers and retirees do, introduces economic  dynamics
that are similar to those which drive the popular FEHBP. For  the past several
years especially, these dynamics have served to  improve the quality of health
care services and to hold premium  costs down below those of both the private
sector and the Medicare  program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming the Private Insurance Market</B>. The success of  the FEHBP is
not due to some mysterious managerial expertise  concentrated among bureaucrats
at the Office of Personnel  Management. It is due largely to the fact that
market forces do most of  the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; in this unusual, but
popular, system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 35-year experience of the FEHBP shows that individual  consumers,
properly armed with information, can make rational  health care insurance
choices. That experience also shows that  intense and direct competition among
insurance companies for  consumers' dollars can help control costs, just as
costs are controlled in  other sectors of the economy. On this basis, Members of
Congress  could construct a consumer choice health care system for every  Ameri
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  can that resembles, in its broad
outlines, the kind of  consumer choice and competition that is now enjoyed
almost exclusively  by Members of Congress and federal workers and retirees. But
to  do this, Congress will have to take very specific steps:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     First, Congress should establish neutrality in the
federal tax  code.</B> This could be done in one of two ways. The best way,
within  the context of reform, would be by enacting a flat tax. This means  that
there would be no tax advantage for insurance or for health  care services,
whether purchased through one's place of employment  or some other way. And
there would be no tax on the earnings of  savings accounts for health care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Alternatively, every American family could get tax relief, in  the form of
a tax credit or a voucher, for the purchase of health  insurance or health care
services, regardless of the breadwinner's  place or status of employment. This
tax relief would be given to  individuals and families to use in a fashion that
best meets their  personal needs and circumstances: to offset the purchase of 
health insurance, out-of-pocket medical expenses, or the deposit of  funds in a
medical savings account, a tax-free account like an  individual retirement
account (IRA) in which funds roll over year after  year and from which
individuals or families could pay routine  medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Second, if households are to receive special tax
relief in the  form of credits or vouchers, the head of every household should
have  to purchase at least a basic package of catastrophic health  insurance.</B>
As with the FEHBP, Congress could set basic ground rules  for health insurance
or certify similar ground rules developed by  the states, including the
guaranteed renewability of health  insurance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  policies; a limitation on
exclusions for pre-existing medical  conditions; and limited underwriting of
health insurance that  is grounded in age, sex, and geography and provides for 
premium discounts for individuals or families who enroll in  preventive health
care or health promotion programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These tax and insurance changes would have a dramatic effect  by changing
today's health insurance market into a consumer  choice system. Like the FEHBP,
the private health insurance  market would benefit from intense competition
among private  insurance carriers, leading to an explosion of group insurance
options  outside of the place of employment and enabling trade associations, 
professional organizations, unions, employee organizations,  churches, and
religious institutions to sponsor their own health  insurance options for
workers and their families. Like the FEHBP, such  a market would put a premium
on the demand for information  on quality, price, and benefit. Outcomes research
would be in  demand for doctors and hospitals and medical groups. Consumer 
organizations and affinity groups, like the American Association of  Retired
Persons (AARP), would monitor performance and evaluate  different health plan
options and their doctors and hospitals.

</P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration will long be remembered for its  attempt and
subsequent failure to federalize the American  health care system in 1994.
Criticizing the current system as wasteful  and bureaucratic, the Administration
initially enjoyed the support  of Americans in principle when it promised
security, simplicity,  sav
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  ings, choice, quality, and
personal responsibility. Moreover,  the President argued that sound reform
should be based on the  market principles of consumer choice and competition.
But the  record showed that President Clinton's costly, 1,342-page Health 
Security Act, an enormously complex and bureaucratic measure, was  anything but
an improvement over the current system. On the  contrary, and despite the
repeated denials of Administration  officials to this day, the Clinton
Administration's huge and complex  health reform legislation attempted to bring
one-seventh of the  U.S. economy under government control.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#41">41</A>

<P>

<P>On the subject of Medicare, President Clinton has refused to  consider any
major reform since the 1994 election. Rather than  overhaul the program so that
it can provide benefits to the next  generation, the Clinton Administration
Medicare reform plan  would achieve modest budget savings largely through even
tighter  controls on doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to Guy King, a spokesman for the prestigious  American Academy of
Actuaries and former Actuary of the Health Care  Financing Administration
(HCFA), &quot;It is similar to the quick  fixes enacted in the past that have
allowed the Medicare program to  fall into its current financial state. This
proposal also includes  accounting tricks to achieve short term fiscal soundness
in the  hospital insurance program. In the long run, these tricks may undermine 
the economic discipline of the trust fund.&quot;<A

<P><B>THE 104th CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the first session of the 104th Congress, federal  lawmakers took
important steps to improve the functioning of the  American 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  health care system. Of the
several legislative proposals  introduced to reform the current health system,
the most important was one  to reform the financially troubled Medicare program.
Virtually all  of the others were narrow adjustments in existing law or 
incremental reform proposals. Some of the key changes, including  Medicare
reform, were incorporated into the Balanced Budget Act of  1995, which was
vetoed by President Clinton on December 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Medicare. </B>In the fall of 1995, Congress passed  sweeping
Medicare reform which would have given the elderly  real choices in their health
care delivery for the first time while  taking important steps to stave off
bankruptcy and help restore  financial solvency to the program. While these
reforms are both  important and necessary, however, taxpayers should realize
that, despite  the level of bitter controversy surrounding them, they still fall
far  short of a permanent fix for the financially troubled Medicare  system.
They are serious structural changes, but still merely defer the  financial
collapse of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund  until 2010. Baby boomers
make up a huge bloc of future retirees, but  no one age 49 and under is
guaranteed, under any of the  proposals offered for congressional consideration
in 1995, that the  current Medicare program will be available upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some of the key elements embodied in the vetoed  congressional Medicare
reforms include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)  An option to pick private plans.</B> The legislation
offers  beneficiaries the option of enrolling in a private health plan as an 
alternative to traditional Medicare. These private plans are referred to  as &quot;MedicarePlus&quot;
plans. MedicarePlus plans include 1) a  coordinated care plan (HMO, PPO);  2) a
combination of a high-deductible plan and contributions to  a high-deductible
Medicare medical savings account; 3) plans  offered by a Provider-Sponsored
Organization (PSO); 4) a  union, Taft-Hartley, or qualified association plan;
and 5) a  fee-for-service plan that reimburses providers on the basis of a
privately  determined fee schedule. Groups such as the American Association  of
Retired Persons (AARP), United Auto Workers (UAW),  and churches could sponsor
health plans under the MedicarePlus  program. By introducing a much greater
degree of consumer  choice within a competitive market, the reform could be
expected to  reduce the rate of increase in Medicare spending. Traditional 
Medicare would remain available as an option.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  A defined contribution.</B> One of the key elements in the 
congressional reform proposal is to turn Medicare benefits into a  defined
contribution from the government towards the purchase of  a MedicarePlus plan,
as opposed to today's open-ended  entitlement to specific services.
Congressional budget projections indicate  that the amount available for
retirees would rise from $4,800 to  $7,100 per capita from 1995 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the reform, the federal government would make  monthly premium
payments to the MedicarePlus plan chosen by the  beneficiary. To ensure
stability in payments to MedicarePlus plans,  the government's contribution
levels would be adjusted to  recognize legitimate variations in the costs of
doing business in  different geographic areas. If beneficiaries wished a more
generous  plan, they would have to pay the difference. But if they chose a  more
economical plan that cost less than the defined contribution,  they would be
allowed to receive 75 percent of the difference, with  the remaining 25 percent
being deposited in the HI trust fund. If  an 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  enrollee elected a medical
savings account (MSA) option, the  entire rebate would be deposited into that
individual's MSA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  A new Medicare trust fund.</B> Liberals in Congress claimed  that
projected savings from the reform would be used to pay for  tax cuts. This is
incorrect. The Medicare reform created a &quot;lock  box&quot; mechanism to
place all savings from the Part B program into  a new Medicare Preservation
Trust Fund and specifically  prohibit any transfers to pay for future tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Creation of Provider-Sponsored Organizations and other  group plans.</B>
To make Medicare more competitive, the  congressional reform created a new
option for the elderly to purchase their  health insurance  Provider-Sponsored
Organizations (PSOs). These  are managed care plans created primarily by
physicians and  hospitals. In addition to expanding the range of choices and
creating  more competition within the MedicarePlus program, it is widely 
believed that providers (physicians and hospitals) in smaller  communities would
be better able to find efficiencies in providing  access to health care than
some of the more traditional insurers.  Certain rules applied to the PSOs are
not applicable to other  private plans.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#43">43</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Medicaid. </B>According to the Congressional  Budget Office,
the federal government alone spent $89.2 billion in  FY 1995 on Medicaid.
Medicaid costs have been exploding.  Like Medicare, Medicaid is plagued with
internal inefficiencies, as  well as rising costs. And as with Medicare, failure
to address  these problems translates into direct and painful tax increases  on
America's working families. Since 1990, Medicaid has been  the fastest growing
program within the federal budget.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->

<P>Governors have testified before Congress about the  increasing strain that
exploding Medicaid costs impose on their  respective budgets, often restricting
investment in such other crucial  human service programs as child welfare,
education, public safety,  and judicial services. Responding to this financial
crisis,  Congress passed a block grant reform proposal which would enable states
 to provide medical assistance to low-income individuals and  families with a
much greater degree of flexibility. Allowing the states  to determine who is
eligible under their new programs would  eliminate the bureaucratic morass that
has resulted in mandatory  coverage for individuals whose needs are no greater,
and often are  less, than those of others for whom coverage is  prohibited.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#44">44</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed this measure. The main difference  between the
vetoed block grant proposal and the current program  is that states would have
been given much wider latitude in  determining which segment of the population
is eligible for the new  program. States were permitted to cover any individuals
up to  250 percent of the federal poverty level. In 1995, this would  have meant
up to $31,475 for a family of three. Under the  congressional reform measure,
the states would be required to cover two  groups of qualifying individuals:
pregnant women and children aged  12 and younger living in families with income
below the federal  poverty level, and disabled individuals (as determined by the
state).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>States also would have been required to meet minimum  spending obligations
for each of three specific groups of beneficiaries:  1) families with income
below 185 percent of poverty with a  pregnant woman or child; 2) elderly
individuals; and 3) disabled  individuals. For each group, the minimum
percentage each state  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  be obligated to spend is 85
percent of the amount the states  were required to spend on mandatory services
(including nursing  facility services) under current Medicaid law during FY
1995. The 85  percent requirement also would apply to payments for Medicare 
premium assistance for low-income elderly persons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Special Needs of Children.</B> The legislation recognized the  unique
needs of children with special health care problems. Children  with serious
chronic conditions or disabilities such as cerebral  palsy, cystic fibrosis,
cancer, or heart conditions represent  approximately two percent of all children
in America. Despite their  relatively small numbers, however, the intensity of
care provided to  this population is high and requires particular attention.
Therefore,  the congressional Medicaid reform required states to outline  their
plans for providing care to children in their jurisdictions with  special health
care needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the congressional reform proposal, states were required  to include
descriptions of their objectives, goals, and methods  employed to achieve such
results. With regard to objectives  and goals, the states were to be allowed to
take into consideration  their financial resources, economic conditions,
adequacy of  existing infrastructure, and  most important  their own particular 
priorities. Current legal protections designed to protect the spouses  and adult
children of nursing home residents against  impoverishment were maintained in
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Nursing Care Standards</B>. While the elderly constitute less  than 25
percent of the Medicaid population, the mounting costs  associated with
long-term nursing care account for approximately  70 percent of the program's
costs. The bill retained the quality  assur
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  ance standards for nursing homes
that were passed in the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987).
OBRA  1987 reformed the Medicaid requirements for nursing homes  participating
in the program. The Medicaid reform in the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995 retained
these quality assurance provisions,  which include the following:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1) A comprehensive list of requirements</B> that nursing
homes  must meet in order to be certified to participate in Medicaid,  including
requirements about assessments of residents, available  services, nurse

</P>
<P><B>2) Provisions revising the survey and certification process</B>  that

participation.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Restoring Tax Deduction for Self-Employed Buying Health 
Insurance.</B> Congress passed legislation that would permanently  increase and
extend the tax deduction for health insurance costs of  self-

percent to 30 percent. The bill  was signed into law by President Clinton.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#46">46</A>  The Balanced Budget  Act of
1995, vetoed by the President, also included an  amendment which would gradually
increase the 30 percent deduction to  50 percent between 1996 and 2002. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medical Savings Accounts.</B> The Balanced Budget Act included  a
provision to allow Americans to establish medical savings  accounts (MSAs). This
revolutionary change in health care  financing promises to have a significant
impact on the functioning of  the health insurance market. Contributions of up
to $2,000 for  individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer 
contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income. 
Interest earned on the income is subject to taxation.  Withdrawals made for
non-medical expenditures would be included in  the individual's gross income and
subject to a 10 percent tax  before age 59 and a half. After that, withdrawals
could be made for  any purpose without the 10 percent tax. For a health plan to
be  classified as a catastrophic coverage plan, the minimum  deductible would
have to be $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Improving Portability of Coverage.</B> Representative Bill  Thomas
(R-CA) introduced a bill (H.R. 1610) to end the problem of  &quot;job lock&quot;
that has been created under employment-based health  insurance systems. The
legislation would allow individuals  moving from one job to another to remain
continuously covered even  if they suffered from pre-existing medical
conditions. With the  use of pre-existing condition exclusions by insurers thus
limited,  individuals moving from one employer group health plan to  another
would not normally be subject to such exclusions. At the end  of the first
session, this bill was pending in the full Committee  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  Ways and Means.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A similar bill (S.1028) was introduced in the Senate by  Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-KS). Like the Thomas bill, S. 1028  would limit exclusions for
pre-existing conditions. By prohibiting  health plans from limiting or denying
coverage for more than 12  months for a medical condition that was diagnosed or
treated during  the previous six months, it is intended to alleviate some of the
 burdens facing workers trapped in an employment-based health  system. The bill
also would modify the Consolidated Omnibus  Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA).
Under current law, COBRA states  that workers in a firm with over 20 employees
can remain insured  between jobs by continuing their enrollment in the company's
 plan, paying the premiums themselves, for 18 months after they  leave the
company. Coverage for spouses and dependent children  remains in effect for a
total of 36 months in cases of death or  divorce. S.1028 extends the length of
coverage under  COBRA. While this is viewed by some as a consumer protection
measure,  it has potentially harmful effects because it would increase the 
costs of health insurance to employers who ultimately pass on any  additional
costs to active employees. In general, healthy  ex-employees decline COBRA
coverage while high risk ex-employees  accept and pay directly for coverage.
However, the employer is  required to pay the actual claims costs for former
workers who elect  COBRA coverage.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased Incentives for Long-Term Care Insurance.</B> Included  in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was a provision which  would encourage individuals
to purchase private long-term care  insurance. By allowing tax-free withdrawals
from an individual  retirement account (IRA) and other pension plans to purchase
 private 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  long-term care insurance, it
would help alleviate the financial  pressures of the Medicaid program, which
spent $14.5 billion in  FY 1990 for nursing home care alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased Delivery Options for Seniors  Medicare Select.</B>  Last
summer, Congress also enacted legislation to amend the  Social Security Act to
permit so-called Medicare Select policies to  be offered in all states. The
measure was signed into law by  President Clinton. The new law would: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Provide a three-year extension of
the Medicare Select  program. Under Medicare Select, beneficiaries have the
option to  purchase their Medigap (Medicare supplemental) policies through 
managed care networks. Studies have shown that Medicare Select  products have
saved beneficiaries between 10 percent and 37 percent  in premiums over the
traditional fee-for-service Medicare  supplemental programs. This has translated
into savings of up to  $300 per year for many seniors.<A

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Fix Medicare and Medicaid.</B> The Medicare program is 
facing bankruptcy. It must be fixed, or the current and future  generations of
taxpayers will be burdened with unprecedented increases  in levels of taxation
required to sustain it. Likewise, exploding  Medicaid costs also must be brought
under control.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress passed legislation in 1995 to address these problems,  but the bill
was vetoed by President Clinton. The reforms would  have helped restore the
finances of Medicare while giving new  choices and security to the elderly. In
1997, these reforms should be  enacted into law. Clinton also vetoed structural
reform of  Medicaid  a reform which would have integrated Medicaid into the rest
 of the welfare system and given states the flexibility to find ways  of keeping
down costs by improving efficiency. This  legislation needs to be enacted in
1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Adopt the flat tax.</B> For reasons of general tax reform, many  Members
of Congress want to overhaul the entire federal income  tax code, simplify it,
and replace it with a flat tax (either as a flat  income tax or as a sales tax).
The flat tax proposal is perhaps  the best way to bring neutrality to the tax
code and eliminate the  inequities and inefficiencies of the current tax
treatment of health  insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a flat tax, there would be no special tax exclusion on  the monetary
value of health care benefits provided through the  place of work. All health
benefits, like wages and other  compensation, would be counted as taxable income
and would be taxable at a  flat rate. Because there would be no built-in bias
toward  employment-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  based health insurance and no
discrimination against  non-employment-based health insurance, whether group or
individual,  Americans would have a powerful incentive to seek the best value 
for their money, weighing the quality and service of a benefits  package against
the price. Certainly, employers may still wish to  offer insurance or get good
group rates for their insurance; but  an employer's preferred option no longer
would have an exclusive  tax advantage, and thus would be in competition with
packages  sponsored by other organizations, including unions, trade 
associations, or other entities offering different packages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A second advantage of the flat tax approach is that it  eliminates the
current tax advantage of third-party payment. Today, there  is no tax advantage
to paying for medical services directly. From  a tax position, it is best if
payment for health care services can  be accomplished through a third-party
payer. If Americans were  no longer penalized for paying directly, doctors and
hospitals  would receive cash payments more often from patients themselves. 
Moreover, cost control would be more effective; a dollar paid for  services
directly would have to be less expensive than a dollar paid  to a doctor through
the administrative apparatus of a third-party  payment system. And when
insurance companies weighed such  features as co-payment and deductibles, these
features would be  offered to consumers without the bias of the tax code
affecting  how they are determined.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a flat tax option, help for lower-income people  those  who are
ineligible for Medicaid or assistance for the unemployed   can be simplified and
secured through the adoption of a  straight voucher system. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Short of a flat tax, establish an individual tax credit for health  care
spending and MSAs.</B> If it should decide to forego reforming  the tax code by
establishing a flat tax, Congress could achieve  neutrality in the treatment of
health care by establishing an individual  tax credit to replace the current tax
exclusion for  employment-based health insurance. The amount of the tax credit
can be varied  by income level and family status to control the cost of the 
subsidy and target the benefits.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#48">48</A>
 A refundable tax credit for health  insurance, medical services, and
contributions to a medical savings  account would enable lower-income Americans
to buy into  the health insurance market on the same terms as all other 
Americans.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#49">49</A>  By providing a
larger subsidy for low-income families,  a credit would encourage more people to
secure health  insurance, reduce adverse selection, and discourage free  riders.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#50">50</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A tax credit approach also has the benefit of advancing solid  welfare
reform by encouraging work and targeting the benefits of  the credit to the
segment of the population that otherwise would  remain uninsured without
Medicaid, a key element of the  welfare system. While the goal of medical
coverage for all who want  to purchase it is realized more efficiently through
tax credits, such  a system also increases the numbers in the labor force. The 
CBO confirms this: &quot;[T]he credit would also reduce the current 
disincentive for welfare recipients to enter the work force. At  present,
welfare recipients can lose most of their benefits when they go  to work.... [A]
tax credit would reduce this  penalty.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#51">51</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Comprehensive legislation establishing an individual tax  credit, The
Consumer Choice Health Security Act (H.R. 3698,  S.1743), was introduced in 1994
in the House by Representative  Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and in the Senate by
Senator Don Nickles (R-OK).
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under this approach, Americans would be able to choose a  package of health
benefits according to their needs and those of  the family. Whichever plan is
chosen by the head of household,  the family would receive tax relief, in the
form of an individual  tax credit, for the purchase of the health plan. Most of
the cost of  the tax credits would be offset by the fact that they replace the 
current tax exclusion of health benefits. Additional savings in  Medicare and
Medicaid reforms, outlined in the Nickles-Stearns bill,  would offset the
remaining costs of the new tax credit program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thus, the tax credit would replace the current tax exclusion  for
company-sponsored health plans. This means that instead of  having a tax break
for the plan picked by his employer, a  worker would be able to claim a sliding
scale credit, based on income  or health care needs, for the plan of his
choosing, as well as for  out-of-pocket expenses and contributions to a medical
savings  account.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#52">52</A>  The tax
credits would be refundable, meaning that if  the credit actually exceeded the
family's federal tax liability, the  government would pay the difference.
Middle-income families  would benefit significantly from a tax credit approach.
A tax credit  patterned after the Nickles-Stearns legislation would mean a net 
tax cut for every income group, including the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If a head of household was satisfied with the plan already  offered by an
employer, the family could continue to be enrolled in it. If  a worker preferred
a plan offered through a different  organization, such as a union, church, or
professional association, the  employer would be required to &quot;cash out&quot;
the actuarial value of the  worker's current benefits and give the money to the
employee to use  for another health plan. Under the legislation, employers would
 have 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  to offer employees the right to
convert their current health  plans into individual policies, which employees
then would own.  Employers also would be required to add the value of their 
current coverage to the worker's wages, with each worker then able to  use the
money either to pay for the company-sponsored plan or to  buy coverage from an
alternative source. To make the system  simpler for employees, and to ensure
timely premium payments,  employers would be responsible for directing premium
payments (just  as they currently do for the company plan) to the health plans 
designated by their employees. Employers also would adjust  tax withholdings to
reflect the credit available to employees. If  a worker became unemployed, the
family would receive a  refundable tax credit (voucher) to offset the cost of
the designated  plan. Workers and their families would have health care
security,  since they would be able to own their health coverage and take it 
with them if they changed jobs, even during a spell of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the insurance system.</B> Tax reform does not eliminate  the
necessity of making certain changes in the rules governing  the health insurance
market. Companies should not exclude a  person from coverage because of
pre-existing illness or drop a person  because he gets sick; thus, there should
be both limitations on  such exclusions and guaranteed renewability of
insurance.  Moreover, underwriting procedures, and hence premiums, should
reflect  age, gender, and geographic location. Insurance companies,  however,
also should be able to offer premium discounts to individuals  who enroll in
programs to promote healthy lifestyles, or for  checkups and other steps taken
to detect or prevent illness. Ideally,  these reforms of the health insurance
market should be effected at  the state level.

<P><B>Short-Term Reforms</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Short of comprehensive health care reform based on overhaul  of the tax
system and free-market reforms, Congress can  pursue short-term, or incremental,
reforms. The central problem with  the incremental approach is that if it is not
done carefully and  deliberately, reform measures can lead in any conceivable
direction.  Liberals in Congress who have sponsored the Clinton plan or 
legislation establishing a Canadian-style system have a very clear goal:  a
government-run, highly regulated national health care system.  Unless
conservatives have an equally clear sense of where they  are going, they may end
up supporting short-term measures that  actually move the country closer to the
liberals' ideological  goal. Therefore, conservatives ought to evaluate any
proposal by  asking whether it promotes a genuine free market in health care; 
promotes real consumer choice and genuine competition; empowers  patients to
make the key decisions concerning their choice of  physician, insurance plan,
and benefit options; gives employees and  their families direct control over
their own health care dollars;  gives workers and their families the right to
own their own health  insurance plan and enables them to take it with them
wherever they  go; and reduces the bureaucratic overregulation and paperwork 
requirements characteristic of the current health care  system.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#53">53</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are several reforms that would move toward a health  care system that
is more secure and controlled by families rather  than employers, insurance
companies, or the government: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Permit self-employed individuals 100 percent tax
deductibility  for health insurance.</B> The self-employed currently are allowed
to  deduct up to 30 percent of health insurance costs. While the  Bal
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  anced Budget Act of 1995 would
increase this to 50 percent  over the next 7 years, true tax fairness would
place individually  purchased plans and employment-based health insurance on the
 same level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require employers to disclose to workers the true cost of  employee
health benefits.</B> A huge obstacle to serious health care  reform is that too
many Americans think that their employer is  paying for their health care.
While, under an employer-based  system, the employer becomes the means for
transmission of  premium payment and takes a tax deduction for doing so, the
truth is  that households bear 100 percent of health care costs. This simple 
reform would give workers a clearer understanding of just  how much of their
compensation goes to cover health care costs.  It could be accomplished by
requiring a periodic statement on  the employee's pay stub specifying both the
amount the employer  has paid in health care benefits and the corresponding
amount  by which his cash wages and other compensation have been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Allow employers and employees to contribute to flexible  spending
accounts that can be rolled over from year to year.</B> Many  firms allow
employees to contribute pre-tax income to a flexible  spending account, which
can be used to pay for out-of-pocket  medical expenses. Unspent end-of-the-year
balances, however, cannot  be rolled over; they revert to the employer. The new
Congress  should change the law and permit these nontaxable accounts to be 
rolled over tax free from year to year. If an employee leaves a firm, he  or she
should be able to retain the tax-free account for medical  costs in the form of
a medical savings or health security account.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Promote medical malpractice reform.</B> Medical malpractice  costs 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  have contributed to increased
medical costs. In conjunction  with medical malpractice litigation, the current
legal system allows  unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. 
Non-economic damages do not include compensation for medical costs, 
rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses.  The fear
of frivolous malpractice suits has driven approximately  75 percent of all
doctors to perform unnecessary tests because of  the threat of liability.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#54">54</A>  The House passed legislation to
limit  non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice, but  the
measure died in the Senate under intense pressure from trial  lawyers' groups
and the threat of a filibuster spearheaded by  Senate liberals. Medical
malpractice and tort reform should be  addressed in 1997, but preferably at the
state level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Adopt antitrust reform.</B> &quot;Safe harbors&quot; from federal
anti-trust  laws should be created for certain groups of doctors, hospitals, 
and other medical providers; for medical self-regulatory entities that  do not
operate for financial gain; for certain joint ventures  involving high
technology and costly equipment and services; for  certain hospital mergers; and
for health care joint ventures that would  increase access to health care and
enhance health care quality.  Current antitrust laws prohibit such arrangements,
and thus  frustrate efficiencies in the system which would reduce health care 
costs and benefit consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similar reforms were passed by the 104th Congress as part of  the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995. These reforms are needed to  allow the creation of
Provider-Sponsored Organizations (PSOs) as  another health plan option for
elderly and disabled beneficiaries,  thus adding to the available choices in the
private sector for senior  citizens. Rural areas especially would benefit from
the creation  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  PSOs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>As a condition of any insurance reform at the federal level,  eliminate
state-mandated benefits.</B> The health insurance industry is  one of the most
highly regulated sectors of the American  economy. But regulation of health
insurance usually is within the  jurisdiction of the state, not the federal
government. A key component of  state regulation is the imposition of mandated
benefits on  insurance firms licensed at the state level. These mandates are the
product  of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where  medical
specialists and practitioners have succeeded in imposing  coverage requirements.
Over the years, the number and scope of these  benefits have grown
substantially, adding to the cost of  insurance plans sold to employers and
employees. Nationwide, there are  over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from
in vitro fertilization  to chiropractic care and psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at  the federal
level. But in reforming the federal tax code to establish  an individual tax
credit or voucher system, Congress could  specify that the only legal
requirement for securing a tax credit is that  any plan receiving the proceeds
of such a credit must include  catastrophic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If Congress should find it necessary to intervene in the  regulation of
insurance, this reform could be accomplished through  federal preemption,
requiring only catastrophic coverage for health  insurance. Such a measure would
substantially reduce the cost of  insurance for small business at the state and
local levels. It also  would allow for more pooling of insurance and ensure
consumer  protection against underinsurance, which is the true meaning of a loss
 or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  absence of catastrophic coverage.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even if the comprehensive congressional reform measure had  not been vetoed,
however, significant problems would remain in  traditional Medicare and would
need to be addressed. Among them:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Taxpayer burdens for Part B are still too high.</B> The  Medicare
supplemental medical insurance (SMI) program, also known  as Part B, is
voluntary. All persons 65 or over may enroll by paying  a monthly premium 
currently $42.50 per month. This amount  is approximately 25 percent of the
program's costs today. Most  of the debate on Medicare has focused on the
impending  bankruptcy of the trust fund in Part A of the program, the part that 
reimburses hospitals. But in terms of the growing fiscal pressure on  working
families to sustain Medicare, a more serious problem is Part  B, which has been
growing at 12.5 percent a year. Under the  traditional arrangement that the
taxpayer pick up 75 percent or more  of program costs  the position supported by
the Clinton  Administration and liberals in Congress  the CBO projects that the 
taxpayer burden to finance Medicare Part B over five years will be  $589.7
billion over the next seven years (1996-2002). This amount  easily surpasses the
Clinton tax increase of $262 billion between  1994 and 1998, the largest tax
increase in American history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The reforms passed by the House and Senate in 1995 and  vetoed by President
Clinton would have frozen the Part B  beneficiary contribution at the current
rate of 31.5 percent at least  through 2002. This is an improvement, but it
still would not fully  address the crushing future tax burden facing America's
working  families. Under every scenario, that burden will increase sharply, 
especially when the nation's 77 million baby boomers begin to retire.   
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Medicare was enacted in 1965, the original contract  with America's
taxpayers was that they would pay for 50 percent of  the program's cost. That
contract between Congress and the  taxpayers was broken by Congress, leaving the
taxpayers to pay an  increasingly disproportionate share of the cost. Congress
should  restore the Part B premium to 50 percent of program costs for  average
Americans, as originally intended. More affluent  Americans should receive no
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress should allow patients to contract privately with  doctors,
hospitals, and other medical providers.</B> Private contracting  arrangements
help both the beneficiary and the taxpayer. Under  such an arrangement, no
Medicare reimbursement claims would be  filed because none would be sought
either by the provider or by the  patient. This would occur at no cost to
insurance companies or  federal taxpayers. Second, beneficiaries would be free
to receive  their health care from any provider they chose without government 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>

<P>Many elderly and disabled persons, for a variety of personal  reasons, have
expressed to their physicians a desire to keep the  federal government
completely out of the picture. However,  Section 1848(g)(4)(A)(i) of the Social
Security Act requires health  care providers to &quot;[c]omplete and submit a
claim for such services on  a standard claim form specified by the Secretary to
the carrier  on behalf of a beneficiary.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#55">55</A>  Surprisingly, the Department of 
Health and Human Services, which is responsible for enforcing this  statute, has
failed to put forth a clear policy against private  contracting. In <I>Stewart
v. Sullivan</I><U>,</U> 816 F. Supp. 281 (1992), federal  judge Nicholas
Politan ruled that the Secretary of Health and  Human 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Services had not articulated a
clear policy against private  contracting; thus, given the discrepancy between
statutory law and  existing case law, physicians remain uncertain as to which
law prevails  and fearful of possible reprisals from bureaucrats at HCFA who 
periodically threaten sanctions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should end this confusion, stop HCFA's  bureaucratic threats, and
protect the right of private contract and the integrity  of the doctor-patient
relationship.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do you want to change the employment-based system?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> True portability comes only from owning your own  insurance
policy, much as you own your own life, auto, or homeowner's  insurance policy.
Under employer-based insurance, the  employer, not the employee, owns the
policy. Therefore, when a  worker changes his job or loses his job, he can't
take the policy with  him. Insurance regulation, while mitigating the
circumstances of  job changes or transfers, cannot establish personal ownership
of  health insurance policies. That is why insurance reforms can only 
approximate portability, a pale imitation of the real thing. Only  reforming the
tax code can change this arrangement, giving the  individual direct tax relief
for the purchase of insurance and  enabling the consumer to purchase his own
policy and keep it, regardless  of where he works. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Can't we just leave health care reform to the states? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The problems of rising costs, uninsurance, the absence of  port
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 55 -->  ability, and difficulties in
gaining access to health insurance  for many working families are grounded in
the profound distortions  of the health care market caused by federal tax
policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The health care system cannot be reformed unless you reform  the market for
health insurance, and the market for health  insurance cannot be reformed unless
you reform the tax treatment of  health insurance. The federal tax code
profoundly shapes and drives  the current system, distorts the health care
market, and frustrates  the market forces of consumer choice and competition.
The states  can change insurance regulation; they can change the rules 
governing the licensing of doctors and hospitals or other medical  providers;
but they cannot change the federal tax code, and thus alter the  basic dynamics
of the health care system. Unfortunately, too  many state health care reform
measures make matters worse by  adding even more mandates and imposing price
controls on doctors  and hospitals, further frustrating the market forces of
consumer  choice and competition.

</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives insist on reducing Medicare spending  to achieve
a balanced budget? </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> In spite of the partisan rhetoric, both the White House and 
Congress know that it is not mathematically possible to balance  the federal
budget without also slowing the growth in Medicare  spending. But even if the
federal budget were balanced, the current  level of Medicare spending  now
almost 11 percent per year   cannot be sustained. It inevitably will impose huge
tax increases on  working Americans or drain federal funding from other vital 
government programs. Writing in the prestigious 
<I>New England Journal of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  Medicine</I> in 1992, President
Clinton himself said that the  current and projected level of Medicare spending
was &quot;unacceptable.&quot;   Curiously, the congressional proposal to reduce
Medicare  spending to roughly twice the rate of inflation is similar to the 
proposal advanced by the President in 1993, when neither the federal  budget nor
the solvency of the Medicare trust fund was a pressing  issue for the White
House and the President was proposing to  use the savings from Medicare to
finance the Administration's  health care plan. A noteworthy difference is that
all of the Medicare  savings under the congressional plan would be plowed back 
into Medicare itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why, then, was there such a huge gap between the $128  billion the
White House plan proposed to save in Medicare and the  $270 billion proposed by
Congress? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There wasn't. The President's plan used its own rosy OMB 
assumptions of baseline expenditures (that is, under current  law). Because OMB
assumed a slower growth in Medicare spending,  the President had to cut less to
reach virtually the same actual  spending levels. Congress used the bipartisan
Congressional  Budget Office baseline, and so needed to save $270 billion over 
seven years. If one uses different baselines, one gets different  results. When
one uses the same baseline, the difference between  the White House and
congressional figures shrinks dramatically.  Using the CBO baseline, the White
House savings of $128  billion balloon into $192 billion, a difference with
Congress of $78  billion over seven years, or a little more that $11 billion a
year.  Taking premium charges into account, a Heritage Foundation analysis  of
the two proposals indicates that the real gap between the  White House and
Congress would be only $20.7 billion in spending  over 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 57 -->  seven years, or about one percent
of current Medicare  outlays.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#56">56</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The appearance of a large gap thus is based on the use of  different
baselines in the same media reports on the competing plans. It's  as if the
White House says the temperature today is 0 degrees  Celsius but Congress says
it is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and so seems to  create an unbridgeable 32 degree
difference. Mixing OMB and  CBO baselines is tantamount to mixing Celsius and
Fahrenheit  measures of temperature, and is equally misleading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives want to push the elderly all into  managed care?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is no plan to do so. The congressional Medicare  reform
plan does make managed care an option, but it also enables  the elderly to
choose other options, including fee-for-service plans  or medical savings
accounts, as well as traditional Medicare. In  any case, the Congressional
Budget Office, in examining the  likelihood of enrollment changes, estimated
that about 24 percent of  Medicare beneficiaries would belong to HMOs in 2002,
an increase  of about 10 percent.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#57">57</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why raise Medicare premiums to pay for a tax cut for  wealthy
Americans?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) premiums paid  by
beneficiaries do not finance the tax relief provisions in the  Balanced Budget
Act of 1995. The Balanced Budget Act sought  to maintain the calendar year 1995
ratio of SMI premium  collections to program costs at 31.5 percent. Since
enrollment in the SMI  program is voluntary, an increase in premiums is not a
tax increase  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  those who choose to take
advantage of a taxpayer subsidy.  The premium  $42.50 per month as of January 1,
1996  is  equivalent to just 25 percent of the actual cost of the Part B
program.  The remaining 75 percent is paid for by taxpayers out of the  general
revenue fund. When Congress established Medicare Part B  in 1966, it created a
taxpayer subsidy for the premiums paid by  the nation's elderly, setting it at
50 percent of the program's cost.  As you can see, Congress created a subsidy
for the nation's  elderly, but at a significantly lower rate than is currently
the case. It  is ironic that most of the uninsured workers in America are forced
 to subsidize health care for the elderly through the mandatory  Medicare
payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Haven't we heard before that the Medicare system is bankrupt?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, you have. The Medicare Board of Trustees have  been warning
Congress for years that the Hospital Insurance (HI, or  Part A) Trust Fund will
be exhausted by the year 2002. During both  the Reagan and Bush Administrations,
Congress was told  repeatedly that corrective action was necessary to avoid huge
tax increases  on working families or a reduction in benefits of similar 
proportions. Congress chose to ignore these warnings. For example, 
Representative Sam Gibbons (D-FL), former Chairman of the House  Ways and Means
Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare,  says the insolvency issue is
greatly exaggerated: &quot;I've read these  trustees' reports for years. They're
all pessimistic. I don't panic  over the insolvency question.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#58">58</A>  Even President Clinton 
acknowledged the impending crisis in an address to a joint session of  Congress,
seeking to maintain the 1995 calendar year ratio of premium  collections to
program outlays with a 27 percent  ceiling.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#59">59</A>  While the 27 percent ceiling
perpetuates a generous taxpayer subsidy to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  elderly, it is a modest
improvement over current law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do Republicans want to force senior citizens into  Health
Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Republicans do not want to force senior citizens into  HMOs. The
Medicare reform proposal contained within the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995
assumes that the elderly should be allowed to  enroll in a plan with health
services and benefits that they  choose, not just one with options prescribed by
bureaucrats or politicians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits  Program (FEHBP), which
covers approximately 1.6 million retired  federal workers, including former
Members of Congress, the  congressional proposal expands the opportunities for
individual  choice. Enrollees would be able to choose either traditional
Medicare or  a private plan in the MedicarePlus program. For an enrollee  who
chose to enroll in MedicarePlus, the choices available would  include a private
fee-for-service plan, a union plan, a  Taft-Hartley plan, a managed care option
(HMO, PPO, etc.), a  high-deductible policy combined with a medical savings
account (MSA), or a  plan offered through a church or an association such as the
 American Association of Retired Persons (AARP).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't I entitled to every penny that I paid into Medicare?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Absolutely. Many elderly Americans wrongly assume they  are
getting back what they paid into the system. However, many  seniors are getting
back much more than they contributed,  assuming they contributed at all. The
Medicare health benefit package  offered in future years will be worth more than
the current  program, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  which is much more valuable than
the one offered in past  years.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#60">60</A>
 Since Medicare benefits are open-ended by design, their value  has risen
consistently over time. The average benefit (Parts A and  B) per enrollee was
worth approximately $4,800 in 1995.  According to the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA), which  oversees and administers Medicare, spending is
expected to  continue rising at such a rapid pace that the total expected value
of  Medicare benefits for a couple retiring at age 65 in 1995 is  over $185,000.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#61">61</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of the workforce  supporting the
current system is scheduled to retire beginning in  2010. The approximate ratio
of workers to people 65 or over is 4:7;  by the year 2030, only two workers will
be supporting each  beneficiary. Given the trust funds' inadequate reserves and
weak  financing structure, unless reforms are instituted, workers will  face
higher taxes to finance the subsidy enjoyed by current  beneficiaries.

<a href="fyi110c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Who Pays for Part B Costs?<br>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The latest annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees underscores the severe financial plight of the program and the urgent need for structural reform. The six trustees, who include three Clinton Administration Cabinet secretaries, make clear that no amount of fine-tuning can stave off disaster. The report indicates that the only way to assure Medicare's ability to deliver adequate health care to most of today's senior citizens, let alone the next generation of elderly Americans, is to overhaul the program now so that it can deliver better care for less money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Most of the recent media attention given to the report has focused on the trustees' assessment of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, also known as Part A. The trust fund is like a savings account, where the income is payroll tax revenue and the outlays pay for services. The problem is that for a number of reasons, most significantly the aging of the baby-boom generation, the trust fund is being hit by a financing windshear, already causing outlays to exceed income and exhausting all reserves by 2001. In other words, the fund in 2002 literally would have no money to pay promised benefits. Thereafter, for at least the next 70 years (the limit of the trustees' projections), the cost of continuing services would continue to exceed program income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Absent any reform, Medicare can continue after 2001 only if it drastically cuts services or tries to keep the HI program afloat with tax increases. But the cost of a bailout would be staggering. The report indicates that the cumulative deficit in the trust fund (that is, the extra money needed to maintain services) would be over $400 billion by 2005. In that year alone, outlays would exceed income by over $100 billion, and the red ink would be accelerating annually. So just to continue hospital services until 2005, the bailout cost to the average American household would be about $4,000 in new taxes. As the trustees conclude, with classic understatement, "The HI program remains severely out of balance."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But that is just Part A. Part B of Medicare, which pays for physician and other services, is financed only partly by premiums (which cover about 30 percent of program costs), with the rest financed by general revenues. The level of taxpayer subsidy has nothing to do with the beneficiary's income -- elderly millionaires get the same subsidy as the poor. Under current law, say the trustees, taxpayers will have to cover 84 percent of Part B costs by 2005 and an increasing proportion thereafter. According to the trustees' figures, the cumulative taxpayer subsidy between 1996 and 2005 alone will be $950 billion, or roughly $10,000 in taxes for the average American household. The figures for succeeding decades will be even larger.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taking the two parts of Medicare together, to keep the program afloat just until 2005 without reforms will take about $14,000 per household in taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, this stark picture prompts the trustees to call for "the earliest possible enactment of legislation" only to delay bankruptcy for a few years, not to address the long-term problem. Instead, they call for a national commission to recommend long-term solutions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such a commission would be a serious mistake. Rather than encourage serious public discussion of the tough choices that must be faced, it would allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years. But by then the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Advocates of a commission point to previous examples of supposedly successful commissions in making the case for a Medicare commission. Most often they cite the 1982 Social Security commission and the recent panel on military base closures. But the experience of commissions intended to produce legislation is that they are successful in only two situations: first, when only a relatively small mid-course correction is needed in the funding of a sensitive program to keep it in operation for many years (the Social Security commission), or second, when there is almost unanimous agreement on what needs to be done and the commission merely provides political protection (base closing).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Medicare fits into neither of these categories. The problem is not small and short-term: It is massive and structural. And there is no consensus on what needs to be done. To deal with Medicare, major and controversial decisions will have to be made concerning the nature of the entitlement, the benefits, and the role of the taxpayer. These already have been discussed at length on Capitol Hill. In fact, legislative decisions were taken last year, only to be vetoed by President Clinton. All a commission can do, in effect, is take a year or so to put the options already known into a single binder and deliver them back to Capitol Hill. But Congress and the President will still have to make the tough choices --a commission would not render them any easier. With the program so close to collapse, it would be much wiser for the elected government to begin making those decisions today, preferably with the President as an active partner.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To achieve long-term stability in Medicare, three broad changes are needed to encourage much greater efficiency by giving much more economic control and more sensible incentives to the elderly. The bill Congress enacted last year would have begun this reform, but was vetoed. Specifically, Congress and the White House should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Turn Medicare into a defined contribution program.</b> Medicare currently promises a set of specific benefits, rather than a certain degree of assistance to seniors to purchase the benefits they want. Moving to a defined contribution system would give the elderly much greater choice and an incentive to seek better value for money.
<p>
<li><b> Open up new plan choices for the elderly.</b> In today's Medicare, benefits are designed and priced in Washington and updated only slowly, if at all, after months or years of intense debate and lobbying in Washington. That is why the elderly are still waiting for the kind of routine drug benefits, or service options, that are available in almost any standard private plan -- or to retired federal workers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Thus, allowing seniors the right to choose from a wide range of plans and benefit packages is needed to modernize coverage. It also is needed to spur competition between plans to provide the best value for money for seniors.
<P>
<li><b> Reduce the Part B subsidy for those who do not need it.</b> Part B is not a social insurance program. It is a heavily subsidized, optional, government-run physician insurance program. Rich elderly Americans receive the same subsidy as seniors who rely entirely on their Social Security checks. It is time for Congress to rein in the unwarranted taxpayer-funded subsidy for those who do not need it to afford health care.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Medicare trustees' report is grim reading. It refutes utterly the na‹ve idea that only a little fine-tuning is needed for the program to exist for the next generation of elderly Americans. The report makes clear that there are only three choices available: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms to enable the program to deliver health care at less cost. Obviously, only the third choice makes any sense. The quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two key advisory boards for the Medicare program, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) and Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), have joined in the calls for Congress and the President to slow the explosive growth in Medicare spending.  The annual reports of both official panels also shed light on the deficiencies in Medicare's complex system of price controls.  In the case of PROPAC, there is a clear acknowledgment that the "dynamic process" works by shifting the rising costs of the Medicare program over to workers and their families in the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Created by Congress in 1983, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) advises Members of Congress and the Secretary of the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and other medical facilities.  Created by Congress in 1985, the Physician Payment Review Commission was charged with advising Congress on physician payment reform, and later with advising Congress on Medicare fee schedules for doctors.  It also examines the related issues of patient access, utilization, and assignment policies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In practice, PROPAC's main responsibility is to advise Congress on how to regulate hospital rates under the Prospective Payment System (PPS), Medicare's hospital fee schedule; the PPS is essentially a complicated price control system.<sup>1</sup>  PROPAC currently is chaired by Stuart H.  Altman, Ph.D., a professor of health care policy at Brandeis University and formerly a key adviser on health care policy to President Clinton.<sup>2</sup>  The PPRC's main responsibility is giving advice to Congress on regulating the Medicare fees of doctors, in particular the administration of Medicare's Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS),<sup>3</sup> in conjunction with standards governing the volume of medical services and limitations on billing.  The PPRC is chaired by Gail Wilensky, Ph.D., of Project Hope, formerly the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) under President George Bush.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In its most recent report,<sup>4</sup> PROPAC outlines 26 separate recommendations governing various aspects of hospital payment and other features of the Medicare program.  Most of these are technical and include detailed recommendations concerning payment schedules.  The PPRC's 401-page report also makes numerous technical recommendations on various aspects of Medicare reimbursements.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But more significant are the panels' recommendations on general Medicare reform.  These recommendations touch on Medicare's fundamental structure and financing, as well as the growth in overall Medicare spending.  Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Both panels emphasizes the urgent need to control Medicare spending,</b> and PROPAC notes that despite partisan rhetoric, the White House and Congress are quite close in their targets for spending control;
<p>
<li><b>Both call for giving beneficiaries more choices;</b>
<p>
<li><b>Neither panel opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs)</b>, in contrast with the White House; and
<p>
<li><b>Both panels note the limitations and heavy costs</b> associated with today's Medicare price controls.
</ul><p>

<b>WHAT THE PANELS SAY ABOUT REFORM</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress showed great political courage in attempting structural reform of the Medicare program.  While that reform was vetoed by President Clinton, recent reports on the operating deficit of the hospital trust fund underscore the need for urgent action to contain costs and reorganize the 30-year-old program.  Members of Congress should heed the Commissions' contributions to the reform debate, particularly on technical issues.  Many of these are particularly helpful and may suggest ways of resolving some of the disputes between Congress and the White House.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider some key observations:
<p>
<b>Observation #1:  Both panels urge Congress to slow the growth in Medicare spending.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Says PROPAC:  "The rise in Medicare spending threatens the solvency of the program's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, its primary source of income.  Moreover, it has been a major contributor to the federal budget deficit."<sup>5</sup>  The Commission notes that between 1967 and 1993, Medicare spending jumped thirtyfold.  Between 1980 and 1993, Medicare spending was climbing in excess of 11 percent per year.  As the Medicare trustees noted last year, the Medicare hospitalization program, which already has run a deficit for the first time in 1995, is expected to go bankrupt in the year 2002 or possibly even sooner.  The Medicare payment for physicians services, also known as Medicare Part B, while not facing insolvency, is taking an ever-larger share of general revenues to break even, rising from 49 percent of Part B income in 1972 to 72 percent in 1993.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under current law, taxpayers are required to cover Part B expenditures automatically:  "The growth in Part B Medicare spending, therefore, increases the federal budget and contributes to the deficit."<sup>6</sup>  By 1995, Medicare spending reached $177 billion, an amount equal to 12 percent of the federal budget.  By the year 2002, it will reach $332 billion, and Medicare, together with Medicaid, which covers the poor and the indigent, will equal approximately 27 percent of the federal budget:  "[The Congressional Budget Office] points to the rapid growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending as the major factor driving up its deficit projections."<sup>7</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the PPRC says, Medicare's "growth has outpaced defense and social security, and today is second only to net interest payments on the national debt.  And while Medicare expenditures are expected to continue accelerating at annual rates of 8.6 percent to 10 percent from now until 2005, rates of growth in federal outlays for other national priorities are expected to decline."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC notes that the private sector has been more successful in recent years in controlling health care costs and recommends a similar slowing of Medicare costs:  "Over time, spending for services furnished to Medicare enrollees should increase at rates comparable to those in a cost- and quality-conscious private sector."<sup>9</sup>  Similarly, PPRC says, "recent data showing that private sector health spending is growing more slowly than Medicare expenditures have reinforced the view that greater discipline in spending is possible without threatening access or quality of care."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #2:  PROPAC notes that the budget debate obscures a significant fact:  Both the White House and Congress are relatively close in their efforts to slow the growth of Medicare spending.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Notes the Commission:  "The annual increase in Medicare spending is similar in all proposals, ranging from 7.2 percent to 7.6 percent.  The variation in total savings, however, is much greater due to differences in the growth of Part B premiums among the proposals."<sup>11</sup>  If nothing is done to curb the growth in Medicare spending, the Congressional Budget Office projects that it will grow between 1995 and 2002 at a rate of 9.4 percent annually.  Neither Congress nor the White House regards this rate of growth as acceptable.  Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, enacted by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton, Medicare spending would rise at an annual rate of 7.2 percent.<sup>12</sup>  President Clinton proposed a Medicare reform package that would have established an annual growth rate of 7.6 percent.  A third proposal, offered by a coalition of members of the House of Representatives, would have set annual spending increases at 7.5 percent.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #3:  Both panels agree that Congress and the President should give Medicare enrollees the personal and financial benefits of consumer choice and competition. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Says PROPAC:  "Medicare beneficiaries should have a wider range of health plan options.  Under the current program beneficiary choice is largely limited to the traditional fee for service program and, where available, an HMO option.  Additional alternatives would let Medicare beneficiaries choose the type of plan that best meets their needs and would permit new beneficiaries enrolled in a particular type of plan before retirement to stay in that arrangement.  In addition, more alternatives could increase plan competition for Medicare beneficiaries on the basis of additional benefits and quality."<sup>14</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress's plan would have given enrollees a broad range of choice.  PROPAC notes that the congressional "MedicarePlus would allow a broad array of managed care plans, including preferred provider organizations (PPOs) to participate.  Fee for service plans also would be permitted.  New options not widely available in the private market, such as medical savings accounts (MSAs) and provider sponsored networks, also could be offered to beneficiaries.  All MedicarePlus plans would receive a capitation payment from Medicare."<sup>15</sup>  PROPAC also acknowledges that the Clinton plan would give less choice to elderly Americans than the congressional plan:  "The President also has proposed expanding the risk program, but the changes would be less comprehensive than those Congress has envisioned under MedicarePlus.  Beneficiaries would be able to enroll in qualified PPO's and provider sponsored organizations as well as HMOs.  Most enrollees would be able to join one of those plans only during annual open enrollment periods.  Private fee for service plans and high deductible plans combined with MSAs would not be among the available options."<sup>16</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC observes that the creation of a market-oriented Medicare system characterized by consumer choice and competition would encourage private organizations to promote and disseminate vital consumer information:  "As the number of choices under Medicare increases either through the current program or expansions, private entities likely will begin distributing information about these choices to beneficiaries.  Although this is appropriate, Medicare should not abandon its responsibility to ensure that beneficiaries receive unbiased, comparable and reliable data."<sup>17</sup>  The Secretary of HHS, much like the Director of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in administering the consumer-based Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for federal workers and retirees, could play an important role in providing unbiased plan information to Medicare enrollees, according to PROPAC:  "The Secretary should continue efforts to identify the information beneficiaries need to make informed health plan choices and the most appropriate format for it.  This is even more critical as health plan choices are expanded for Medicare beneficiaries.  The Secretary should explore initiatives that would, for example, measure the satisfaction of beneficiaries who used services, describe total benefits available in an area (including those covered under insurance policies offered as supplements to Medicare) and document performance of individual providers within a plan."<sup>18</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The PPRC similarly favors an aggressive information program for Medicare consumers on plan options in a reformed and modernized Medicare system, showing consumers costs and benefits, including the costs and benefits of enrollment in health maintenance organization (HMO) plans.  Says the PPRC:  "Plans should disclose information about the general nature of the financial incentives faced by providers who contract with a health plan."<sup>19</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC recommends the expansion of Medicare's limited capitation program and patient choice:  "The Commission supports reforming the Medicare captitation program to control spending while expanding beneficiary choice."<sup>20</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #4:  Surprisingly, neither official panel comes out in opposition to medical savings accounts (MSAs).  Both panels acknowledge that MSAs would provide additional choice for the elderly and note that most, though not all, Medicare beneficiaries choosing MSAs would benefit financially from their choices.  The panels do emphasize that MSAs must be carefully designed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to PROPAC, "Most beneficiaries who selected the Medicare MSA option probably would benefit financially.  Beneficiaries who did not anticipate using health services would be attracted to this option, because they would expect to keep unspent MSA funds."<sup>21</sup>  The Commission notes that the effectiveness of MSAs in the area of cost control would be determined largely by the way they are designed.  Specifically, senior citizens would likely be prudent purchasers of medical services if they saw the money in their MSAs as their own money and viewed anything unspent as personal savings.  The MSAs must be designed as a savings vehicle.  If they are improperly designed or presented, and if the elderly do not understand the money in the account to be potential savings, and not just an account for health services, the MSA could become a "spending plan" and, PROPAC notes, thus would "tend to reduce beneficiaries' restraint in purchasing health services."<sup>22</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another issue related to MSAs is the problem of adverse selection.  Critics claim that MSAs would be selected mainly by healthy seniors, which could lead to a large increase in Medicare spending rather than a reduction.  PROPAC says that the current risk adjustment mechanism in the Medicare system is inadequate to deal with the problem of adverse selection.  This has consequences for MSAs.  PROPAC suggests that in developing an MSA program, policymakers should scrutinize its design carefully, with special attention to the amount of funds deposited, the length of time before persons may disenroll, and the "features" of the high-deductible plan.<sup>23</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is strong opposition to MSAs among liberals in Congress, particularly in the Senate, and in the Clinton Administration.  Thus, it is significant that PROPAC, which serves as an official advisory board for Medicare, does not oppose MSAs.  Instead, PROPAC favors improved risk adjustment and says that "The likelihood that rates would better reflect risk would be enhanced if Medicare enrollees were required to remain in the MSA option at least for several years."<sup>24</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the PPRC recommends that "The enrollment and disenrollment rules of Medicare medical savings account plans should be structured to reduce the potential risk for risk selection.  Examples of restructured rules include a minimum enrollment period of several years in an MSA or requiring beneficiaries to announce their disenrollment from an MSA one or more years in advance."<sup>25</sup>  The PPRC calls for careful monitoring of risk selection and its impact on Medicare costs.  Moreover, says the Commission, Medicare MSA plans should be on a level playing field with other plans.  In this respect, it says, MSA plans should be held to the same standards as other plans in reporting data to Medicare.  Moreover, there should be "no undue legal restriction of managed care plans' ability to offer this product."<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, the PPRC notes that the personal choice of an MSA plan is not, of course, a risk free option and estimates that 28 percent of Medicare beneficiaries probably would reach the $3,000 deductible limit that qualifies them for catastrophic coverage under the congressional Medicare reform plan.<sup>27</sup>  Consumers therefore should fully understand the potential costs, including out-of-pocket costs.  Thus, the PPRC recommends:  "Medicare MSA plans should be required to disclose beneficiaries' typical (and potential) out-of pocket spending including exposure to balance billing.  This information should be provided to beneficiaries in a uniform format so that they can easily compare insurers."<sup>28</sup>  It should be noted that in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, health plan cost comparison data, including potential out-of-pocket costs, are made available routinely through private sources to Members of Congress, federal workers, and retirees during the annual "Open Season," the special time of year when these consumers pick and choose among a variety of health plans.
<p>
<b>Observation #5:  Both panels say that Medicare should improve risk adjustment mechanisms to reduce the problems of adverse selection and to control costs in the Medicare program. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1985, Congress established a "risk contracting program" under which health maintenance organizations (HMOs) would receive a per capita payment from Medicare for providing medical services to the elderly.  Through this capitation system, Medicare beneficiaries would be able to enroll in these special HMOs and get extra benefits, while Medicare would be able to realize savings through a fixed payment.  Today, about 8 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the program.  The government's pricing system is inefficient and does not reflect market conditions.  As PROPAC notes, "The program's capitation rates appear to be too high in some markets and too low in others, discouraging plan participation.  Further, it appears that healthier beneficiaries are likelier than others to enroll, and the payment rates do not adequately reflect this lower risk of illness.  Thus, Medicare may pay more for beneficiaries in its risk program than it would have had they stayed in the fee for service program."<sup>29</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC argues that Medicare needs a better risk adjustment method in setting rates to reflect more accurately the differences among individuals in their use of medical services.  Without this effective risk adjustment, especially if capitated plans and traditional fee for service plans are competing in a reformed system, the result could be higher-than-expected costs.  PROPAC suggests that while no ideal risk adjustment mechanism exists, the Secretary of HHS should "implement interim improvements as soon as possible."<sup>30</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In order to meet budgetary targets, Congress included a "fail safe mechanism" in the Medicare reform legislation last year.  This would have meant automatic reductions in payments to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers if specified budget targets were not met.  The mechanism would rely on the existing apparatus of Medicare price regulations.  With respect to this approach, PROPAC says, "Any fail-safe budget mechanism should include a more effective risk adjustment factor to ensure payment equity between the Medicare capitation and traditional fee for service programs."<sup>31</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given its limited experience with managed care options, the PPRC agrees substantively with PROPAC on the issue of risk selection:  "Although Medicare's per capita payment should be adjusted to reflect the risk mix of each plan's enrollees, current risk adjustment approaches capture relatively little of any biased selection across plans."<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #6:  Medicare's price controls have their cost.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Physician Payment Review Commission is charged with advising Congress on how to pay doctors the "right price" for their professional services.  Given the complexities of the cumbersome Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), this is an inherently formidable task.  As the PPRC puts it, with classic understatement:
<blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In hindsight, however, physician payment reform has not been an unqualified success.  In part this reflects inconsistencies within the policy that resulted from compromises made in crafting the reform.  For example, distortions in relative values have been reintroduced owing to the existence of separate volume performance standards (VPSs) for different categories of services:  surgical, primary care and non surgical.  As a result, shifts in relative payments accomplished over the past several years will likely be reversed unless further legislative changes are made.  In addition, some expectations about payment reform's effects may have been unrealistic given the underlying incentives of fee for service medicine.  Despite progress in slowing the rate of growth in physicians services, for instance, overall Medicare expenditures continue to increase at a rate many consider unaffordable.<sup>33</sup></blockquote>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If Medicare's price control regime governing doctors has not been an "unqualified success," neither has its system governing hospitals.  Since 1983, Congress has imposed a complex system of price controls on hospitals called the Prospective Payment System.  Under this system, hospitals are prospectively reimbursed for medical services; almost 500 of these medical services are grouped according to categories, each called a diagnostic related group (DRG), for which there are fixed payments.  Hospitals may not charge more for the services to Medicare payments, nor may hospitals rebate funds to Medicare enrollees if they can provide a medical service more cheaply.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the years, the impact of the PPS/DRG system on inpatient care has been to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare's hospital costs.  The economic incentives in the system have reduced the length of inpatient hospital stays, especially for older Medicare patients.  Says PROPAC:  "The rapid fall of Medicare length of stay may partially reflect a trend toward discharging some patients to post-acute settings earlier in the course of their treatment, representing a change in the hospital product.  This has led to concern about how Medicare pays for patients who are discharged from PPS hospitals to inpatient post-acute care providers."<sup>34</sup>  Price controls always encourage a shifting of resources from the controlled to the less controlled or uncontrolled sectors of the economy.  This, of course, invariably generates a demand for an extension of the price controls, an absurd process that distorts economic arrangements even more.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A clear example of hospital gaming has been the broader shifting of Medicare hospital costs since the inception of PPS to the private sector.  Says the Commission:  "During this period, hospitals generally were able to obtain the revenue they needed to cover additional losses from treating Medicare patients by cost shifting to private insurers.  This was accomplished by obtaining payment increases from private payers that exceeded the corresponding cost increases.  As a result, the average payment to cost ratio for private payers went from 116 percent in 1986 to 131 percent in 1992.  Primarily because of cost shifting, hospitals were able to maintain fairly stable total margins, which reflect gains and losses from all payers as well as from non-patient care activities."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, Americans with private insurance pay extra to offset the relatively low reimbursements received by providers from the Medicare program.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Medicare's official advisors have strongly reaffirmed the need to reform the Medicare system.  This is welcome support for necessary changes in the program.  Failure to enact reform means either huge future cuts in Medicare benefits for the elderly or huge tax increases on working families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Medicare's advisory panels have argued forcefully in their reports that Medicare spending should be slowed, and that the failure to do so threatens Medicare's financial solvency and aggravates the federal budget deficit.  But Medicare's advisers also have endorsed broader consumer choice while declining to oppose medical savings accounts (MSAs).  Moreover, they have made constructive proposals in the technical areas of risk adjustment and information sharing for a modernized Medicare system characterized by consumer choice and competition.  And, finally, they have been forthright in their description of the operations of the system's price regulations.  PROPAC, in particular, has noted that price regulation of hospital services -- long the official recipe for slowing down Medicare's rising costs -- imposes its own costs on workers and their families in the private insurance market.  Obviously, any "reform" of Medicare that relies on clamping down even more tightly on payments to hospitals and physicians will aggravate that cost shifting to the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reports of these two commissions underscore the need for fundamental reform, and they indicate yet again that there is bipartisan support among experts for that reform.

<title>Bridging the Budget Gap on Medicare -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>BRIDGING THE BUDGET GAP ON MEDICARE</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br>
 Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/welcome.html.cgi"> The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 73<br>
November 21, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
The Congress-White House budget agreement reached on Sunday would incorporate a slightly modified Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline against which to measure competing ways to balance the budget in seven years. 
<p>
This is important because it means both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue will be using the same "benchmark" to compare proposals with current law. Until now, the White House has insisted on  using baselines developed by its own Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Congress uses the nonpartisan CBO, as required by statute. Since the OMB's forecast for the economy and spending under current law generally is more optimistic than CBO's (that is, assumes faster economic growth and a slower increase in many federal programs), achieving any proposed federal budget requires smaller savings according to the White House than according to CBO.
<p>
Using the same CBO scorecard will make it much easier to reach compromise in a number of policy areas where the White House and Congress hitherto appeared too far apart for an agreement. Perhaps the most important of these areas is Medicare. The White House and congressional Democrats in recent weeks have attempted to draw a stark distinction between the Medicare savings projected in the House-Senate conference budget resolution and President Clinton's budget plan, released in June. Americans have been told that, while the President's plan seeks to achieve only $128 billion in savings over the next seven years, the conference budget resolution seeks to achieve $270 billion in savings. Hence, the impression is created that Congress intends to reduce projected Medicare spending by more than double the amount favored by the White House.
<p>
Using the same CBO baseline for both Medicare proposals sharply reduces the gap. 
<p>
Specifically:
<p>
Comparing the two budget plans with the CBO baseline indicates that the White House wants savings of $192 billion, not the $128 billion it claims when comparing its plan with that of Congress. This makes the difference between the two plans $78 billion over seven years, not the $142 billion claimed by the White House.
<p>
But even this overstates the gap between the two positions in terms of reducing the outlays for Medicare. The reason:  Congress's budget includes new revenue into the program from raising Part B premiums in two ways. In the arcane accounting of Washington, bringing new revenues into the Medicare program is considered identical to cutting the growth of projected spending on health care services. It obviously is not, however, since adding revenues to fund the program does not reduce spending, even though it does reduce the growth in net outlays. 
<p>
Under the congressional plan, the first way Part B premium revenues are increased, compared with current law, is by maintaining premiums at 31.5 percent of costs instead of allowing them to fall to 25 percent of costs, as current law would do (meaning an actual reduction in premiums). This raises $48.7 billion over seven years. Under the second change, an affluence test would be applied to Medicare recipients, and upper-income beneficiaries would face an additional increase in premiums, reducing the subsidy these individuals currently receive from taxpayers. This second change raises $8.6 billion over seven years. Thus, the combined revenue generated by the premium adjustments -- which is classified as a reduction in spending by Washington, but actually funds more Medicare services -- is $57.3 billion over seven years.
<p>
The Clinton budget contains no premium increases, even on the wealthy. So to compare the effect of the two Medicare proposals on actual spending for services, it is necessary to add the misleadingly classified $57.3 billion revenue increase to the congressional budget numbers.
<p>
If Medicare spending under the two budgets is compared with the CBO baseline, after correcting the congressional figure for the additional premium revenue, the difference in spending falls to a gap of just $20.7 billion over seven years in a program which is projected to spend $1,900 billion over that period. Thus, the gap between the White House and Congress on Medicare spending is just one percent of current projected outlays.

<h3>HOW CONGRESS WON THE BUDGET WAR </h3>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi109t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Comparing this Congress with Clinton's and Reagan's Selected Spending Cuts
<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.

<P><B><A NAME="THE">The Issues</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of balancing the federal budget is no longer in question  in
Washington. Both Congress and (much more reluctantly)  President Clinton have
presented plans to balance the budget by FY  2002 that are certified by the
Congressional Budget Office. As with  any major corporation facing Chapter 11
bankruptcy, however,  balancing the books on paper is not the same as taking the
tough  actions needed to restore a failing institution to fiscal health. Even if
 Congress and the President reach a balanced budget agreement  in 1996, which is
by no means certain, the federal budget still  will fund hundreds of programs
that are obsolete, inefficient, or ripe  for privatization, or which should be
turned back to state and  local governments. Thus, the central budget issue for
the 1996  election should be how to restructure the government to meet the 
nation's needs in the 21st century. Such a debate will lay the  groundwork for
swift action by the 105th Congress in 1997 to downsize  and restructure the
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If Congress and the President are serious about restructuring  the federal
government, they must challenge the substance of  every government program  top
to bottom  using three principles  to guide their work: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Federalism:</B> This means determining which activities are  the
responsibility of the federal government and which are best  done by state and
local governments.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Privatization: </B>This means finding ways to transfer many 
activities now run  inefficiently or inappropriately  by government  to the more
effective and efficient private sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Termination:</B> This means asking of every government  program:
Should the government be engaged in this activity at all?  Is  this program
outmoded, obsolete, inefficient, or broken beyond repair?   If the answer to any
of these questions is yes, then Washington  has an obligation to the taxpayers
to terminate the program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Tinkering with the process of government will not cut  enough spending to
balance the budget; nor will it deliver the major  restructuring the government
needs. Making obsolete programs  process paperwork more efficiently is a waste
of taxpayers'  money. This is the major failing of Vice President Al Gore's
National  Performance Review, or &quot;Reinventing Government&quot; initiative. 
Taxpayers sent a clear message to Washington in 1994 that they do  not want
useless and obsolete programs to waste their money  more efficiently. They want
the budget to be balanced in a timely  fashion, and they want the result of this
effort to be a smaller,  less costly government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration managed to cast  the 1995 budget
debate more as a struggle over the process of how  to balance the federal budget
on paper, without making any hard  decisions, than as a serious attempt to
define what the  government should look like once the budget is put in balance,
and what  was 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  needed to reach that result. The
Balanced Budget Act of  1995, which passed Congress only to be vetoed by
President Clinton,  did contain many substantive policy changes to slow federal 
spending growth and turn some federal programs back to the states. But  in an
effort to force the President to compromise, even this did  too little to alter
the basic structure of government.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Lawmakers thus face many important challenges in the 1996  election period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> they must make the case for continuing to cut spending  
especially discretionary spending if a budget deal  significantly reforms
entitlement programs  to keep the budget on target  for balance in FY 2002; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> they must engage in a serious debate about what the  federal
government should look like once the budget is in balance  and how it should be
restructured to meet the needs of the next  generation of Americans; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> they must change the underlying structure of  entitlement
programs to prevent these programs from consuming ever  more tax dollars and
ever greater shares of the federal budget; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> they must reform the budget process itself to reign  in
spending and bring accountability to how tax dollars are  spent. The current
budget process is a disaster and badly needs  reform.<B> </B>The President is
often a mere bystander, unable to exercise  much control of the nation's purse
strings except through the veto  once Congress has passed a budget. On the other
hand, spending  authority within Congress is highly diffuse across many
committees.  As 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  a result, most Members of Congress
are on one or more  committees with the authority to spend money, but no one
Member is  responsible for how the money is spent. In order to rein in the 
government spending machine, conservatives must make the case  for reforming the
budget process.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Balancing the federal budget is not a panacea for what ails the  federal
government or the national economy. It is simply one step  in returning fiscal
health to a decrepit institution and one element  in boosting economic growth.
To transform the federal  government from a relic of the past into a modern
institution, much more  needs to be done to slow the growth of federal spending,
especially  the uncontrollable portions of the budget known as entitlements,  or
mandatory spending. Also, the budget must be stripped of  programs that have
become outmoded, obsolete, broken beyond  repair, candidates for privatization,
or transfer to state or local  authority. And the process of crafting the budget
itself, which  now takes over a year from the time the White House begins its
work  to the time Congress puts the finishing touches on it, must be fixed  or
the first two priorities cannot be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, balancing the budget and cutting taxes, as the  Balanced Budget
Act of 1995 (BBA) proposed to do, are not  competing ends. Cutting taxes is
central to boosting long-term  economic growth as spending is curbed to bring
the budget into balance.  To be sure, balancing the budget without tax cuts, as
some in  Congress have proposed, will produce higher economic growth  over the
long term than not balancing the budget would. But more  robust economic growth
is generated by a balanced budget plan  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  includes tax cuts. Key to this
superior growth potential are tax  cuts to stimulate new investment and tax cuts
for families.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending Is the Problem</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration proudly claims that the 1993  Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (OBRA 1993), which instituted  the largest tax increase in
U.S. history, produced three years of  continuous decline in the federal deficit
for the first time since  the 1950s. While the causal relationship between the
Clinton tax  increase and slightly falling deficits is questionable, one fact is
 certain: Tax increases do not lead to long-term deficit reduction.  As the
budget deals of 1982, 1984, 1987, and 1990 showed  clearly, tax increases lead
to higher federal spending, slower than  expected economic growth, and, not
surprisingly, higher deficits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures show  that while the
deficit did decline from $255 billion in FY 1993 to  $161 billion in FY 1995, it
is now estimated that it will soar to  nearly $300 billion in ten years, or 83
percent higher than today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Deficits are a symptom of a disease, and the disease is  spending. Thus, the
1995 budget debate was unlike every other effort  to eliminate the federal
deficit because it focused solely on  how much to slow the growth of spending.
There was no discussion  at all, even from liberals, of the &quot;need&quot; for
additional tax revenues  to close the deficit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent CBO spending projections reveal how daunting the task  of controlling
spending really is. From FY 1995 to FY 2002, if  no changes are made in current
law, federal spending will balloon  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  $582 billion, a 38 percent rise.
On average, CBO projects that  total federal spending will grow by 4.8 percent
per year through  2002. While discretionary, or appropriated, programs are
projected  to grow by some 14 percent over the next seven years, and net 
interest payments on the national debt by 16 percent, the reason for  the
explosion in federal spending is entitlement, or mandatory,  spending.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Need to Control Entitlements</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While the short-term projections of entitlement growth should  demand
lawmakers' attention, the long-term growth  projections should demand every
taxpayer's attention. If left  uncontrolled, entitlements will consume a greater
share of budgetary  resources, leaving less money for defense, education,
housing, national  parks, and other areas. But these areas also will continue to
consume  a larger share of the nation's resources. The result will be  stifled
economic growth, higher taxes on tomorrow's workers, and  reduced living
standards for every American.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the impact of growing entitlements extends well  beyond the federal
budget. Unrestricted entitlements distort  individual behavior in many ways  for
example, by discouraging  self-help or even encouraging some beneficiaries to
choose leisure  over work. And growing entitlements distort political behavior
as  more and more Americans become members of an &quot;entitled class.&quot;  
Until recently, politicians have been more than willing to accept  deficit
spending to avoid making politically painful choices on  tax increases or
benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What are entitlements?</B> According to the Congressional  Research 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  Service (CRS), &quot;entitlements
are created by legislation that  requires the payment of benefits to any person
or unit of  government that meets the eligibility requirements established by
such  law.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>
 Entitlements are part of a larger category of the budget called  mandatory
spending. Mandatory spending generally is any  spending that is not controlled
through the appropriations process,  including interest payments on the national
debt and deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How many entitlement programs are there?</B> While there  are &quot;about
400 entitlement and mandatory spending accounts,&quot; it  is difficult to
answer this question because there is &quot;no clear  definition of what
constitutes a `program'.&quot;<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     According to the CRS, &quot;the 19
programs with estimated FY  1993 outlays of $2 billion or more account for 97
percent of  entitlement spending. The large social welfare entitlement programs 
dominate mandatory spending  18 of the 19 largest programs are in  the social
welfare budget functions.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     According to the 1994 report of the
Bipartisan Commission  on Entitlement and Tax Reform, headed by Senators Robert 
Kerry (D-NE) and John Danforth (R-MO, now retired), since the  early 1960s,
entitlement spending has consumed an increasing share  of total federal
spending, rising from 22.7 percent of all spending  in FY 1963 to over 47
percent in FY 1993.

<P><B>*     Entitlement programs defy good budgeting practices.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principles of sound budgeting and fiscal responsibility  require that
spending decisions be based on available resources. The  way current entitlement
programs are designed, with their  open-ended claim on the economy's resources,
violates this principle.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Sound budget measures would require that the eligibility criteria  of these
programs be driven by priorities and limits set by  Congress in the budget. But
today, the federal budget is being driven by  the eligibility criteria of
federal entitlements. The entitlement tail  wags the budget dog. The automatic
growth of these programs  forces higher taxes on American workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Deficit reduction should not be the primary goal of  entitlement reform. It
should be the result. These programs should be  reformed because there needs to
be a real decision about their scale,  their objectives, and how best to achieve
their goals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Simple &quot;fixes&quot; are not the way to reform entitlements.  Sweeping
cuts without reforms, for instance, are akin to using wage  and price controls
to curb inflation. As history shows, price  controls and spending caps produce
the budgetary effects of clamping a  lid on a boiling pot. Nor is means-testing
itself a sound way to  curb the growth of mandatory programs, especially if tax
increases  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  used as the primary tool for &quot;taking
benefits&quot; away from  upper-income recipients. Means-testing does nothing to
change the  fundamental problems with the program. The result is a broken 
program with fewer beneficiaries. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Current entitlement programs also should be authorized  and funded on at
least a biannual basis. If necessary, a  commission should be created to balance
program eligibility and available  budgetary resources. Congress would vote on
such  recommendations at the beginning of every two-year cycle. Further, the 
government should have a mechanism for monitoring who is receiving  federal
assistance from all sources. For able-bodied individuals,  there should be a
lifetime limit on government assistance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Entitlement programs violate the American principle of 
federalism.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principle of federalism suggests that programs should  be funded and
managed by the most effective level of  government. Many federal entitlement
programs, such as Medicaid and  welfare, have become expensive mandates to state
and local  governments. The long-term result of such mandates is an irrational
balance  of funding for programs that distort state government  decision-making.
Moreover, since states depend on federal dollars, they  have less incentive to
manage programs in the most efficient and  cost-effective manner.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Entitlement programs undermine responsible behavior.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Entitlement programs undermine individual behavior in  various ways. While
the disastrous incentive effects of welfare on the  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  havior of the poor are well
known, entitlement programs also  encourage the middle class to change their
behavior in ways that  are neither fiscally healthy nor socially desirable. The
fastest  growing portion of the Medicaid program, for example, is made up of 
the long-term costs of nursing care for the elderly &quot;poor.&quot;   However,
many middle-class seniors are simply divesting themselves of  their assets and
technically impoverishing themselves to become  eligible for Medicaid's generous
nursing home payments. Such  a scam may work to the benefit of a senior's
children   absolving children of the cost of caring for their parents  but
society  is much worse off as a result.

</P>
<P>

<P>The federal government has become a monument to the needs  and priorities of
the 19th century, the Great Depression, World War  II, and the Great Society. No
amount of &quot;reinventing,&quot; as Vice  Presi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  dent Al Gore's National
Performance Review proposes, can  turn institutions created to address problems
the nation faced 30, 50,  or even 100 years ago into agencies capable of meeting
the needs  of Americans in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most taxpayers would be stunned to learn how old many  federal programs and
agencies really are. Large segments of the  federal bureaucracy were created
decades ago for purposes long since  forgotten. It is time, for instance, to
strip out of the budget such  pre-World War II programs as the Rural
Electrification  Administration, the National Helium Reserves, Impact Aid, and
the  Agricultural Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many relatively new programs also have seen their missions  made obsolete by
technological and social changes. The Corporation  for Public Broadcasting,
international broadcasting programs such  as the Voice of America, Low-Income
Home Energy Assistance,  and the Department of Energy, for example, all are
outmoded or  irrelevant because of technological and market changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because outmoded, obsolete, or inefficient programs almost  never die,
bureaus, agencies, and programs that duplicate each  other's functions have
sprung up all over the government. The  National Performance Review identified a
staggering degree of  duplication throughout the federal bureaucracy. For
example:

<P><B>Why Tax Cuts Are Needed While Balancing the Budget</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Washington insiders, especially those within the White House  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  some in Congress, argued
throughout 1995 that cutting taxes  was inconsistent with balancing the budget.
They claimed, for  instance, that tax cuts were not justified because Washington
could not  afford them while so much spending was being cut to balance  the
budget. Once the budget was in balance, they reasoned,  Americans could expect a
tax cut. This peculiar logic often gave taxpayers  the false impression that if
the tax cut package were dropped  from Congress's budget plan, Washington could
balance the  budget even sooner, say in five or six years rather than seven.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Such arguments are misleading at best and disingenuous at  worst. The
reasons:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> the $245 billion tax cut package contained in the BBA  is
small; it amounts only to returning to taxpayers 2 cents of  every dollar that
would otherwise be collected by the federal  government over the next seven
years. This is hardly &quot;unaffordable,&quot;  considering that federal tax
collections are projected to total nearly  $11.5 trillion over the next seven
years. Moreover, the tax cut  package amounts to returning only one-third of the
tax increase  imposed during the Bush and Clinton presidencies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> if every dollar of tax cuts was eliminated from  Congress's
balanced budget plan, the budget would not balance any  sooner. Eliminating the
tax cut package, or reducing its size, would  only leave more money in the hands
of politicians and bureaucrats  to spend on programs taxpayers cannot afford and
do not even want.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But one of the most important reasons for cutting taxes while  moving the
budget toward balance is that tax cuts significantly  increase potential
economic growth and allow millions of families and  in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  vestors to keep more of the money
they earn.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, last year economists at The Heritage  Foundation used one of
the principal econometric models of the U.S.  economy to project the economic
effects of the tax cut elements of the  congressional Balanced Budget Act. This
model (created by  Lawrence Meyer and Associates) is used by the Office of
Management  and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Federal 
Reserve Board. The analysis showed that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The Balanced Budget Act with tax
cuts would have added  $112 billion more to gross domestic product (GDP) over
seven  years than the same plan without tax cuts.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The reduction in taxes on capital
(including capital gains tax  relief) accounts for $66 billion of this
additional GDP and leads to  a stronger economy in the long run.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Why is there such a large increase in economic activity when  tax cuts are
included in a balanced budget?  Initially, balancing  the budget requires the
government to reduce its role in the  economy. In the short term, this can slow
the economy, but returning  money to the private sector by means of the
$500-per-child tax credit  will help to offset these negative effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, tax cuts to spur investments (particularly cuts in  the capital
gains tax rate) increase economic growth in the long  run. Cutting taxes on
investments has two beneficial effects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> reducing the tax on capital gains lowers the cost of  moving
an investment from an average company to one that is  exception
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  ally productive and well run.
This lowering of &quot;switching&quot;  costs means that investors will play a
larger role in promoting well  run, productive companies. Thus, the economy as a
whole is likely  to be more efficient. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> lower taxes on capital cause the cost of capital to  fall.
Lenders, for example, do not require quite as much interest  on their capital
loans in order to recoup the taxes they paid when  they made the capital
available to a borrower. Lower capital costs  usually mean more investment by
businesses in labor-saving  equipment, which commonly results in increased labor
 productivity. This increased productivity translates into higher wages  and,
through the wonders of the division of labor, more jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Need for Budget Process Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While there are many reasons why federal spending is out of  control, and
why the political process seems helpless to stop it,  the process of making a
budget is a significant factor. The  modern explosion in federal spending began
shortly after the 1974  Budget Act was passed in the &quot;wake of the Watergate
scandal, when  regard for the institution of the presidency had reached its 
lowest ebb.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#18">18</A></B></TT>
 The 1974 Act stripped the President of his authority  to impound funds  that
is, to refuse to spend excessive  program funding appropriated by Congress  and
directed greater  spending authority to Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, spending authority within Congress is highly  diffuse: Many
committees have the power to spend taxpayers' money,  but no one committee or
member is accountable for how it is  spent. Thus, the budget process is biased
toward increasing  spending, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  rather than toward setting
priorities. The key to bringing  accountability to the budget process is
therefore to shift greater  authority back to the President through such
measures as the line-item  veto and the Balanced Budget Amendment and to tighten
the rules  under which Congress goes about crafting the budget and  spending
money.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to popular belief, the federal budget is not a single  document.
Even the President's proposed budget, transmitted to  Congress each year,
usually incorporates four or five separate  volumes totaling thousands of pages.
The House and Senate must digest  the proposal and then generate their own
documents  at least  15 separate pieces of legislation  that outline their
proposal.  This ponderous process repeats itself each year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The annual workload for Congress and the President includes  the initial
proposals from each side (the President's budget  submission and the
Congressional Budget Resolution), the 13  appropriations bills, and, when
necessary, a reconciliation bill to deal  with changes in tax and entitlement
policy. Often, &quot;emergency&quot;  or &quot;supplemental&quot; appropriations
bills are added mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 13 (or more) appropriations bills cover only 37 percent of  federal
spending. Remaining &quot;mandatory&quot; or entitlement spending  is addressed,
if at all, in a single reconciliation bill. This messy  process must be married
with &quot;authorizing&quot; legislation that may  determine how a program
spends money over two years, five years,  or indefinitely. The numerous steps in
the budget process make  it difficult to cut spending. Real spending cuts can be
derailed at  any of several steps.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When considering the federal budget process, it is often best  to examine it
thematically. The key steps in the current process are:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Vision:</B> formulating a framework for the budget through 
the President's submitted budget and the congressional budget  resolution;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

spending levels;

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Reconciliation:</B> changing permanent tax and entitlement
law  to meet the requirements of the budget resolution.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress vs. President</B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Congress and the President act independently in  the most
important step in the whole process: establishing their  own vision and
framework for the budget details. The President  submits his budget proposal to
Congress at the start of each year to  establish his vision. Following the
President's submission in early  February, Congress outlines its vision by March
of each year  through what is known as the budget resolution. This sets 
Congress's spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At this stage in the process, neither branch's proposal needs  be approved
by the other branch. In most recent years, as was the  case in 1995, the visions
of the President and Congress differed  significantly. Under the existing
process, however, negotiations  between 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  the two branches do not occur
until the end of the process   typically just before (or even after) the new
budget year begins   when a serious impasse often occurs. This happened late in 
1995 for the FY 1996 budget. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The budget resolution is not signed by the President, so does  not have the
force of law. Congress then proceeds with the  authorization and appropriations
process. It is not until a reconciliation  bill is adopted by the House and
Senate, usually in the fall, that  the two branches even begin<U> </U>to
discuss their policy differences.  This often leads to a &quot;train wreck,&quot;
as was the case in 1995, in  which parts of the government shut down or operate
under stopgap  funding while Congress and the President try to work out their 
differences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Authorizers vs. Appropriators </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It would be incorrect to assume that the only disputes in the  budget
process are those between the executive and legislative  branches. In fact, a
significant logjam can occur because of policy  differences among the budget
committee, authorizing committees,  and appropriations committees. The budget
committee drafts a  blueprint based on certain policy assumptions. Authorizing 
committees then are required to craft legislation setting out the 
responsibilities and maximum funding levels for a program with that  framework.
It is then the responsibility of the appropriating committees to  decide how
much to spend.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This three-tiered process means that the people who decide  how much to
spend cannot decide how that money should be  spent. Similarly, the politicians
who set the policies for the program  have 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  no meaningful control over its
funding. With policy decisions  divorced from spending decisions in Congress,
the likelihood  of ever-higher spending is increased. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, the effort to eliminate the Commerce Department  in 1995
required action by 11 committees and 9 subcommittees,  including the House and
Senate Appropriations Committees,  the House and Senate Commerce Committees, and
the House  Government Reform and Oversight and Senate Governmental  Affairs
Committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With a strong consensus among all these parties needed to  end government
programs, there is a clear bias against cutting  spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Entitlements vs. Nobody</B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While discretionary spending programs are subject to  multiple hurdles each
year, entitlements  which are mandatory  spending programs  operate on complete
auto-pilot. If Congress and  the President never passed another budget bill,
entitlement spending   which includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and 
welfare  would continue unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Two-thirds of the federal budget is consumed by mandatory  spending that
need not be approved annually by Congress or the  President. Leaving
entitlements without annual approval has  contributed to the dramatic increase
in mandatory spending as a  percentage of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The portion of the budget consumed by mandatory spending  has 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  doubled since 1968. Mandatory
federal spending also represents  a significant force in the American economy.
More than one-tenth  of the nation's economy (10.7 percent of gross domestic
product)  is consumed by mandatory programs.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Entitlements can be addressed in the budget process, but  when they are, it
is done in a single bill called a reconciliation  bill, which often incorporates
permanent changes in tax law,  pitting entitlement reforms against tax policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite the major fiscal impact of entitlement spending, there is  no
established process for Congress and the President to review  these expenditures
regularly. The Congress spends more than half  the year focusing on how to spend
one-third of the federal  budget, with far less attention paid to the other
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Previous Reforms.</B> Budget crises in 1986, 1988, and 1990  were met by
specific spending agreements coupled with budget  process reforms. Because
reforms left the flawed budget process  largely intact, however, the agreements
held only for a couple of years,  to be followed by new crises when economic or
political  conditions changed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most significant of these reforms, the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act,
required automatic, across-the-board spending  cuts (called a sequester) if
Congress failed to meet the deficit  targets prescribed in law. Gramm-Rudman was
successful in  reducing small differences between projected and prescribed
deficit  targets, but it broke down when the deficit became so large in 1990 
that Members of Congress refused to allow an automatic spending  cut to take
effect.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The 1990 budget deal scrapped Gramm-Rudman and  instituted statutory caps on
discretionary spending. But these have been  adjusted numerous times, so they
have served as little more  than &quot;speed limits&quot; on the spending
expressway, since they were set  far above anticipated spending growth rates.
Moreover, since  they focused only on discretionary spending totals, ignoring 
fast-growing entitlement spending, these caps have had limited effect  in
bringing down the deficit.

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite a campaign promise to balance the budget in five  years while
providing tax cuts for working families, President  Clinton resisted
congressional efforts to enact a balanced budget plan  with tax cuts in 1995. In
addition to vetoing the Balanced Budget Act  of 1995, Clinton presented four
budget plans to Congress during  the year  each falling far short of balancing
the budget, according  to the Congressional Budget Office. After a year of
prodding,  Clinton presented a fifth budget plan on January 5, 1996. CBO
certified   at least on paper  that this new proposal would balance the  budget
by 2002. Closer review of this plan shows that, as with the  four previous
plans, the White House was not serious about either  balancing the budget or
providing meaningful tax relief. It  seemed interested only in finding ways to
spend more taxpayer  dollars while appearing to agree that the budget should be
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> Clinton Budget #1: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</B>
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to  the 1994 election
results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget  to the new Congress. This
budget deviated little from &quot;baseline&quot;  forecasts which projected $200
billion deficits through the end of  the decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to CBO, the President's February budget would  increase the
deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to  $276 billion in 2000.
Spending would grow an average of 5 percent  per year, some $422 billion in all
in just five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The February Clinton budget was not all bad, however. It did  propose a few
modest privatization initiatives, such as selling  the Power Marketing
Administrations, portions of the Strategic  Petroleum Reserves, the Naval
Petroleum Reserves, and portions of  the National Weather Service. It also
proposed terminating a  few small programs and consolidating some 270 programs
into 27  new programs. Best of all, the budget proposed a &quot;Middle Class
Bill  of Rights&quot; which included a modest $300-per-child tax credit  for
families with children below age 13 who earn less than  $60,000 per year. But
the Administration did little to fight for any of  these proposals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On May 19, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote  of 99 to 0.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #2:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional  bal
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  anced budget efforts while
offering no plan of his own,  Clinton presented a second budget plan which he
claimed balanced  the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>This Clinton plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better  than his
first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in  addition to not balancing
the budget, this plan would produce $200  billion deficits for at least the next
ten years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second budget plan also included the modest tax cut for  families with
children in addition to tax deductions for higher  education and expanded
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later  said that this
plan would balance the budget in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the CBO maintained that it would never balance  the budget. Indeed,
CBO found less than $400 billion in  legitimate deficit reduction in this
Clinton offer  $350 billion short of  the total seven-year deficit reduction in
the Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #3:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget  Act of 1995, he
presented yet a third budget plan. The  Administration claimed that this plan
also would balance the budget in seven  years but was more in line with the
President's priorities than the one  he had vetoed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers  failed 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  to reach a balanced budget by
2002. While this budget plan  proposed larger savings from discretionary
spending programs  and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also 
proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's  third
budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit  reduction over seven
years  $365 billion short of the savings achieved  by the BBA he had vetoed.
Moreover, according to the CBO,  instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as
advertised, it would leave  a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #4:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with  congressional leaders,
Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But  this plan was mostly an iteration
of Budget Plan #3 and contained  no new policy recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The CBO scored this plan as $69 billion out of balance in  FY 2002. The
Administration tried to make up its shortcomings  in reducing the deficit by
challenging CBO technical and  economic estimates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's  economic
assumptions were too conservative and thus required  excessively deep spending
cuts to balance the budget. In making  this argument, the Administration wanted
to have it both ways.  While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it
actually wanted  to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On December 18, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412  to 0.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #5:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan.  This plan,
largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats,  was certified by CBO to
balance the budget in seven years, at least  on paper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is likely that Clinton never would have submitted this plan had  it not
been for the conditions Congress included in the  continuing resolution passed
on January 5, 1996. These conditions  stipulated, in effect, that a bill to
provide operating funds for  unappropriated federal programs through January 26
would not be sent to  the President until he submitted a seven-year balanced
budget  plan scored by the CBO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years,  the fifth
Clinton budget falls far short of being a credible plan.  The reasons: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In the fifth Clinton budget, most of the heavy lifting of
deficit  reduction is required in the two years following the end of  Clinton's
possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the  plan's $583
billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002.  For example, the
plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings  over seven years, but 63
percent of these savings are to come in the  last two years. Similarly, the plan
called for $37 billion in  discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed
to achieve a  &quot;hard freeze&quot; in these programs, yet 95 percent of these
additional  savings fall in the last two years of the plan.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 --> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in 
gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these  cuts are
sunsetted in FY 2001  one year before the budget is  balanced. This means taxes
would have to be raised. Mathematically, such  a ploy &quot;boosts&quot; tax
revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002  and thus requires fewer spending
cuts to achieve a balanced  budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal is
reduced by the  plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing &quot;corporate
 loopholes.&quot;  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these  tax
hikes would be received in FY 2002.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #6:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This  sixth budget plan
in a year moved only slightly beyond the  previous plans, modestly increasing
the proposed savings from  Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly
boosting the size  of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce
nearly  $160 billion less in budget savings than the last congressional offer 
and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction. Moreover, the  White House
still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare,  Medicaid, and welfare needed
to achieve budget savings and  restructure the programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> Clinton Budget #7</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on  January 18. This
budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9  plan except that it
substantially increased the amount of new revenues  it 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  would generate from closing &quot;corporate
tax loopholes&quot; and  other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the
net size of  the tax cut would be reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven
years.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past  year, the FY
1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February  5, would force hard-working
Americans to pay higher taxes in  exchange for more spending on programs which
have become  old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization,
 or transfer to state control. Moreover, each plan ignores the  fundamental
problems facing the government's major entitlement  and welfare programs.
Clinton has shirked his responsibility to  address, for instance, a Medicare
program facing insolvency, a  Medicaid program that is bankrupting state
budgets, and a welfare  system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these cast suspicions on  the Clinton
Administration's sincerity in negotiating a balanced  budget plan with Congress.
At every turn, Clinton fought attempts  to cut spending or even reduce the
growth rate of spending.  Clinton challenged CBO's conservative economic
assumptions  because they required greater savings to balance the budget. In 
other words, he wanted more money for favored programs while  claiming to
support balancing the budget. Clinton repeatedly called  on Congress to reduce
the size of the BBA's tax cut package, not  because eliminating the tax cuts
would balance the budget any  faster (say in five years rather than seven), but
because smaller tax  cuts would allow more money for government spending. The
record  is 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  clear: Bill Clinton prefers
keeping money in the hands of  Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the
pockets of American  taxpayers.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Negotiations Stalemate</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By mid-January, the negotiations between Congress and the  White House had
reached a stalemate. Yet the job for both parties  of reaching a balanced budget
in seven years had been aided  considerably by CBO's December revised economic
forecast,  which showed that $135 billion less in spending cuts would be needed 
to balance the budget by 2002. Congressional leaders quickly  offered to reduce
their proposed savings from programs such as  Medicare and Medicaid in an
attempt to move toward common ground  with the President. In this offer,
congressional negotiators also  reduced the proposed size of the tax cut package
to $177 billion net  from $218 billion net. But this counter-offer made little
sense;  millions of families could be denied needed tax relief as billions of 
dollars more is spent on government programs they do not want.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For all intents and purposes, congressional negotiators broke  off talks
with the White House after sensing that Clinton was not  serious  and, perhaps
never had been  about reaching an accord  to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the new Congress swiftly fulfilled the centerpiece of  the Contract
with America by drafting and then passing a  comprehensive plan to balance the
budget in seven years while providing  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  cuts to help families and spur
economic growth. The  Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was vetoed by President
Clinton, but it  nevertheless marked a dramatic reversal of Washington's &quot;business
 as usual&quot; attempts to deal with budget deficits. Though  Clinton signed
the largest tax increase in U.S. history just two years  ago, tax increases were
never suggested as a necessary element of  deficit reduction  even by the most
liberal members of Congress.  The dominant issues during the 1995 budget debate
were how to  curb the rampant growth of federal spending and how much tax 
relief should be given to hard-working American families. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As the year progressed, however, the new Congress's vision  of downsizing
the federal government and returning power and  resources to taxpayers and the
states was overshadowed by the  central issue of balancing the budget within
seven years. Thus,  many of the bolder reforms and initiatives contained in the
early  budget blueprints were watered down or abandoned in the battle with  the
Clinton White House. As the debate wore on into 1996,  voters' 1994 election
mandate to rein in the federal government took  a back seat to the &quot;green
eyeshade&quot; math involved in reaching a  balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The House Budget</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On May 18, 1995, the House of Representatives, spurred by  73 freshman
Members, by a vote of 238 to 193 passed its  sweeping budget blueprint  formally
known as the budget resolution   to balance the budget in seven years while
providing over $350  billion in tax cuts to help families with children, to help
seniors,  and to spur economic growth. The blueprint called for $1.13 trillion 
in total spending cuts over seven years and, after netting out the  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  cuts, over $970 billion in
deficit reduction over the same period. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of the bolder proposals contained in the House budget  resolution were
generated by freshmen Members. Indeed, with the  encouragement of the House
leadership, a cadre of freshmen  developed serious plans to close four Cabinet
agencies: the  Departments of Commerce, Energy, Education, and Housing and Urban
 Development. The abolition of three of these agencies (Commerce,  Energy, and
Education) was incorporated into the final plan.

<P>
</P>
<P>Though ambitious by Washington standards, the Senate  plan (which passed on
May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42) fell short of  advancing the bold proposals
contained in the House blueprint.  For example, the Senate plan proposed closing
only the Department  of Commerce even though Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) 
became an active supporter of the House freshman effort to  close four Cabinet
agencies. In fact, some Senators wanted to go  beyond 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  the House effort and developed
proposals to close two  additional agencies: the Departments of Transportation
and Labor.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The most disappointing aspect of the Senate plan was the  absence of
specific tax cuts. The Senate plan allowed for unspecified  tax cuts for
families and economic growth only if CBO certified  that the plan would balance
the budget in seven years. Once this  certification had been made, tax cuts
could be financed with the  $170 billion economic windfall, or &quot;Fiscal
Dividend,&quot; the CBO  estimated would accrue to the government from lower
interest  rates and the increased tax revenues generated by higher  economic
growth.

<P><B>Completing the Balanced Budget Plan</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The task of producing the final balanced budget plan  proceeded along two
fronts: the appropriations process (funding  particular agencies and programs)
and the authorization process  (changing such things as tax laws and
entitlements to conform to  spending goals). Specifically, the appropriations
committees in the  House and Senate are responsible for drafting the 13
appropriations  bills that fund the day-to-day operations of the government. The
 authorizing committees, including the House Ways and Means  Committee and
Senate Finance Committee, are charged with  making changes in permanent law
affecting entitlement programs and  tax policy. By law, Congress must complete
all of its work on the  bud
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  get by September 31, before the
fiscal year begins on October 1. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress faced many serious questions as it undertook this  enormous task.
Would the budget, for instance, be completed on time?   If appropriations bills
are not completed by the end of  September, government programs must shut down
due to a lack of funds.  This scenario later became known as the first &quot;train
wreck.&quot;  Also,  Congress needed to pass the reconciliation bill, which
makes  the changes in permanent law, by mid-November when the  government was
expected to exhaust its legal authority to borrow  money. If the permanent debt
ceiling was not increased in time, the  Treasury faced the possibility of
defaulting on its loan payments  and not having the funds available to pay
Social Security benefits.  This became known as the second &quot;train wreck.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, conservatives  including most House freshmen   had other concerns
as well. For instance, would the  appropriations committees follow through on
the bolder proposals in the  House budget resolution to overhaul and terminate
some programs,  privatize others, and send many back to the states?  Also, many 
worried about the commitment of the Ways and Means and Finance  Committees to
tax cuts. Though the budget resolution  recommended $245 billion in tax cuts to
help families and promote  economic growth, Ways and Means and Finance are not
obligated to  follow its recommendations. The question became, would the &quot;tax
 writers&quot; become the &quot;tax cutters&quot;?

<P>The balanced budget outline passed by Congress in May 1995  required that
annually appropriated spending be reduced by $24  bil
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  lion, or nearly 10 percent. But,
with only a few notable  exceptions, rather than meet these spending goals by
overhauling  domestic programs, terminating obsolete agencies, privatizing 
commercial functions, and transferring non-federal functions to the states,  the
104th Congress chose a &quot;salami-cut&quot; approach to  restructuring
government. In other words, Congress shaved relatively  equal amounts from all
programs in order to achieve the savings  required by the balanced budget
outline, which means that most of the  appropriations bills continue the status
quo, albeit at reduced  spending levels.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The appropriations bill for the Departments of  Commerce,
Justice, and State would have spent $27.3 billion in  fiscal year 1996, an
increase of 2 percent over the previous year.  President Clinton vetoed this
bill on December 19, 1995. Little  progress was made in eliminating the
Department of Commerce.  Moreover, the Economic Development Administration, a
perennial source  of funding for purely local projects, was granted $349
million.  The Small Business Administration, which as early as 1963 was 
described by <I>Life</I> magazine as a &quot;device for soaking up money  and
getting rid of it,&quot; <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#19">19</A></TT></B>
was appropriated $590 million. But the bill  did take some positive steps. For
example, the Advanced  Technology Program  corporate welfare and industrial
planning at its  most blatant  would have been eliminated. The bill also would 
have converted the cops-on-the beat program into a block grant to  localities to
allow flexibility in fighting crime.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The appropriations bill for the Department of  Energy and
various water development projects spends $19.7 billion  in fiscal year 1996, a
reduction of only 4 percent from the  previous year. The $3.2 billion Army Corps
of Engineers, a favorite  source 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  of funding for local pork-barrel
projects, received a mild cut of  5.6 percent. This still left plenty of money
to fund such efforts as  the $304,000 investigation of the Upper Trinity River
basin in  Texas; the $4.4 million beach erosion project in Sarasota County, 
Florida; and the $100,000 beach erosion project in  Surfside-Sunset-Newport
Beach, California. Only 18 percent was cut from the  Department of Energy's
Energy Supply, Research and Development  program. Since 1977, the federal
government has spent over $70  billion in today's dollars on this program and
has little or nothing  to show for it.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Congress cut the Agriculture appropriations bill by just  8
percent. Instead of terminating various sources of  pork-barrel spending and
corporate welfare, the bill as signed by  President Clinton will provide $710
million for the Agricultural  Research Service, a reduction of only 6 percent.
And the $934 million  Cooperative State Research Service is cut by only 3
percent. This  mild reduction left room for such spending as $220,000 for 
lowbush blueberry research in Maine, $1.2 million for potato research,  and
$395,000 for rice modeling in Arizona.

<P>The record of the Reagan Administration's proposals to  terminate programs
shows that simply reducing the budgets of such  wasteful programs as these 
instead of terminating them outright   leaves the door open for future
Congresses to boost their funding and  thus return the government to the path of
increasing deficits and  burdensome taxes. This happens because a bureaucracy is
left in  place to work with interest groups toward the re-instatement of 
funding. According to the Congressional Research Service, 94  programs were
recommended for termination during the two  Reagan terms.<TT><B><A

<P><B>The Balanced Budget Act of 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to liberal rhetoric, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995,  as passed by
Congress on November 17 and vetoed by  President Clinton on December 6, did not
slash spending to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Had the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) been signed into law,  federal spending
would have slowed from an average projected rate of  4.8 percent per year
through 2002 to an average of 2.76 percent  per year  roughly the average rate
of inflation. However, over  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  next seven years, total federal
spending would have grown by  21 percent, or $318 billion, from $1.518 trillion
in FY 1995 to  $1.836 trillion in FY 2002  the year the budget is to be in
balance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Driving this spending growth, even under a balanced  budget scheme, is
the rapid growth of entitlement programs. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the BBA, overall mandatory spending was allowed to  grow by $341
billion over the next seven years, a 46 percent  increase. On average, mandatory
spending would grow by 5.6 percent  per year. Contrary to White House charges of
Congress's &quot;deep  cuts&quot; in entitlement programs, the share of the
budget devoted to  this uncontrollable spending would grow from 48 percent of
all  federal spending in FY 1995 to 58 percent in FY 2002, even if the  BBA
effected needed reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare  programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only category of federal spending that would have  declined under the
BBA is discretionary, or annually appropriated,  spending. The BBA would have
reduced aggregate spending for  these programs from $546 billion in FY 1995 to
$515 billion in  FY 2002, or 5.6 percent. However, these modest cuts are &quot;scored&quot;
 by CBO as totaling $408 billion in savings over seven years. How  can this be? 
Nearly 55 percent of these savings, or $258 billion,  comes from &quot;freezing&quot;
aggregate discretionary spending at 1995  levels for seven years. Because CBO
assumes spending to grow,  spending the same amount as the previous year &quot;saves&quot;
money. The  remaining $151 billion in savings represent real cuts in  spending,
meaning that less money will be spent in future years than today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA contained $245 billion in gross tax cuts, or $218  billion 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  in net cuts after deducting the
$27 billion in revenues  generated from closing special tax breaks for certain
corporations and  industries. Though often criticized by the media and the 
Washington elite, the tax cut plan actually is rather modest. Overall, it 
promises to return to taxpayers roughly 2 percent of the $11.5 trillion in  tax
revenues the government expects to collect over the next  seven years. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As Table 5 shows, the tax cut plan is targeted largely to  families, though
the pro-growth tax cuts would have a substantial impact  on spurring new
investments and jobs. Highlights of the tax cut  plan include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tax Cuts for Families.</B> A full 65 percent of the overall
tax  cut package was targeted to families, especially families with  children.
The &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the congressional plan was the  $500-per-child
tax credit benefiting 28 million families raising 51  million children. Also
included was a gradual increase in the standard  deduction for couples filing
jointly as a modest way of alleviating  the marriage penalty. The plan also
contained a substantial  $5,000 adoption credit and a $1,000 deduction for
families who care  for elderly family members.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tax Cuts for Jobs and Economic Growth.</B> The remaining 35
 percent of the tax cut package was targeted to spurring jobs and  economic
growth. The centerpiece of the pro-growth tax cuts  was capital gains tax
reform. The effective capital gains rate for  individuals would be cut in half 
19.8 percent would be the top rate   and the corporate rate would be set at 28
percent. The plan  would have promoted savings by creating a new &quot;American
Dream  IRA,&quot; or back-loaded Individual Retirement Account. Taxpayers  could

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  contribute to these accounts
using post-tax dollars, but  withdrawals would be tax-free. The plan also
included reforms in the  Alternative Minimum Tax (ATM) and taxes on estates and
gifts.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tax Cuts to Promote Health Care Independence.</B> The tax
cut  plan included two small but important tax provisions to help  seniors with
health care costs. The first provision would have given  more favorable tax
treatment to long-term care insurance, in the  same way other health care
insurance is treated. The plan also  would have allowed tax-free treatment for
terminally ill individuals  who cash out their life insurance plans.

<P><B>LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There was a great deal of speculation during the summer of  1995 about
whether there would be a &quot;train wreck,&quot; or general  shutdown of the
government, in the fall. &quot;Train wreck&quot; is really a  generic term since
there are two basic ways in which government  spending could come to a halt in
any given year:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Government programs lack the authority to spend, or
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. The Treasury lacks the authority to borrow money to  finance
government spending.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each scenario has interesting yet important nuances. By law,  the
appropriations bills must be passed by Congress and signed by  the President by
October 1 of each year. If a bill is not approved  by that date, programs within
its jurisdiction must cease  operations. Entitlement programs such as farm
programs, Social Security,  and Medicare, however, continue at current levels
because their  spending levels do not require annual appropriations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What happens if appropriations bills are not approved?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>SCENARIO #1: </B>Congress passes a continuing resolution. 
What has happened most often in previous budget stalemates is  that Congress
passes a continuing resolution (CR) to fund  appropriated government programs at
the previous year's spending levels until  a compromise between Congress and the
White House is reached.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>SCENARIO #2:</B> Essential programs continue through 
executive powers. The now-famous Civiletti interpretation of the  &quot;Anti-Deficiency
Act,&quot; named after former Attorney General  Benjamin Civiletti, outlined to
Jimmy Carter in 1981 how the President  can continue &quot;essential
expenditures in cases of imminent  emergency, to protect lives or property.&quot;<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#21">21</A></B></TT>  This authority by most 
accounts includes &quot;essential workers&quot; performing such functions as 
White House and congressional duties; Defense, Coast Guard, and  FBI/police
functions; meat and poultry inspection; and Air  Traffic Control. Since this
power rests with the President, it is difficult  for 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  the White House to argue that
Congress is responsible when  meat inspections, for example, are halted.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Shutdowns of 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There were two general shutdowns of the federal government  during the
budget debate of 1995-1996. The first showdown  between Congress and President
Clinton occurred when Congress failed  to approve all 13 appropriations bills by
the October 1 deadline.  An immediate shutdown was averted, however, when
Congress  passed on September 29, and Clinton signed a day later, a short-term 
continuing resolution bill to fund government programs through  November 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When talks between Congress and the White House broke  down before the
November 15 deadline, Congress passed another  short-term spending bill which
the President vetoed on November  13. This veto brought on the first general
shutdown, which lasted  six days. Nearly 800,000 people  about one-third of all
federal  workers  were furloughed. Essential workers remained on the job,  but
without pay (though congressional leaders assured  furloughed workers that they
all would receive back pay). Also on the job,  but with pay, were workers in
agencies whose funding bills had  been passed and signed by Clinton. These
included some  Pentagon workers and employees within the Departments of 
Agriculture, Transportation, and Energy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second  a partial shutdown and the longest federal  shutdown in history 
lasted from December 16, 1995, until January 6,  1996. This time, rather than
send the President a new continuing  resolution, congressional leaders decided
to send him the actual  appro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  priations bills for the remaining
unfunded portions of the  government. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#22">22</A></B></TT>  The shutdown occurred
because Clinton vetoed the  bills funding the departments of the Interior,
Veterans Affairs,  Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, State, and Justice. 
Approximately 280,000 federal workers were sent home during this  second
shutdown.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Shutdown's Limited Impact</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most media attention during the shutdowns was focused on  federal workers
who were left temporarily without a  paycheck, <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#23">23</A></B></TT> companies closing because
of a lack of government contracts, and  &quot;innocent&quot; travelers shut out
of national parks and museums.  However, lost in the media coverage was the
silver lining: a glimpse into  an America with a limited federal government.
Lawmakers and  citizens alike should look carefully at the lessons to be learned
 from such a large-scale federal government closure.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Lesson:</B> As the Chief Executive, it was Clinton who 
determined which agencies and government employees were deemed  essential,
meaning those most directly involved in protecting the lives  and property of
American citizens. The President's choices, then,  are telling because they
indicate exactly where the true priorities  of the federal government lie. These
choices are also ironic in light  of Clinton's claim that he vetoed the Balanced
Budget Act of  1995 because it was too harsh on education, the environment, and 
housing. During the second shutdown, the Administration decided  large portions
of these same programs were &quot;non-essential.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Lesson:</B> Most taxpayers are unaware that many federal

an excellent indication of why  they should be privatized or transferred to

<P><B>The Debt Crisis Showdown</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second showdown occurred over the issue of increasing  the $4.9 trillion
legal debt ceiling (last increased in 1993), which  was to be done by November
15. On November 9, Congress passed  a short-term increase in the debt ceiling,
but with certain  conditions such as terminating the Department of Commerce and
a  prohibition against divesting retirement funds to cover government  debt.
Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, throwing into  question the ability of
the Treasury to make interest payments on  government debt and, possibly,
December Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Generally speaking, if the debt ceiling is not statutorially  increased, the
Treasury runs out of authority to borrow money  to fund spending not covered by
tax revenues. In other words,  the government is forced to operate more or less
on a cash basis.  Treasury then must fund programs out of tax and fee revenues
or  employ a variety of techniques to stretch its borrowing ability. It  has
managed as long as 30 days on a cash basis, Congress in  most years passes
temporary debt increases (six during the 1990  budget deal alone) to get
Treasury through the negotiations.

<P>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin avoided the possibility of  default during
the November 1995 crisis by disinvesting the Civil  Service Retirement and
Disability Trust Fund. He justified this action  by cleverly interpreting a
section of the Civil Service  Retirement Trust Fund Act<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#31">31</A></B></TT> to allow the U.S.
Treasury to take  Treasury bonds out of that trust fund. Moving Treasury bonds
out of  the Civil Service trust fund reduced the debt to below the legal  limit,
thus enabling the Treasury to sell additional bonds to the public.  If Rubin
chose to tap the entire $375 billion in this trust fund,  it would be adequate
to sustain this financing trick until May 1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many Members of Congress have challenged the  Treasury 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Secretary's interpretation of the
law and are looking at ways  to close the loophole, which they say undermines
Congress's  power to set a federal debt limit. Moreover, many fear that Rubin 
could fund the government indefinitely by raiding other trust funds.  The
federal government maintains a number of special trust funds  to hold and invest
certain kinds of special payments, such as  Social Security, motor fuel tax
receipts, and airline ticket taxes, as well  as the Civil Service funds.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. government bonds, in which money paid to these  trust funds is
invested, have always been counted as part of the  national debt that Congress
could control by setting a statutory limit.  But the legal interpretation
advanced by the Treasury Secretary is  that the government owes this money to
itself, and the &quot;investment&quot;  of the trust fund balances in Treasury
bonds is not real. It is only  a convenient fiction used by the Treasury to
compute periodic  interest payments to the trust funds, so the Secretary is free
to  disinvest from the trust funds and sell new bonds to the public.

<P>
</P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The White House worked actively to kill the Balanced  Budget Amendment by
convincing Senators who previously had voted  in favor of it to reverse their
positions at the last minute. During  his February 25, 1995, radio address,
Clinton claimed the  amendment is an &quot;extreme fiscal policy&quot; that &quot;in
its most exaggerated  form, [is] what helped to turn the economic slow-down of
the 1920s  into the great depression of the 1930s.&quot;
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 55 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration however, did support the work begun by  the 104th
Congress on giving a line-item veto to the President. In  his March 25, 1995,
radio address, President Clinton stated,  &quot;[The line-item veto] will bring
more discipline to our spending  process by enabling presidents to veto
particular projects which are  unjustified, but which today can be hidden in
comprehensive bills  the president has to sign.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But the White House also has perfected the art of misleading  the public
with baseline budgeting. The most egregious example  is Medicare. Throughout the
past year, Clinton falsely charged  that Congress was insisting on
unconscionable cuts in Medicare.  The truth is that Medicare spending would
escalate dramatically  under the BBA, just not as fast as expected under the
artificial  CBO &quot;baseline.&quot;  Clinton also conveniently forgets to
mention that  his own plan would reduce Medicare spending below the  projected
baseline, though not as much as Congress's plan would.  According to CBO
estimates, cumulative Medicare spending over the  next seven years will total
$1.824 trillion.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#32">32</A></B></TT>
 Clinton proposes  spending a total of $1.733 trillion over the next seven years
on  Medicare, $91 billion less than projected. Congress, by contrast, proposes 
to spend $1.685 trillion during the same period, roughly $140  billion less than
projected but just $49 billion less than Clinton.  Thus, there is a difference
of less than 3 percent between how  much Clinton wants to spend on Medicare and
Congress's proposal.  This is hardly draconian.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress came in with an ambitious budget  reform agenda that
included passing constitutional amendments to  balance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  the budget and provide the
President with a line-item veto. In  addition, the new Congress promised to
bring honesty to the  budget process by eliminating typical congressional tricks
such  as &quot;baseline budgeting,&quot; in which increases in spending are 
called &quot;cuts&quot; because they fall below the spending levels projected by
 the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although often stymied by the White House and old guard  lawmakers, the new
Congress had a good year trying to bring  needed reform to the budget process.
The Balanced Budget Amendment  to the Constitution received overwhelming support
in the House,  only to lose by one vote in the Senate. Congress also advanced 
legislation to provided the President with a line-item veto and  enacted rule
changes to remove some of the trickery from the budget  process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Overall Record</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some of the more important budget process issues addressed  by the 104th
Congress include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Balanced Budget Amendment.</B> In 1995, both the House  and the
Senate considered constitutional amendments that would  provide for a balanced
budget by the year 2002. While the  House overwhelmingly achieved the two-thirds
majority needed to  send the proposal to the states for ratification, the Senate
fell one  vote short of the 67 votes needed when liberal Senators who 
previously had supported the Balanced Budget Amendment reversed  their position
under heavy lobbying from the Clinton Administration.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Fiscal conservatives in the House and Senate attempted to  include a tax
limitation provision in the Balanced Budget Amendment  requiring a supermajority
(three-fifths) vote in both houses to  increase taxes. Unfortunately, that
effort fell short in both  chambers. Such a safeguard is justified because, as
shown in Chart 1 in  this section, the deficits of the last 25 years have been
caused  by spending increases rather than by taxes that are too low. Without  a
tax limitation provision, a balanced budget requirement could  be used as a
justification for tax increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Line-Item Veto. </B>The Line-Item Veto Act (H.R. 2, part of  the
Contract With America) was approved by the House and  Senate, but the two
versions differed widely. The House version, known  as enhanced rescission,
would allow the President to single out  specific items in spending bills for
reconsideration by Congress.  The Senate version would split appropriations
measures into  multiple bills for separate action by the President. After a
lengthy  conference, House and Senate negotiators agreed on a plan that  follows
the House's enhanced rescission approach.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Used conscientiously, a line-item veto could cut wasteful  spending without
jeopardizing necessary programs. State experience  shows, however, that the
line-item veto alone is not likely to result in  huge budget reductions,
although states have found it to be a fairly  effective curb on spending growth
over time. Moreover, it serves  as a check on the usual tendency of legislators
to lard  appropriations bills with pork-barrel spending designed to garner
additional  votes  both for the majority party in Congress and the individual 
Mem
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  ber back home. The President of
the United States would join  the chief executives of 43 states in being able to
use this weapon to  cut spending if the line-item veto is approved.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Byrd Rule.</B> Section 313 of the Budget Act is the  so-called Byrd
Rule, which prevents &quot;extraneous&quot; provisions from  being included in
the reconciliation bill. The rule was proposed by  Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) a
decade ago to prevent adoption of  a particular provision with which he was
unhappy. Unfortunately,  it has resulted in a long-standing problem in the
Senate. A  provision deemed out of order under the Byrd Rule must face a 
three-fifths vote (60 votes) to survive intact. In 1995, more than 45 
provisions were ruled extraneous and summarily removed from bills.  Among the
lost items were:

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Tax Limitations.</B> The House did adopt a supermajority  provision
regarding tax increases as a House rule. Since this House  rule would not have
the same standing as a constitutional  amendment, it would not apply to the
Senate and could easily be changed if  a new Congress decided it no longer
wanted to live under it.  However, House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has
promised a  vote around April 15, 1996, on a constitutional amendment that 
would prevent big-spending Members of Congress from using the  drive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  toward a balanced budget as an
excuse to raise taxes on  hard-working Americans. It is significant that the
vote on the  House rule change received significant support from both sides of 
the political aisle. The vote was 279-152, or 65 percent in favor   just short
of the two-thirds needed for a constitutional amendment   with 52 Democrats
voting for the rule.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Scoring Rules.</B> One of the most significant disputes in the 
confrontation between the President and Congress over the Balanced  Budget Act
of 1995 was the question of &quot;scoring.&quot;  The President  argued for the
use of Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) spending and revenue estimates to
judge whether the budget  deal met the requirement of balance by 2002, while the
Congress  stood by the more conservative predictions of the Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO). Using the President's OMB numbers would  have permitted
hundreds of billions in additional spending over  seven years. If Congress and
the President are serious about achieving  a balanced budget, it makes sense to
use the numbers that  produce the most spending cuts; this leaves the greatest
likelihood that  the budget will be in balance when the plan predicts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Lock Box.</B> Another concept which could help reduce spending,  the &quot;lock
box,&quot; was approved in preliminary form by the House  in 1995. Currently, if
the House or Senate adopts a specific  spending cut, the savings can be diverted
to spending increases on other  programs. This becomes particularly troublesome
in conference  committees where back-room deals are cut. The lock box bill 
establishes congressional and Treasury procedures to ensure that  votes in
Congress to cut specific spending programs translate into  overall deficit
reduction. Under this plan, internal congressional  spending caps applying to
the 13 appropriations bills would be  lowered 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  whenever the House and Senate
vote to cut a particular  program. The savings would be totaled by the Treasury
Department,  which then would reduce overall spending caps for both Congress and
 the executive branch. Even if fully implemented, however, this  plan, like the
line-item veto, is unlikely to produce major spending  cuts, though it would
discourage hypocrisy.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Truth in Budgeting.</B> The Contract With America contained a  provision
that required House committees to compare new  spending recommendations to how
much was spent on a program in the  previous year. Under the old system,
tax-and-spend liberals had  the upper hand because spending increases were
judged not  against actual spending for the previous year, but against 
projected<U> </U>spending for the next year. With these rules, even a spending 
increase could be called a cut, as happened frequently during the  Medicare
reform debate in 1995. The House rules change applies only  to House committee
reports, however, and not to all government  budget documents.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>1995 was the year Congress faced up to the task of making  tough decisions
on the budget, while the Administration chose instead  to avoid them  and even
maintained that no hard decisions  needed to be made. Conservative candidates
thus must explain to  Americans that Congress sought to institute needed
reforms, only to  be thwarted by the Clinton Administration. And with or 
without White House support, conservatives must commit themselves  to finishing
the job. If Congress and Clinton fail this year to agree  on a seven-year plan
to balance the budget with substantial tax  cuts for families and economic
growth, the first task in 1997 must be  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 61 -->  deliver a new plan to the
President as soon as possible.  Equally important, however, conservative
candidates must commit  themselves once more to overhauling and downsizing the
federal  government.

<P>The vision outlined in the Heritage plan is one of a  government focused
solely on functions that are national in scope. The  routine functions of
government, such as cutting checks at the Social  Security Administration, or
those departments concerned with  nar

operating National Parks, would be  reduced to sub-Cabinet level or independent
status. Activities  more appropriately delivered by the states would be

</P>
<P>

<P>In 1997, the conservative agenda for restructuring the federal  government
for the 21st century should be based on three sound  principles:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Federalism:</B> Transferring non-federal functions to state and 
local governments;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Privatization:</B> Transferring non-governmental functions to  the

<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Termination:</B> Eliminating programs which have become  outmoded,
obsolete, inefficient, or broken beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Principle #1: Federalism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1997, Congress should enact a budget that makes it clear  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 66 -->  the first responsibility of the
federal government is an  adequate national defense. Congress then should
examine every other  program to determine whether it is truly national in scope
and can  be carried out on a national scale only by the federal  government.
Funding for all agencies and programs that fail to meet this  test, such as many
education, welfare, health, transportation, and  other programs, should be
transferred to the states or returned to  the people as federal tax reductions.
</P> 
<P>

actions, among others:

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Principle #2: Privatization </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1997, conservatives should articulate clearly the distinction  between
those activities that are the exclusive responsibility of  the public, or
government, sector and those that should be the  responsibility of the private
sector. In addition, they should describe  areas in which, while there is a
public purpose, the activity still  should be carried out by private
institutions, either directly or under  contract to government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress should commit to an intensive privatization,  or
denationalization, effort to reassign essentially private functions  to the
private sector. Such an initiative is long overdue in this  coun
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 68 -->  try. Governments throughout the
world, from Russia to  Mexico and from Japan to Great Britain, have been
redefining the role  of government in a private economy. These governments are 
denationalizing state-owned enterprises, cutting subsidies to  inefficient
industries, removing barriers to private investment, and  restoring property
rights. Yet the U.S. government continues to control  hundreds of private
activities and functions such as public utility  management, railroad services,
small business loans, printing and  publishing, agriculture subsidization, and
oil extraction and storage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In some cases, privatization provides the only hope for many  inefficient
and unreformed programs starved for capital due to  federal budget constraints.
In the private sector, investment flows to  enterprises that can produce
valuable goods and services. Other  countries have used private capital to
finance major  infrastructure projects with a public purpose. The $9 billion
tunnel between  England and France, for instance, was financed almost entirely 
with private capital. By contrast, infrastructure financed and  maintained with
public money tends to be chronically undercapitalized,  as budget pressures
cause public investment to be deferred in favor  of current public consumption.
Privatizing commercial functions  can yield considerable short-term revenues
while greatly  improving the efficiency of services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the private sector, selling unproductive or underperforming  enterprises
is a common practice. Scott Paper CEO Al Dunlap,  who orchestrated the largest
corporate restructuring in history, says  that &quot;Inside every corporation is
the biggest bank one is ever going  to find  its own assets. Before you go

<P><B>Measures to Fix the Budget Process
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 73 --> 
</B>
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The 105th Congress should move quickly to overhaul the  budget process
before the process itself stymies the major  restructuring the government needs
to move into the next century.  Conservatives should focus on restoring the
balance of spending power  between Congress and the President by passing such
measures as  the Balanced Budget Amendment and the line-item veto.  Congress
also needs to clean its own house. Conservatives should  centralize spending
authority within a few accountable committees and  enact other rule changes to
safeguard taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Specifically, the 105th Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Send a balanced budget/tax limitation amendment to the 
states.</B> Congress should promptly consider a constitutional  amendment that
provides for a balanced budget by the year 2002 with a  requirement for a
supermajority (three-fifths) vote to raise  taxes. Unless these requirements are
specified in the Constitution,  the nation is doomed to an endless string of
broken promises and  accounting gimmicks that permit politicians to say &quot;just
wait  five more years&quot;  over and over again.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pass a Balanced Budget Enforcement Act. </B>Congress should  enact and
the President should approve a new budget process  designed to implement the
requirement for a balanced federal budget.  The package under discussion by the
House's Cox-Largent task force  is an excellent starting point. Among the
important features of  that proposal is a budget resolution, signed by the
President, that  sets out overall spending, revenue, and deficit figures for the
year.  This resolution would have to be adopted before any other spending  or
budget legislation.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 74 --> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Other essential features of budget process reform include  elimination of
the current services baseline, an annual review of  entitlements, a mechanism to
review regulatory costs, and a sequester  or other device to ensure that
spending and deficits stay within  established limits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each of the following reforms could be adopted either as part  of such a
reform package or separately.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Abolish the appropriations committees.</B> The 105th 
Congress should find the political courage to reorganize the  committee
structure to rationalize spending powers and build in  accountability. The
current three-layered congressional budgeting system  is both complex and
diffuse. Many committees of Congress have  the authority to spend tax dollars,
but no one is accountable if  such spending results in higher deficits. Studies
show that when  spending authority is limited to a few committees, Members are 
more accountable for their decisions, which result in minimal  deficit spending
and occasional budget surpluses. For example,  the Hoover Institution's John
Cogan found that congressional  spending decreased sharply in the 1920s after
spending power was  centralized.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#34">34</A></B></TT>  Combining authorizing
and appropriations  functions would eliminate one of the three layers in the
budget process  and strengthen the Budget Committee's ability to limit spending 
by permitting it, rather than the spending-oriented  appropriations committees,
to guide budget decisions.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Uniting policymaking and spending decisions in the same  committees would
eliminate a severe bias in the appropriations  process. The fact that the House
and Senate Appropriations  Committees exist solely to spend tax dollars provides
a perverse  disincentive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 75 -->  against cutting spending. Every
dollar cut from the budget  represents a corresponding cut in the power of the
appropriators,  particularly the so-called Cardinals (subcommittee chairmen).
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Establish a lock box.</B> The 105th Congress should adopt
rules  to ensure that when Members vote for spending cuts, the savings  are not
secretly recycled into new spending. This reform would  make it much more
difficult for appropriations committees to  insert pork-barrel or controversial
spending in conference reports.  In addition, the direct tie to deficit
reduction might encourage  members to offer and support more amendments for
specific  spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Revise the Byrd Rule.</B> The Byrd rule should be modified to  permit
reasonable spending policy decisions to be included in the  reconciliation bill.
While the limited debate time in the Senate for  consideration of reconciliation
bills does help prevent legislation  from becoming a Christmas tree bearing all
sorts of extraneous  provisions, the current structure of the rule prevents
Congress and  the President from adopting important reforms that directly affect
 how the taxpayers' money is spent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Introduce truth in budgeting. </B>The practice of baseline  budgeting
should be eliminated, and all government budget  documents should indicate the
change in actual spending from one fiscal  year to the next. As discussed in the
chapter on government reform,  the House and Senate also should adopt rules
requiring witnesses  to disclose any federal funding they receive.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Conduct an entitlement review. </B>Congress and the President  should be
required to reexamine entitlement spending at the same  time 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 76 -->  they consider the appropriations
bills. It is fiscally irresponsible  to spend months feuding over one-third of
the federal budget  while scarcely noticing the major drain on federal
resources:  entitlement programs that consume most of the annual budget. The 
regular review should include a careful study by the appropriate  committees of
the programs within their jurisdiction and should result  in roll-call votes in
the House and Senate that, at the very least,  force Congress and the President
to acknowledge the current and  future levels of these programs. Annual budget
resolutions should  establish spending ceilings for all mandatory spending
programs,  except for interest on the national debt, as is now done for 
discretionary (appropriated) spending. Committees with responsibility for 
mandatory programs would be required to revise these programs  to limit spending
accordingly. The nation no longer can afford  to confer benefits on classes of
people with no regard for the cost  to the American taxpayers.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Introduce biennial budgeting.</B> If the congressional budget  process
were expanded from an annual to a biennial process, much  time would be freed to
permit a more careful analysis of policy  revisions. A two-year budget would
permit Congress and the  President to spend much more time debating the
fundamental role of  government and how to revise and improve existing federal 
programs. While biennial budgeting may be a useful reform, however, it  must not
be adopted without the other urgent reforms noted in this  section. Two-year
budgeting on its own would merely create a  higher-stakes &quot;train wreck&quot;
and cause more harm than good. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why not balance the budget in nine or ten years rather  than 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 77 -->  seven?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There are two main reasons why balancing the budget  sooner
rather than later is necessary. First, taking nine or ten years to  balance the
budget would mean larger deficits in each year. The  cumulative effect of these
larger annual deficits is a larger  national debt and larger annual interest
payments on the national debt.  For example, a ten-year &quot;glidepath&quot;
balanced budget would add  $467 billion more to the national debt than the
congressional  Balanced Budget Act of 1995 over the next ten years, resulting in
 additional annual interest payments of $19 billion in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, increasing the time frame for balancing the budget  increases the
likelihood that future Congresses will not  follow through on the necessary
spending reductions and program  reforms. Five Congresses and at least two
Administrations would  be responsible for fulfilling a ten-year balanced budget
plan. It is  impractical to assume that these future lawmakers will restrict 
themselves to decisions made ten years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why cut taxes at a time when we're trying to balance the  budget?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Tax cuts are essential in any balanced budget for two  reasons.
First, tax cuts should be thought of as the ultimate form of  devolution.
Reducing the spending patterns of the federal government  is not enough. We need
to return power to the most basic levels,  the primary one being the individual
household. Parents who are  able to keep more of the money they earn will make
better choices  for their children's education than the federal government.
Senior  citizens who are able to realize more of their retirement savings  will

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 78 -->  be better able to choose a health
plan for themselves than  Uncle Sam. All of these choices are possible only if
people can  keep more of their hard earned money.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, tax cuts are needed in a balanced budget to ensure  a strong
economy. Initially, balancing the budget requires that  government reduce its
role in the economy. In the short term, this  can slow the economy, but
returning money to the private sector  by means of the $500-per-child tax credit
will help to offset  these negative effects. Also, tax cuts to spur investments 
(particularly cuts in the capital gains tax rate) will increase economic growth 
in the long run. This higher economic growth means more  jobs, higher incomes,
and lower prices.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why did Congress insist on giving a huge tax break to the rich?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Despite the liberal rhetoric, the tax cut package passed by 
Congress as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would have  benefited all
Americans, including the working poor and the  middle class. Sixty-five percent
of the entire package would flow to  families. The $500-per-child tax credit
would benefit 28 million  families raising 51 million children, 89 percent of
whom earn  below $75,000. Moreover, the congressional family tax cut  package
would have eliminated the entire income tax burden of 3.5  million families
raising 8.7 million children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even the capital gains tax cut would benefit all Americans.  Fifty-two
percent of the capital gains tax cut would go to  households with an annual
income of less than $100,000. The capital gains  tax cut also would spur the
economy and promote increased  economic 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 79 -->  efficiency, which leads to more
and better paying jobs  among other benefits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In light of these facts, it is also ironic that many Democrats,  including
members of the Clinton Administration, would cast  the congressional plan as a
tax break for the rich. It is even  more ironic since the President's original
tax reduction plan would  have denied tax relief to more than five million
families earning  less than $30,000 when compared to the Republican  plan.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#35">35</A>
</B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why is a spending increase labeled a spending cut?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Each year the Congressional Budget Office issues a  &quot;baseline&quot;
projection of federal government spending. This is an estimate  of the amount of
money that will be spent on each program funded  by the federal government, from
Medicare to AmeriCorps. Put  simply, baseline budgeting is a way to forecast
future levels of  spending, tax revenues, and deficits. Any proposed or enacted 
changes in federal spending and tax policies thus are measured  against these
projected benchmarks to produce estimated cuts or increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, last year the Congressional Budget Office  estimated that
between 1996 and 2002 the federal government would  have spent $12.8 trillion.
In contrast, the Balanced Budget Act  called for $11.8 trillion over the same
period. Even though spending  under the balanced budget plan would have
increased each and  every year, because it would have increased more slowly than
 projected, it is considered a cut.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What economic benefits can I expect to see from a  balanced budget
with tax cuts?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 80 --> 
</B></P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The immediate benefit for many Americans is tax  relief, whether
it is the $500-per-child tax credit or a lower capital  gains tax rate. In the
longer run, every aspect of economic activity  will benefit from a balanced
federal budget with tax cuts.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't blaming the process just a way of shirking real 
responsibility?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Members of Congress certainly must remain  responsible for
their votes and their legislative records, but the current  rules actually
conspire to raise spending and taxes. The roadblocks  to reducing government and
putting more money in the  taxpayers' pockets are immense. By reforming the
budget process, the  accountability of Congress and the President  will<U> </U>increase,
not decrease, because the hurdles to cutting taxes and spending will  have been
removed. The only factor will be the actions of Members,  not arcane rules
created by the defenders of big government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't the line-item veto give too much power to the President?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. A narrowly crafted line-item veto that permits the  President
to send individual spending items back to the Congress for  reconsideration
increases accountability and decreases the  likelihood that pork-barrel projects
will be squirreled away in the  appropriations bills. While this reform alone
will not reduce federal  spending levels significantly, it will provide a
beneficial check on  the current spending tendencies of congressional
appropriators.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Q. Why must a tax limitation provision be included in the  Balanced
Budget Amendment?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 81 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Without a requirement for a supermajority vote to  increase
taxes, the chances are good that Congress will resort to tax  increases
(probably disguised as something like &quot;revenue  enhancements&quot;) that
increase the financial burden on hard-working  Americans. The American people
will make sacrifices as the size of  government is reduced and should not be
insulted by being told  they must pay higher taxes because the politicians in 
Washington couldn't find the courage to make the tough decisions on  spending
cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can the American people be confident that Congress  and the
President won't resort to phony numbers and accounting  gimmicks to balance the
budget?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Balanced Budget Amendment would represent  significant
progress toward effectively reducing the size of government  and returning money
to the taxpayers' pockets. Anyone concerned  that politicians might try to
circumvent a constitutional balanced  budget requirement should be even more
concerned about what  Congress has done in the absence of a balanced budget
mandate.  Effective enforcement provisions and political vigilance by  votes
would be necessary. The 31 states which have balanced  budget requirements have
been able to meet them regularly, even  when difficult decisions were required.
Congress can, and should, do  the same.
